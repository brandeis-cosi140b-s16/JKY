Good food, excellent service and two-for-one margaritas and beer for happy hour. 

We were town for a conference and apparently there was a traffic jam in the Paradise/Flamingo area (where all the chain restaurants are), so our cab driver took us off the beaten path until we came to this place. After a great dinner, we tried to catch a cab and were told we'd have to wait an hour! So our server, Miguel, offered to drive us in his car. We were hesitant to trouble him, but after waiting for 20+ minutes and unsuccessfully trying to flag down 4 cabs that drove by, we finally took him up and he graciously returned us safely to our hotel.

Pretty rare to find service like that anymore... thanks, Miguel! We recommend Hacienda Del Rey if you're looking for Mexican food in Vegas!
