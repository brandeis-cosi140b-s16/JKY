When my friend drug me for "korean tacos" I was a little nervous. I couldn't really imagine a fusion of mexican and korean. When we arrived at the taco stand, I first of all was surprised at how clean everything was. On top of that the owner was extremely nice! and helpful. I had two tacos chicken and beef, they were about $2 each very reasonable for fresh food.  Yes it is a little hot outside but it is Vegas and summer... it is to be expected.  The owner even came to the car to make sure the food was good and offered us crazy dough .
What rocks is awesome food and awesome customer service... Will definitley be back and I live in Henderson!!!
