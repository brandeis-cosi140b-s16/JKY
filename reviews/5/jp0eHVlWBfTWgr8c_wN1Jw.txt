Two words- Pollo Magnifico.

I don't care what anyone says, I love you Julio G!  

The rice has carrots and peas in it!  I love that too.

This is Sonoran style and it's my favorite style.  

This is my go to place now that I moved back to Scottsdale.  My best friend and I have been meeting up a Julio G's for lunch since we learned how to drive.
