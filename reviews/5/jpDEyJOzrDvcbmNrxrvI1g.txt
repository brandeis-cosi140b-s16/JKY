Okay, this place is still awesome, so it holds the five star rating, but I have to agree that the old lady in sweat pants who I guess is the owner? is kind of a ball buster.  I'm not sure what her deal is, but just don't cross her no matter what!  She will ruin you!  Or she'll just be unbelievably rude and disgusted by your presence.  You're lucky you have an awesome chef and some kick ass service cranky lady.
