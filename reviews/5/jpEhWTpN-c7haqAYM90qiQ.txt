In case you have a hard time finding where this place is..it is literally right next to Sapphires.  With that being said, there are no strippers here but there is some delicioso food. The chef is friendly and welcoming, talked to us a bit and sat us down.  Street tacos are better than Tacos y Tacos and the chips are nom. Should give this place a try before their grand opening in August!
