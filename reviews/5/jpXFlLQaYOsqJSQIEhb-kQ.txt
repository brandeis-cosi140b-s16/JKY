In order this review to have some weight, let's say I eat Mexican food at Laredo, TX, Nogales AZ, Tucson, AZ, Brownsville, TX, etc.
The food is amazing.salsa is very good with flavor and fresh ingredients.the plate is actually a tray. 14"plate. Ladies, in case you were mislead on size, this is as big as pizza size.
The interior is big, decorated and very clean.service A+.portion size is generous and prices are in part par with other Mexican restaurants. Don't read negative reviews place is worth it.
Carne asada is fashizl!!
