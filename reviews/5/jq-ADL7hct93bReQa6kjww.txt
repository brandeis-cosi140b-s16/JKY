I could write a whole book about why this place is so amazing and 5 star worthy. The margaritas and tacos were delicious and full of flavor. The server next to us, his name was RJ or JR, was AMAZING. Our server was good but he helped the table next to us and he did great with the young kids at the table and super excited and really enjoyed his job, it seems! But Michael, the manager, is what won us over. I saw an OSU license plate hanging up (Ohio girl here) so I got super excited & he told us all about his football traditions every year and how he keeps the national champions up on the wall. Even though he's a Nebraska fan, he was great, friendly and an attentive manager. We will definitely be back for more margaritas and friendly ambience!
