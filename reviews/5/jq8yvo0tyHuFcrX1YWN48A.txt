My favorite Mexican food joint in town. Hands down. 

Customer Service is always excellent, but I like to sit down on the right side of the restaurant and get served by the pretty dressed up lady. Otherwise, service is usually pretty good overall. 

I would come back here whenever I come back in town. Its one of those must.
