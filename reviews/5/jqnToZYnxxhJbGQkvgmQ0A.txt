I absolutely love this place. The food is authentic, extremely fresh and homemade, including the salsas and pico de gallo. And it's relatively healthy--not greasy at all. Did I mention inexpensive? I paid $7.25 for a large shrimp fajita burrito. I'll be coming here on the regular! Really great service as well :)
