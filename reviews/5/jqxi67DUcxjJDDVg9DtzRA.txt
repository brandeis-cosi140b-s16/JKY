My opinion hasn't changed and I actually was breave enough to try the egg and tofu and steak . I actually liked the egg and tofu ... but I am still saying the STEAK is my fave. 
I am actually starting to have dreams about these tacos! 
maybe because I am not allowing myself to have sugars or carbs very often. 
I am making an exception only for these tacos... I actually tried the crazy dough today and it Rocked! 
So good.
I am considering adopting the owner just so that he feels obligated to give me free tacos... *kidding* 
I still don't think 4.38 for two tacos is extreme. So I don't mind ... paying... :)
It is like I said to someone else. I don't mind paying extra if the service is there. 
Honestly ... this has the whole enchilada .. I mean taco... great food great service. .. will soooo be back again.
