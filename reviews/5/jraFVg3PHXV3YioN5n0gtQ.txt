AMAZING TACOS. Has to be one of my favorite tacos ever. Freshly made torillas they cook right in front of you. The Carne Asada fries were soooo good. Ate there twice it was that good and satisfacting. Love that they are open late and there lines were a little confusing but the tacos made up for that!
