I really enjoyed the tacos de asada last time. Tonight I got Carne Asada fries! Yummy! The green salsa is really good.  The service is fast and friendly.  Toss a tip in the School fund jar.  The girl who took my order tonight  wants to be a lawyer so the jar is for her.   Don't forget it's cash only but worth having to hit the your banks ATM if you have to.
