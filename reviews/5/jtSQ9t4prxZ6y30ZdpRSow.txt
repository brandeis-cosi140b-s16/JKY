Just when I think that I've finally figured out where my favorite Taco Shop is, Taqueria Yaqui jumps in and has to throw all my game off.  

This place is AMAZING.  The meat is some of the best I've had, juicy and tender, fair prices, they take CREDIT, always fun to people watch, and to think that I found this place by accidentally taking the light rail one extra stop to 7th Ave and Camelback rather than Central.  

I will be getting my exercise thanks to this place, and the long drunken walks from Rosie's down the street.
