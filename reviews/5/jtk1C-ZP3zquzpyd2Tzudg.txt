Great place for Indie fish tacos and burritos. This joint has fantastic food and great service.  It is nice to support "non chain" restaurants making a go of it. We had the green chilie pork and the red chilie beef burritos. The chips are home made and the salsa superb. The service was outstanding. We were very happy and will return soon.
