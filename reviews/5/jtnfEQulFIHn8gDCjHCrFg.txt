This review is for their online ordering system,

I have ordered from them a couple times and every time my food has come out correctly and I've had a staff member call me to make sure everything was to my liking.  On this most recent visit I read an old email that said my food wasn't going to be ready for another hour. I called and the lady let me know that it was actually for an earlier time. I felt so bad! Like how impatient did I sound to call 15 minutes after I put in an order. So the wait time was actually only about 15-20 minutes when I thought it was going to be an hour.

When I went into the store she was so appreciative that I actually communicated with them and she was so helpful. 

When you order lunch for a big office or not this is the key when you have a short lunch break.  There are two other chipotles that are actually slightly closer yet I find myself ordering from this one more.

The main reason I'm even writing this review for Chipotle, which is a chain restaurant, is because I think that their staff is exceptional. 

The "she" I've been referring to is a young bubbly employee named Grinesha who has helped me twice. And those times were only very brief. I just think that she has a wonderful work ethic and great attitude.
