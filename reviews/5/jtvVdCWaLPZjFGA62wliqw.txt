Had a coupon for this out of the way restaurant and were so glad we went.
Happy Hour prices were low which added to the experience.
We had the Fried Shrimp appetizer and it was so good that I had to stop my husband from ordering another. It's presentation was amazing and the butterflyed shrimp were exquisite.
I had enchiladas which were home made and my husband had the Pollo Asada. Both were wonderful.
If anyone is looking for a newer, excellent Mexican restaurant, try this! You won't be disappointed.
