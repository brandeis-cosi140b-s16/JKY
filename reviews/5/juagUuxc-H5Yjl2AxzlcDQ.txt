Stopped by to grab a quick post work drink and hopefully coming across some gluten free food.  

Come to find out, the bartender makes her own tasty margarita mix and the chef knows what it's like to live with someone with Celiac Disease.  He prepped the grill and steered me away from anything that's so much as seasoned with gluten, even double checked seasoning ingredients!!!   Boom!!!!

This place is a Celiac's gift!!!   Great for non-Celiac's, too!!
