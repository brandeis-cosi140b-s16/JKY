This super-clean little gem off  95 & Ann Rd. has delicious food prepared fresh to order. Inside is a typical-looking taco shop, but don't be fooled by the simple trappings. The carne asada tacos are amazing, and they'll even make ground beef tacos or burritos for the gringos. They have a fresh salsa bar that includes carrots and chiles. They serve breakfast, lunch and dinner. We've gotten takeout a couple of times now and it's our new fave for a quick meal. Only drawback is they're closed on Sundays. The owner told me that's his day with his family so we can't complain too much.

Bottom line: if you want good food in a clean but simple setting, this is the place for you!
