This place is AWESOME.  Very Mexican... nice music mix of some classic Spanish mariachi and current top 40.

They greet you when you come in... bilingual. :)  Love it.  When my hubby spoke Spanish to them, they understood, so you know it's authentic. :)

I had the fish tacos. They were absolutely awesome.  Loaded with meat.  The beans and rice were great also.

Hubby had tacos al carbon and he loved them as well.  Hubby, as a full blood Mexican, said that everything had a good down home Mexican taste, not americanized at all.

Service was great, attentive.

They have strong margaritas... awesome. 

We will be going back. :)
