I had the carne asada fries and they were amazing!!! I asked for no pico de gallo or guac and they had no problem doing that.  I didnt know they added cilantro to top it off, and I am not a big fan of that, but it didnt matter, it was still great.  I definitely will go back for more fries. 

The guy taking our order was extremely funny as well.
