I am not ashamed to admit it, but I am a fan of Rubio's. I have been to several restaurants, but this was my first time at this location. It was a bit challenging to find, so be sure to look for the Party City store and look across from it.

One of the things I like about Rubio's is they have a lot of lighter and healthier options.

Don't forget the Fish Tacos! The beer battered fish tacos are really popular.

I may eat mostly vegetarian, but eat fish once in a while. If you go there on Tuesdays, they run a special on fish tacos, and if you sign up for the Beach club you get coupons and a free taco.

Very good value.
