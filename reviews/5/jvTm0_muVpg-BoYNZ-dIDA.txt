I live right down the street from here. I have meaning to stop by and try this for some time now. Located in a strip mall I expected to find it to be like a fast food kind of restaurant . I sat down and a nice lady took our order and brought it to the table. Our food came to our table pretty fast. I ordered enchiladas and rice and it was all really good. I enjoyed my lunch very much and will return.
