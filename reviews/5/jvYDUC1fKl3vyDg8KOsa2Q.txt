Need to review this joint on the real. This spot is legit. I haven't found a taco shop like they have them in Cali. Roberto's can eat me and Don Tor can go take a hike too.

When a co-workers son recommended it, I jumped at the opportunity to try a new spot. I always go in with high hopes for the danky-dank-dank.

Las Deliciousas isn't the prettiest. Inside she has surprisingly ample seating, the temperature was borderline oppressive, and the humans behind the counter were making everything from scratch and made to order. The aromas were intoxicating. 

I ordered two gorditas and their aqua fresca of the day (which was cantaloupe).  The wait took awhile as all items were made from scratch.

Worth the wait. I was met with those delicious Cali vibes and taste sensations. It's a little out of the way, but not bad and a great spot to hit up before a night out on the strip.
