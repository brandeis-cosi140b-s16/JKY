If I had to choose between all Mexican Restaurants, I would choose this place.  It is, to me, the most authentic.  The staples are great: fried beef/chicken tacos; red enchiladas; rolled tacos; steak/chicken burros. The rice/beans at this place are the all time best.  For my taste, the salsas are just OK. I wish the food was more spicy. But this is a general problem north of the boarder. 

Try it. Love it. 

Note: I have only been posting about places I really like.  No sense wasting time on places I don't like.
