Great food, friendly staff, and a clean environment. We stopped by for Sunday brunch after New Mexico Grill started closing on Sundays. Now Tacos n More is our go-to Sunday morning restaurant. They serve free chips and salsa while you wait for your food and I love the mild salsa which has a hint of sweetness. If you are looking for a sit-down establishment with ambiance, you will not be satisfied. However, if you want fresh tasting, quick tacos or burritos, this is a great place. They also have a tiny margarita bar with what looks like margarita slushy machines. We have not tried the alcohol choices, but we will when we go for dinner.
