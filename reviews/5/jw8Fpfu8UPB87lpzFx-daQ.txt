El Nopal

The first time we visited this Mexican eatery, we were under the influence of Jose Cuervo while visiting the observation deck at the Stratosphere hotel and casino. Often when you are under the influence, everything, and almost anything tastes delicious. 

This time around, the Mrs. copied me
and had chicken enchiladas and she remarked that they were very good. The steak quesadillas are very good and I gobbled them right up. They are so cheesy and the steak is chopped very small which helps it go down easy. 

You can eat as this place on a budget. Everything is priced at $8.99 or less, so you're not going to break the bank to have an enjoyable meal. They have a wide variety of salsa and dipping sauces to satisfy any pallet. 

The next time I have a trip to Vegas, I am going to sample this place again. The layout is nice and the tables are a good size that helps with elbow room.
