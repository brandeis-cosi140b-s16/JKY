As usual we stopped by a few days ago and had another fantastic experience at the s s location,met Ryan the g.m awesome person and had our own personal waiter josh again,love talking with these folks,pretty soon,they will have our order ready when we walk in the door, of at least unsweet tea and chips and white cheese dip,lol! Keep up the great job,they must be getting noticed,its busy now more than before when we stop by,cannot wait for warmer weather to sit outdoors while there! Phyllis and mark
