I remember La Paz being located off of South Blvd for years and we would go there all the time. Now they have relocated towards uptown in the Metropolitan area. What can I say, absolutely  love it!! Amazing food, atmosphere, and MARGARITAS are the best in Charlotte. Hands down La Paz makes the best margarita to man. I have tried the pomegranate. skinny, the original, and the original with mango. The pomegranate is my favorite, but it is a bit pricey for a drink. If your looking for a margarita that goes down light and taste yummy, I recommend the skinny margarita. It's affordable and fantasticly made. The bartenders are on point with their drinks.
I have eaten almost everything on the menu and the food is all Amazing. I have never had a bad experience at La Paz. The staff is friendly, the atmosphere is inviting, and the food is awesome. Right when you sit down they bring you chips, and 2 different kinds of salsa (red and green base). We always order the queso. It's a bit spicy, but it melts in your mouth the bomb. The decor is brightly lit and they have a patio which is nice to sit at. Sometimes a band is playing outside as well. My boyfriend and I are huge cantina eaters and we go to La Paz on a regular basis.
