This is a great casual place to eat lunch with family and friends. Small and cozy and the owners and employees are always friendly! 
I love the food and it's always fresh & hot! 
Lunch time is always busy and you might have to wait a few minutes, but worth the wait. 
For winter months, you could enjoy the outdoor tables which allows more space for other patrons. 
If I am thinking casual, great food and wonderful service, Geeko Grill is my choice of restaurants anyday!
