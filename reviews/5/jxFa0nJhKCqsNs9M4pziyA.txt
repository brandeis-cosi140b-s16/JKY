This is as close to real mexican food as ive ever had and its awesome. Got to be good with a line out the door even at 2am.  I take everyone that comes to visit.

Take someone that speaks spanish with you the first time,  no one working the line understands english so youll need help or feel dumb.   

Ive only had one bad experience there,  the AC broke and they closed down early so I had to drive over to the one on Charleston,  was worth it.
