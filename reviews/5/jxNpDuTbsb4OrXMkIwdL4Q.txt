I don't understand why so many people are writing such bad reviews about this place. I have been coming here since 09', every time that Iv'e been here I have loved it! 

Great food, great happy hour & a family friendly atmosphere during the day into the evening.

There is a vast mixture of people which is cool. Ya you get some cougars but it's boarder line Scottsdale people what do you expect? FYI  "cougar" is a compliment, better than a bunch of fat old ladies right?

I honestly really like this place, I have not been approached by the so called "swinger couples" that everyone else is talking about lol.

The staff is really laid back, yet attentive. Saturday nights are a little over bearing for my taste,"most of the time" very busy, dancing & a lot of gawking men, yet this has nothing to do with the place itself.

Sunday nights are laid back, they have karaoke @ 9. I love it here on Sunday nights, not so crowded and usually a younger crowd.

So overall this place has everything that a great bar should have, so I give it 2 thumbs up! ; )
