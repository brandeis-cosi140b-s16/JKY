My favorite traditional Mexican restaurant. Literally their recipes taste just like grandmas used to. My family and I have been coming here since I was a preteen, now I have a preteen and am still taking my family here. The staff is great, it's a Cheers feel where everyone knows your name and order. The food is always fresh and exactly what you are craving. The Botanitas appetizer is enough to fill you but a great variety, love their tamales, carnitas and sopapillas!
