I love the fish tacos here. I have had the grilled and the crispy and both are amazing. I prefer the crispy, though, but I get both. 
The happy hour deals are good too and the patio is a nice place on a nice day.
The management is very friendly here, too (at least who I think was management) and made sure we were taken care of the whole time. 
They also (obviously) have a pretty extensive beer list, but their cocktails are pretty interesting and tasty, too. If I allowed myself tacos more often, I would be here at least once a week!
