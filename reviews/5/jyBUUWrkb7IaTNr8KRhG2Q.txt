Found this restaurant on yelp.  Based on reviews decided to give it a try. The service was excellent the food was of high quality. The presentation was nice the flavors were outstanding.

We enjoyed the smothered fries the flauta' and the crispy rice and then sampled the fried wontons. everything was done extremely well. Prices are very reasonable and I would highly recommend this restaurant. 

The food is prepared fresh everything was done to perfection. You may have to wait since the food is fresh and prepared when ordered. 

Customer service is excellent. Food presentation is very appealing. I could see this restaurant growing if it had a bigger floor plan.
