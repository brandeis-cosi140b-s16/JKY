Very fresh and tasty seafood and other mexican plates. On Thursday if you buy a dozen oysters you get another dozen for free! And the oysters are a dozen for $11.50 that is the cheapest price I have found in Arizona so far. It's a little ways away but well worth the drive. Ask about their daily specials.
