We planned a party here for my husband and good friend. The manager was friendly, professional, and helpful. The ambience was lovely. Our server kept up with our party of 14 drinks beautifully. The food was delicious. I would recommend a trip to this restaurant when you want a lovely night out for good food, good drinks and good company, because that's what you'll get here.
Thanks Christian for all you did to make our night memorable.
