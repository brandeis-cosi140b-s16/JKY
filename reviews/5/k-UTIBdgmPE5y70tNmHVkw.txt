We used the taco cart catering service for a birthday party and couldn't have been happier with the food. Our taco guy, Enrique(?) was also awesome, the tacos were a hit with our 50+ party guests (especially the carne asada). If you want to pay with credit card though make sure you make advance arrangements - I had to scramble to find a check to pay the balance at the end of the night. We would definitely use the taco catering again.
