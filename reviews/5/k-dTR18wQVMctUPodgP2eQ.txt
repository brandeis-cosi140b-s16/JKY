HOLY DELICIOUSNESS OF SOUTHWESTERN FOOD.

Barrio made my first meal in the Southwest memorably wonderful.  We were greeted by a 45-minuteish wait (it seems many restaurants in Phoenix don't take reservations for parties under six).  We were packed like sardines in the small waiting area, and there's not much around the area to kill time at.  After being seated, my friend and I shared the table-side guacamole (notable only due to the inclusion of pomegranate seeds!  delicious and unique) and posole (good and refreshing, but actually disappointingly bland).  The appetizers were somewhat expensive: 11$ for the guac, which only included one avocado, and 8$ for the soup.

I fell in love with my seafood enchilada: cheesy lump crab meat wrapped in a warm blue corn tortilla, over which chunks of scallops and shrimp are generously scattered.  The whole thing is finished off with a rich, creamy sauce bursting with flavor.  I polished off the whole thing.  The entree ran me 23$.  And yes, it made it to my List (the OMGWTFBBQ List).

Unfortunately, we were too full to try dessert.

Service was solid, and the place emptied out after we were seated around 8:45PM.
