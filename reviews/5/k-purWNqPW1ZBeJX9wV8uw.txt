When my grandma came to visit in April she wanted tamales and I was wondering where I was going to get that during the non tamale season and after a quick search I found this place. The tamales were so good and everyone in my family where raving about it. I have no idea how I forgot about this place because I started craving tamales and my husband reminded me that The Tamale Store was nearby and he got me the chicken and green chile and the beef ones and they are as good as they get. If you want good tamales go here, yes they are pricier than other places but they're big and satisfying. You won't find tamales like this at other stores.
