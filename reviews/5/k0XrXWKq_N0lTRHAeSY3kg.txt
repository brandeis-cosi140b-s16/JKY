First time here, our waitress Rita, was very knowledgeable with menu and helped us with our order. Had the chicken polo and burrito. We had 5 people at our table and they remembered what we ordered, kept our glasses full and checked back on us. For sure if you like Mexican then here is the place to go. Very reasonable prices
