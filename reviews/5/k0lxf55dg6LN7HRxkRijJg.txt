got a carne asada burrito and carnitas taco.  both came with guacamole & pico de gallo, and both were excellent.  the meat is tasty, the guacamole is nice & chunky, and the pico de gallo is fresh.  the salsa bar is awesome.  i tried the fiery red hot salsa and avocado salsa, which were both great.  they also have tomatillo salsa, red salsa, spicy carrots/jalapenos, and limes at the salsa bar.  don't listen to amy.  rice does not belong in a burrito.  beans, yes.  but if you want rice in your burrito, go to chipotle.  carne asada burritos in southern california & arizona come with guac and pico.  that is the style, and it is done well here.
