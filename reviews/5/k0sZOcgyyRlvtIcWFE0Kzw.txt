I am always craving Mexican food. My boyfriend and I were staying at the Boulder Station hotel and casino for a car show and didn't want to spend a fortune on food for the weekend. We stopped by this place for dinner real quick and it was so good! I got the taco plate with the rice and beans. All of it was delicious and super cheap! We ended up eating there again for lunch the next day right before we left Vegas. I would definitely recommend this place! Can't wait to get it again sometime.
