We have eaten here a number of times and are happy every time! Favorite dish is the baked potato with steak. So delish! We planned a large group dinner of 30 people for our birthday and were pleased at the ease of it. They are able to accommodate large groups with no hassle. Portions are large and prices are fair. Only disappointment ever was in the deserts. Not worth it to even try.
