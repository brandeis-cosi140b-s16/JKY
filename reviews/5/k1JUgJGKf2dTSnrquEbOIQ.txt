Just tried this place for the first time and love it! The enchiladas that came in a skillet were amazing.  My husband had the carne asada burrito which was really good as well.   No gristle like some places have.   We really enjoyed the music too.   Great food and atmosphere.  We'll definitely be back.   P.S. And a quick shout out for the chips and salsa ;-)
