Had lunch on 2/17/12. Was one of the best experiences in a while. The new location is very nice, plenty of seating. Service was quick and very good. We ordered a veggie taco, nachos, and a beef enchilada. Good portions, well made, and hot. The ingredients was fresh not from a bag. The black beans were cooked and not spooned out of a can, like so many restaurants. All three choices were well done. We will be back again soon!
