The best Mexican place I've ever had, surprisingly, is in Kentucky.  This place is a very, very close second.

I've only ever had to wait for a table one time.  The salsa is amazing, and they actually have two salsas.  If you want something a little hotter, ask for the spicy salsa.  

Every dish I've ever gotten here is delicious.  The food always arrives hot and exactly as ordered.  And the food comes out very quickly.  The assistant store manager, I can't remember his name, is there almost every day.  He's a tall blonde guy.  He's wonderful.  Sometimes we won't go for a month, and he still remembers my exact order!  

This place is a little bit on the pricey side, but you get massive portions of everything.  I can almost never finish my whole meal it's so much food.

The only complaint I have about this place is the new mariachi band.  I just think it's too loud for my particular preferences.  If you want good, authentic Mexican food in west Phoenix with good prices, and excellent service, look no further.
