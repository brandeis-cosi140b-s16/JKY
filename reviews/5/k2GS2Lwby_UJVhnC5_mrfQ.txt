Honestly one of the best quick meals that I really enjoy. I go there a lot. The same few guys are usually working and whip the food up quick. They have a $4.99 daily deal that always hits the spot and their honey grilled chicken oh honey don't get me started That and their steak quesadillas are my regular. Chips and guac is a must you get a monster guac thing so you don't run out I hate when I run out of guac. There fish burrito is good too load up on the special fishy sauce I like it. The tacos are good too. Man everything is good and you should just check this spot out. I don't really mess with the delivery cause it takes like 30 minutes and you can be in and out in 5. You can win a free burrito at the gumball machine but I'm currently 0 for like 100 so not likely. But yeah this place is better then waiting in that chipotle line plus I just like it more better bang for your buck!
