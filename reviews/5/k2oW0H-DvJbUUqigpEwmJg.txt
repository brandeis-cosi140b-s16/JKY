I was recommended by a friend when I walked in I was greeted by the whole staff felt like I knew each and every one of them I felt welcome and right at home then I was looking at the menu noticed they smoke and grill their items that is unique flavor of the smoke was incredible the meal I would pay twice for it when the chef / butcher came out to greet me making sure I was find with the meal and service was very cool I would recommend this place but  you need to try for yourself.
