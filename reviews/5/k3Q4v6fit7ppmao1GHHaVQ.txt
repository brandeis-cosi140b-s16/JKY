Amazing food! Great speedy service! Always had drink refilled. EVEN REFILLED BEAN DIP! Chips were crispy and warm. Soup had too many veggies , could use some more noodles . Great atmosphere: was greeted and waited upon as soon as I got out of car. Horchata could use more sweetness, but still good. Chips came with free fajitas! Owner greeted us as well! My girlfriend like their salsa. HAd a burrito with green sauce ! OMG too good!


My girl had a mojo de ajo which was even better ! Fresh guacamole , delicious fried ice cream with plenty of whipped cream ! Even the rice and beans were delicious! Everything was hot and fresh. People were nice , staff was even nicer. Got attended by Arturo. Ask for him! He is a great server. Calm and well mannered , and always brings you refills. Never leaves you dry , which is my favorite part about him. Love this place , love the food. Taste authentic , and that's what I was looking for. 


Will definitely be back !
