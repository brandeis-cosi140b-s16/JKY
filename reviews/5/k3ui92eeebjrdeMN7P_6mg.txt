yo, now this is whuts up!!!

i spent the last 10 years in nyc, living in queens where taco trucks were a plenty and a favorite late night post bar 4am put on harold and kumar and toke a lil' sumpin' sumpin' snack was chorizo, bistek, or carnitas tacos and a manzana soda!!!

i'm fond of all the different foods in madtown
but i missed my taco truck
then i found this place!!!

yo, the tastes are delicious
the meat portions sizes are HUMUNGOUS!!!
this is it for my east side taco joint

they pack each taco with so much meat, your head will explode in pleasure!
each taco with set you back about $2.50
but for the portions, it's really like 2 tacos!!!

super nice people
quick service
very clean

highly recommended!

ps i stopped in for lunch today
saw some dudes putting away a huge slab of meat and soup and tortillas
that's my next meal!!!
