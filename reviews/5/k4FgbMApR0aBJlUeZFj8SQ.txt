This is a small place that specializes in authentic Mexican seafood dishes.  The draft beer Negra Modella can be had in a full pint (now that's a heavy mug!),  The chips and salsa are top notch.  The staff is friendly and does not look at you funny for being gringo.  The decor is over the top mexican loud colors down to the painted wooden chairs.  Not too loud inside, can have a conversation without raising ones voice.  You might need a reservation on the weekend but I have never had a problem at lunch after 1pm.
