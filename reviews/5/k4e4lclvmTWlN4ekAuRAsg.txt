This is my favorite breakfast place in town. Fresh OJ, all local ingredients, except for the fish which is flown in daily from CA, on ice. The Huevos Rancheros is premiere. Ask for salsa and they have 2 very good ones. It's located in the bottom of the Clarendon, which is an Art Hotel, with great local art that seems to be rotated monthly. I would actually give them 4.5 stars, I have to take a 1/2 point off for under cooking their eggs. If you don't want them runny ask for over hard or fully cooked, over medium was runny. Great little patio and an awesome environment all around.
