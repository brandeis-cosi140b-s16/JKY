OH MY GOD. I love love LOVED this place. I had the Mahi Mahi tacos and they were soooo delicious. The boyfriend had some sort braised pork tacos and practically liked his plate. Also, we didn't have the guacamole but I passed it and it looked ahhhhhmazing.

Now, not only was their food incredible, but their drinks were too!!! I am not a margarita fan. At. All. They're way too syrupy sweet for me but their Cucumber Mint Margarita was to die for. 

I HIGHLY recommend this place. Definitely as good as it gets:)
