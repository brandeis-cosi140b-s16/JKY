Searching for food near Carolina's which was closed. Saw a line and a group of people eating and thought that must be a good sign. IT WAS GREAT! Had carnitas tacos that are amazingly delicious, chili verde burrito with papas is carnitas with green chilis-yum, the the chorizo torta with fresh avocado and grilled jalape√±os - awesome. Very impressed. Great tortillas too.
