The best salsa you can get! Authentic as you can get! This place gets busy at lunch time so expect to wait if you don't call your food in ahead of time. Their homemade tortillas are the best in town. Parking is a negative during their busy hours (lunch especially)... I recommend their Machaca Burrito Enchilada Style with Green Sauce. Although I haven't experienced anything bad on their menu yet. I eat there 1-2 times a week.
