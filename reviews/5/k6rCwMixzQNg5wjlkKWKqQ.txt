My brother took me here when I was out visiting. He really liked this place so we went here. I ordered the green chili and corn tamales and loved them! They had a kind of sweet and spicy taste to them. They were soft and delicious! This place is a little pricey, but very tasty and awesome service! We sat outside and there is a really nice waiter out there but I cannot remember her name. I would love to go here again the next time I visit AZ. 
P.S.... my brother is a crazy white boy.
