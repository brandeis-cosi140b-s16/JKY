I've been driving by these orange groves several times a week since the 202 opened to Val Vista, but only recently tried Jalapeno Bucks.  I have tried both the green chili beef burro and the red chili pork burro.  They are both great finds for those of us who believe that chilis of all colors are definitely a food group.  The only thing my husband wants when we go, is the green chili ground pork burro.  I haven't tried it yet, but everyone in our family who has, raved about it.  Our family is five-generation Arizona residents (4 in Mesa) and we are picky about our Mexican food - we appreciate home-style burros and don't eat at places that have trendy ingredients (the worst is pineapple salsa!).  We patronize local establishments that have good food and staff that are focused on the customer.  Jalapeno Buck's is definitely that type of restaurant.

We haven't tried the BBQ at Buck's, but who wants BBQ when there is great Mexican food on the menu?
