I have been eating at Dons since it opened in the 60's, so maybe I'm not the best to write a review or maybe I am?  Its the kind of place with a special taste that cannot be gotten anywhere else.  Its easy to slam the place if you think your an expert cause you been here since 87.  Well I have been her since 53 so I have a lot more history eating my favorite food.  I call Dons " classic valley of the sun sonoran style mexican food! " When I see the word AUTHENTIC, I want to run.  Have you ever eaten in Nogales, Mex.  Thats authentic and you can have it.  They only thing I'm not crazy about is their red or green chili burritos, not bad just not the best.  Their fries used to be the best I ever had, don't known since they reopened if they are the same.  I'm glad they reopened with new people, the prior owners had the personality of a fence post.  They used to nickle and dime you;  extra chips you paid for, ice tea refills cost; common this is Arizona.  I think they don't do this anymore.  Now if they would add chicken to the menu and how about a decent beer like Bohemia!  So I just have to say if you don't like the food you were weaned on the wrong style to start with.  Last thought, no indigestion.
