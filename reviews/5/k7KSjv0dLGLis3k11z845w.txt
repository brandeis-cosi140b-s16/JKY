This place is amazing. I live in Dallas so anytime I come in, this is where I head. Price is a little higher than the surrounding joints, but the food is better. Also, they are larger portions than the rest. If your looking for cheap food in price and quality, this place isnt for you. 

 Try the shrimp cotail and the steak tacos.
