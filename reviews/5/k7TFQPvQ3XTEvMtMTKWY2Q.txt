Americas Taco Shop in general is where I go when I've got a craving for a good bean and
cheese burrito. I don't even really care for refried beans (and these are without lard,yay!) But man, these are so amazing. The hot salsa is great and a cochata to wash it down is amazing! I'm not even a big fan of horchata but mix it with iced coffee and I'm sold. I was actually addicted to it for a few months a couple years ago! This location isn't quite as nice as the one on Camelback but who cares, it's a quick taco shop!
