I''ve long been a fan of Qdoba, and never really gave Chipotle a second look. But once I finally tried them, I was hooked. Their burritos are both more flavorful AND more affordable, plus they use meat from organically raised animals. Their selection is a little more basic and they close at 11, so every once in awhile I still hit Qdoba if I'm in the mood for a "signature" burrito or if I'm out late, but if you just want a good burrito at a good price, Chipotle is the place to go!
