5Star service. Our first time here and everything couldn't have been more perfect. From the looks of the giant video billboard outside advertising $5.99 lunch specials we expected average Mexican fare. We got much more.

Not only was the food excellent, the service was equal to the likes of The Pointe. 

The Food - Brunch served from 10:30-4:00
I got the South of the Border Ranch Style Eggs with pork chile verde, eggs basted. The taste of the pork was superb. You can tell everything is made fresh. The food didn't come out in 5 minutes either so it's apparent they take their time making everything to order.
She had the Breakfast Tostada substituting fajitas veggies for the meat, otherwise served with chorizo. Again, all the ingredients were fresh and tasty.

The Little Things
John, our waiter is low-key, extremely helpful and knowledgeable. He knows how to adapt many dishes for the vegetarian and gluten free eaters.
We never had to ask for a thing.  If we needed an extra napkin, it was on the table before we had to ask. Used creamer and sugar packets were immediately bussed. A new cup of coffee was on the table just as I was finishing my last sip.
The manager, Jason, made a nice appearance and welcomed us. 
After the meal, John spent a little extra time socializing but otherwise he was the invisible waiter who took care of all our needs.

We'll be back and next time we're bringing our son on Sundays for face painting and because kids eat free.  Thanks Arriba!
