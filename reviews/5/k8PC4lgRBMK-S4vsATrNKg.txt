Really delicious family spot with the best of Mexican and El Salvadorian food. The carne asada fries are always a hit, and who doesn't love a crunchy torta. Also getting to try a Mexican style and Salvadorian style tamale side by side is a treat.  

Closes early so don't wait until dinner time to think of it! Look for Stephanie at the counter she was very kind. Absolutely love supporting local family spots, and this is a gem. Will definitely be back!
