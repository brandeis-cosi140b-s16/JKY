Went to Cabo Wabo because we were in town for a bachelor party and one of the groomsmen was feeling a need for some mojitos. I was skeptical at first because I figured these guys focus their efforts hocking 3' tall slushy drinks on the miracle mile. I was wrong.
We sat at the bar and ordered a round of mojitos. Before I knew it we were 2 mojitos down and the bartenders started pouring shots of fireball on the house while grilling us on our favorite nfl teams. It was basically nfl trivia; get a question right, get a shot, get a question wrong, get shot with a water pistol (I got shot a lot). We laughed with these guys for a solid hour while drinking some of the best mojitos I've ever had and laughing about sports.
If you get the chance to sit down at Cabo Wabo I highly recommend sitting at the bar because these guys know how to have a good time.
