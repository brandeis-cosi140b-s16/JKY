look...1 tacos on Wednesday..what else?? but the shrimp burrito is delish.. I had the chili relando or however you spell that. it was ehh..but the chicken and steak tacos are !!!!!!good!!!!! the salsa bar is good but they never keep it full. it's in the hood but it's worth the time. the people that work here are THE BEST!!
