Hubby and I were in Phoenix scoping out places to live (currently in Chicago) and we tried Pepe's on a whim. Then we came back the next day...
Shredded beef tacos are delicious. I'm also a huge fan of their refried beans, especially on the tostada. Love this place. Guarantee we will be regulars once we move!
