Just moved to the area and was craving some Mexican food, so I decided to check this place out. I got the Shrimp Burrito and absolutely loved it! I was originally planning on just eating half and taking the other half home but before I knew it, I cleaned my plate. Ha. And my five year old ate her entire burrito with beans and rice. We will definitely be coming back in the near future.
