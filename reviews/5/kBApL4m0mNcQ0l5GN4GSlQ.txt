Best Mexican fast-food in the North Scottsdale area!  The prices are fair, but you get A LOT of food. We usually have some to take home every time, sometimes even half the meal. The value you get for what you pay cannot be beat. More importantly - the food is VERY yummy. The service is also good, the girls at the counter are always very friendly and accommodating. For quick Mexican food, this place cannot be beat by Filiberto's or Habanero's. Quite possibly the perfect fast-food Mexi place. I recommend the Grande breakfast burrito (possibly the best breakfast burro we have ever had), the California, the Surf 'N Turf (its a little messy though) burro, the hard tacos, the rolled tacos, the quesadillas. Also HIGHLY recommend the flautas - you basically get a decent sized chimi for $3. Its an awesome deal. Compare this place to Habanero's - which is overpriced, serves less on each plate, and tends to overcook their meats. No comparison. I'm pretty picky about Mexican food, because it is so easily either generic or overdone - but Senor Taco finds a perfect middle balance of simple Sonoran foods that are perfectly prepared and served. This is definitely our new go-to place when we need to fill up, be quick, and not spend a lot of $.
