I was doubtful on coming here. Korean and Mexican fusion just sounds... no. Don't judge a book by it's cover though, this has to be one of my top favorite family-owned businesses in Las Vegas! 

We came on a weekday night, an hour about closing. Apparently this night they were short staffed, and the place was busy, so service took longer than expected (but of course, was understood). I do not eat meat, but thank goodness they had vegetarian options on their menu. I had the fusion tacos sans the meat, but added kimchi. Even without the meat, the lettuce wrap tacos with kimchi were delicious!

My friends ordered the fusion tacos with beef and pork, and everyone at our table was highly please by the taste for such a cheap, cheap price (I believe it was $1.95 for the tacos, where can you get a better deal than that other than at a Taco Bell or Del Taco?!)

While the service was slammed that night, we were able to talk to one of the owners who, while very busy, still showed awesome service to us, even when we had many questions to ask amongst how busy it was. Very nice owner who is willing to explain everything down to the last ingredient. Will definitely return here again, this is my new favorite fusion restaurant! (That ISN'T fast-food!)
