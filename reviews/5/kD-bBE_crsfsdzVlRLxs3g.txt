I grew up in Phoenix and lived there for 20 years before moving to the Pacific Northwest. I miss real Mexican food as it really doesn't exist over here. I have come to realize how spoiled I was by living in Arizona where any given taco stand can serve Amazing food. With all of this said, my father introduced my wife and I recently to Pepe's! Without exaggeration, this place might serve some of the BEST Mexican food I have ever had! We of course ordered some delicious margaritas that got the party started and then I preceded to order the green sauce enchiladas with Pepe's own guacamole...a taste sensation in every bite. The staff was super friendly and the restaurant feels like what a great Mexican Arizona Restaurant should feel like. I cannot wait for a return visit!  Pepe's...you have my permission to drop the mic. That's how it's done son!
