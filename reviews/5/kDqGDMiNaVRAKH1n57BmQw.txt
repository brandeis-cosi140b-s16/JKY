Ive been eating Red Eagle Tortillas since before I could walk. I have tried many brands of tortillas and I still find myself wishing they were Red Eagle, especially when I lived out of state for a while. 

They use simple ingredients in their products so you have to eat them quick, because they don't last as long as other tortillas with preservatives. Their flower tortillas should be stored in a sealed large zip-lock bag, be sure to remove as much air to keep them fresh and soft. If they get exposed to the air they will harden, like most tortillas without anti-cracking agents. 

The corn tortillas can be stored in their original packing just making sure to try and remove some or all the air from the bag before sealing it up and storing it back. Most people do not read the heating instructions in the front of the bag. It states that the corn tortillas need to be wet when heated. I believe these make them softer and a little thicker just like homemade. I have tried heating it with and without being wet and it does make a difference. Though either way for they taste great to me. 

These are one of the last few manufactures of authentic tortillas in the city and I hope they stay in business for a long time.
