I frequently travel all the way from Gilbert just to eat here. 35 miles of driving which has always been well worth it. I've tried the one in Mesa but I don't find it to be as good as the original. They have amazing New Mexican style cuisine. I do love it spicy though, and they're the spiciest mexican food I've ever had. They do have a lot of non spicy stuff too. Out of town guests I've taken, who aren't into anything spicy, have found it to be very good. I think the milder part of the menu have been just as appetizing, sometimes moreso because you're not sweating bullets and downing 5 glasses of water just to make the burn go away. 

You can wait a long time for a table, so be prepared to wait, but if you go during off times, like after the lunch crowd or right before the dinner crowd you shouldn't have a wait. The margaritas will kick your ass too. Get a pitcher and make it a day drinking, hotter than hell Mexican extravaganza.
