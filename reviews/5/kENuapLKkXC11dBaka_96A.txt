My wife and I love this place! We try to eat out here at least once a month as our dining out budget allows. The service is solid, the food is Santa Fe style and excellent, and my wife especially loves the salsa and chips (although she tends to eat all of the blue corn chips before I can get them!!!). Prices are fair for dinner (except margaritas are a bit pricey), and the weekday specials are great. Had dinner there last night with some out of town friends. 6 adults, 4 of us had margaritas, tab was about $150 ($25/person). Most of us ordered from their "Blue Plate" menu, which tends to have their specialty items, and cost more per plate. You certainly can have a great dinner meal with drinks for between $15-$20.
