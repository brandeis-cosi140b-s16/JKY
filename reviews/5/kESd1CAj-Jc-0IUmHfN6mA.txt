Best Mexican food on the planet. Holy crap.

You may want to make a reservation. This restaurant is boomin! My fiance and I were lucky enough to get the last walk in seat they had. 

They offer free flan with your yelp check in, so you should go for that reason alone. The flan, along with many other menu items, is gluten free. 

The street tacos are the most reasonably priced entree on the menu and they are DELICIOUS. They come 3 to a platter and you can totally mix taco types, too. 

Friendly server. AMAZING food. Strip club next door. Free flan. What more could you want?! GO!
