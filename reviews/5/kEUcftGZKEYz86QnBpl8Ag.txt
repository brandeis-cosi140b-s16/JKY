What a great dinner! Just got back from Italy and couldn't believe that the mozzarella tomato dish here was even better!!! The Harissa creamed shrimp is a must! The salmon with plums was excellent as well as the short ribs!!! Thank you Chef Kelly for your  yummy twist in every dish.Thank you David for the professional service. Loved the beautiful presentation, the simplicity of the place, and the affordable prices. Chad Withycombe cooked something real good for us here...
