One wouldn't expect good Mexican-style seafood in the middle of Arizona, much less in the middle of a mostly abandoned strip mall in Guadalupe. But man, oh man. I've never had a bad meal here. The chips and salsa as delicious and the entrees are all so tasty. I have to admit that I usually get the Shrimp Al Ajillo (a chile/garlic sauce) which is just so flavorful. But I do encourage my boyfriend to get other things to try (i.e. for me to try!) and we have never been disappointed. Also, very reasonably priced!
