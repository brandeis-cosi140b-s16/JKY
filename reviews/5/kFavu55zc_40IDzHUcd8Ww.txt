Ordered dinner the other night because I was too lazy to cook. Ordered nachos no beans. When I got home I discovered it only had beans, being too lazy to go back I called. I figured they would replace the nachos the next time I was there. I spoke with Jody(manager) she was very pleasant. She said the next time I visited she would take care of it. I went back today and Jody went above & beyond to make sure I was taken care of. The team was also very sweet. Thank you Jody for making sure I was a satisfied customer .
