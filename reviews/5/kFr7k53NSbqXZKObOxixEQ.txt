The Naco Torta RULES!!!

I've been here just once and still don't dare to try the tacos (yes, perfection still stays in Mexico), but the torta and a bite of one of their hamburgers...was a good sample of the tasty food they have here. 

Place has a really cool decoration, that actually you want to check in one room and enjoy later the jacuzzi!
