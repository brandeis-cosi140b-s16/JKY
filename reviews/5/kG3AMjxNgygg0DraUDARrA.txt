The salsa is soooo addictive, I could (and practically do) eat it as a meal before my meal even arrives at the table! 
It isn't anything fancy, but this place will take care of any Mexican food craving you are having. 
Dog friendly patio, and great service. I have never had a meal at Ajo Al's that wasn't delicious!
