Tex mex has been a dining staple for my entire life. Javier's isn't tex mex but it's fantastic. The enchiladas with mole sauce were perfect. The seafood combo with lobster enchilada, shrimp taco, and shrimp and crab chile relleno was a real highlight. 

It's pricier than what I'm accustomed to for Mexican but the ambiance, the service, and the odd but tasty cucumber Rita made up for that. Oh and there's a sweet wall sculpture with skulls and death.
