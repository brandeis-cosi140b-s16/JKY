Absolutely wonderful environment and very friendly people!! Went when it was packed and waiters were running left and right, we got everything without delay and it was perfect. Highly recommend this place to anyone crazing some Tex-Mex food. Anyone saying otherwise either had a bad day or are just haters. Keep up the good work!
