I had a Chicken Taco Combo for 6.19 which included 2 Hard "Red Chicken" Tacos with Rice & Beans. I added a large homemade lemondae & apparently they charge a .50 fee for any card transaction so my final total was 9.44. It was well worth it. Tacos were seasoned well I felt were overstuffed in chicken but I pulled it out and munched later in the meal. The rice & beans were plentiful. I had no leftovers but I did not eat anymore for the rest of the day. Completely filling. My first experience was wonderful. No complaints!
