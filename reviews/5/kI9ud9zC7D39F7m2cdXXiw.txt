This place is amazing. I am very picky when it comes to my Mexican food and this is the best I have found in Charlotte. I have tried lots of places and I mean LOTS. The staff is extremely friendly and very helpful. There margaritas taste amazing and on Thursday they have $4.00 margaritas which is a steal. We always order the table side guacamole and it is delicious. I would recommend this place to everyone I know and I just brought my family here that was visiting from California and they loved it!!!! This is now my go to place for amazing Mexican food.
