Food was so damn good make you wanna slap your mama!! Lol
I got food for the family and the burgers are good my daughter loved her cheese fries and the hot dogs were amazing and the burrito was smaller than filibertos but so much more better as far as taste. My only complaint would be about the quesdilla they were small and definitely not worth the money buy overall a 5 and will be a repeat customer
