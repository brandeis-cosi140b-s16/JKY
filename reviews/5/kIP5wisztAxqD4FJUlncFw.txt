Finally! A place with *real* Mexican food! I had a trio of tacos (chorizo, al pastor, and steak) while my wife had a steak quesadilla and chicken tostada. The tacos were incredible and authentic with fantastic meats, but the star was the quesadilla. Fried, stuffed with queso blanco, and just delicious. At any price this stuff was great, but considering how inexpensive it was I don't know if I'll ever go to another Mexican joint in town.
