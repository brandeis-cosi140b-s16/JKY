Alright so after hearing so many good things about this place I checked it out! It was nice, really great actually, the customer service was amazing & every staff member we encountered was friendly & cheerful. Apart from their service, the food came by quicker than I imagined so that's a plus! I had the Sonoran dog and this thing was amazing, I usually have to order a second plate but this was well worth the money and it filled me up. I ordered Horchata and maybe I'm just being delicate but it did taste kind of weird, but nothing too bad I still drank it all. I plan to go back to try several other things in their menu! Overall I recommend this place, worth the bang for your buck, and the environment is overall just friendly & great.
