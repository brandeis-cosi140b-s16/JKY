Rosa's is awesome.  It flourishes despite its sketchy surroundings.  The location is downright scary from the outside - beaten-down old half-empty strip mall, with a clothing store next door that sells new clothing, but makes a typical thrift store look like Neiman-Marcus.  If you were just driving by, the odds you'd want to stop are near zero.  Don't be deterred!  Once inside, you'll be quite comfortable as the surroundings are nice and comfortable.

I've had several items here, but have settled lately into their fajitas.  I always order a chicken/beef combo, and I swear they simply double the portion of meat by giving full servings of each.  The beef is unusually good for fajita beef, very steak-like and tasty.  Zombie Girl generally goes for the shrimp tacos, which she loves.

Prices are reasonable, service is competent and friendly, and the value proposition is strong.  Rosa's earns a solid 4.5 stars on the patented, trademarked and copyrighted Brak-O-Meter, a half-star withheld for location.. but rounded up to 5 due to all the positives.  Visit Rosa's tonight, you won't be disappointed.  And you know you can always trust Brak!
