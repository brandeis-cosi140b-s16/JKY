I grew up in Silver City New Mexico and grew up with a certain kind of Mexican Food taste ... this place NAILS IT.  I love anything green chile on their menu.  The tacos and enchiladas (love the flavor of their red sauce) are amazing too, and more recently I had their red chile plate which because a favorite.  Anything and everything I have had here is amazing.  I love their beans and rice too ... Not much of a kids menu if your kids don't like Mexican food, but they do have cheese crisps for them (just no chicken nuggets or grilled cheese like some other Mexican kids menus do) 

Anyway - this place is in my top 2 of go to Mexican Food spots in the East Valley (QC, Gilbert, Mesa etc)  Do yourself a favor and EAT HERE - you will be sending me a compliment thanking me later.
