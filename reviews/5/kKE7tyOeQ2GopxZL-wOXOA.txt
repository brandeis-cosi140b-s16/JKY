I have always loved Chevy's, they have THE BEST fresh tortillas! I usually order the Chicken Fajitas and have never been disappointed. This location is no different. I sat in the bar today and had great service during a busy Saturday lunch. I live over in Summerlin so this isn't the most convenient location, but it's the only one in the valley and it's worth the trip.
