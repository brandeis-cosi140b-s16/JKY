I've been going to Pedro's for over 20 years. This place is outstanding. From the chips and salsa to the sopapillas you can't go wrong. I typically get the stuffed quesadilla, the best in the biz. However, everything is good. 

Also, ask for the pico de gallo to spice things up a little. They don't bring it to the table unless you ask for it but it is awesome. Great with chips or on your meal!! Enjoy!!
