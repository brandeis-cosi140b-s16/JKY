I usually don't like to review chain restaurants but I have loved El Pollo Loco since birth! I feel like this is a great alternative to eating fried chicken. I find myself able to eat a full meal with out the guilt that comes with eating McDonalds or Popeyes or any other fast food. If I'm in the mood for something super healthy, which I haven't been in a while lol, I'll go for their humongous chicken tostadas. The whole thing is delicious including the taco shell bowl that it comes in. Their chicken is just amazing. You can taste that it is freshly grilled after marinating forever. Even though it is fast food, it doesn't taste like it! On the more regular occasion we usually opt for the family meal that comes with 8 pieces of chicken, 2 large sides, a salad and dessert for about $20. Macaroni and cheese is my side of choice; super cheesy (probably not healthy). We get some flour tortillas and make little tacos with the chicken, salsa and rice (Eric likes to put Mac n cheese in too). Even if its just the two of us, I love taking the leftovers to work for lunch. I love their salsa, so much that we can never go through the drive thru bc I have no shame and need about 15 salsas :). El Pollo Loco is my fast food of choice!
P.s. the staff is super nice, they messed up on our order and took care of our next meal!
