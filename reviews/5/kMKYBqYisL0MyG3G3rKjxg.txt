My family and I love this food! We order delivery from Cilantro frequently because we get cravings for the beef machaca tacos dorados all the time since we first tried them. They always send plenty of cups of condiments - the salsa verde is awesome, so is the guacamole. We get a courtesy call when they have questions about the order and you can tell they want you to be satisfied. The delivery guy is pleasant and polite. The combination of great customer service and delicious, authentic mexican food makes Cilantro one of my favorites.
