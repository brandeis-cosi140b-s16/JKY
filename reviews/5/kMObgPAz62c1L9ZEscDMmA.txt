Some really good Authentic Mexican food.  I will be back again! The carnitas plate is great. The salsa is good also. I think I will be back tomorrow to try seafood! Also Chef Paco came out to great us and bring out a complimentary flan for myself and family. The best Flan that I have ever had. We need one of these in Los Angeles.
