Buried Treasure

Urban lore often directs one to look among the rubble of dubious boroughs for the finest of flavor.  People have likely driven by Restaurant Atoyac Estilo Oaxaca for years, without stopping, overlooking this diamond in the rough.  I had.  Having won the Phoenix New Times Best "Rising From the Ashes" Award; there is more than meets the eye to this otherwise humble establishment.

Just beyond the rush hour traffic lay explosions of flavor in fish, al pastor, chorizo, and mole tacos.  Heading back to the counter for seconds; the shrimp, carne asada, and chicken tacos reverberate the same savory blasts.  Excavate through the ice that once chilled some of the finest horchata in the valley and resurrect the remains of cantaloupe and pecan.

Regardless of opinions on the curb appeal, the inside is always clean, inviting, and pleasant; indoor and patio seating.  The striking young lady at the counter is friendly and accommodating; offering onions, peppers, and sauces.  Accept them, then find a place to sit with safety straps; it's about to get exciting.
