Easy to drive past and not very noticeable from the road - DON'T miss it!! Real Mexican style tacos - simple, fresh, good ingredients. How hard is that? Shouldn't be but so so many places get it wrong.

Walked in at 5:55 - 5 minutes before it was meant to close - and the owners could not have been nicer or more welcoming. Husband and wife team and clearly they were made for owning a restaurant. Super friendly - happy to customize the menu - nice people.

The tortilla chips come out hot and ridiculously freshly made. The home made salsas hit the spot. Went with my wife, kids and parents (who aren't big on Mexican food) and everyone loved it. Continues ordering until 6:30 and they could not have been nicer about it. As we left - at 6:45 - other people coming in... so they may have ended up with a late night.
