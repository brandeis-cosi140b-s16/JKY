I was on a fish taco quest.  Multiple places later, I have found my spot.   Serrano's is clean, people are friendly, tacos and salsa bar excellent.  Everything tasted fresh.  I had both the shrimp tacos and their fish tacos, and everything came out generously topped and piping hot.  Wanting to make sure it wasn't a fluke, I went back the next day for the deuce.  Just as delicious! And now I am craving more as I write this review.
