Me and my friends visited here from LA and this place on the strip attracted us instantly. We had awesome service and an amazing waitress! Her name was Liz and we had no idea what to order, so she recommended the shrimp cocktail and it was bomb! Exactly what we wanted. She kept us laughing the whole time, and made us feel welcome. I definitely recommend visiting this joint, and asking for Liz because she was the cherry on top of this awesome restaurant!! We will be back!!
