This is not a typical greasy, god knows where the meat or produce for that matter comes from- Mexican joint.  Phoenix needs more places like this.  "Natural meats" people!  I'm shocked that this place doesn't have at least 4 or 5 stars?  We probably go a few times a month and I get catering for work, ALWAYS great food and great service.  2 words FISH TACOS, AMAZING!
If you are looking for same ole same ole Phoenix Mexican food, go somewhere else (Phoenix is full of them), this place is too healthy and fresh to be one of those.
