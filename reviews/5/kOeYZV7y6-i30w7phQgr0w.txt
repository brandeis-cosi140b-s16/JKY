AMAZING SERVICE!!!!! The waiter offered us peppers & onions with our salsa.. I said no thinking he was recommending an appetizer.. They brought it out anyhow AND IT WAS AWESOME! Great touch with the chips. Not for a second did we wait for a thing. All the servers look out to be sure no one needs a thing. The food was great and service impeccable! We will be back SOON!
