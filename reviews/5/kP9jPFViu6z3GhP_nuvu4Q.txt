This place is awesome! Finally a Tia Rosas on my side of town! If you like Mexican food, they do it up well. But if you are ready for a real treat, try the Ancho Peach Chicken with Chipolte Mashed potatoes! It is truly divine. Not your traditional cheese smothered Mexican dish. Servers are excellent, the wait times during peak hours are very reasonable. There is outdoor seating, weather permitted, although they do have heaters during cool winter months.
