OMG! Unlimited mimosas of all different flavors (peach, blackberry, prickly pear, blood orange, etc) for $10 and unlimited small plates (steak n eggs, chilaquiles, french toast,  etc) for $35 (which are not small at all). This place is THE BEST brunch spot in Vegas. Plus the service is beyond impeccable. RACHEL our server was AMAZING, she brought us every single dish on the menu, continued to keep our glasses full during our 3 hour stay and was such a sweetheart! This was the best spot for MOMs B-Day bc we were able to enjoy the beautiful outdoor seating view with all 12 of us family members. A must visit spot for all foodies and big groups. Tip big, it's worth it.
