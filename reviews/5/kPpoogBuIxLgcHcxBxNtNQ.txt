Have eaten at Maize several times.  GREAT food, very good prices, ambiance is crowded and very informal.  This is the place to go for GREAT food, and the basic amenities likely help keep the costs low.  It is typically crowded - the limited counter seating is a constraint.  The building looks like it was converted from a gas station to a restaurant, but no matter - the food is GREAT.  Try it, you'll be glad you did.
