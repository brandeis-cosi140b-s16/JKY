Really, really yummy. Looks like a hole in the wall from the outside and limited seating but friendly service and DELICIOUS food. Homemade chips w/ 4 salsas. The beans they serve are delicious, as is the rice. Make sure to check the specials on the board behind the cash register. It can be easy to miss but usually has some yummy options. The chocolate cake is definitely for 2 people and not cheap but soooo yummy. Also good horchata.Guacamola is also not cheap but straight outta the avocado fresh and enough for 4 probably.
