Omgggggg we had the pork belly tacos, tres leches French toast, Sonoran hot dog torts, and elote... Prob gonna puke. Best food I've had in a long time. Everything. We're so full. The pork belly melted in my mouth and the French toast literally tasted like the best fried ice cream I've ever had in French toast form. Definitely don't need the syrup. The hot dog, so so good, the bread was so soft and everything was so flavorful and delicious. So full. So glad we came here, we will be back! Maybe tomorrow!
