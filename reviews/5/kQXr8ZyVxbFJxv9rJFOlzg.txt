This place has awesome food! The owner is the nicest guy around and takes a lot of pride in what he does! Can't believe he's been in business here for 19 years and I just discovered this place. So far I have tried the green and red burittos and both are very delicious. Every time I come in he gives me a sample of something else. Carnitas was the last sample and that is going to be what I will have on my next visit! Can't wait!
