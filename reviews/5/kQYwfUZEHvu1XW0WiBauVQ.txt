My family lives almost an hour away from Anita's yet we seem to make the trek to eat there monthly. Their food is so delicious. I have never ordered something I didn't love. The salsa is amazing!! Everyone is always so incredibly friendly and the service is great. I always recommend this restaurant. It is definitely worth the drive!
