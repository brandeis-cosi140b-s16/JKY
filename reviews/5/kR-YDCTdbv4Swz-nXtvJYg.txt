I eat at this specific Rubio's very frequently and I'm never disappointed. I absolutely love eating here.

The food is not the most amazing food you will ever eat but it is above par. It is also not extremely expensive so it is definitely worth it.

After the first two times going there, they remembered my name and the chefs knew our order and started cooking when they saw our car. Even when they are busy, our food is ready in very little time. And not bad for being so quick.

It's close to home and has good service and I would recommend it to anyone.
