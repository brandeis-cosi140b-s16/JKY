I stopped here before hitting a show and absolutely loved it. It's a no frills type of place, but you would never know that based on the quality of the food. The veggie and pollo tacos were delicious. It was so good, that I came back after my show so I could enjoy the nachos. They don't sell liquor or beer here, but you are allowed to take it to-go and enjoy it at the bar next door (same owners). Every bite had amazing flavor ... both the tacos and the nachos. I will definitely return very soon. It's a small little place but their concept is very thought out. I even enjoyed the fact that every item is priced as a whole dollar amount (Tacos $3, Nachos $4 no meat / $5 with meat, soda $2, beans $2). Our server was friendly and personable.
