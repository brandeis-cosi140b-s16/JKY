Came here to eat while visiting family. I am hooked! The food is amazing especially the CC Sizzle. Everything here is homemade and there's nothing like it. I have been craving it since I returned home. The service was great too. Everyone was super friendly.  I wish we had a Cafe Casera here in Southern Oregon! Will definitely be back for more next time I am in Vegas.
