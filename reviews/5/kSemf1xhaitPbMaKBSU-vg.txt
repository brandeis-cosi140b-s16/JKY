This place is great for on the go meals, even perfect if you're trying to watch your weight. The employees are fast, place is clean, and the price is reasonable. You also have the choice whether you like brown rice or white rice and flour tortilla or whole wheat. The only thing I would suggest is if they could add wifi. I like studying here if I don't need internet but that's just me. Overall, two thumbs up!
