I am quite surprised at all the low reviews here. There is lots of parking in the lot.      I decided to stop here one day after visiting the great Bookmans.  It is very fresh food, and not at all over priced.  There is an entire little salsa bar that has cool to go cups with nice tight lids( a major plus).   The food is excellent! no red meat just fish and chicken. Lots of fresh limes.  Every one there were very pleasant and though i took it to go. I could of eaten there because it was nice and clean. They even had a drive thru. I thought it was great!
