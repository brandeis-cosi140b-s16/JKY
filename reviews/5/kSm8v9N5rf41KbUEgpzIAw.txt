I love the food and enjoy dining here.  The staff is always friendly and professional.  I always tip greater than 20% because the food is always well prepared, the staff is professional and attentive, and I support local business.  The only negative  is that they do not provide a "salad plate" to diners to eat their chips and salsa off of.
