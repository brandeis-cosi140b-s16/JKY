So,  my wife and I had an evening to ourselves which doesn't happen to often with our busy lives.  Barrio Queen was our choice!  After being seated we were passed over for some minutes.  Upon hearing that,  Manager Phillip immediately came to our table to assist us.  To start , he comped an appetizer  and then our entire meal as well!  He was extremely professional,  polite and personable!  We were very satisfied with his generosity! But wait,  upon hearing that my wife had saved a small portion of her meal for our daughter to sample Manager Phillip brought  out a full portion  to take home to our daughter!  Manager Phillip absolutely went above and beyond customer service! Incidentally,  the food was Great! ! Kudos to Manager  Phillip and Thank You once again! !Lee and Sandy
