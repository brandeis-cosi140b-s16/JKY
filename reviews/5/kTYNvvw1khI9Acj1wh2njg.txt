My fianc√© and I went here on November 23rd to celebrate my 21st birthday. Boy are we glad we did. After being at two other bars, prior to this one, we weren't finding "that spot" until we walked in here. The drinks are good and very good priced, the waitress we had was great, and all of the bouncers were really cool, and this was a great spot to watch ASU beat UCLA. Not too busy either. The food was bar none, Enchiladas, rice and beans, as good as it gets!!! Next time we go bar hopping in old town, this will be a definite stop!!
