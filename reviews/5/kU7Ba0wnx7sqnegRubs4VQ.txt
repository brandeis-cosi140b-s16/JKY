This is a diamond in the rough of Mexican food with in Scottsdale. I tend to shy away from shrimp tacos in Arizona for fear of subpar seafood but this was far from that. The shrimp was juicy, huge and flavorful! All the accoutrements were flavorful and authentic, we also had the breakfast burrito and it was just as amazing. The staff was beyond friendly and a tentative. I recommend the horchata as well! This place is a real Mexican food Chipotle style restaurant and I recommend it to everyone.
