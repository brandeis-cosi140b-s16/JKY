Went for the Carne Asada Fries, will go back for the Fish Tacos!  Seriously, I just ate the best fish taco I have ever had and I've eaten them in 3 states and both sides of the border!  Freshly battered and fried fish, fresh cabbage, pico and three thick slices of avocado, drizzled with creamy and mildly spicy sauce all wrapped in two soft corn tortillas.  Yeah, it was that good.  We've had the Carne Asada Fries before and they are the best but the fish taco was the surprise.
