The food memory that I have of Mucho Gusto is like a dream made of sand that gets brushed away in a gentle wind that ends in a singular impression that is so beautiful that you can only see pieces of it at a time. It's like closing your eyes in broad daylight and watching beautiful colors burst on the back of your eyelids. The one brilliance that I can articulate is the guacamole. This is no ordinary guacamole. It is as distinctly unique and wonderful as a Lear jet is to a prop plane. How's that possible?... Grand Marnier jalape√±o reduction sauce.
