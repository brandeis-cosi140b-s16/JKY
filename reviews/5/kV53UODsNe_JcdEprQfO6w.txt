We had passed this place on our way to the gym a few times and we finally tried it... And are we sure glad we did! This place was great; very small but nice and clean. Carlos was very helpful and took care of us. We went with what he recommended; tamales. I had the sweet corn topped with pork and chicken tamales, and my fianc√© had the chicken and the beef tamales. Everything was amazing! We were almost too stuffed to try an Empanada, but Carlos brought us one to try. It was the best Empanada I have ever had. We tried the pineapple and cream, which was heated and topped with a little bit of powdered sugar and Carmel. We will definitely be back. We found out on our way out that you can bring your own wine or beer and there is just a corking fee. What a fun place and we will definitely be coming back!
