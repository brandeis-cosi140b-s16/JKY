Guess what Paula from earlier reviews. . We had Whitney as a server.. she was awesome as balls! Never an empty Margarita glass and a happy smile! Come here often and never disappointed with service.  Happy hour frozen margaritas are well worth it. Pork a Vado do burritos make you see the face of god.
