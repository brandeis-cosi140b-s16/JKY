What a gem! Looked it up while visiting my grandfather who lives within a mile and he had never been there! Now he has their menu posted on his fridge.

You can order tamales by the 2s, dozen, or 20? I believe. They are frozen, but are fresh and ready to be heated for a quick meal or a party. There are about 25 different kinds and they even had seasonal pumpkin ones. They have tons of vegetarian options. 

Lucky for us, they do sell a couple fresh tamales. You can't each inside, but they will give you a fork and plate and you can eat on the bench outside or take on your picnic. We had chicken green chili, pork red chili, corn and cream cheese and chipotle corn. The corn and cream cheese was amazing and the chicken verde was moist and flavorful. Recommending it to anyone who comes to visit grandpa from now on!
