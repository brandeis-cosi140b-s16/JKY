Been to this place several times and I tell you I don't have one complaint it's always been delicious and fresh. Anytime I'm on the east I stop in by the way I'm going there in a little while :) mouth is drooling from looking at the pics. Don't let the couple of one star yelpers turn you away you won't be disappointed!!!!!!
