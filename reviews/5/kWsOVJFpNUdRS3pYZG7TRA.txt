My mom lives near here and I stop by on occasion.  Mom gets chile rellano a lot with cheese enchiladas.  I love chips, salsa and the refried beans with cheese.  I love cheese enciladas too.  They are clean.  I've known places like this to taste/smell of PineSol.  Glad that this one does not.  Everything is flavorful and good.  I'll go back for more.
