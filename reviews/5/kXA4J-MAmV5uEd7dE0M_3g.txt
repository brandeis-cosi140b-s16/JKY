SERIOUS MEXICAN NOM'S!!!  My husband and I stopped here after flying into Phoenix.  It was a bit late but they were more than willing to accommodate us, thank goodness!!!  I was craving good, real homemade Mexican food after being in the Midwest for months with no real Mexican.  This place seriously hit the spot.  Dive restaurant in not so good part of town...so what!! Trust me, you don't want to pass this place up.

The service is fast and friendly and the margaritas are seriously yummy BUT the MOLE is TO-DIE-FOR!!!  Seriously, I ate so much I'm pretty sure I almost died but the flavor of that mole was so incredibly rich and delectable that I could NOT stop eating.  It was by far the BEST MOLE I've ever had!  The other impressive part of their mole was that the chicken was served on the bone, almost stew style, which you don't see much.  Normally you order mole and it's either shredded or chunk white meat.  The bone-in chicken added to the richness of this dish.  I highly, highly recommend it!!!

Don't miss this place. You'll regret it! I shall return Barquita.  Te amo!!
