I've heard of monstrous two handed burritos before but never two handed tacos!! I had a problem the other day. A huge appetite and a pocketful of laundry money and pocket lint. I ended up scoring two tacos for under six bucks. These weren't your average pocket tacos w a sprinkle of carne and a sprizzle of onion in a palm sized flat cake. These were perfectly cooked swine with fresh cabbage onions and tomatoes in a canopy of maiz. They were a bit naked so I stopped by the salsa bar to shower em w limon before tapping them with different salsas to really make em dance. Had I checked the menu or had been there before  I would have gone with the 5 rolled tacos aka taquitos for under $4. If they took that much care into the lower priced items I can't wait to return to see what else they have  up their sleeve. Try to find more bang for your buck in the south side let alone az and you will b disappointed.
