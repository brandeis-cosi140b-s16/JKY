This place is in the wrong place for most people. Located in a dilapidated plaza near the Metro Mall, this restaurant should not be amazing. But it just is. And it is in the perfect spot for us. We have eaten here several times and have never been disappointed in any meal. The inside of the restaurant is not pretty. It resembles a fast food joint. The food is anything but "fast food" quality! Tonight we ordered carry out . The meals are served with chips, salsa, and refried bean dip, which is outstanding. We ordered the shrimp wrapped with bacon, which is served with refried beans, rice, and a small salad. YUM! It is definitely in the top 5 best Mexican dishes I have ever had. My hubby had the green pork burrito. It is huge! Also served with beans and rice. We love this place and hope people go there so it stays in business unlike most of the restaurants and stores located in and around Metro Center.
