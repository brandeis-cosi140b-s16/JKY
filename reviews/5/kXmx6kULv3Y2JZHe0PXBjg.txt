Love,love,love this place! My husband is a huge Carna Asada Fries guy, and this place is perhaps the best we've tried.  They pack on the meat, and really hook you up. The best part is that they're open 24-7. We live in CA, so when we have late night flights into LV, we come straight here, knowing they're open, ready to serve us, even at 1am. LOVE IT! By the way, Speak spanish to the cashiers, and they'll love ya even more.
