If you're looking for real, authentic Mexican food - Pepe's is the place to go. I have been going for the past 15 years. It's my all time favorite Mexican food restaurant. I get the red chili. Their home made tortillas are to die for! Their refried beans are incredible. And their rice is unlike anything you've ever tasted. You must take your friends and family to Pepe's on your next night out! I love Jose, the man who runs the show. It's family owned, so his mom does the cooking in the kitchen with his sister and other siblings. It's really homey and a great atmosphere. They are all very friendly. There is always a game on the TV when you're there. There's also take-out, which is very convenient. MUST TRY!
