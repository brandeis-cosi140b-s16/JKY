I was in Vegas for a bachelor party and a few friends and I decided to check this place out. I have to say this place is top notch. I am a server at a fine dining restaurant and I can honestly say the service was incredible. They were fairly busy when we walked in but we were quickly seated and taken care of. All of the drinks were delicious but the Margaritas were easily the best I have ever had. The food was incredible as well. I was a little skeptical about the mango guacamole but it turned out to be my favorite of the three. The four of us split a few types of tacos, they were all excellent but I highly recommend the mahi mahi. I can honestly say I loved everything about this place. The food, service and ambiance was excellent and I would recommend it to anyone.
