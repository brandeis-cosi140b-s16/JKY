Our favorite place to grab a burrito to go. I have not ventured to deep into their  menu as I am hooked on there carna asada burrito. A great burrito with quality ingredients. I never find "bad" pieces if meat and I have eaten here at least twenty times over the years. They give you all the hot sauce you want and it is good. Overall great place to eat.
