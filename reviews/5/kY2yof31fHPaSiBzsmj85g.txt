I love this little place, I have been here several times and they never cease to impress me.  At first, one thinks that they are entering the average, everyday taco shop but at Serrano's, they take care of you.  After you enter, if you're not sure what you would like to eat, you can have a seat instead of ordering at the counter and the server will bring you a menu and chips with salsa while you read it over.  They will take your order at either the counter or your table and they have an awesome little salsa bar.  The Flan is amazing.  I highly recommend this place to everyone looking for a little taco shop with an extra flare of class.  Definitely a step above the rest.
