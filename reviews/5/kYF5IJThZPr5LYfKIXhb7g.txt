Incredible food incredible service. 

I wanted to go to chipotle was about 10 AM in the morning unfortunately to my dismay they don't open till 11 AM since I was already here and was hungry needed to be anyway I the food that I have in the car. One of the employees saw this and 40 minutes before they open offered to run inside and make me a burrito. I told him because I was already eating that was okay, but what services that. You never see that in any retail stores ever especially corporate own big guys. I was expecting them to open at 11 and not take any orders or business until 11 and this guy saw a customer need and jumped.
