This place is great! It may look like just an ordinary "Robertos" type mexican restaurant, but it's far from that. The food is awesome, it actually tastes like it's homemade and made with love. It also had an authentic mexican feel to it, like it was made from family recipes.

Phrank or Frank however he spells his name, is a character. While there he had a Snoop Dogg reference for almost everything on the menu. Like, "This burrito is off the hizzle." So any man that can quote a rapper and make delicious food is good in my book.

I had the nachos, because Phrank told me they were "bomb!" So I had to go with that. I was kinda hesitant because I'm not a big fan of chili verde sauce, only liking it from a few places. The nacho chips we re slathered with this delicious green sauce and topped with cheese. Phrank was right...they were bomb! My girlfriend had the special of the day which were the fish tacos. She's had her share of fish tacos and she admitted that these were the best she's ever had. The fish was crispy, the cabbage had texture and the cream sauce they put over it was outstanding. Even the beans and rice it came with didn't have that "straight out of the can" taste to it. Phrank also gave us a sample of the ceviche he makes, and it was great. A lot like lomi salmon at some hawaiian restaurants. It had a strong lemon taste, but you could still taste every single ingredient in the dish. It was top notch.

Like their quote says, "Not The Best, Just None Better," This place is one of the best "Strip Mall Mexican Restaurants" I've been to. I'm glad I live so close, there were a lot of things I wanted to try.
