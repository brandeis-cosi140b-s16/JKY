I was a little hesitant to come in here at 3 o'clock on a Saturday afternoon as the parking lot was empty and the building looked a little run down. But it is the best authentic Mexican food I've had in a long time. We were started with salsa and bean dip which was quickly refilled and we devoured it. The Mexican rice was to die for. Peppery and spicy. I Could have eaten just that. There was a lot of rave about the margaritas, but I was disappointed. Way to syrupy and tasted mostly of mix. The server was quick and attentive.  He offered us to go waters and chips and salsa which was a nice suprise. Reasonably price, fast service,  and definitely going back!!!
