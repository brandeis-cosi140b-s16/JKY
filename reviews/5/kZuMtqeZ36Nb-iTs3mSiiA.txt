Cheap, tasty, and fresh Mexican food.  They have several different types of fillings; barbacoa, green chile beef, red chile pork, carnitas, two chickens, and carne asada, as well as black and pinto beans, fresh guacamole, and salsa that will take the skin off the inside of your mouth (this is a good thing).  And the burritos are the size of my head.  Very hard to beat for the price.
