We were sooo happy  when we had lunch at  this restaurant  today.  We've been trying to find a really good Mexican restaurant since we moved to Apache Junction. We had fajitas with chicken & beef.  DELICIOUS, made fresh & served sizzling hot just how we like them. Service was excellent too!  Will be regular customers, and will tell all our friends & neighbors about this great restaurant.
