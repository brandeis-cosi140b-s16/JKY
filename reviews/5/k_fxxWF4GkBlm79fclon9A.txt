Let me first start out by commending the staff at this place; from the hostess, wait staff, bartenders and management it's clear their staff is a cut above the rest. Personable service with a smile, great atmosphere, awesome cocktails and good food. (Especially the taco cart late night weekends!) I've have the pleasure of planning many group events there with the GM Justin Jereb. Always accommodating my every need to ensure we have a great experience. With that said we plan on returning for many sports games, UFC Fights and birthday celebrations! If you're looking for a relaxed place to enjoy a night out or a casual happy hour on the patio, this is your place and JUSTIN is your man!
