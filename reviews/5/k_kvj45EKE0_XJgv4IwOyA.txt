I had the good fortune of showing up on "Taco Tuesday". Got an extra free taco with my two-taco order. That's good news when it's at Tortilla Fish, because these are the best fish tacos I've ever had. I had the "heart healthy" steamed Fish Machaca on a soft corn tortilla. (And you do need three of these to fill up.) Friendly, efficient service.  The ambience is what you would expect for a small fast food lunch-type restaurant in a strip mall. Seating for 22 hungry people on a quick lunch break. My second visit so far, and I am going back.
