Contemporary setting meets traditional Mexican cuisine. This place is great. The surroundings are "modern Mexican" with a traditional color palette and accessories with an updated urban design. Food was amazing and served in generous portions. The chicken nachos were completely loaded with chicken, cheese, pico, etc... Chimichanga was huge, smothered in sauce, and came with sour cream and guacamole. We had a large party  and the service was fantastic. Al the waiters pitched in together to provide excellent service.
