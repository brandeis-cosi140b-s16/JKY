I almost gave only 3 stars just to trick people into not going to this wonderful and delicious restaurant (now that I found it, I don't want it to become so crowded I can't get in).  I have often visited the Globe location, and decided to try the location on Ray Road (Chandler) since I live pretty close by.  No Happy Hour :-(, but, the margaritas are absolutely delicious (although only mildly strong) and inexpensive.  Like Chile Rellenos?  They make the best!  Enchiladas are really excellent as well.  Taco's are good, but about the same as any other good Mexican restaurant.  Chips are perfect, salsa was good, but a little hot (which I normally love, but this was just "very good" in my opinion).  Service as a bit slow, but worth the wait!
