I've driven past before. Finally tried it a couple weeks ago. Not your typical scottsdale joint. Good prices. The staff are so sweet. The food is amazing. I've gotten the tamales, chicken tacos, burrito, beans and rice. All were delicious! They are speedy when ordering to dine in or to go. Definitely will be returning.
