Always has been our "home base" for a relaxing and wonderful place to eat.  much good food...good drinks, and the best staff you could ask for!  They even catered our first daughter's wedding a few years ago.

Don't miss this "GEM"... that is "slightly hidden" in Gold Canyon!!  (but yet right on the 60 going east of Phoenix)...  Amazing patio with view as well.
