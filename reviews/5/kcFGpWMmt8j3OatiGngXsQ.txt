MMM MM This my **** this my **** ( to put it as graciously as Ms Gwen Stafani does)  

Seriously though, this is my favorite Roberto's hands down.  I have been to about 3 other ones and one comes close, and the other two fall so short I don't even want to talk about them anymore, SO!  

My friend and I frequent this particular Roberto's because 1. It is close and 2. It is DA BOMB.  I went on a chimichanga kick for about 3 entire months and to be honest, surprised I didn't turn into one; I couldn't stop eating them they were so freaking good!  Always crispy and hot; I make sure to order with no beans inside, that's just my preference and I have noticed that the innards of the chimi seem to be less watery, which is perfecto! 

My other passion is the rolled tacos, it's like being a kid in the candy store and eating all your favorites!  Well, for me it is, I just love that guac and cheese they put on top and the crunchiness, it's just, well- simply FANTABOLOUS! 

I could sit here and rant and rave about the food all day, but alas, stop reading and go eat!
