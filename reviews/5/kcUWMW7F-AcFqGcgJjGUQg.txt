This neighborhood mexican grill is now a favorite.  Quick food but high quality.  Order at the counter and sit down and enjoy or take out.  Atmosphere is not fancy but it's very clean and nice enough to really enjoy eating in...NOT a hole in the wall!    The chile relleno is uniquely delicious, not greasy like the traditional.  Tortillas are so yummy and salsas are perfection.  My favorite item is the pineapple chipotle margarita!  Can't beat the price or satisfaction of this tasty margarita!  Above all, the owners are so friendly and appreciate their customers, and the staff must be hired for their professional yet friendly service with a smile!  They are the best.  We love Salsa Blanca!
