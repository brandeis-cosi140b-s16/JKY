What is not to love about Mad Mex??? Although they are a chain, the food is always A+ and the atmosphere is fun!

I was first introduced to Mad Mex about three years ago. Not knowing what to expect I thought that it was just another Mexican restaurant.  Mad Mex is awesome from their chips and salsa, to their burritos to their margaritas, never a bad meal, drink, or service! I have been here for both lunch and dinner. 

The atmosphere is very fun too, the art is pretty cool  and resembles the Mexican Day of the Dead, and it just has a relaxed vibe to it. It is a casual place so you are perfect in jeans!

Their margaritas are really good and reasonably priced. Are you a beer drinker? They have a ton of beers that they serve and a decent amount on tap. Around fall they have an awesome selection of fall beers and they have pumpkin beer.

Also in fall they have this wonderful little thing called a gobblerito.  You must try it,  it is the most amazing thing I have ever tried.  Although to some the idea may sound gross, you MUST give it a try!!! A gobblerito is: turkey, stuffing,  corn, some black beans, and mashed potatoes all wrapped up neatly in a burrito shell. You get gravy and cranberry sauce as a side! A must try for fall!!!!

While I have been to other locations, Greentree is my favorite! !!!
