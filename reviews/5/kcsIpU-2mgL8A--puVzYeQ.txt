AWESOME. That may even be an understatement. This place creates enchiladas that are a flavor explosion in your mouth. There are so many different flavors and combinations, but no matter which way you build your enchilada, it's going to be a success. 

I hate to do this because I'm sure they hear it all the time, but it's very similar to Chipotle in the way you order and build your food. You walk up and go through a process which is nicely explained on their menu above the ordering area. The people behind the counter are very friendly and will help you along the way if you get lost on your first time through. 

I'll share my combination because it was incredible and gives an idea of how the whole thing works. I got two enchiladas in flour tortillas (they have both corn and flour tortillas made in house!). In one enchilada I got the green chile pork and in the other I got the sweet and spicy cornbread. Next I chose the green sauce and asadero cheese (aka jack cheese). Then they throw it into an open oven and let the cheese melt and bubble over the top. Next I topped mine with Uncle Rico's Pico, crumbled cojita cheese (more cheese!), honey v slaw (SO GOOD), pickled onion, and scratch made crema. Lastly I got the jalapeno ranch on the side, which I'm glad I did because it had a nice kick to it!

I went with 4 people and our total came out to about $32! WHAT A STEAL. We just got waters and skipped on the chips and guac but I still left the restaurant feeling full and happily satisfied. 

I hope they open up more location closer to home because I'd eat here all the time.
