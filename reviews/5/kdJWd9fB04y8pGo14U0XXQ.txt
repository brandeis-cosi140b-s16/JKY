I'm moving to Chicago tomorrow and if I have one regret, it's that I didn't eat at Mas Amigos enough.
It ruined my day today with its deliciousness, that's what it did.  I had so much I meant to do today, but then I went into Mas Amigos for the vegetarian torta (it's amazing) and a margarita as a reward/break for my industrious morning with a mop.  I had my sandwich, and my giant margarita (I think there was some confusion as to what size I wanted.  Maybe they thought I needed the large.  It's EXTREMELY large) and chips, and by the time I was done I was in no shape to do anything.  I managed to walk home, where I immediately collapsed into a 4 hour coma.  There went my day.
Mas Amigos, it was worth it.  I think I may get another sandwich (But not another margarita, omg) tomorrow.
