This restaurant is superb! The food is excellent and the place is very well kept. This place is on the smaller side and can become crowded rather easily by all the centennial high school kids, but besides weekends this place doesn't become too crowded. 
 
 On my first visit I enjoyed a plain bean and cheese burrito(I know rather plain). A lot can go wrong with a plain bean and cheese burrito(most cases it tastes to plain). I was super impressed with the bean in cheese burrito! The tortilla was to die for, the cheese was delicious and the beans were cooked well(not too hard). 

 The staff is friendly, amazing food, nice facilities! Your sure to enjoy your visit to Cafe Rio!
