I love this place. Friendly and the food is super tasty. Breakfast burritos! Salsas are awesome. Staff is warm and welcoming. 

Just found out that they were robbed yesterday. I am so sorry guys. That is just horrible. Sending much love and light to all of you and your families. Wishing you a speedy recovery. Please keep us posted. 

True Fan!!
