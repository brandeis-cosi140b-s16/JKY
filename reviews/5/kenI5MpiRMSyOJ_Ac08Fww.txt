I write this review as I finish the second of two lime candies that were given to me along with the check. While that part comes last, I feel the need to comment on how good those things are. They are exponentially better than peppermint candies that are ubiquitous at family restaurants. 

Anyway, that's probably not why you're here reading this review. Manuel's provided exactly what I was looking for--great Sonoran Mexican food and a down-to-each, low-key atmosphere to go along with it. The experience started off walking into the building, which is located in a strip mall. The building itself seemed to be older than the rest of the mall. Anyway, it worked. The interior is standard 1980s Mexican with the terra cotta tiles all over and sombreros gracing the walls and ceiling. Pretty much sets up the experience the way is should be. Two waiters both tended to the table, answered questions, took part of the order, and continued to serve us through the whole meal. Not only were they both affable, we got twice the attention!

The recommendations they provided were genuine; not limited to "people like this..." No, both waiters told us exactly what they liked and gave reasons. The entrees were preceded by some pretty tasty salsas (yes, two o' them!) and chips and a cheese crisp, which we ordered from the appetizers.

The two of us who dined there had carnitas and the three amigos enchiladas, both which came with rave reviews. If you're not looking for three enchiladas, may I recommend the spinach with white sauce. Neither disappointed. It's true, you need to like cheese and a little grease with you food. But that's exactly why you'd be at this restaurant.
