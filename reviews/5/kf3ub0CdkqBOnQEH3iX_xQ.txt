My husband & I met my Aunt & Uncle there for our first time, and we loved the food.  My husband had the fish tacos and gave me a bite, delicious.  I had the machaca beef chimichanga, yum!  I loved it so much we are going there again tonight 1/27/14.  

My parent's came to visit and we recommended Don Ruben's too, and they absolutely loved it.  I use to be a Tee Pee's fan but I have to say Don Ruben's does make a better chimi.
