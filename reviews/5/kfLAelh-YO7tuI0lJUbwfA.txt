Being from Las Cruces, NM which is about 30 minutes away from the Green Chile capitol of the world (Hatch New Mexico), I think that I can accurately judge the green chile burritos to be sensational. I'm not much of a pork fan, (excluding bacon of course) which is usually what is in the burritos, so I usually just order a bean and cheese burrito enchilada style with green sauce. Green is the only way to go in my opinion. The burritos are huge, and are filled with so much beans, cheese, and green enchilada sauce, it's overflowing as soon as you take the first bite. It's always hot because they make each order fresh, but be prepared to wait especially if you go between 11-1. I try to only go after 1, but it's not uncommon to wait 20 minutes even going after the lunch rush. So if you have only an hour lunch, and you work downtown, you better be a speedy driver. I usually only have about ten minutes to eat after driving over and waiting in line, so that's definitely something to take into consideration.

It's a little hard to find at first because there isn't a sign, and the business operates out of an old house across from a school, but you'll know you're in the right place when you see the line up of cars for a block. The staff is all very friendly, but there isn't a lot of waiting room inside, and there really isn't too much space outside to eat either, so it's more of a grab and go kind of restaurant, which I don't mind because I probably would not choose to stay and eat there either, but you're going there for the food not the experience.

The only other downside aside from the wait, and the lack of seating and cleanness, are that the green burritos are twice as much as the red ones because they are so popular. I personally think that this is ridiculous, but obviously everyone is still willing to pay for it. All in all it's a great little hole in the wall in downtown Phoenix, and a must try if you are craving some delicious green chile.
