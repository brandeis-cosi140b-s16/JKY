I prefer this location over the original in cavecreek strictly on service and accessibility but if I must say I think their food is a bit better as well. 

My parents frequent this location on a weekly basis and occasionally I get to tag along and participate in the fun. Every lunch or dinner usually starts off with chips and salsa (3 types) and a large pitcher of frozen margaritas. 

El Encanto Dos has basically ruined margaritas for me, as its hard to find any as strong and as good tasting anywhere else. They just taste right!! But watch yourself, like I said, they are potent. 

I don't change up my selections very often because the Pollo Fundido is just too delicious to stray away from. I suggest it to everyone if they are unsure on what looks good to them or just want my opinion on something to get. It's a must try at El Encanto and I would suggest getting a half size portion just because it is so filling. The mild but tangy cream sauce will keep you coming back time and time again. 

As for service, My family and I threw a surprise 60th birthday for my dad here and all of the staff helped out and made it really special for him . They accommodated our 30 or so guests and had special menus out for our party. We couldn't have asked for a better set of staff to help us with a such a special event. And to top it off the service is like that all the time. They are always super helpful, recognize the regulars, and are very friendly at all times.
