The Pig Wings were pretty amazing as was the rice that came with the taco combo which is why they got 5 stars. The service was very good so don't be mislead by the "bar-type" atmosphere you will see when you walk in. We had the shrimp tamales (a little too salty but still good) and the taco combo with the excellent rice. I would recommend you put it on your list of places to check out.
