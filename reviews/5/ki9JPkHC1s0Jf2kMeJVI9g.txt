Good Mexican restaurants are hard to find. More often than not the good is bland and leaves a lot to be desired.  

Not with Aranda's.   The food is amazing.  I had the Mondays special which was a massive chorizo and pulled pork burrito covered in verde sauce.  It was amazing!  Very flavorful.  I wish I lived close to this place.  

The service was good, the beer was cold, and the prices were right.  

This is a 5 plus star establishment.   If you're in the area stop by. You will not be disappointed.
