We eat Mexican food all over the valley, Sunnslope to Chandler and a few on the west side.  Grullo has the best bistek I've had. The nachos with green chili are my wifes favorite.  This is real Mexican food and affordable. for a comparison the bistek combo is $7.49. They serve Menudo and whole fried fish too.
