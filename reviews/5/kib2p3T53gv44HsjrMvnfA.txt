Whenever I fly back to Arizona, about twice a year, I drive straight from Sky Harbor to San Carlos Bay. For fifteen years I have kept this tradition. The chips and salsa are perfect, mariachis drifting around, real families and workers on their lunch breaks. All the seafood is perfect, especially the ceviche. The soups are amazing. For the kids, I get fried shrimp with french fries, and they're the best fried shrimp you'll ever eat. Flying into PHX, I dream of this and am never disappointed: a cold Pacifico beer with those tiny, tart Mexican limes and a whole fried snapper endiablados style. 

The neighborhood looks like a place you'd go to pawn your grandma's walker or sell a hot catalytic converter, but inside San Carlos Bay, you'll think you're eating on the square in Guymas!
