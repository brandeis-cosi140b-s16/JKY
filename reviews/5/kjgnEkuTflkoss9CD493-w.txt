This Julioberto's is one of the best drive thru Mexican places I have found of the '-bertos' restaurants. I have been coming to this location for 6 years. Previously it was a Filibertos. I have a Filibertos right by my house and I drive to this one because the food is far superior. The breakfast burritos are large and just chock full of bacon-- big bacon chunks not the little tiny chopped bacon bits you get at some places. The carne asada fries are truly a masterpiece. They manage to make them crispy enough not to get soggy but without being burned and you get a really big portion. They always seem to rotate in new burrito styles and some of them are new favorites. I have never had a problem with small portions, bad food or anything else ever at this location. The one thing I wish they would change is the drive through speaker. It sounds like they're yelling at you from 1952 through a tin can.
