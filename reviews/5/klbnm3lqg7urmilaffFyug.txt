Old, funky Mexican food place that feels and tastes like Mexico. We went here based on Yelp reviews and were not disappointed. It's very small - 4-5 tables but we got a place to sit. Everything is in Spanish with minimal English references. It was just good, cheap food. 2 of us ate for less than $20. Where does that happen in Scottsdale. We'll be back!
