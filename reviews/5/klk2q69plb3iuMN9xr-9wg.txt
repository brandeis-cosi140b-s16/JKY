This place was our first stop after an early flight in from Seattle, and wanted something light but filling. Not a surprise that the so call "City that never sleep" most restaurants are closed for breakfast/brunch! We happen to stubble upon this place while searching for any opening. Our experience there was great, the owner was friendly (very talkative) and the quality was amazing compare to their price.
