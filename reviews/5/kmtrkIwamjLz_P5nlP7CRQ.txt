Great food and prices. Far better pricing and speed than down the street at La Familia which is basically now a loud obnoxious bar, with Mexican food on the side sadly.

Federico's has a lot of daily specials. Check their website for coupons, specials, menus, prices.  Monday AND Tuesday is 99 Cent Tacos (reg. $2.09+) and $1.99 burritos (reg. $3).  

they have a nice little salsa bar, but also have red radishes sliced  up, jalepenos, onions/jalepenos julienned.  And they don't ration your salsa or charge extra for to go salsa like La Familia does.

I often find that going inside is quicker than the drive through.  Not sure why. I think everything is made to order, so if someone gets something unusual in the drive thru, it holds up the line.

I wish this was close to my work, I'd go there a lot more. Great combo specials, and very good prices. I like the atmosphere inside, TV in there.
