After visiting TF pretty much every week, I decided it's time to update my review. Bottom line: I love this place! Make no mistake, it's a fast food restaurant in a strip mall, opposite WalMart. But remember the old sage, you can't judge a book by its cover. Same goes here! The place is clean and uncluttered, and the staff is ALWAYS very friendly and helpful.

But the food! Always fresh, made to order, and very tasty! I always order two tacos (and get one free on Tuesdays ) -- naked style, which means no tortilla. Then customize to my liking at the excellent salsa bar. Amazing flavor combinations are possible! Be sure to try the chipotle and the cilantro sauces.

Check out my photos for many examples of what can be created. Today I decided to avoid the fried choices, and went with two Fish Machaca tacos - naked style, of course!
