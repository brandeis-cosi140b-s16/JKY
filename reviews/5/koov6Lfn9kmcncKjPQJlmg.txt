Amazing amazing amazing! During my trip to Vegas, we came here many times. The chef shay (spelling might be off) was amazing. I have a gluten and dairy allergy and every time she came out to ensure what I ordered was safe for me to eat! So sweet and the food amazing!  I'm so glad we found this restaurant! Gluten free and dairy free. No problem!
