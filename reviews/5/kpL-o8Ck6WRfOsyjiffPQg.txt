I've been coming to Mi Patio for 14 years and they're still my favorite Mexican restaurant. It is a smallish place but the service is always friendly, fast and efficient. I really like their salsa along with their complimentary chips. I usually have their various selections of encheladas and have never been disappointed.  I've seen complaints that Mi Patio isn't authentic but i would disagree. You can't beat the menu, flavor of the food, service and price. I'll continue to frequent Mi Patio as long as I live here in Phoenix.
