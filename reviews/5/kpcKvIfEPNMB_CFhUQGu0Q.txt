Having grown up in Texas and then lived my adult life in California, I was skeptical about finding good Mexican food in Wisconsin. I tried this little gem out today and was blown away! Not only is it adorably quaint inside, but our server couldn't have been sweeter. She made guacamole for me on the spot, even though they don't typically even serve it on the menu. The tacos were amazing and everything was so fresh. They will definitely be seeing me on a weekly basis!
