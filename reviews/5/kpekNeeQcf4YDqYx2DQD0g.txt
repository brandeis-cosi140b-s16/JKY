I'm a huge fan of Super Taco.  It's the closest mexican place to my apartment and I'm always here.  So what stands out to me?  Service.  They remember me, they're always so friendly and accommodating.  

I am a sucker for carne asada fries, thank god I'm naturally slim, because I get them... often.  A full portion is way too much for me but they will always let me order a half order.  Does Robertos?  No, they won't.  But Super Taco does!

This place is always clean, extremely swift with getting the food out, and like I said before, service is exceptional.
