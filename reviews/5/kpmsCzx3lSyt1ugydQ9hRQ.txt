Was excited to try this place for a while, and I was pleasantly surprised. I had a taco salad, husband had a burrito and kids had a quesadilla. Yes, you have to buy the chips and salsa as someone else stated, but I do not know why this would be a problem?? Every restaurant I have been to, you have to buy the appetizer (they are only $2.50). Our food was excellent and our service was fast! We were in and out in less than 45 minutes. We will definitely return!
