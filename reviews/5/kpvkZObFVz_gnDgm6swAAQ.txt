I feel a moral obligation to compensate for not so hot reviews. My food wasn't bland, my service didn't suck and I certainly don't regret going here. The menu sprawls out very prodigiously and so I doubt there's anything Mexican you could possibly want that's not here (maybe lengua or menudo but I sure don't want that). I went a little more "traditional"/entry level with las enchiladas supremas and I feel like they were easily comparable to the enchiladas I've had in little, hole in the wall taquerias near where I grew up on Chicago's south side. I'd imagine the same is true for the other dishes. 

Also, today was $1.99 margarita day and they sure as shit didn't skimp on the booze. If I think of a two dollar margarita, I imagine a perfunctory splash of tequila and a lot of sweet sugary juice. Nope. 

And finally, I could tell this place was the real deal by the tortilla chips. The best Mexican restaurants, as my dad tells me every time anyone brings up Mexican food are the ones that have tortilla chips that are basically cut up, fried tortillas. While Chipotle may be the exception to that rule (although I do like Chipotle), those chips were the sign of authentic Mexican food.

Anyway, above average service and really tasty food for someone who (not to brag) actually knows about real Mexican food. So remember, y'all, as Jemaine from Flight of the Conchords says, "Be more constructive with your feedback, please."
