We were out of towers and wanted Mexican food. This place is AWESOME! Great food and great service! They tended to our big group of 7 with great attentiveness.   The GM and the chef came out to greet, welcome, and occasionally checked on how we were doing! We had the special between 3-6pm...street tacos. Had the different kinds and all were great! We also tried the watermelon infused drink/water & the beef taquitos as an appetizer. Delish! As for desserts,  we had the churros, fried ice cream, and flan. Mouth watering!

A must try for sure!

We did drive past it since it's a lil tucked away. It's beside a gentlemen's club.
