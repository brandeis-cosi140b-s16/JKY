AMBIANCE: Clean, tidy & tiny, Mexican hole-in-the-wall burger place. Not too many peeps around to bug ya, also which is awesome! 

SERVICE: Service was great! The employees were really helpful, since it was my first time eating there. Of course, they speak Spanish & English!! Caterin' to that hungry crowd! 

FOOD: Boygers are awesome, I had the Hawaiian Boyger and Chencho fries, which were hot and delicious. They give you good portion sizes, and the prices are extremely, extremely cheap. They have a lot of specials, which are on the updated menu I attached!! 

Love this place, can't wait to go back :)
