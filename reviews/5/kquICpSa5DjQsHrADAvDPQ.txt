For cheap, yet delicious Mexican food, especially after a night of drinking... this is the place.  They're open 24 hours!

Order the Steak Egg and Cheese Burrito.  $5.45, and its about the size of a subway foot-long.  Packed with steak and cheese... oh man, I think I might go get one for breakfast!  *drool*
