Okay, I've never been to Mexico, so I don't know how authentic this food is.  What I do know is that I enjoy it.  There are so many things to choose from.  You can go basic with tacos, burritos, and the like or try something more exotic.  The Milaneza (sp?) is a particular favorite.  The Burrito Loco is a challenge.  The salsa is excellent.  My family loves this place.  Whether it's going there for dinner or getting take out, we always say yes to El Toro.  The problem with take out is that we can't enjoy one of the best parts of El Toro: their Golden Margaritas.  Preferably the HUGE ones.  Staff is always friendly, service prompt, prices very reasonable.  Fantastic!!!
