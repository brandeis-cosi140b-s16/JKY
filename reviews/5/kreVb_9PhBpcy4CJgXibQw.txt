LOVE the carnitas...quality and flavorful beef.. Reasonably priced.. and I am confident it was NOT horse meat... We ALL need to be careful of quality these days.. sometimes it pays to spend a few extra dollars on quality and trusting the brand.. IE Lettuce Entertain You..... also we enjoyed terrific service....
