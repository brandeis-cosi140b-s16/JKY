I can go on for pages about how great these tacos are. And no the alcohol is not an influence. Sober or intoxicated these are THE BEST TACOS IN THE WORLD. Yeah, i said it. No I have not travel the world but nothing will change this claim. Whats my favorite? Try one of everything, I'm sure you cant decide. Tacos are a little more than what you can get in LA but its all worth it. My first time here, I was told to try their Abodabo meat. It reminded me of spicy Korean pork. Which I like but I prefer to stick to  carne asada, buche and tripa. The place is pretty well kept, clean and organized. If ever in Vegas, this is a must!!!!!
