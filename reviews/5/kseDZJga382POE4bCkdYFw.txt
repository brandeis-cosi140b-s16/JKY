My taco fix when I want to eat tacos without feeling bad about it later.  It's a custom food option like going to Chipotle where you decide if you're getting something in taco, burrito, bowl, or salad form... only a million times tastier and better.  I can't actually remember if there is a burrito option or if I'm missing anything because I always get crunchy tacos anyway.  The steak and Kahlua pork are great, the fish was good but the others were more flavorful to me so I keep going back to those.. I have a routine here and I'm not going to change it.  This place is very vegetarian friendly and their coconut bark is chocolate coconut crack.  I have gone to Braddah's just for the coconut bark, it's one of my favorite dessert things in Vegas.
