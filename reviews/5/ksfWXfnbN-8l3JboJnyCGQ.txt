Honestly this Chipotle is just like any Chipotle I have ever been to. This location has been well-kept and clean every time I have gone. The food has been great and reasonably portioned per what I have seen at other Chipotles. The employees are friendly and help to move you quickly through the line. If I need Chipotle, I will probably just drive the 3 minutes to this location and eat until I am stuffed full. Also, I did not smell anything but tortillas and grilled chicken.
