just stopped in for lunch. was able to get in and out and back to work in time. wasn't too busy. there were two servers working and helping each other out. both were super friendly. I ordered three tacos - fish, carnitas and pork belly. Here is my rating based on five stars: Fish - four stars. nice chunk of lightly breaded/fried ... the sweet/sour pink purple slaw thing on top really added to the flavor. Carnitas - 4 stars. really tasty. They use a crispy pork versus the usual pulled pork. I think I prefer the usual, but it was still good. The best for last - Pork Belly - five stars. I could have eaten 5 of them...perfectly crisp on outside, delicious evil fatty layer...drooling. Figured since I had an hour lunch, I could treat myself to a cocktail too. You cant beat a $3 house margarita! I will definitely be back.
