Great Mexican food with a friendly staff.  Looks small from the outside, but has plenty of room for dine in inside.  Agree that the homemade tortillas are awesome.  Brought some home for my family (as I am GF I couldn't try them, but they reported they were awesome).  They have a great selection of food, my favorite was machaca and eggs.
Just moved to AZ and live in East valley, but am back here everytime I am in area (3xs so far in 2 months).  Highly recommend.
