The best quick Mexican food I have found in the valley. Full stop.

Street tacos? Superb. Burritos? Huge, not greasy, filling. Enchilada sauce? Spicy with just the right amount of bitter. Their selection of meats is more varied than most, and every one I have tried has knocked it out of the park. Their Carne asada is cooked fresh on their full view cast iron grill. Hands down the best green Chile beef I have ever had. Red Chile carnitas. Barbacoa. Tinga chicken. White breast chicken. The hardest part is choosing which one.

Their fillings and toppings, while not great in number makes up in quality. Fresh sour cream, pickled and raw onions, cilatro, corn, amazing guacamole (some of the best non-homemade I've had), along with the requisite beans and rice make a great compliment to the protein offerings.

Last but not least is the salsa bar with 5-6 fresh salsas depending on the day. Hot, medium, mild, Pico, jalapenos, fresh peppers, and what I like to call 'the green stuff'. Very, very hot but don't be afraid of it! Has a creamy hummus-like consistency that adds a potent jalape√±o punch. Tasty. Best of all? I don't feel like I need a shower after scarfing down a burrito here (I'm looking at you Filibertos).

So, yeah, overall I like it a little.
