Go there many times, mostly on the weekends. I have never encountered a problem there and their staff is always nice! There was a time when I was low on cash and didn't realize I didn't have enough money for what I wanted and the cashier helped me out. And usually if you ask for extra sauce at other places they'll give you a mean look. But not here!
