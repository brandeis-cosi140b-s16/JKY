This is a great place to try some traditional Mexican dishes that don't commonly show up on the menu at other Mexican places in the Valley. For example, it's the only place I've seen huitlacoche (or corn smut in English) on the menu, and I am definitely trying that quesadilla next time. The huarache con nopales that I ordered was huge and incredibly filing, stuffed with thin layers of beans and topped with salsa verde, a little bit of lettuce, queso fresco and nopales. If you want to try some authentic Mexican dishes that you won't find at other places, definitely come here.
