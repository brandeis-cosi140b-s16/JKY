My Girlfriend and I decided to venture out for some Mexican after spending a long day in the yard. Something about tacos, horchata, and piles of rice and beans just sounded right, you know? I was perusing yelp for something new and came across this joint - and man was that an awesome find. Seriously, guys. This place is great. I ordered the Carne Asada with Plantains and my Girlfriend ordered 2 chicken tacos. 
The carne asada was flavorful and delicious, the rice and beans tasted fresh and actually had flavor (what!?), and the salad it came with had a ton of avocado and a tasty lime vinaigrette. Then there were the plantains. Normally when you get a side of plantains you get a little lump of them on the side of your plate...not here. I was given two WHOLE plantains that were sliced in half and fried perfectly. They took up half of the plate and they were delicious. As for the tacos, they looked good, they were gigantic, and I was told they tasted very fresh. Also, the horchata was giant sized and delicious. I saved half to drink the next day. Anyway, this place rocked and is currently the only Mexican in town that can compete with Taqueria Guadalajara. Good stuff, man.
