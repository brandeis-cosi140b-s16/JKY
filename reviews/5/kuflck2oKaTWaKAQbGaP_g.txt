We almost turned around & went to another restaurant when we saw that it was just a little hole in the wall in a strip mall. Boy am I GLAD that we didn't! 

I had a chicken salad that was AWESOME! Light & Healthy. And the chips and salsa were DELISH!!! Hubby liked his meal too- tacos I think.

It's inexpensive and the food is GREAT! Just go. You won't regret it
