I love this place! The atmosphere is cool, the food presentation is very powerful and the food is fantastic! I was expecting a regular taco shop, but this is gourmet in every aspect except the price. The servixe, the plating and the food is top notch and the place is just fun to be at. I highly recommend the homemade horchata, and check the specials board for great items that aren't on the menu! I highly recommend El Fish Taco!
