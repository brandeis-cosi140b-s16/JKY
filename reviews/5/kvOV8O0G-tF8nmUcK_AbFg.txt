We are from Portland, Oregon and spent a week in Scottsdale during December 2013.  Of the 7 nights we dinned out, we went to Cien Agaves 4 nights.  Everything is absolutely excellent- including the service, prices and especially the quality of the food and drinks (the Happy Hour food menu and drinks are fantastic!).   The atmosphere and seating offer something for everyone.  Indoors for the music and energy, outdoors for the wonderful desert air and a little more quiet while enjoying the warm heaters.  My only regret:  that Cien Agaves is not in my own city!  Check it out, you won't be disappointed!
