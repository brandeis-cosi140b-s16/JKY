First visit so review is for only one experience. I got the breakfast burrito steak egg and cheese. This is the only "fast food" Mexican restaurant in Arizona that I have been too which uses fresh eggs, not out of a carton so they got an extra star for that. The burrito was good with plenty of meat. The salsa was fresh and the flavor was top notch. I highly recommend the brownish salsa as it pairs with the steak so well. I look forward too more samplings from this place. Restaurant was clean and workers were friendly and for less than 5 bucks a bargain for the size.
