I usually don't review right after the first visit but this place blew me away! I didn't expect my sushi burrito to be that good! I ordered a DIY jaburrito with salmon, ahi tuna, with wasabi mayo (yum!), romaine lettuce, cilantro, and pico de gallo on soy paper: it was delicious! The ingredients were fresh and the burrito wasn't dry like I would expect it would --- for some reason. I think the wasabi mayo did the trick and the rice was cooked perfectly in its sticky sushi rice condition. I can't wait to go back and try their specials!
