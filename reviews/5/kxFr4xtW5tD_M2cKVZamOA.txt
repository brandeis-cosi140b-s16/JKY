I love Manuel's. 

I know that every time I got to Manuel's I'm going to have a good experience. 

I think they have the best cheese enchiladas. Hands down. 

Their chimichangas are so good too. 

I like how they have several locations throughout the Valley and the food is always consistant. 

I've always had great service at Manuel's. The prices are reasonable too. 

I've been a customer for years and that won't be changing anytime soon!
