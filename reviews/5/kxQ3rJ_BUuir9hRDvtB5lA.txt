If your in the mood for real good, but quick, and great tasting mexican food, this is the place to go.  They make the food right in front of you, so you have it within minutes.  They also have seating where you can sit down, but you also have the option of taking it to go.  The pork in my opinion is the best, but the chicken, beef, and shredded beef is great also.  The portions are just right, not to big, but not to small.  I prefer this place over chipotle, any day of the week.
