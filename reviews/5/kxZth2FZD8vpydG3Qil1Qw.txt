I had no idea this place has been here for 9 months already! Walked in, saw an Open Faced Supreme and said, "Wow, look at the size!" A woman at a table said, "...and its really good." She wasn't lying. I ordered it and loved it! Even tried the Horchata drink based on another reviewer's bragging. Loved it! Amazing! 
Will definitely be returning regularly.
