Located a bit passed Eastern and Trop, its right next to an auto parts shop. You'll see the colorful building with "famous Jose" on it. 

Came in on a Saturday lunch hour and there were 2 other parties before us. I noticed only one guy was working the grill and cashier but he was getting food orders quickly and food out to the people. 

I've been here twice and ordered the carne asada torta. The bread was crispy and just enough burnt for me to taste. Usually I don't like the burnt taste but this was the right amount. Inside was carne asada, lettuce, sour cream and tomato. I believe adding avocado is extra. That was the regular and it was $6. 

I still need to try other dishes they have available so I will definitely be back!


Update! 

Had their carne asada nachos one late night! It was muy rica and the customer service was great at 1AM. I advise getting that dish!
