We visit Scottsdale for at least one week every year and for the first time investigated Habanero's. After our visit it will not be our last time eating in this excellent restaurant. Coming from Southern California we are well acquainted with Mexican cuisine, and used to "hole in the wall" or strip mall places. Habanero's is as good or better than anything I've had in the price range. I had the Parrillada combination of meats and all were fantastic. I tried my daughters ground beef burrito and it was very tasty as well. Great food, great value.
