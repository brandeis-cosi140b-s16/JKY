Came in from out if town and tried this out with my best friend. Had the guacamole, so yummy.  We shared the tamales & short rib tacos.  Tamales had a little kick to them and were so delicious.  They had great flavor & portions were good.  Short rib tacos were yummy too. Must have the red sangria! It's infused with Rosemary!!
