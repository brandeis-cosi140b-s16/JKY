A hidden gem.  Without a doubt, the best street tacos in Phoenix.  

 I usually don't go for street tacos because that's just code for baby sized tortillas with skimpy fillings.  Not so!  Small (not tiny) tortillas come loaded with the good stuff.  Fresh toppings and your choice of meats-- asada, carnitas, and many more.  

They do chicken right.  I can't remember the last time I had chicken at a Mexican restaurant that wasn't that plain boiled shredded white meat.  This place serves chicken chunks crisped up on a griddle and lots of seasoning and a hint of lemon.  You can mix and match your tacos, and four tacos makes a big meal.

The burritos have the same meat choices.  Great tortillas again.  Another bonus is that the burros aren't massive- hear me out.  A burro is supposed to be hand-held food.  When it's so overstuff it splits apart or squirts out, you're making eating harded.   These are very well crafted-- good shape, size and ratio.  Not too much tortilla (I'm looking at you Azteca), not too much stuffing (Rito's).  Plus, the price is right you can just get two burros and still be out the door for $10.

The staff is very friendly and accommodating of gringos like myself.  Open late.  Alas, no breakfast burros.
