Love the $1 tacos on Thursdays.  Good food, and the wings alone will make me come back on Wednesdays for Wing Wednesdays.  Genevieve was an outstanding server and the suggestions were spot on - we loved the tacos, and the Pineapple Jalepeno wings had the perfect balance of hot and sweet.  Nice place - kind of trashy (in a good way), and kind of homey - nothing pretentious about the joint.  Love it!!
