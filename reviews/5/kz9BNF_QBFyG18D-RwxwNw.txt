My favorite place to go midday for lunch or happy hour. You can't go wrong with the smoked pork or the carne asada every way the serve it. The signature margarita is totally worth it too. But Brittany real makes the place shine, best bartender in ALL of Phoenix! And she has an amazing magic trick you don't want to miss!
