Love the atmosphere and ambience. Surprisingly downtown Gilbert is popping. This spot in particular seems always packed. Drinks are great. The blood orange and prickly pear margaritas were great. Then for dinner we had some corn appetizer dish which was the highlight of the meal. I'd go back just for that. Dinner was a chilaquille dish and a veg enchilada with green and red sauce. It was good but not the best. I'd give this a 4.5 but I'll round it up. Bc the overall experience
