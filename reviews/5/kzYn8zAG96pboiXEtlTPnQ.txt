We started at the Nacho Daddy's in Henderson and ended up at this location because the one in Henderson had a weird vide to it. We are glad we came to this location instead because it is very lively and it is in the heart of downtown. Ric was our server and he was very attentive and provided great service. We ordered the mango and peach margaritas and were delicious ! The nachos were also amazing! Will be coming back to this location.
