Being from Southern California, I'm extremely picky about my Mexican food. La Palapa is great! I always start with their chips and salsa - and finish with their three enchilada dish. I love that it's BYOB ... And in my taste, white wine tastes best with Mexican food! 

I can't wait to go back ... And maybe one of these days I'll try something new. Their vegetarian soup and fish tacos sound good also!
