I'm always satisfied with their cooking . I always get the bacon breakfast burrito, or the role chicken tacos the meal. I like how they are fast but very officiant . I like to call and place my order in and they always have my order correct. Their food is always fresh . The restaurants appearance and uphold of the store is an overall A . Would chose them over the other Mexican restaurant in southern highlands .
