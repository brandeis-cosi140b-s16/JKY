This place has hands downs the best nachos I've ever had. In fact, some months after I was there the first time they got a mention in Esquire magazine for having nachos among the best in the U.S. 

Like anything else in Vegas these days, it's not cheap. Nachos might run you $18-$20 but it is a huge layered portion that never seems to run out of cheese and fixings. Plenty for two or three people depending on your appetite. I can't speak to any other food in this place, but I go back every time I'm in Vegas for the nachos. They also have a cool bar upstairs overlooking the Strip, so be sure to take a walk up there if you visit.
