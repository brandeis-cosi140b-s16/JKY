Sitara is hands down the best hookah lounge in Las Vegas! Les is the BEST and always so friendly, giving me great bowls to try out and even when I was sick made a bowl for me that legit made me feel better! It was like my mom making me a cup of chicken noodle soup but better! He cares so much about his customers and business and you can definitely tell! I have been going to Sitara, the old location, since I was 18 and I am now 24 so Sitara is home for me and I will always be a loyal customer. If you bring your business here they will make you feel that way as well. They also own house of smokes next door which I recommend you purchasing any of your smoking necessities from as well! I love everyone at Sitara with my whole heart and you will too!! COME CHECK IT OUT YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED!
