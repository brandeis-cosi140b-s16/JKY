Finally made it to the taco stand on a crisp, sunny December day.

YUM!! I had one solitary fish taco as I was running low on cash. But it was worth it. Put on some of their hottest hot sauce (which hit the spot), sat down at one of the tables and waded through the messiness. Consider me converted... I'll be back!
