We went to The Mission on New Year's Eve in advance of a wedding and had a great time.  It's in Old Town Scottsdale in an older building that they have updated.  Has a great feel inside and a nice patio in the front.  I'm not reviewing that though.

Almost every dish we had was fantastic.  We decided to share a bunch of appetizers and entrees among us and the standouts were the Grits (yes, the grits) and the Corn as appetizers.  For entrees, the Chicken was delicious as were all of the tacos.  

The service was very friendly and efficient too.  Highly recommend this place.
