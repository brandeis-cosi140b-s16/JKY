There's something about green chilies.  You could smother a car bumper in roasted green chilies and it would be good.

This place doesn't serve car bumpers, it serves the best New Mexico cuisine in a four-state area.  Don't go here looking for Tex-Mex or Mexican.  Here you'll find only the freshest ingredients creating the freshest and most flavorful meals in town.

I had the chile rellenos and they were incredible.  Nothing here is less than the best and freshest in town.

I'll see you all there, probably next week.
