I had to splurge today....had the taco platter three soft or crunchy your choice of meat I had two with beef and one carne adovada (pork marinated in red chile and slow roasted) creamy refried beans and moist spanish rice. The salsa had a kick that was perfect on everything. Paul sat me as soon as I walked in and provide good suggestions and great service. 
Owners Paul and.Amy.came over to say hello and Jewels.had a great smile for.me on the way out. I.will definitely be back. They serve only certified "Hatch" chile.
