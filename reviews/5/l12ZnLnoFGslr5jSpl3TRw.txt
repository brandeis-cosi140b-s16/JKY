Amazing menu and overall solid execution. Substantial drink list which shows lots of thought was put into it. Not sure if there are any concepts like this that combine the Mexican and Asian cuisine so well.  Attention to detail is apparent. Some of the food may have taken too long to come out, so that might need some oversight. The tortillas for the guac were of inconsistent crunchiness. But that is easy too. The Korean beef tacos and the pork belly ramen were both easily 5 stars. I'll be back.
