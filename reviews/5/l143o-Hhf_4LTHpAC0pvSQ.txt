Honestly some of the best Mexican food I've had and this is from someone that lives in L.A. The service was beyond amazing!! Along with the amazing nachos and burrito!!! Whatever you want on it they will put in it. Luis , Jessica and Joanna really were great!! They provided great service and great at helping us pick out what we wanted. I think this is a MUST GO TO spot when at the MGM ! I can twice in one day that's how good this place was! Portions are BIG!! And they aren't shy when adding Things to your plate! NACHOS ARE A MUST!! And yes they do serve alcohol
