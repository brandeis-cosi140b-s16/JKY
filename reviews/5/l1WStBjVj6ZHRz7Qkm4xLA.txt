First things first, it's a lucha libre wrestling themed taco shop named after one of the famous Luchadors, El Santo.  I mean, their name and theme alone deserves 5 stars.  

I heard there was great Mexican in Phoenix but this place is unreal.  All sort of options for vegans and vegetarians with tacos, burritos, bowls, tostadas, salads, quesadillas...it's endless.   Once you choose what you want, you then have the options of pinto or black beans or a vegetable mix.  I ordered 3 black bean soft tacos with lettuce, cotija, sour cream, guacomole and a bunch of other toppings.  There was definitely a rager happening in my mouth.
