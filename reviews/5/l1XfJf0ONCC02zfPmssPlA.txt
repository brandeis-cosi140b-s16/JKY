This is a nice, cute little mexican style snow cone joint.  That being said, it is literally the best snow cone I've ever had.  Most authentic flavor you will ever find.  

You could tell the owners who work there are super passionate about their product.  The owners are very pleasant, the place was clean and service was great!  I would definitely recommend everyone to visit this place!  You'll be happy you did!
