Awesome tacos for $3 each.  It's a lot larger than I thought so I was pleasantly surprised.  It's a super good deal and it brings authentic flavors, even though it's on a flour tortillas.  (which I would think a lot of people would prefer anyways... especially in the hood that it's in)

Definitely a great place to go daily!
