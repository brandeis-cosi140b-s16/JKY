So, this Fili B's used to be where Big Burrito now is.
The place for the best burritos..
A.K.A. my high school hangout!
You know, the place you & your friends meet up before cruising the night?!

Here's a little hint for y'all..
If you want real Mexican food, the closer you are to Mexico, the better!
