Literally the best "fast food" restaurant I've ever be too. Not just because of the food but the service is outstanding! I've been a regular here for months and never have I come in to someone with a bad attitude. If anyone has complaints about this place it's because they are the type of person to find the littlest flaw in perfection. I literally made this yelp account specifically to write this review. I've worked in fast food and this teams hard work should not go unrecognized. I'll be back next week.
