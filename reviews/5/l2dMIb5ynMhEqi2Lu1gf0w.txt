I love the Prickly Pear!  I was so disappointed when I drove by today to see it was closed.  The food was fabulous; however, after the restaurant next door closed, there was a backed up sewer smell in the restaurant.  We went there several times over a month and could not stay due to the smell.  That may have contributed to the downturn in business that caused the restaurant to close.
