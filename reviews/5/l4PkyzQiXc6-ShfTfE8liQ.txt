After a few bad meals in Scottsdale this week,  we tried this place and we're very happy. 
Loved our waiter, JR,  he was very fun and personable and had great recommdations when I couldn't decide.   We are very particular about our margaritas,  we both got the. Cruz Caddy on the rocks with salt and it was good.   
The salsa is fabulous,  even my 8 year old choked it down.   I was feeling seafood.... Our waiter,  JR, said the Blue seafood enchiladas were one of his favorites,  they did not disappoint.  Anyone can slap enchiladas together,  including my own,  which are rather bland and boring,  but these had tons of amazing flavor in them and I ate the entire plate even though I was stuffed.   My daughter had the kids beef taco,  I was worried since she is used to steak tacos and doesn't eat much.   She ate the whole thing!!!!!!   The husband ordered,  the Cruz Kitchen Signature plate.  Also a recommendation out of his two choices by the waiter,  JR.  The meat was super tender and delicious.   
I was a little leary of the live music when we got there,  but we actually enjoyed it.   Out waiter was very attentative,  which was a nice change from a week of dining out.
