First time here. I have passed this restaurant for years now and I have never ate here. I decides to try it last year after buying a groupon. My groupon expires today just in time before my brothers birthday. Now I have to say it is a nice little cozy place nestled on a corner close to the freeway. Parking is limited. There is a line of spaces in the back of building maybe holds a good to 12 cars against a 3 ft brick wall right by the alley. Don't let the location chase you away.  The building itself is cute lined with arched beautiful windows. When you walk in you can seat yourself someone will come to you and take your order.  The inside is nicely decorated with typical Mexican decor Pancho Villa pictures and all. Not overly done but tastefully done. You will be served fresh hot chips with mmm mmm salsa. I bit spicy maybe for the weak but still full of flavor. We had an excellent waitress and she made sure our basket and salsa was always full along with our drinks. Water is not tap lol so that was nice I was a bit thirsty so didn't mind the refills. We ordered the platter with seafood for 2 you get a salad Mexican potatoes and rice. The platter was abundant with several tasty items sea bass grilled and breaded. Shrimp grilled AND lightly breaded and bacon wrapped and to top off a lobster tail. It truly was alot we definitely could not finish. If you ever are in the area and would like some authentic Mexican dishes stop by Rita's.  The menu will not disappoint anyone there is something for everyone.
