My wife and I went to Juan's while in Vegas for a convention in June of 2015. Wow, talk about a great decision. From the moment we walked in the door to the moment we walked out, the experience was phenomenal. Arguably the best food/service we've ever had. The host was nice when we walked in, the waiter and multiple other waiters/bus boys were attentive and nice the whole time we were there and ALL the food we ordered was great! Their chips, salsa, refried beans and grilled onions with peppers and soup (all are complimentary) were excellent. We had some shrimp ceviche to start and shrimp fajitas for dinner. It was all fantastic. Highly recommend this joint. Food was a 10, service was a 10. No cons to even mention.
