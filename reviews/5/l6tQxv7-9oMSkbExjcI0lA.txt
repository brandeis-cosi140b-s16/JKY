What you put in is what you get out. This place seems to really encapsulate that notion. If you want to spend $20 for two this may rate low....but if you are willing to actually get some drinks, a meal, and stop thinking about the dollar or two difference, please do not hesitate to go here.
      Chips and salsa are delivered instantly - the salsa is a mild with a subtle heat....the chips are warm with a lemon salt (manny's anyone?) plus they have pickled carrots on top!! Love it! Just make sure to move the "pickles" if you don't intend on devouring all of the chips right away.
     My fella and I ordered the traditional lime margaritas on the rocks - the perfect disguise for a decent amount of tequila! Delicious.
    We both ordered skirt steak for the entree...he got the asada and I got the poblano. This was by FAR the best skirt steak I have ever had at a restaurant...the lime marinade came through, perfectly cooked, simply amazing. Seriously, this dish is worth it alone!! The poblano had an incredible amount of scrumptious, melted cheese and the asada had a great splash of guacamole...the tortillas with the entree are also served grilled.

We had a coupon....but this place is worth it...just splurge for the better dishes - it's only a couple bucks and it is oh so worth it!!

*While we did not have dessert the fried ice cream seemed incredibly popular*
