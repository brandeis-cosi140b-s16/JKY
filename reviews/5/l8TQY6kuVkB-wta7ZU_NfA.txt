This place is so cute! Sucks it's summer because their outside patio is adorable. Ordered cheese enchiladas with verde sauce and they were some of the best I've had...according to my taste buds. The rice and beans were super good too, which is rare. Guac is good, nothing too special to be honest...hopefully they work on that. My honey had the fish tacos which were delicious as well! Drinks were yummy and big, so totally worth the price. I think this spot is a gem if your looking for great, not greasy, Mexican food.
