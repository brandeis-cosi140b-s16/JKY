Being from Southern California, we do two things well: Vegan food and Mexican food. Yet, there are surprisingly very few Mexican restaurants that offer vegan options. Pancho's Kitchen has a full menu devoted to just vegan dishes. After being greeted by the friendly young lady at the counter, I opted for the #1 (vegan tamal with rice and beans) and my boyfriend ordered three different tacos with rice and beans. 

Because they were out of avocados for the avocado taco, my boyfriend was trying to choose between the bean taco or the poblano and zucchini taco. She kindly suggested that they could combine the two for him, which was a really nice gesture and just a small taste of the great customer service they displayed. 

As the food came out, everything was hot and meticulously prepared. They put a little bit of vegan pepper jack cheese (Daiya, I believe) on my beans, which is the way I would do it at home as well. The masa encasing my tamal was the most delicious and flavorful I've ever tasted. It was a good size as well and left me feeling content after I finished my plate rather than heavy and sluggish. The young lady helping us said they were her favorite and she wasn't lying, it was the best vegan tamal I've ever had and that's considering my grandma's homemade non-vegan ones I ate back in the day. 

My boyfriend was so pleased with all of his tacos. I gave preference to the potato taco due to the crispness and the amount of cabbage and salsa amassed on top of it, however the other two were just as delicious (especially in regards to the homemade tortillas). 

Too bad this place is not in Southern California. We really lost a good one to Las Vegas' authentic Mexican (and vegan) food scene.
