What a find! We were stopped by the security guard asking us to bag our beers. He was very polite so we decided to go in. We've now eaten there 3 days in a row! Not only is the food cheap, but it tastes great! Everything we try new we like better. And the "flip the sauce" flair is a fun bit to watch. Makes this end of the strip worth a visit.
