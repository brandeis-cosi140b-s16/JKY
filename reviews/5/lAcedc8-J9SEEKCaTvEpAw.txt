This is my favorite new place for Tacos. I'd read a positive review about it in a local publication, but then a friend of mine mentioned it - so I figured I'd give it a shot. I ordered the Carne Asada Taco. I dont know what I was expecting, but this is unlike any other taco I've ever had. It's huge. Initially, I wasn't sure about beans on my taco, but I thought I would try it the way they make it and then decide. Suprisingly, I like the beans.  And the Carne Asada? Most delicious I've ever had. Ever. I found myself tempted to drive back for dinner later that day, if it wasn't so far I may have actually done it.

I've been back two or three times since, each time just as good. On my second trip, I tried the Quesadilla Harina con Carne Asada, which was also very good. Reminds me a lot of these Quesa Tacos I had from a street stand in Mexico.
