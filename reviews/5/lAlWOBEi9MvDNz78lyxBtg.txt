Thank goodness one of my husbands clients told us about this place!! 

No more Chipolte EVER..lol..

Zaba's meat is more fresh & white meat chicken..

They offer brown & white rice.

Also wheat tort or white flour tortilla.

And don't forget the yuuuummmy queso sauce they have! You can add to any burrito, salad.. etc. 

They also sell nachos you can deck out like your salad or burrito :)
