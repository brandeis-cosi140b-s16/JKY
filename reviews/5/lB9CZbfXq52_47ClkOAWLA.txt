I have been going to Carlsbad for years and it is one of my favorite places in the valley. I have read a lot of the reviews and one thing is noticeably absent and that is any  comments on their Tortilla Soup.  It is the best in the valley as far as I am concerned. 

Another thing I have noticed a lot of previous reviews have mentioned is the water feature.  Some like it, some don't.  It may be helpful for some people who have not lived in valley for a long time to know that in it's previous life the building that Carlsbad Tavern now occupies was once a seafood restaurant called Pier De' New Orleans or something like that.  You can vaguely see as you walk into the restaurant the old motif of a seaside pier, and the bow of the boat was the main dining room.  So Carlsbad Tavern inherited the water feature and kept it as part of their dinning experience.  I like it and just wanted to shed some light for anyone who might find it odd or out of place.
