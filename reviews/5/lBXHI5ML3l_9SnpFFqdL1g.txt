Every aspect of my experience at the Taco Guild was amazing! My friend and I were over at the Urban Bean when we realized we wanted dinner. The word Taco caught my eye so we wandered over for some dinner. 

The environment of this place is amazing. Everything is beautiful, I feel like I could look around for hours and hours. All of the plates are from the Salvation Army. It's so fun to see what plate you will get next since they are all mismatched. 

I got the taco plate which was about $10 with the Al Pastor, Urban Bean Coffee Beef, and the Veggie taco. The al pastor taco was extremely flavorful and had very tender pieces of pork-no nasty grizzle. The coffee beef with mango and jicama salsa was wonderful with the contrast of sweet and salty. I especially liked the veggie taco with roasted brussel sprouts, peppers, and mushrooms with hummus. All were very flavorful. The Corn with Habenero Butter was also amazing and flavorful. 

Service was extremely friendly and we never had an empty glass. I can't wait to come back!
