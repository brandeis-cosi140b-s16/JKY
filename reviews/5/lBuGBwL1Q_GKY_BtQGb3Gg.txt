I found this place one day by chance! And loved it! It has the best tacos in town! Luv the meat!! Everywhere i go to get tacos de asada the meat has gross fat on it that i stay chewing for hours (yuck)! The people here are friendly and its super clean. Everyone always asks me where do u eat mexican food at? I cook my own but here it is, the place I luv!  Forget tacos el gordos  that place is gross!! I have to travel but thats ok!
