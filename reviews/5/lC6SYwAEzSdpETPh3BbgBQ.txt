We love this place! The rellenos are great, the pollo asado is great, the fish tacos are wonderful ... it's clean and organized, and the best part? DRIVE THRU!!!

My husband is crazy about the Sonoran Dog. I think he'd eat it every day if he could.
The salsa's homemade too. The only thing we didn't care for was the choco flan. Perhaps we should've eaten it at room temp, but it didn't taste at all like flan.
