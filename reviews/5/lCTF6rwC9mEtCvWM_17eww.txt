This was my first time here.  I remember seeing them at the taco festival last year and thought we'd give them a try.  They're really helpful when picking out what meat you want.  The girl gave us samples of everything to try.  After the fist few I lost track of what's what.  No matter what you get, you can't go wrong!  
The only thing I would say is they need more signs to find them.  I drive down 7th street every day and I had no idea they were here.  I'll definitely be back again!
