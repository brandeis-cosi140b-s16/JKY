Freshly made authentic mexican food, open late. Near the airport. First stop after landing at PHX at 10pm. Ordered three tacos (carne asada, al pastor, and chicken). Each order gives you two tacos, so I had a total of six. Green sauce, red sauce, lime, and cucumbers came with the tacos. They call out the number in spanish, but luckily counting in spanish isn't that hard. I got the horchata but it wasn't well mixed and was powdery at the bottom. Take it to go or eat at the picnic tables. Saw a bunch of Mexican families there during my visit.
