Decided to come here with a few friends after losing horribly at bingo across the street at Red Rock. I didn't know what to expect considering I had gone to this restaurant a few years back when it was located in the Venetian, and received horrible service (and the food wasn't much better.) We sat at the bar and ordered drinks, the bartender was super friendly and our drinks were very strong, but still tasty. We started with chips & salsa and the spicy guacamole. It was a lot spicier than I thought it would be, but it was still pretty good. The boyfriend and I ordered chicken quesadillas to share, they were delicious and it was such a large portion that we couldn't finish it. This place definitely redeemed itself since my last visit, everyone in our group enjoyed their meal and we would definitely come back.
