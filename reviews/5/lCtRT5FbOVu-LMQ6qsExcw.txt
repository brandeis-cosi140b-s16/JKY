I've lived in zona for 1yr & 3mnths down the street from Poliberto's from the 1st day I stepped into this place I've THOROUGHY enjoyed the food! I'm originally from Chicago & GREAT Mexican food is @ the TOP of the list there. I'm impressed with their style of Mexican food (DELISH) they've turned Me on with their take on a few favorites of mine however it's a pleasant change. For awhile this was My 2nd kitchen (lol) I've slowed down ALOT! yet I still have em @ least once a month :-)

My Favorites
Taco Salad
Mini Platter 3tacos, rice beans

it's time for Me to try more items from the menu...peace...
