Great food, TVs with sports and music videos on every single one, live band plays some pretty good music to. Never been there for the nightclub but judging by the atmosphere it seems well worth being there past 11pm...my favorite thing about this place though is that it's UFC friendly. I'd recommend this place to anyone looking for a fun Friday or Saturday night; or a great place to eat on any day of the week.
