I have been to Clamatos La Cruda twice in one week. Need I say more?  I dream about these Clamatos, and their Instagram feed makes only serves to strengthen my obsession!  The staff is super friendly too!  I've had their Clamato that is loaded with fresh shrimp, cucumber, beef jerky and topped with chamoy and tajin. Their shrimp tacos were delicious as well. Can't wait to try their other menu items as it all looks amazing!
