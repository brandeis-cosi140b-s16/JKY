Ummmmmmm....I would give this place a million stars if it would let me.

This place is a family favorite.  Sooooooo yummy.  My parents have been taking us there since I was a baby.  I swear it is the only place they took us out for dinner growing up (well, actually they took us to Ricardo's a couple of times but that place is no mas).  We all love it!

My Dad used to tell my sister and I that we had to have our wedding reception there.  Back then, I was horrified and even cried over it.  Now, I think it is a brilliant idea.  I've never been married but my sister is getting married in October.  Her reception is going to be at The Desert Ridge Marriott---I think she should have gone with Don Jose!

Yeah, it's divey and they don't have limes for the beer but it is the most ultimate, yummy Mexican food on the planet.  The chips and hot sauce are so amazing.  I wish I could hook myself up to an IV of the hot sauce- it is sooooooo yummy!  The enchilada sauce and the beans are also to die for.  Everything in the place is so awesome!

The one thing I am upset about is they took away the orange soda.  I don't know about you but Mexican food and orange soda are the perfect pair to me.  Bring it backkkkk!  :)
