I live 125 miles from Las Vegas, but anytime I'm in town, Frijoles is my first stop!  Everything I've ever tasted there is excellent.  From the basic cheese quesadilla to the carne asada taco "con todo" to the basic rice and beans side, the flavors are authentically Mexican and delicious.  The fresh juices are awesome and made fresh daily.  The folks working there are courteous and professional.  The decor is fresh and modern.  I recommend Frijoles without reservation!
