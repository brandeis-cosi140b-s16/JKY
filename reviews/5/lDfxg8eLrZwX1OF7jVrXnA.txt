I like the Southern California atmosphere.  The staff was friendly and "waited" on us despite the "order, and take a number" style establishment.  All in all it was a good experience, but I wanted the tacos to taste better.  I'm going to give this place another try so I can hopefully bump the rating to four stars.

5/28/13-  I gave this place another try and I am so glad I did.  I had one of the better tasting chicken burritos I have ever had.  I had to bump up the rating from three stars to five because it was so delicious.  The staff was friendly again.  I really hope this business does well enough for a few more locations in the valley.
