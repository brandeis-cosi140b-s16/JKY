I cannot say enough how much I enjoyed my food at this restaurant. I grew up in AZ and am quite picky about my Mexican food and this place impressed me. It's not traditional Sonoran Mexican food, but trust me you won't be disappointed. We started with fresh guacamole, which of course was amazing. I had the carnitas street tacos with rice and beans. This was hands down the BEST most flavorful carnitas I have ever had in my life. So delicious! I'm not usually very impressed with rice and beans, but the flavor infused in these was so good. Just the right amount of spice to give a good amount of heat. I wanted to lick my plate clean! I loved it all. The service was also wonderful, our waiter was awesome. This place is a must try
