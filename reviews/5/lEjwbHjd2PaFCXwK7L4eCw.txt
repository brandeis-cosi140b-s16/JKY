This is bar none my favorite taco shop ever I loved the previous establishment and this new addition is also fantastic!
I love the fish taco and Pastor the most but really you can't go wrong! $1.25 tacos is a great value for the contrast in flavor you receive. $2.00 for the fish is well worth this lovely taco and it delivers with fresh cabbage and the creamy sauce that always makes or breaks a fish taco for me.
The place is a hole in the wall but that just makes the charm of this taco shop that much better IMO.
