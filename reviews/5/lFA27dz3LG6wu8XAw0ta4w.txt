I stopped I stopped into this place on a whim and my tummy walked out happy! I was seated promptly and brought out three types of salsas the green one was the best
It's super spicy! After that I ordered two tacos. My tacos were awesome!! When I eat out I prefer to eat vegan so my tacos included lettuce, tomatoes, onions, refried beans, cilantro and guacamole! If you never been here check it out! Oh and by the way the prices are super reasonable!!!!
