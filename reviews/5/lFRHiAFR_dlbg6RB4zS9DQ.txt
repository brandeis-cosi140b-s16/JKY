Full disclosure: I only ate the deliciousness of Jefe's, I didn't personally interact with any of the employees or go into the restaurant. 

With that being said, YUM! Seriously, sooo good!

My husband went and picked up dinner for us last night while I stayed home with the babe. He came home and told me how friendly everyone there was while we inhaled our food. I could barely pause between bites to answer him. It was SO good. EXACTLY the same as the taco shops in San Diego, which I've missed terribly since we moved away. My husband got the smaller portion of carne asada fries and still had leftovers to take to work with him today. They make high quality food and don't skimp on the good stuff at all. We will DEFINITELY be back!
