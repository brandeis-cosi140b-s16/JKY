This place gets it, not your average taco shop. They serve chips and salsa! The  food is all freshly prepared, the Carme asada was top shelf, the chicken was amazing. I generally will always test a Mexican restaurant by its frijoles. My son got a bean and cheese burrito and my wife and I snaked a couple of bites when he went to get a refill. OMG the best beans I have ever eaten in my life. The tortillas were fresh and the portions were huge. This place is a diamond in the rough!  I will becoming a regular at this joint....superb!
