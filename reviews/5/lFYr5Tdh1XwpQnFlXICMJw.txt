Always can count on delicious food even when I try something new on the menu. My favorites are the chorizo burrito, shrimp taco, vegetables and margaritas! The margaritas are tasty and strong so don't plan on having more than two. 

Service is excellent. I'm a huge fan of the server Ashley- charisma for days!
