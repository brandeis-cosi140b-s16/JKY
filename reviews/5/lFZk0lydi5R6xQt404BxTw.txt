Had to try this restaurant since we LOVE Mexican food and we were very happy. The food is fresh and hot. Salsa is unique, very tasty and the bean dip w chips are awesome. The fideo soup was fun with alphabet pieces (kids will love it)  but has a great flavor. I was pleasantly surprised when our server, Cesar, brought us lightly sautéed onion and jalapeño slices. Very fresh and tasty.  I ordered beef taquitos and my son, Chris, ordered carne asada tacos. Yum to both. Definitely recommend this restaurant. Nice and clean too.

Alan told us about the weekend special that his grandmother makes called Corundas. Gotta try them!!!!
