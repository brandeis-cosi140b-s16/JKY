This place is hands down awesome! 

The salsa they make is really tasty and unique. They have flavors I've never dreamed of like strawberry salsa.  Every time I go there they have something new and exciting to try. 

I've had the tacos and burritos (which were both amazing), but I think the tacos are a little better (plus you get a side of beans which are about as good as you can get anywhere). 

My only complaint is you only get one basket of chips for free and they charge for additional refills. Oh well.
