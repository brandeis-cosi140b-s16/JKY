I. LOVE. THIS. PLACE.

Their carne asada burrito is the best I've had in the valley! I love it that you don't have to pay extra for the guacamole on the burrito!! And they have fantastic pico de gallo as well!

Great for a quick lunch or dinner...and I just realized they serve breakfast too! Breakfast served ALL DAY, at that! My friends even had their wedding rehearsal dinner here 2 years ago! Excellent and efficient service, no long line, happy man at the register...makes for a great place to eat!
