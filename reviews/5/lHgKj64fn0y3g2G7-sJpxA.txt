This is our favorite date night spot. Love the atmosphere and the service is normally wonderful. We prefer to sit outside, but the inside is just as great. I always get the fajitas abd they are definitely big enough to split if you order extra tortillas. Love this place so much! Is a little pricey if you are wanting just a easy night out, but overall one of our favorite places to go in Cave Creek.
