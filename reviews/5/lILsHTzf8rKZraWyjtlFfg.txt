I'm driving around the Carolinas, and I was nursing more than a few hunger pains when I looked this place up. We fed 3 people for under 20$ off the lunch menu, and the service was prompt, friendly, and polite.  The restaurant was clean, kid friendly.  I had the Spinach enchiladas which I promptly inhaled. I decided that I have to leave a review for any other travelers looking for a bite -- stop here!
