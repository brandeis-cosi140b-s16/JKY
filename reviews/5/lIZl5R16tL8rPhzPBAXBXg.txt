I am so glad I went to this place today.  San Francisco has Chinatown and North Beach -- and we've got the town of Guadalupe.  El Yaqui gets 5 stars from me, because having lived in the valley for almost all of my 34 years, this was the best quick Mexican food I've had, period.

I've only been here twice  -- once with my fiancee and once with the whole family.  Both times it was great.  I've had the pleasure of enjoying barbacoa and carne asada burritos.  Damn, they were awesome!  And only $3 each!  Are you kidding me?

This isn't some Filiberto's gritty-meat, dripping with grease burrito, either.  The meat was very tender, the refried beans tasted homemade, the tortillas were tasty.  Delish!

The guacamole is what convinced me this place is the bomb. We ordered a large side of guac, and I have never tasted such a fresh and fruity, bursting with avocado flavor in my life.  I think this recipe is unique to El Yaqui, and it's my new favorite for guac.

We've ventured into Guadalupe occasionally for Farmer's Market produce, but we'll be going back a whole lot more now that we've discovered El Yaqui.  My next Mexican Food mission is San Diego Bay, which is in the same plaza, and I found out is owned by the same family.

So, the service was quick and friendly and there was plenty of seating inside and outside.  If you've never explored Guadalupe, you're missing out.  Start with El Yaqui.  Invest $3 in one of their burritos and let me know what you think.

Just a few final notes:

 -- some really authentic choices on the menu for the adventurous, including beef brain, head meat, and tongue.  Like I said, I went with carne asada and the barbacoa -- which were excellent.

 -- same owner for the last 22 years (her son was working when we went so we got a little of the history)

 -- $3 burritos & tortas; $5 - 7.50 combinations / plates; $3.75 - 5.25 for breakfast with beans and rice;  $2 Flan; $1.50 tamales -- yes El Yaqui has to be the best value around.

 -- Beer is served.

 -- open 7 a.m. to 9 p.m.

 -- you can't see this place from the street -- it's in an enclosed plaza.
