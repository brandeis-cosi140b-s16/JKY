Been here multiple times and as they keep getting busier, the more drinks they come up with. It is family run and you can really tell they all care about the quality of the food because everything I have had so far tastes so great. The omelets are HUGE and fluffy, definitely never had an omelet like this before. You get A LOT of food for the price you pay, WORTH IT! Their chicken mole enchiladas are among the best things they have there, along with the cochinita pibil, carnitas, and one of my favorites, the shrimp platters. Definitely recommend this restaurant to everyone, this is the most authentic tasting Mexican food I have ever had. Been a fan since the first day I stopped by.
