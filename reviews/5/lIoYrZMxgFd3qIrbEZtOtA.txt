Visiting family nearby and did a Yelp search on Mexican restaurant in this area and read the reviews and they were not wrong.  
We were greeted at the door by the manager I assume  and made us felt welcome. Service was excellent from beginning to end, the food was excellent, we ordered the street tacos and chicken enchiladas suizas, the flavor and how the chicken breast was perfectly shredded, no big chunks like in CA.. I ordered the carnitas tacos and sampled the Carne asada and was not disappointed! The poblano rice was perfect and the beans too. Hopefully we would be able to try breakfast on Sunday.
