Literary Mariscos Escondida. Did two loops, because GPS was not cutting it. You do have to keep an eye out as it is tucked away like a hidden gem waiting to be discovered. Oh boy! was it discovered. This place was worth the drive. It was really tasty.  We ordered a tostada each of #4 spicy aguachile camarones and gosh it arrived packed with so much chunky shrimp.   Flavors are on point.  We accompanied our meal with a michelada de corona, that was real good too.

I really just want to get on a plane fly to LV for some not so simple and magical Mexican food and order me a Molcajete de mariscos.  

Service was excellent - these folks really have it going on.  Going back PHO SHO!...LOL!
