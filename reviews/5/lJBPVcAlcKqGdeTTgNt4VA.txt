Went here with my husband for the first time tonight. We were waited on by Julia's granddaughter. She was delightful and gave us samples of everything to try since we were first-timers. I got the street tacos and my husband got a burrito. The standout was the red chili... Delicious. A ton of food for the price. I'm so happy to have found such a gem so close to our house. I see many more tacos in my future.
