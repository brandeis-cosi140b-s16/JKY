Day one fan of Three Amigos, so congrats on their new location! 

Poprock Tonya & I checked on the new digs last night & we had a blast.

While the space is small, much like the Central location, the staff are just as friendly & efficient. 

I had ground beef tacos (that cilantro & onion - owwww!) & a small margarita. The chips & salsa were on point, like always! 

Parking is decent & prices are affordable.
