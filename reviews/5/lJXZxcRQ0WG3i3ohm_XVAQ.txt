Due to business I am a regular to the Champaign-Urbana area,  and this is my go to spot.  Chips are addicting and the salsa is freshly homemade.  There was a recent ownership change, it used to be "Mas Amigos", this change has been to their advantage. It is definitely cleaner and minus a few hip cups in the begin with their staff they seen to have it together now. Food is very cheap, tasty.  

If you want tasty, affordable and Authentic  Mexican food in the Champaign Urbana area this is the place to go.
