Yay Casa Rasta! Again, still on the vegetarian kick and they have THE BEST soy-Chorizo burrito around. They also have a quaint little patio that over looks one of the steepest hills in the United States for driving. The owners are amazingly nice and their food just screams quality to me. If you are in the mood for a good burrito try Casa Rasta out!
