Met a good friend here for lunch today. Really outstanding service! Chips were light & served with a nice tomatillo salsa. I ordered three tacos: the Standard (chicken, guac & a mild aji amarillo), the Crispy Fish (beer-battered fish & slaw), and the Shrimp. So.Good! With three tacos, you get a side, and we both got the Orange-Cucumber salad -- cukes sliced on the diagonal with pepitas. The food enhanced the company, which is always nice. And the restaurant provided a great vantage point to watch a very fast dust storm move in! Will be back.
