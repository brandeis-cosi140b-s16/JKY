I have always loved going to Valle Luna. Its not pretentious, the food is yummy and the drinks are tasty! My fiance' and I go to split appetizers and a few beers every few weeks. And when visitors come in, we take them to Valle Luna for  good time. Plus, the owners are heavily dedicated to their community. I have volunteered with the Fiesta Bowl media committee for years along with one of the owners of the restuarant and know how hard they work to ensure the best experience for customers and best support of their community. Just look at the photos and honors on their lobby walls!  

BTW, they do a lot of fundraisers, and I hope you might be interested in chowing down on a Chimichanga today...to support Cystic Fibrosis. See info below.

WHY:         For more than 25 years, the owners of Valle Luna Mexican Food & Cantinas have believed that you should always give back to the community. According to Bill Riddle, giving back to the community has been something the family has done since the first restaurant opened in 1983.  You can tell by the lobby "walls of fame" that grace each location and include numerous youth sponsorship plaques. In addition Valle Luna has continually supported the many private, non-profit organizations, church groups, educational institutions and sports-related groups in their fundraising endeavors.  Gift certificates are sent out on a regular monthly basis to support their efforts.  To date, more than 6,200 organizations and groups have benefited from Valle Luna's community efforts. 

 

The Riddles also believe that volunteering is another important aspect of giving back.  Both Bill and Janie are active in chamber of commerce organizations (Phoenix, Chandler and North Valley Chamber (formerly Paradise Valley - where Janie was President), Fiesta Bowl, ASU and ASU West (Janie served as Dean's Advisory Board member for the College of Teacher Education and Leadership, National Football Foundation/Valley of the Sun Chapter (Janie is current President and Bill, President Emeritus).  They also serve on the Arizona Licensed Beverage Assoc Board (both) and members of the Arizona Restaurant Assoc.
