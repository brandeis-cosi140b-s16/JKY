I love this spot for breakfast and lunch. It's run by a Mexican family and serves Mexican food, but it's also a great spot for a traditional American breakfast and lunch. I took a family member today who was from out of town and she loved it! We both ordered the French toast breakfast which comes with eggs, bacon or sausage, and chips and salsa. Sounds like a strange combo but I always crave something sweet after eating something salty, so the chips are a great start! After the food came my cousin and I quickly cleared our plates. The French toast is made perfectly here and my bacon was the right amount of crispy. The staff here is very attentive and always made sure we were taken care of. I've been here a few times before and have had some of their Mexican menu items and the cheese burger and all have been very good. This is a great lunch spot if you have multiple people who can't decide on what to eat.
