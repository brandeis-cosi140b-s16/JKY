Charming little restaurant.  Chips and salsa are good and the staff is friendly.  What I'm basing my review on is the amazing tamales.  My family and I are in love with the tamales.  The beef tamales are excellent as are the cheese which come with two different types of chiles in them.  Coming from Southern California I can tell you I've had my share of tamales.  This place is the best.
