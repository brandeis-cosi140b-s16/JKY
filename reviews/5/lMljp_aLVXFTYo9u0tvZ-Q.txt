I walked in at 650pm but they closed at 7pm. I asked can you make 15 Papusas to go is that ok or are you closed they told if you wanna wait about 20 min we can make them for you. I said ok I'll wait talk about great customer service they gave me chips and salsa while I waited this place is great the Papusas were fantastic the best I've had in Vegas probably definitely going back to this place Andale great food and great service it don't get any better.
