Ok I don't know what took us so long to finally try out Salsa Blanca??  I mean we live down the street and commonly ride our beach cruisers to the Starbucks in the parking lot. Well we finally went here yesterday and I was so impressed!

First off it was very clean and the employees were very friendly and inviting.  I prefer places where I can order at the counter and the food is brought out to me. I think my wife and I ordered too much food! She ordered the chimichanga and I had a seafood, chicken, beef enchilada.  I couldn't believe that we were out the door for under $15. When the food came out it was hot and fresh. 

My personal favorite was the seafood enchilada but her chimichanga was dang right amazing too!!

We will be back here! Especially seeing we live so close and the price is amazing. We rode our beach cruisers here for dinner and was a nice was to start working off some of the food that we ate.lol.

But even if I didn't live so close, I would come here. It's just a cheap as Taco Bell but with an authentic comfort Mexican fare.
