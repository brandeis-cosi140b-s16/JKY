Well done! I enjoyed my lunch here yesterday so much! The carnitas and the goat taco were my favorites! The side of beans is absolutely worth ordering. I couldn't finish them but I was able to take them home for a snack and I am so glad I did. This is a great addition to the selection of ethnic food in the city. Clearly,the quality of the food is the first priority. Thank you for a wonderful experience.
