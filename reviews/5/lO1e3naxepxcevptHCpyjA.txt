Wow, I can't believe how bad my first review was! i'm glad I went through to read my past reviews, because this one was way off. Maybe it was my secret plan to keep people from crowding our spot!

We bring everyone here! The tortillas are great, the service is amazing, and I've never had anyone tell me they didn't love it. Their cochata is amazing, and my personal favorite is the vegetarian quesadilla. yum!
