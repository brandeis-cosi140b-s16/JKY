A co-worker of mine recommended this place, so I had to check it out. I was impressed. It is clean, and has a wide variety of choices, yet simple menu. I like that you can choose toppings  such as mango and cucumber. The variety of Chickens (Kung Pao, Teriyaki, etc..) are delicious. The staff is friendly. Recommended :)
