Anticipating a grueling swim team practice in the evening, I went here yesterday afternoon to get a tasty, stick-to-the-ribs lunch. I got two beef red chili tamales and a pumpkin tamale. The beef tamales were scrumptious, as expected. The pumpkin tamale, which I ordered out of curiosity, was excellent! It was rich and just sweet enough to provide a pleasant counterpoint to the savory beef tamales without being dessert-sweet. And for 6 bucks, that lunch sustained me through the afternoon and through the rigorous physical activity of the evening. As I said in my previous review, the Tamale Store is far from where I live, but now more than ever I'm convinced that it's well worth the drive. And I'm planning to get frozen tamales next time so I'll be well-stocked with these tasty treats.
