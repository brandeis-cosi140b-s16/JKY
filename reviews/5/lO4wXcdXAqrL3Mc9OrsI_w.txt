This is a very bright and colorful restaurant that looks great for a party. I visited on a Sunday early evening and ordered take out. I was the only customer in the place. I ordered al pastor tacos, a fish taco and a pollo mole. All were excellent. I hope more people come to this place to keep it alive. I could seriously see having a birthday party here.
