This place has quickly won my heart.  Not easy to do so...ask the ladies. Haha! I've been here a couple times.  I was looking to get a quesadilla.  Never in my life did I think I would be having one of the best steak quesadillas I would ever taste.  Absolutely delicious and flavorful.  Meat was tender and very well spiced.  

On my second visit, I know I needed one of those again, but i decided to add some tacos to the mix.  Couldn't believe how good those shrimp tacos are!! I'm mad as I'm typing this, since I can't just reach over and have another bite! Finished them in record speed! Love the fresh garnishes they throw on top of the tacos, even the corn taco tastes very homemade.  I really enjoy the vibe of this restaurant.  The workers are very cool and laid back, the families that are sitting around you seem very happy with their meals, and the workers do their best to interact with everyone.  Really can't ask for more from an establishment.

They will know me by name soon...thats how frequent I will be visiting this place.
