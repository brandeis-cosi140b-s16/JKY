5 stars for the food! 3 stars for the workers (mainly the young kids).

I am so in love with this place that since they have opened I have already received 2 free meals (they give out punch cards "buy ten get one free")!! I always order the chicken burrito enchilada style. I am a very picky meat eater and I will tell you their chicken is amazing! All white, tender, flavorful, no fat! Portions are huge and you can get in and out of their quick! I actually disagree with a lot of the other reviews indicating that Chipotle is more fresh and tasty! NO WAY. Cafe rio is extremely fresh and WAY BETTER than chipotle! I am a HUGE fan!

My only complaint is that some of the workers behind the bar, mainly the high school kids, either have a bad attitude like they don't feel like working, or plain just don't listen so you end up having to correct them multiple times to get your review right. Their is this one kid their that is in constant super speed mode, which I give him props for but, he doesn't slow down enough to listen and ends up making a lot of mistakes. I am sure this will work itself out once this place isn't newly opened.

Highly recommend!
