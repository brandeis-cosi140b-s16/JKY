Thank God there is finally a Zaba's on my side of town. I used to live over on eastern and st rose and would frequent that zabas and then is closed one day. Utter devastation ensued. Moved to mountains edge and was so delighted to find out that they were opening a new location. I always get a chicken salad and I find myself really enjoying zabas more then chipotle. They have more options for toppings and guac is included with salads for 8 bucks. This place is a great location with outdoor seating and a huge inside dining room. If you're in a rush and don't want to wait in chipotles crazy long lines come to zabas, you won't be disappointed!
