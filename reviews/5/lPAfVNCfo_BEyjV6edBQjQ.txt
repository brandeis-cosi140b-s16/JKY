Good food, always clean, always friendly, and reasonable prices. We frequently come here for some quick good Mexican. It's fast food without feeling like fast food. I've never been disappointed in anything I have ever gotten here. It's all good from the chicken to the shrimp. I would probably even enjoy their veggie options.
