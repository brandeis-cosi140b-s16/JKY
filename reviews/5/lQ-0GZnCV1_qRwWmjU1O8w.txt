Entry 1: waitress is very nice. She told us that the kids cheese pizza is terrible so that is good that the waitress knows what she is talking about. The salsa is spicy. The chips are very fresh and hot.

Entry 2: just got queso. Holy mother of goodness. They also gave us deep fried chips with it and it was awesome. 

Entry 3: the food is here and I want more fajitas. I got some of everything in them and they taste like heaven.
