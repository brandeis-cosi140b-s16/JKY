We went there for the first time Wednesday 9-25-13. It was incredible. My hubby who is 63yrs young said it was the BEST burger he has ever had in his life, and he has eaten quite a few...... I had the breakfast that is served all day and it was perfect. Chips and salsa were our starters with home made to order salsa that will knock your socks off. We will be back for sure and bring friends. YEH!!!!
