I love Julios too!!!!!! The best mexican food around. Free chips and salsa and the Chicken Mini Chimis are to die for. Definitely a must if you haven't tried it.

P.s. writing a bad review about the restaurant for being a dumbass and parking in the parking lot to go out clubbing, resulting in getting towed, isn't the restaurants fault. Follow the parking rules!!
