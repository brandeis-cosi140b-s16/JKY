Love love love Black Chile!  First tried this place out when we got a $20 coupon in the mail.  The chips and salsa were delicious.  I got the chicken tacos which were tasty but it was the rice and beans that really got me, love how they are not your ordinary rice and beans, they were amazing!  My boyfriend got the enchiladas which I had to have a few bites of because they were really good too!  We have already been back a couple times, love having another great restaurant close to home!
