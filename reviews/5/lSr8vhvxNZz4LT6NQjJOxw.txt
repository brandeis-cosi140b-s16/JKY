"DIAMOND IN THE ROUGH" - That's what I have in mind when I first tried this place...

and I KNEW I was RIGHT! (when my mouth was already filled with Carne Asada Fries)

First timer? Don't be intimidated. If you don't know how to speak Spanish, I'm sure you won't even bother worrying about it since their menu is listed at the top and all you need to do is utter your best Latin impression lol

In my opinion, they got the best carne asada fries in the form of "Adobada Fries" found on their menu. They got the best authentic selection of Mexican food. You know its Mexican when El Gordos' parking has a small number of vacant spot than what Del Taco has on the other side lol.

Their $2.00 plate is good too! I haven't tried their Quesadillas yet but I will after this review. I will update you how that turn out for me.
