Carne asada burrito was no joke y'all. Oooweee!! :) Why get one here, instead of somewhere else, you may ask? Well, whatever they did to the tortilla my perfectly cooked carne asada was on made it distinctive and amazing, and to be more specific, there was just the perfect balance between softness and texture-something I would usually only expect when eating cake. 

I've been meaning to write about this place and just got around to it today. There are so many other food items here that are delightful also, and since they open at 7 am, it would behoove you to visit in the morning and try their breakfast burritos one day. They are only open from 7 am-2pm, and that "only" I throw out there is by no means a passive aggressive complaint; rather, I only want to to give you a heads up," and mention that this place does more business than places twice the size. This shows these folks know what they are doing. Its been around for decades and is a local staple for sure. Start your weekend off with breakfast here if you are in Chandler. Its comfortable and nice inside too!
