I love this place. Food comes out fresh and hot. I also appreciate that most foods are not over salted. The portions are big. The tortilla soup is great but it's a bit salty for me so I have to water it down a bit. When I get home, I add some rice and more water and I can get another two servings out of it. :) I also love the live mariachi band on the weekends. My kids have a ball there.
