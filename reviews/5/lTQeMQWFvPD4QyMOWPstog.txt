I really enjoy this place, and have made it almost a weekly lunch spot since I work close by. 

The food is awesome and the service is impeccable. 

I will agree with some of the other reviewers that the chips are not the greatest, but I'd rather have a good meal then good chips any day. 

The Basa filet and albondigas are staples for me. But the beef tongue tacos are excellent as well.
