One word - GUACAMOLE. So fresh and light and delicious, it goes perfectly with the fresh, salty tortilla chips. Make sure you try the salsas, too. Served in a squeeze bottle (sounds weird, but it works!), they are so flavorful and unique that you may find yourself running out by the end of the meal.

The menu is relatively small, but if you are in the mood for unique and flavorful tacos, this is a perfect spot. And since the menu is smaller, you can be assured that everything on it is the best possible quality. Try everything at least once - you won't be disappointed!
