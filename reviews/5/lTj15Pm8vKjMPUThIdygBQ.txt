Great fun and friendly atmosphere!! Sorry the last reviewer was unimpressed, my experience was 1000% better, very attentive servers, great food! My server was excellent, Tabitha was on the ball and never dropped it!! I'll be back and bring friends!! I recommend the Quesadilla Burger, Wings and margaritas!! 43 Tequila's to choose from is icing on the cake!!
