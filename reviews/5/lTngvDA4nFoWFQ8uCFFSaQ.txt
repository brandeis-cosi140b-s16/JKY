I cannot stress enough how much I love this location. Even at its busiest, they are always quick, clean and courteous, and have never gotten an order incorrect. 

I went in today for a quick take-out lunch. I luckily completely missed a line, and had a new guy make my soft tacos. He was a bit slower than usual, but there was no rush. I could tell he was learning as he did not know how to fold up my tacos to-go, but a supervisor taught him quickly. I was out the door in 5 minutes. 

The best part about this location is that as a UNLV student, they give you a free drink with your order. Who doesn't like free? This is a great spot for vegetarians and vegans alike and the price is just right for the amount of food given (which is A LOT). An entire meal for $6 is not bad at all, and the service is always great. This Chipotle location is definitely my favorite.
