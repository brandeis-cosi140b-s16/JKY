Great Food! You must have the brunch. It's a great experience, many flavors. Beware you can oveate, everything is so delicious you just want to keep trying new dishes. 

I had a great experience. All waiters were very attentive. Tamera W. You rock. Great suggestions and great service. 

Definately coming back!
