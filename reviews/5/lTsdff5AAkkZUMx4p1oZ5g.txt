Came here with my family for Mother's Day and it was perfect! The portions were excellent, food was great, and the server was very friendly. A unique take on Mexican food that blew me away! Very intimate setting and great atmosphere. Highly recommend the shrimp tacos and the green salsa mmmmmmmmmmm!
