We eat at Los Taquitos once  a week! I always get the same thing...3 shrimp street tacos, hold the pico. They are so fresh and full of flavor. The shrimpys have perfect grill marks on them. My husband gets the street tacos, but loads up on the meat ones...pollo, asada, barbacoa and carnitas and he devours them. The verde and red salsas that we pour onto each taco have a kick and great flavor. Don't pass on a Happy Hour margarita while you're there either. For $4.00, you get one of the best margs of your life. They are from scratch and contain zero artificial sweeteners or nasty sweet & sour mix. 

My only complaint so far is weak guacamole. It makes me sad to type that, but it's true. The guac is kind of watery and flavorless. If they would improve the guac, this place could take over the world.
