Love this place. My wife and I eat here all of the time. The tacos are my usual with rice and black beans. Today though I had the red chili chicken enchiladas and was blown away. Absolutely amazing flavor and a huge portion. I took half home for lunch tomorrow. There are two huge patios with heaters for the winter and misters for the summer.
