I am from Dallas, Texas transplanted to the Charlotte, North Carolina area. As an aficionado of Mexican cuisine, Azteca Family Restaurant Is the BEST Mexican food I have EVER had. You won't find your palate wanting when you eat here. The service is excellent and the management is second to none. 

Five-out-of-five stars, Azteca Family Restaurant is a six.
