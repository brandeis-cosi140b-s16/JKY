Canonita gets five stars because of the great food, cocktails and the gorgeous view from the tables!  I have been to Canonita each time I've visited Vegas.  It is conveniently located along the Venetian Canal.  I love having my meal at the tables along the water and watching the people on their Gondola rides.  It's an excellent spot to listen to them sing their beautiful Italian songs.

I always order the Queso Fundido as my appetizer.  Their homemade Guacamole is in a league of its own.  My favorite entree is the Pork Barbacoa tacos.  The pork is slow cooked inside a banana leaf.  The rice and beans are excellent.  Canonita also makes excellent margaritas.  They have a $5 margarita special around happy hour.

The service is wonderful.  The servers are always very friendly and attentive.  They don't mind if you just sit and watch the canal after your meal is done.  It's a great place to stop for lunch during a day of shopping!
