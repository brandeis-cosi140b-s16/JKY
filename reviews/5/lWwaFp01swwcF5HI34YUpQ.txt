THE...........FREEKING...........BOMB

2nd visit here today. Carne Asada burrito with just guac and pico.
It was about the size of a football and I ate EVERY.......LAST.........BITE.
If you're near here and looking for food, breakfast, lunch or dinner.....go here.
Girl friend doesn't know what she wants to eat? Go here.

Out of all the "Berto's" in AZ, this is by far the best one.
