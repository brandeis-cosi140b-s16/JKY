Want an awesome breakfast burrito? Come here. 

Everyone was really nice and the service was quick. The girl at the front assumed we were new and then offered us chips and salsa for free!

Everything tasted super fresh, baked right in the back. From the chips and salsa to our massive burritos, it certainly didn't disappoint. This place is worth coming to if you're desiring a burrito or simply some great food. 
Thanks for being local & fresh!
