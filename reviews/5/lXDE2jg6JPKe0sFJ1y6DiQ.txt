Went here on a recommendation from a friend that lives in Buckeye. I was visiting from Cleveland. We have no New Mexican style restaurants in Cleveland. I will take this one home any day. All five in our group really enjoyed the food. It was nice to finally have heat without having to add it. The red salsa was awesome. Runny-nose goodness. I will definitely come back here the next time I visit the Phoenix area.
