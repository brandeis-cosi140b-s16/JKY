Absolutely AMAZING service!! The food was excellent...especially the fresh guacamole!!! My boyfriend told our server that it was my birthday. At the end of our delicious meal they placed a humongous sombrero on top of my head and the servers and the mariachi band sung a version of "happy birthday to you". Then they brought me a shot of tequila and a few of the best tasting churros I've ever had in my life!! It was such a wonderful experience!! We will definitely be back!!
