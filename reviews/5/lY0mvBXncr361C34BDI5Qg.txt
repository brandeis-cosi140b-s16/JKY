We had a great experience with our "to-go" order this afternoon.  The manager, Sam, was very helpful and enthusiastic.  His store was neat and clean and the employees were friendly.  It is nice to see someone excited about the company they work for and proud of the product they serve.  Our meal was excellent too!
