Seriously good food. The breakfast for two was jam packed with deliciousness. Mexican breakfast delights to please!  You will not hungry. You might be able to share among three people depending how much you eat. Coffee is good but gets cold quick. They need cafe de olla added to the menu.  Service was extremely catering, general manager sat us near TVs playing Jets game, he saw our Jets shirts .  He had a layout of TVs and what on...nice touch.  Walked us to our table and made sure we were okay or would have moved us. Music is diverse. Each song changes to a new genre, from Spanish to Billboard to Classic Rock. Wall decor and chandeliers are ethically chic.  We came for breakfast. TVs everywhere but it doesn't feel like a sports bar. They had a DJ station.  Definitely worth trying.  The couple from Brooklyn sitting near our table came back to eat today after eating here yesterday.
