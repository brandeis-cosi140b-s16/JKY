A Mexican restaurant inside a gas station? Why yes!!! Don't let the location stop you from trying this place... This is some of the best authentic homemade Mexican food you can get! 

We have visited here many times and have never been disappointed with anything we have ordered. My favorite, by far, is the Navajo taco with half green & half red! The carne asada burrito is also fantastic! Everything is fresh and made to order. 

The owner, Dave, and his wife are always manning the counter and are so friendly and welcoming! 

Maganas is now one of our favorite go to Mexican places, we have only been there for lunch and dinner but looking forward for trying out their breakfast items! So happy we stumbled on this delicious diamond!
