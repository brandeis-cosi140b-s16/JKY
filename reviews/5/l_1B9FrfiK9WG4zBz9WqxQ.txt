Hot damn! They finally moved north! Came for lunch on opening day. Same great Sonoran dogs as the Tucson locations. This one is a little bigger than the ones in Tucson. Easy access right off I-10.

About the only negative I can think of is they don't have a digital display of which orders are ready like the Oracle location, and the loudspeaker is hard to hear because it echos throughout the building. So pay very close attention when you're waiting for your order.

I'm gonna get fat real quick :-)
