I must admit that the only item I get here is the Carnitas burrito with everything. I simply love this burrito and this location makes it tasty regularly. The carnitas are shredded and mix well with the guacamole, the whole burrito just melts in your mouth. It is not a fat free choice, however, if you love yourself, you should try it too. I am also nuts for their pickled carrots and the red smoked chili sauce. The only way to make the experience better is with a cold Budlight. They do not sell beer, so you'll have to do with a Jarritos soda.
