Brunch surprise!

Say what you will about the sad Phoenix scene but on a recent visit, my boyfriend and I were treated to what was probably the most delightful Sunday brunch I've ever had!

We weren't aware of the Iron Chef connection when we decided to try this hidden Scottsdale gem--their online menu attracted us. It did help that the weather was perfect for outdoor dining, and also that their beautiful color scheme and local art collection stimulated our senses. But when I tasted their blood orange margarita, I almost shit myself. Unbelievable. Bloody-orangey to-the-max. Their spicy-ass agave syrup was like, "You've never had agave like this before. Have you? What." Not to be believed. I had two. 

Then we got served their guac and chips. Simply delicious. Fresh, tangy, salty, and mildly spicy.

The piéce de résistance was their trés leches French toast. You fuckin heard me; the best hi-calorie dessert ever, fused with the best hi-carb breakfast ever, baked to perfection. Shit was like magic and I snorted it clean off the plate. 

I'm still not sure why there wasn't a line to get into Distrito but it's probably the only reason I would ever think to revisit the Phoenix area (sorry, desert rats).

Do yourself a favor and try it out. The prices are reasonable and the parking's free (ignore the stupid-ass hotel valet who'll try to convince you otherwise).
