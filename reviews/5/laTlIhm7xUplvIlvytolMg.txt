This is hands down my favorite place to get a breakfast burrito since I've moved to Las Vegas in 2004. I'm originally from Los Angeles where all the best Mexican food is made but have been unable to find anything remotely close to it here in Vegas. I've found this place as it's not too far from my office and went there one day. 

I've ordered a chorizo burrito with no cheese (no clue if it has cheese. Just everything I order, I must specify "no cheese" because I don't like cheese on anything). It took a while for it to be made but once it came out with a side of hot salsa, it was perfection. It was a nice size and perfect price (I believe it's $4.85... I don't pay too much attention as I usually pay $6 to include a tip).

Since then, I've gotten a copy of their business card and learn if I want a burrito, I call ahead and pick it up 10 minutes after I placed my order so I'm not waiting there too long. After reading the reviews from others, I will try their lunch burrito to see if it's just as good.
