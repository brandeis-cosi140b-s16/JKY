Fish tacos on corn tortillas here are even better when you take them home and nuke them in the microwave for 1 minute. At $2 each, they are entirely a deal and good for you, as they offer cabbage, rice, beans, cilantro, cheese (just a little), a baked white fish with a little yummy sauce.

I too thought the banana walnut bread was memorable, also at $2 per slice.

Woman-owned business is an additional plus!
