Awesome service and even better food! The waiter was very attentive and helpful. The dishes are huge! I ended up getting chicken and beef enchiladas and they were very good even though I wish they had a little more meat in them but they were cooked perfectly. The beans and rice are awesome! They turned out to be my favorite part of the meal.
