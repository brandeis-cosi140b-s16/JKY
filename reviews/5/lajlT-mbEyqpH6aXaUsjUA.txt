When I first saw that KoMex was opening I had recently had my fill of Korean/Mexican fusion on some trips to LA and didn't think highly enough of the area KoMex is in to want to run out and try if...my bad!  After reading some reviews on Yelp I went to try it out and it is absolutely wonderful.  I have gone a few times now with friends each time so that we could share and I love all the fusion items! 

Come here with someone else, share a larger item like a burrito, chimichanga, tostada, or enchiladas (whatever you normally would get at a Mexican place) and then have a few tacos for yourself!

The prices here are amazing...especially for the portions!

I also need to give some love to the fish taco.  Not a fusion dish like the others I mentioned on the review, but incredible!    They also have a menu full of non fusion items...but I have not tried them...I asked the waitress what I needed to try and she went right to pointing out the fusion items.

The beef and the pork hold the Korean marinades the best!
