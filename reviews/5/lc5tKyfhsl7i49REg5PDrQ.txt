The manager is one of the nicest guys who really cares about his business. I remember visiting a few times before they moved locations and it was good but now they're even better. Hookah is great; $12-$20. Drinks are just as good! Especially on Thursdays . I haven't tried the food but it smells amazing! 

I like the fact that, they know when they're getting at capacity and put a hold on letting people in. It's always a good time.

One thing I have to put a little damper on is one bartender/waitress. She never looks friendly and seems like she always has an attitude. Put a smile on, you'll feel a lot better. 

Other than that, Sitara-- you go boooy!
