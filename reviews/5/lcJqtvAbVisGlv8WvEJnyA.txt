I read a lot of the reviews and I have to say I understand why most of you don't like it. Some of you even state you never been to mexico so do not know what to expect.... Well as a mexican, I can say I was pretty impressed with my meal from here. Went with my wife and inlaws and we all tried a little of each others food and I enjoyed everything we had.... Some one mentioned the chips being in a hotdog basket... Agreed, they need to get a big bowl for those. But for most places here in AZ we end up with Santa fe style food and covered with cilantro to mask bad meat.... This place did not do that to my food.... I hope they make it, would enjoy going again.
