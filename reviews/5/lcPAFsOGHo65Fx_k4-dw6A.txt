I was super excited to try this taco joint since they opened, so finally today I got my chance. I was overwhelmed by all the choices they had. I stuck to the al pastor( marinated pork)mon-thurs they have a 3 soft shell tacos ur choice of meat, drink and refrained beans and chips for about $6.  Which I thought was a great deal. And I love the fact they are open 24 hours, and only a short distance from my house. I will be coming back... Maybe for dinner tonight, or breakfast tmw... Chorizo and huevos yummy...
