Service was friendly and pretty timely for a busy Friday night.  The food was delicious.  A mountain of meats, spices, Veges, and yumminess.  So filling even having split the el Rey.  The mango crema drink may have added a bit to the fullness effect.  My 13 yo daughter asked why all the waitresses were so pretty.  "it's their thing"... They run a swift machine and they do it well
