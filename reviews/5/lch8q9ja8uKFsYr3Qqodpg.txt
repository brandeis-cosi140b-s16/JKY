Amazing food, I had the three street tacos plate with rice and beans. The rice and beans are some of the best I've ever had. I had Tinga, Al Pastor and carne asada tacos and they all were delicious. Salsa bar is also great and it has a wide variety of options. Definitely recommend this place when in the area.
