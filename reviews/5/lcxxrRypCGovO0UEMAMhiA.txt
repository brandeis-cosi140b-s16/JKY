Viva chica loca!  
I have been looking all over Pittsburgh for decent mexican food since I moved here from Dallas 8 months ago.  I'm happy to say Chica Loca is not just decent but EXCELLENT!  I work up the street and just found my new favorite lunch spot.  The decorations are cute, bright, and colorful. The service is friendly and prompt.  And the food is SO GOOD.  The tacos taste like the ones I used to get from the authentic Mexican markets in Dallas.  For the chips, I have only 3 words: nom, nom, nom.
