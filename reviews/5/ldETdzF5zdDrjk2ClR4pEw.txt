This was very good Mexican food. I bought the yelp deal and I was so glad I did. The service was fast and friendly. We ordered chicken nachos for an appetizer and they were excellent. Also, the chips and salsa here are amazing. I had the chicken enchiladas for dinner and they were very good. They came with rice and beans which were also yummy. My husband had the pork thing, and the pork was so well seasoned. Everything was delicious and we eat quite a bit of Mexican food. This place was great! Also, the prices are so reasonable. And what really made our evening was the server. He was great, and he was so funny. He had us laughing multiple times. Thank you!
