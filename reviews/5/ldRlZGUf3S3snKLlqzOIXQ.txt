I'm not sure why this place doesn't have 5 stars???!!!  

The Mini Chimis are wonderful with the cream cheese Jalapeno dip.  
Tacos are always right on. 
And who can resist the $2.50 Margaritas???
Staff is always helpful. 
Only thing I would change is the staff should check on you if you need more chips and salsa :)
