My girlfriend and I love to go to Arriba whenever we feel like we want to go out to eat and don't want to take a chance on the food being subpar.  

This past weekend not only was the food delicious, but additionally the service we received exceeded outstanding.

My mother had bought us a 40$ gift card for a date night out, and upon arriving to the restaurant we asked the waitress to check the amount of money that was on the gift card. After checking she returned telling us that the card had never been loaded, and was thus empty. I called my mother to see if she still had her receipt, which she did. She proceeded to call the restaurant and talk to the new general manager, Dan, who was kind and generous to all of her inquiries. He recognized that a mistake had been made and comped our entire meal, as well as giving us the number of the card that was supposed to have to original 40$ on it. 

The food was spectacular as always, and will Dan's intervention the meal was a complete success, I cannnot wait to return to this location as I'm sure we will have an amazing time.
