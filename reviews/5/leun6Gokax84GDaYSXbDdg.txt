This place is a hidden gem lol, everything about this place is fantastic! bean and cheese, fajitas, rolled tacos to even menudo 
and that's a tricky one. All the items taste so fresh and flavorful. The guacamole is homemade and is on point, I love places where you can taste the passion in the food, this place is a gotta try for anyone that hasn't. :)
