In terms of value this is my favourite restaurant in Vegas. The best tacos Ive ever had for $2 a pop. I would definitely recommend the Adobada tacos with everything on them, but its hard to go wrong with anything on the menu.

Some downsides are that El Gordos always seems busy and it is probably not the most efficient ordering experience if you want multiple kinds of tacos given that there are separate lines depending on what you are ordering. If you are going as a couple or as a group I would suggest coordinating your order and splitting up amongst the lines. 

Even with the downsides the tacos are always worth it though. Just a fantastic, genuine, taco shop with no frills. Tacos El Gordo is a must eat for me whenever I'm in Vegas. Perfect for lunch or post Vegas shenanigans late night eats.
