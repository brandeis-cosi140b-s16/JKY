tacos el gordo aka the holy grail of tacos. I mean it does not get better than this. One day..I am going to get something here other than tacos. but everytime I come, the adobada with pineapple keeps calling my name.  It's just good I mean theres no other way to put it. I also like the cabeza and suadero. Every now and then I mix it up but I always get, atleast one of each;  adobada and buche. buche is well cooked, the taste is different from others I had, for some reason I like this much better than anyone else's. Even though I rave about the adobada, I have to say it's 2nd to another taco place in town...but..hey  they're open late, fairly priced, you cannot go wrong here. this is one of the places you must try before you die. no other way to put it.
