Great authentic mexican.  First time here and was very impressed.  A simple restaurant,  not very fancy decor,  service was very good and the food was fantastic.  They offer many dishes that you will not find in your traditional American Mexican restaurant. 

I asked the waitress to pick an appetizer and a main dish for me.  I really do not know what either was but both were extremely good.  

I would recommend being adventurous and trying something new.
