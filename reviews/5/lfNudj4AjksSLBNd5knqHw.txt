Talk about a hidden gem. Apache is not usually the first place I think about when looking for a place to eat, but Guerreo's may have just changed that. Apparently it's been there for years, who knew! It's one of those places you'll drive by a million times (at least I did) but it's worth stopping by at least once.

The boyfriend and I went here on a Saturday for lunch. The place is tiny (like 3 tables inside tiny) but we were the only ones there so it was not an issue. The guy behind the counter was friendly in an old-guy-who's-been-there-forever-and-you-look-forward-to-seeing kinda way. I ordered a beef tamale and a cheese enchilada. Now I'm totally serious you guys, this was the BEST enchilada I have ever eaten and I don't even like raw onions (was not expecting those). I don't know why it was so good but it was AH-MAZ-ING. I'm craving it now just writing about it. The tamale was good too but majorly overshadowed by the enchilada's awesomeness. 

This place is cheap, friendly, and downright delicious. They do close early (7pm) so make sure you go in time, you won't regret it.
