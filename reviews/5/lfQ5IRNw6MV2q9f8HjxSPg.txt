I have been OBSESSED with Cabo Fish Taco lately! I randomly get a hankering for cool, fresh, fish tacos and my brain immediately screams "Cabo!". Usually, I answer it and head to NODA where I can munch on tacos and hot crab dip. 

The service is always on point here. I even once had a server plug up my dying iPhone by the server stand so I could keep an eye on work things over dinner. I tried to offer her $5 for charging my phone even though we had moved to a different server's section and she refused to take it! Good peeps over there.

The decor and vibe of Cabo is very NODA-esque and fun. It reminds me of grabbing a bite to eat at a restaurant in Florida after a long day on the beach. The patio can seat quite a few people and is good for some interesting people-watching! There are also TV's at the bar if you don't want to miss a game. 

Cabo has an extensive margarita menu and a decent beer selection as well. But the best thing about this pace is the delicious food. You just can't go wrong with any taco you order from the menu. I think their Taveroo (sp?) and Blackened Mahi might be the best, though. :) Every table receives fresh corn salsa and chips before their meal and I always end up filling up on that stuff too early because it's so dang good! The food always tastes so fresh and is packed with delicious flavor. I've never had anything bad here, nor had a bad experience. I love this place and it's a no-brainer for the summer!
