This is def as good as it gets in Vegas... Came here for the first time with my bff last night and we loved it! Great food, good service, cool and clean atmosphere! I am in love with the Al Pastor tacos. Also tried their horchata, Barbacoa taco and elote... Everything was indeed yummy. Got some to go for my husband: lengua, asada, barbacoa and al pastor tacos and he was feeling em too! Interested in trying out their burritos next time. This is seriously our new spot!
