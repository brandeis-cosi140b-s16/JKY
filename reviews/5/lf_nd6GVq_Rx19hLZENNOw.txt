My husband and I moved to Phoenix from San Diego a little over a year ago.  We searched for months for a Mexican restaurant to satisfy our cravings for GOOD mexican food.  Luckily we found El Conquistador and have never gone anywhere else.  We go here every week and cannot recommend this place enough!  The salsa is delicious and the enchiladas verdes (I prefer the cheese or chicken) are absolutely the BEST I have ever had, ever.  I wish I could give this place TEN stars.  Try El Conquistador, I guarantee that you will be back time and time again.
