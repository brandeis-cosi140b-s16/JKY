Honestly I think this is the best kept secret in Phoenix. I'm sorry but this hood is rough, but Mary's is is no short of a diamond in the rough. I'm sure I sound like a family member or something but I am really just a fat boy that likes good food and works near by. The pupusas are amazing, green chili burro is top notch and if you are in the mood for breakfast try the chilaquilas. You won't be disappointed.
