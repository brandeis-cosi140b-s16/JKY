Hidden gem this side of the border.  Lunch is very yummy. We've eaten here several times and never disappointed. They are open for breakfast, lunch & dinner. Breakfast burritos are wonderful. I recommend the chorizo burrito, although all are delicious. The entire menu is wonderful and their homemade salsas compliment the fare.  The owner is super cool and always makes people feel right at home!
