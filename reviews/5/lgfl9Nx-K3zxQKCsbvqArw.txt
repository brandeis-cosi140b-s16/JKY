Coming from the east coast and having the experience of living in NYC, the land of food trucks and ethnic food, this place hit the spot!

 i had the carne asada, it seemed pretty fresh to me, but damn it was spicy too..im not sure if it was the salsa verde or the meat that was spicy..

i loved the old school, mexican cross southern california feel inside.

Strong accents but that didnt stop me from ordering. i'll be back to try the tamale and their rice and beans among others :)
