I've been here several times, both dining in and taking out.  I've never had a bad experience and have never disliked anything I ordered.
Staff is friendly, music is rockin and upbeat.  Food is really good.  My only bummer was not being able to have a Mexican Coke earlier because they were sold out.  Otherwise...Bueno for Bueno Burger!
