Seafood enchiladas in North Scottsdale? Say yes and don't look back! The Enchilada de Mariscos here is comprised of seared shrimp, blue crab, cheddar and monterey jack cheeses, rice and orange pico. And, it's 100% delicious. Be sure to order the guacamole appetizer too. The chips are addicting. Maybe the reason why the location is so far from town is so that you have time to digest on the car ride home. With the 2014 Opentable Diner's Choice award, you can't go wrong.
