Came here for a second try since the first one was so good. The results were the same. I really love the food here. I had the Ropa Viejas and red beans, which was excellant. Could have used a little more in the bowl, but nonetheless, I loved it. It seems there are so few opportunities to dine out without it being a chains, and this is one worth trying out. I really need to eat here more often.
