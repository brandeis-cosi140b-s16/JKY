I love this place! It's not your average Mexican American food. The price is cheap and quality is wonderful. Although the menu is minimal, tacos, burritos, enchiladas, and the soup are my top picks. The soup is only available certain days, so if you enjoy real mexican food...I suggest to try this place.  If not, then please enjoy your Chipotle!
