Hubby and I live within walking distance and one of the reasons we bought a house where we did was because we could walk to Chuy's.  It's super casual and cool.  Super cheap and very, very good and fast.  We have not eaten anything at Chuy's we didn't like.  We have had the tri-tip plater, the california tacos, the tri-tip salad, the baja chicken salad, Chuys' famous chicken salad, the burgers & fries, etc, etc.  EVERYTHING is good, fresh, not greasy, and amazing.  The booths are in a bit of disrepair, but still comfy.  Not always the cleanest place in the world, but the pitchers are cheap, the food is delicious.  Love the casual, creative, and funky atmosphere.  We are originally from CA and take everyone who visits us here because it's soo good and fun.  Want a cheap, fast, great tasting meal?  Eat at Chuy's.
