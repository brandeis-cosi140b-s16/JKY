This place is excellent! We had friends visiting from out of town and we decided to try out Leticia's, as we were all craving Mexican food. This place did not disappoint. There were nine of us. Despite the fact that they were very busy, we were able to be seated after only a short wait. The staff was terrific. They were friendly and attentive. Not only did our server make sure our needs were met but two other gentelmen came over to make sure everything was to our liking. I spilled my iced tea and someone was at my side as soon as it happened, helping to wipe up the mess. She was really nice about it and within 60 seconds, it was cleaned up and I had a fresh glass of tea. It was as if it had never happened. We were there on their karaoke night and that was a lot of fun. We've decided that we'll always try to go there on karaoke night. Most importantly, the food was delicious. The portions were just right and everything tasted perfect. I'm really excited that we finally tried this place. We're from out of state and there is a Mexican restaurant back home that I miss all the time. This place totally helps fill that void.
