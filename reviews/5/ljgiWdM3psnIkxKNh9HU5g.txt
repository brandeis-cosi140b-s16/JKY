Come on people, it's chipotle..one of the rare places no matter where in US that never disappoints you. Steak fajita rice bowl with extra rice, extra steak, extra pepper and onions,guac, pico de gallo, hot salsa, cheese and a tortilla in the side, best meal you could ever have, the best 10 bucks you could ever spend. There's In n out for burgers and there's Chipotle for burritos. Thats how good they are
