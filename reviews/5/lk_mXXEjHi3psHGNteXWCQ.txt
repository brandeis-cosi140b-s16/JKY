First time here. This place was amazing!  Nice outdoor setting.  Colored lighting for a fun atmosphere.  I choose to sit at the high style bar tables.  Nice to be able to look straight into your waiters face.  Didn't get a chance to see inside the rest of the place.  My husband had a Margarita and traditional Chile Relleno and Chicken, cranberry and spice Relleno.  I had the appetizer mini taco combo.  Hibiscus, Chicken and pork with spices and raisin (I think).  It's a must go to place to eat whether you live there or just visiting.  Will go back if we get a chance.
