Molly's Tamales is a modest little shop that sells wonderful Tamales...and that's not all, Chili Rellanos and Enchilladas are also available but for some reason, there is no menu  and the only thing on the wall menu behind the counter is Tamales.  Still I had two encilladas(cheese) and a tamale (chicken and cheese) .  I skipped the rice and beans....rice and beans is everywhere. What I did have was  wonderful. The other customers who were there swore that everything was delicious and I believe that whole heartedly.
My wife had a couple of  green chili tamales.  While my tamale was good, we enjoyed her's a touch more.
They also serve desert tamales, tamales for diabetics, tamales with cactus (napal) leaves.  As you can see, lots of different kinds of tamales and our food came fast.
There are four tables inside or you can get to-go service.
The place is run by two ladies who are personable, charming, friendly and happy.  
Molly exhibits pride in her store and in the quality of her food. "No lard or grease, we make our stuff with olive oil".  
You betcha' we'd eat there again........and we will.
