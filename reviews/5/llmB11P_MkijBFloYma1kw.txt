If you want great food with the best service possible Javier's is the place to go.  I was so impressed with the staff and the way they accommodated a large group. They put the customer first the entire night.  The fillet and shrimp were incredible and well worth the $60 dollars.  The margaritas were sensational.  Everyone in our party commented the next day on how good everything was.  From the ambiance, d√©cor, food and service this place was a 10.  Great Job!
