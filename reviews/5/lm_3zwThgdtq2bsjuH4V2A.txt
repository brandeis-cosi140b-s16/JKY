I am SO thrilled that Tijuana Flats is back in Charlotte! They just opened at their East Blvd location yesterday after previously having 3 locations in Charlotte a few years ago. The new TF is in the building on East Blvd. that was previously Italian Pie. I believe Tijuana Flats is superior to Moe's, Chipotle, etc. The freshness of their ingredients is evident. From the black olives to the jalape√±os, you can tell they pride themselves on using fresh ingredients. Be sure to try many of the sauces at the hot sauce bar (my favorite is Smack My Ass and Call Me Sallly!). 

The service here is also always remarkable. Even though you order food at a cash register, your food is brought to you and guests are frequently checked on at tables as well as offered drink refills. I did notice, though, that the staff at this location is super eager to help since they're brand new. It was almost a little overwhelming but I'm sure that will settle a bit after time. 

It'll always be 5 stars for Tijuana Flats from me. I am so excited to have TF back in town and in such a convenient location.
