Los Olivos is a Scottsdale institution and I won't hear a word against them. Especially not when I have a few margaritas in me. They take good care of regulars, especially at Happy Hour. The chips and salsa are delicious and they keep them coming. I recommend the mini menu, they are a great way to sample stuff if you like to try a lot of different things, but my favorite meal is definitely the Chicken Poblano. Mmm, so good! The shrimp chimi is also fantastic. I never leave without feeling totally stuffed.
