Located on Rainbow/Charleston, this small family owned business is worth the stop to try and enjoy.  Everything is fresh and made to order.   My personal favorite are the cheese Papusas,  the cabbage mixture is very refreshing.   The menu consists of traditional Salvadorian dishes, and some mexican eats (not so much authentic but a really good fusion taste).   This is our go to spot on night we want to lay low, a d it never disappoints!
