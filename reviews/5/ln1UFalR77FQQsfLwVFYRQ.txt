Oh my. Delicious. Came here to get breakfast and that was the best decision yet. I got the omelette rancheros... I can't even begin to explain how wonderful it tasted. The omelette was perfect. Honestly, I didn't really have high hopes for this place because of the outside. Now that I've experienced the restaurant, I would definitely come back.
