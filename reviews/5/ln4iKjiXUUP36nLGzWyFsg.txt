Our last night in Phoenix and we decided to try Mexican.   Decide on this place based on Yelp reviews.   I had the combo with a beef taco, bean tostada, and cheese enchilada because I couldn't decide.  Usually not a fan of the enchilada sauce but this sauce was excellent!!  Beans and enchilada were my favorite!
