I am so upset with myself. I have lived about 1.5 miles away from this place for the last 4 years. The exterior does not do it justice so I have never pulled in to try it  or read about it before today. I decided to look up some new Mexican places around my house , and this one has really good reviews, so I went and checked it out I could not believe how many people were there, even still it only took about 7 or 8 minutes total to get my food. They are cash only so make sure you go with some cabbage. They have a huge BBQ constantly grilling carne asada right inside the restaurant over hot charcoal. They also have some pork varities but I have not tried that yet. I had some carne asada tacos and oh my gosh they were so good. They are served on the freshest mini flour tortillas I think I've ever had they were so good. Everything seems like it comes plain, if you want to add on onions or salsa or the pickled vegetables you do that yourself after hitting up the little salsa bar. They also have a few different types of Mexican soft drinks in glass bottles. The place itself is just the bare minimum, its just a little tiny place that serves street food, but the food makes up for the decor. I am so glad I tried this place it's a great cheap meal and it's right down the street! Next time I will try some of the other taco and burrito types, I saw Pastor and barbacoa and a few others as well that looked good! This is real Mexican food, not tailored for Americans or gringos, I was the only white dude in the whole place out of about 30 while I was there!
