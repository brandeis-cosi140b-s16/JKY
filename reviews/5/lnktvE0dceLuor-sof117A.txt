Have eaten here since I was in high school. I have visited Phoenix with the primary purpose of eating here and I always stop by when I'm in town (which is hard because they are not open on Sunday and close early because they are in Sun City where  a late dinner is 5:30). The locations is not even close (40+ min) to where I usually stay. Worth it.

I love their chips (when warmed) and SALSA. Definitely one my favorite restaurant salsas (and I've tried a ton all over Phoenix, San Diego, and LA trying to find something as good. Very rare). I could drink that stuff.

I usually get the crispy chicken tacos, bean tostada, and bean and cheese burrito. I don't know what they do to their tortillas, but it makes the burrito so good. The crispy tortillas of the tacos and tostada are also excellent. I love the chicken they have in the tacos. Not to greasy or saucy, white meat, very good. 

Eat the tacos/tostadas right away! They tend to get soggy if you wait long. If they do, I would request another, because the servers are wonderfully nice and wouldn't want you to have a bad experience anyway. Plus, the tacos are amazing if still crispy.
