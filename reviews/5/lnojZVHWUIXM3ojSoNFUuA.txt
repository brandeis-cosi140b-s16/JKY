The food was very good, service was also good here.  I wish it were cleaner though. 

What we tried:

Pi√±a and Orchata was perfection!  Enough flavor but not too sweet.

Shrimp cocktail was awesome! Unlike most of the coctels I've had, which had more fillers (tomatoes, onions, cucumbers, etc) than shrimp.  This had more than enough and big! 

Bean tostada- beans had a very nice flavor, fried tortilla had the perfect crunch and tasted like it was just fried. 

Carnitas platter- pork had perfect texture.  Crunchy on the outside and nice and tender inside.
