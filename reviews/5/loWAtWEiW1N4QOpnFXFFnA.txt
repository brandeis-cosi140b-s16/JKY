Our visit to Mariscos made us feel like we were on vacation in Mexico. The salsas (rojas and verde) and chips that we were greeted with were tasty, as was the ceviche. We started with the Mexican Shrimp Cocktail (we each had one), very nice with lots of shrimp and avocado. I had the green cheese enchiladas - LOTS of cheese and sour cream - yum! My husband had the octopus rancheros - he proclaimed it delicious. Both were served with rice, lettuce salad, and beans. The beans were much better than the usual.  We were too full for dessert, should have shared the shrimp cocktail.  House red wine was good and prices were reasonable. It's a long drive for us since we are near Pinnacle Peak, but we will be back.
