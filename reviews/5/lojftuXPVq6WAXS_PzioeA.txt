Stopped here today on my way through town on the recommendation of a friend and was glad I did. Had the corned beef hash Anita style and it was awesome! Delicious corned beef hash kicked up with jalapenos. If you like spicy and you like corned beef you will love it! I got it served with some corn tortillas and salsa on the side. Was the best breakfast i have had this month. 
Service here was also over the top, they kept my coffee cup full and I really needed it this morning since i had to get up at 4am today. 

I'll definitely be back here next time I go through Wickenberg
