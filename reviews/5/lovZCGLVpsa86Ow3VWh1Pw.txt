I can't get enough of Some Burros!

I travel often for work and am only one one a couple days a month and during those couple days my diet consist of Some Burros.  If you haven't had their Pollo Fundido then stop wasting your time and try it.  I usually ask them to give me half rice and beans instead of a full portion of one or the other.  

I have to admit the last time I was here their salsa was a bit off.  I didn't taste the same.  it was disappointing considering that if I could I would drink it straight from the bottle. 

Seriously though, come in, sit down and enjoy some great Mexican food.
