La Frontera Restaurant has quickly become our favorite Mexican Food Restaurant!! Quality & flavor of a much larger restaurant.  The plates show much attention to detail like retried beans on the plate are served in a little fluted hard tortilla with cheese! The food is always made to order and the employees go out of their way to comply on special request. Give this little gem a try, you will not be disappointed!!
