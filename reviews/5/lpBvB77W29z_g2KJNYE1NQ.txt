The best mexican food in Pittsburgh.  My favorites are their enchiladas, the chicken fajitas, and of course the Margaritas.  The even have a diabetic friendly margarita the has less sugar in it!

The service has always been good for me and I highly recommend checking Gran Agave out because it is truly a cut above any other mexican food in Pittsburgh.
