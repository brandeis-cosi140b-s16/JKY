So, when I think of Señor Taco I think of one of those places that serves Mexican food and it only tastes good when you're drunk. Well, I'm wrong! I mean, I'm sure it tastes good when you're drunk but it tastes good when you're sober too! I'm addicted to the veggie burrito! I get it w/o cheese, sour cream, or pico and I add in cilantro and jalapeños (I don't eat dairy). The burrito comes with guacamole, lettuce, refried beans (not cooked in lard), and spanish rice. It is so tasty and tastes really authentic. Pair it with their mild salsa and it's AMAZINGGG! 

My friend gets the chicken nachos and they're loaded with cheese and plenty of chicken. Yum if you're into that!
