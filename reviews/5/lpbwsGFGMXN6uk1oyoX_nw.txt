Great food, and good prices.  The inside was pretty standard taco shop kinda place. The food is good. I ordered a carne asada burrito plate and was quite pleased with what I got. Keep in mind that the burritos sold here don't come with rice or beans inside, you have to order the plate. Also, it is open 24 hours!
