We still LOVE this place.  We tried the fried quesadilla with Carnitas yesterday.  AMAZING.  The pork is so good and it tasted light even tough it was fried and it came with the BEST sauce.   I am still a huge fan of their Carne Asada tacos and the Burrito with Carne Asada.  My kids are obsessed with the beef tongue and pig stomach tacos.   I am not brave enough to try them.  The Torte sandwich is HUGE and made with their amazing Carnitas.   Everyone needs to try this place....
