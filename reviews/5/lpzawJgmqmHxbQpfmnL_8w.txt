The best Coctel de Camaron I've ever had! And the Micheladas are fantastic! Yes it does get crowded so expect a long wait time, but I've seen the waiters do everything they possibly can to get your group seated as quickly as possible. Yes, there is live music. So if you don't want to hear Mariachi or Norteno while you're eating, don't come.  Yes, they specialize in seafood (thus, the name). Yes, there are vendors who will try to sell you things. Another words, it's pretty much just like having mariscos in Puerto Nuevo, Mexico. So if you don't quite understand the music, the food, the culture, then don't come with expectations of something like El Torito or Chilis.
