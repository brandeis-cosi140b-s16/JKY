This place is amazing. The chips are fresh and cooked there and taste great. Ordered the enchilada trio the beef was good but the green cheese and chicken fundido was amazing. Also ordered was a shredded beef taco, carne asada, mini combo and machaca. All were really good. Definitely a place to return to. Portions were good sized as well. Only bad part is they have coke not Pepsi.
