I was amazed by the new restaurant.  It had an open atmosphere and very clean, with tables set for fine dinning.  The staff was friendly and engaged. We ordered stuffed jalapeno, chicken wings and chicken and steak skewers. All were to die for. Portion size was just enough and taste was of an authentic modern Mexican cuisine. Desert was heaven! I recommend this restaurant to everyone who wants to be treated like a king or queen.
