Fun entertainment, great bar location, Best bartender, fun drinks that are always well made!

I've seen lots of places change over the years. Like New Orleans, the drinks got more expensive while the mixes got more sugar (less alcohol). Cabo Wabo is not one of those places. They stay competitive on the prices of the Vegas strip but the main thing is that you get what you pay for here! Alcohol! The mixes are delicious and the drinks are real.

The bartender was very friendly, had lots of energy, amazingly quick no matter how many customers they had, and had lots of fun while keeping the professional feel. That's amazing! We knew then, that Vegas only hired the best of the best.

We sat at the bar which is nicely situated facing the Bellagio fountains. It held an outdoor feeling without getting burned due to the architecture of the venue and had a fun energetic and interactive entertainer.

We had some light snacks which were surprisingly flavorful and innovative. Thanks! And thanks for taking a group pic of all of us with you guys included with our phone since you're the ones that made our vacation awesome! Great memories, Great times.
