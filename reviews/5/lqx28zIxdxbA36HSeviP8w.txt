Ate dinner on a Thursday night, which, unbeknownst to us, we had an option for a Date Night Thursday menu. The delicious food options we could choose from included an appetizer, 2 entrees and dessert all for under $25. We had more than enough food and the quality was even better than I expected. One of the entree options we chose was the Salmon Salad, it was delicious and huge! The staff was courteous and efficient. We will be going back for sure!
