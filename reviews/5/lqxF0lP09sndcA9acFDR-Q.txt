I am so in love with this place right now. I have the lap band and so I cannot eat like the normal everyday burrito eater. I get the burrito bowl and chips to use to scoop with. I love the atmosphere and the fact that everything is made fresh and you can taste the natural flavors in the food. Amazing. 
It makes the perfect lunch or dinner...or in my case, BOTH! :)
