This place is AMAZING.

The location is great. I ordered the carne asada burrito and it was filled wih the best steak I've ever had in a burrito. The staff is friendly and the people watching is perfect. Definitely a small location and is somewhat fast food esque. I would recommend to anyone looking to get out of the office for lunch. Delicious!
