Hella thick and juicy!

Now Chipotle, all are the same? NO!

Here the cashiers are pretty awesome, my chica stuffed the shit outta my burrito with chicken, rice, beans, hot salsa, crema, cheese, and some lettuce! THIS THING WAS SOOO BIG IT RIPPED DOWN THE MIDDLE! Now at first I was a little pissed, but then I was like "Yea!!" I basically ate half the burrito with chips, then took the rest home for dinner!

Place itself is not super super busy so its nice, and its always clean! Prices have risen a little and the menu is nice bc it tells you calorie info.

In addition they have tacos, bowls, and quesadillas. Go get your eat on babies!
