The restaurant is in a small mercado. I've had tried pastor tacos, torta ahogado, some big burrito they have with everything including shrimp and my favorite, carne en su jugo. I drive 60 miles round trip for the carne en su jugo a few times a year. If you have never tried it it's worth the drive. They did give us a sample of a chicharron torta, this was like a free appetizer. It was very good but I have never had chicharrones that weren't dried.  Overall I would say the food is a 4 star but because I have only found carne en su jugo at this place and it is IMO to die for I must give it a 5.
