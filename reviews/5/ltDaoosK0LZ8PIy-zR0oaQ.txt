As one of my coworkers said, this is where all the (Mexican) landscapers go.  If you like authentic Mexican run by authentic Mexicans, look no further.  They bring FOUR different salsas out with the chips, along with lime wedges!

As uninviting as this place looks on the outside, there is no substitute for authentic food.  The lunch burritos (California burrito and burrito la unica) and lunch enchiladas are great.  When you factor in the price, they're phenomenal.  The shrimp fajitas for dinner are the best I've ever had.

If you're the type that likes Cantina 1511, Don Pedro, Azteca or any of the other countless Americanized Mexican restaurants then you probably won't enjoy this one.  If you're looking to impress your date, then I recommend looking elsewhere.  But if you crave the real deal, with plenty of spice and zest, it doesn't get any better than La Unica.  I've been here with 8-10 coworkers, and the ones that like authentic, spicy food all love it.  The ones that prefer Don Pedro weren't as thrilled.

Oh, and this review applies to the location on South Blvd (in the heart of "Little Mexico").  Never got to try the one in Plaza Midwood before it closed.
