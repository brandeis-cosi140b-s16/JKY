It's hard to find a good Mexican place around that has great meats. This place grills all of their food so you won't get a greasy burrito (like filibertos). Got the chicken one which comes with just cilantro and onions. Carne asada comes with beans added. This means you're getting about 99% meat. Great customer service as well. 

Ps. Add jarritos to your menu!!
