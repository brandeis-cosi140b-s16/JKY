We have been eating at Don Pedros for over a year and just love it. The place is never empty and its not because there is nothing else to eat in Queen Creek. If your looking for the "Garcias" type Mexican food, there are two other places in Queen Creek for that! But if you like real Mexican food, Don Pedros is for you! Even though busy, we have never had to wait long to be seated and the service is always great. The owner always walks around to the tables to make sure everything is to your liking! And, I likey!!! YUM  They also have Poker and Karaoke on Saturdays! Very fun!
