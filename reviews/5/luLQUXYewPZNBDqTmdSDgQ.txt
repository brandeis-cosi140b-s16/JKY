I have driven by this place so many times and always thought I should stop and check it out. Well I did tonight and all I can say is WOW!! I wish I would have stopped and discovered this place the first time I seen it. Food is amazing, portions are insanely big, and the prices are incredible. I ordered the #1: 3 enchiladas with choice of shredded beef or cheese, with rice and beans for $9.25 which your probably thinking might not be that great of a deal but when you see the size of the plate/portion you will know what I'm talking about. I had 1 1/2 enchiladas and rice and beans (totally stuffed)and still took home the same amount of food if not more than a combo plate at Fili B's. This place is incredible don't let the area fool ya this place is truly amazing!!!
