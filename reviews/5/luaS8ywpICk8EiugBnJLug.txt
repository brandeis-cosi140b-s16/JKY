I am actually writing a review for Two Hippies Magical Mushroom burgers...
Yelp says it is closed..... it has reopened... with the original owners... I ate there on Saturday for the first time.... the food was fantastic... the service wonderful... the owner took great care of us..... the burgers and tater tots were delicious... i will return... i hope Yelp figures out it has reopened because you don't want to miss eating there....$6 for a burger, tater tots and drink... they have yummy toppings to choose from.... everything is fresh and piping hot... and they take credit cards...
guess i will try this place next if it is as good as the burger place!
