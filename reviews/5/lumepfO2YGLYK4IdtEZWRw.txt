I love this food truck, its directly across from my apartment complex which makes is extremely convenient. I eat here at least once a week, its just that good. Ruby is one of the nicest guys, and he makes fantastic food. Highly recommend the pastor taco's, the churros are dangerously good, and make sure to get chips and pico with your order.
