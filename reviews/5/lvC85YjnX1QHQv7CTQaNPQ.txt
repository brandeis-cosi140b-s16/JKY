It seems like Roberto owns most of Las Vegas, being that there are over 80 or so locations of his taco shop all within a 15-mile radius. It's perfect, because wherever you are, and whatever time it is, Roberto's is open and ready to serve your drunk ass full of lip-smacking good Mexican food.  And it still tastes amazing when you're hungover, or completely sober. 

I find myself constantly craving their carnitas tacos.  Wow, did I just drool as I typed that?

Must try:
Carnitas Tacos- tender, salty, and juicy shredded pork, cheese, guacamole, hot corn tortillas... I think I need one STAT.

Carne asada fries-  Oh yes, they went there.

Honorable Mention: Breakfast burrito with bacon

Any location will do just fine.  Just wish they had one in LA.  Is that too much to ask for?  They're open 24 hours a day, and most shops also have a drive-thru. It's fast, cheap and soooooooo good.

Note: Anyone who says they've gotten sick from Roberto's probably got alcohol poisoning.... not food poisoning.
