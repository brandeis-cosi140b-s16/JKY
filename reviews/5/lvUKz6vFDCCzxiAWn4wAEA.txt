This is one of those 'you will miss it if you blink' type places. Hidden in a strip mall, behind a convenience store, you will find El Herradero. Best Mexican food I have had in Nevada, hands down.

The same lady helps me every time I go in, and she is a total sweetheart. The decor is basic, this isn't a place you would take a date for a special occasion, don't go into a hole-in-the-wall establishment expecting fine china or 800 thread count table linens... If you have ever been to Mexico, you know that it's the flavors of the food that make it authentic, not the d√©cor! 

The chicken soup is fabulous. Great broth with lots of chicken, potatoes, carrots and rice. It tastes extra yummy when you are hungover. I also like the chicken tacos and taquitos. Basically anything with chicken is going to be great. 

The free chips and salsa you get when you sit down are also tasty. The salsa is mild, but that is how I like it... They have a small salsa bar as well for those that like it hotter. 

Make sure you get a churro for desert. Yum!
