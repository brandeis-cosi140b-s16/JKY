Went here while I was in Vegas for a friend's birthday weekend. We went in the afternoon and it was packed! They have late night hours and I'm sure if I was close by fter club or party, I woud be there! I love Mexican food and being in the West Coast sure gives you a different perspective of what real Mexican food should be like.  I had Tacos de lengua, carne asada and buche. All delicous.  

One thing bad, the fact that you can't order all your tacos on one line. I had to ask my friend to get me buche from the line she was in. Definitely going again if ever in LV again.
