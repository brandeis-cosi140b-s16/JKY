Try and find a sit down mom an pop restaurant in the  east valley, I dare you. 

Franchise food is franchise food is franchise, and the east valley is the land of Franchise food. It seems as soon as you find an edible one the manager changes and the place takes a hard nose dive. Nobody really owns it, nobody really cares ... what a world we live in. 

If you advertise on TV they will come! 

The jewel of the nile in the east valley franchise scene is On the Border at Power and Baseline. I have been coming here for years and the same manager reigns supreme. She treats her workers fair and they tend to stick around. 

That translates into friendly wait staff, great food, and they have the money to regularly refresh the decor. The bartenders are knowledgable and they all make a decent margarita. You even find real mexicans, not just working here but ... eating here! ... Imagine that.

Chances are you'll also find me in the bar sipping a Grand Marnier spiked Bordirita made by my main "men in black" ... Kenny and Moe. 

Â¡Buen provecho!
