almost like chipotle, but better. same format but you get legit hawaiian meats like huli hulu chicken, and fried fish. their sesame vinaigrette is so good! and the chocolate coconut bars were tasty too. highly recommend this place. 

if you're looking for super authentic hawaiian food, this place is NOT IT. but it is a good mix of chipotle with an island swag. 

obviously, services is friendly as well. they're from hawaii! mahalo, braddah!
