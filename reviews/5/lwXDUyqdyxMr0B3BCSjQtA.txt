Came here tonight with some girlfriends and loved it.  I am a huge fan of El Pastor tacos!  I usually drive all the way to the other side of town for tacos el gordo.  I'm so happy this place is like 10 min from my house and is so much better!  They have more food variety - You can make bowls, burritos, street corn.... They have a huge full bar - the horchata rum drink and their house margarita were very tasty!  Their interior is super clean and chic decor.  This is not a little taco shop. Weekend evenings they have a DJ Upfront which we enjoyed while having our delicious drinks and chatting up over some tacos!  Great little spots I will be bringing all my clients for lunch
