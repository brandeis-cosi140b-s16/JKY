Organic Mexican food that blew me away! It is connected to Saphires (strip club) but dont let that scare you! The restaurant is gorgeous, chic, and has phenomenal food. Our bartender was spectacular, as was the general manager! We will definitely be returning!

Update: we now consider ourselves regulars here. The food gets better with each visit and their margaritas are amazing! So fresh and beautiful. I recommend the shrimp bowl and chicken enchiladas too!
