I was in town with my niece and my family members that live there recommended this place. I had no clue what to get so I tried the loco mexican pie. Holy moly. It was so good I couldnt stop talking about it. It was enormous and everyone at the table was able to have some and I was still able to get my fill. 
The salsa was just ok but I dont really go to mexican places for their salsa. I'm not much of a fan. 
The decor was a little odd for a mexican restaurant but, honestly, I didnt care at all because the food was so delish!!!
I also liked that they have big cups for drinks. I'm a huge drinker and my biggest pet peeve is having to wait forever for a waiter to fill up my cup. 
I cant wait until I'm back in Phoenix because I'm heading straight here!!!
