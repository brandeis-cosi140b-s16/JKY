I went to Cabo about a week ago and I still can't stop thinking about the shrimp tacos. I've never thought about a taco this much in my life. I fall asleep thinking about it every night. This is truly a piece of art located in the heart of the art district. I would recommend this restaurant to every person I meet. I would write poetry about the shrimp taco... If I was any good at poetry. Here, I'll give it a try here's a haiku: 

Cabo's shrimp tacos,
They changed my life forever,
A perfect evening!
