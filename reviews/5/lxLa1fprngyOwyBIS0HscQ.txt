My friend and I went today. I had the smoked pork burrito, he had the chicken fajita one. Delicious. 

We were also the first to try the Red Velvet Flan. O-M-G it was STUPID!!!(that means it was so good, you should slap whomever is sitting closest to you) #lawddd

Oh and Chico was our server and he was outstanding.

Reasons you should go:

- Beautiful decor (it's sexy)
- Amazing food (it's stupid)
- Reasonable prices (make it rain for the tip)
- Excellent service (Chico was a B.O.S.S.)
- Happy hour from 3pm - 6pm, and 10pm - close (dranks)
- Red Velvet Flan (slap yo mama right now)

Get there now!
