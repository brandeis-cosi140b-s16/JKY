Just had the most memorable experience ever. We work at Apple and there was a group of 8 of us on a time constraint and Tim and Jen were fantastic! I have been in the service industry for my whole prior career and that was by far the best service I have ever had. Food was delicious, service was amazing and they met our time constraint to boot! Please treat yourself and don't miss out, can't say enough great things. I will not only be returning but I will be inviting others!
