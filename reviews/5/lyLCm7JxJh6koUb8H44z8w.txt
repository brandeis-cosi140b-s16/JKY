When my boyfriend (LV native) and I first cooked up the idea to spend my 30th birthday in Vegas, a stop at Roberto's was the first thing he mentioned we HAD to do. 

I mean--he was so serious, you guys. Feasting on their chicken tacos was a must--as many times as possible while we were there. Boy am I glad my boyfriend has great taste, because Roberto's changed my life. And from his expression as we gobbled down this authentic, Mexican goodness, I could tell they tasted just the same as he remembered. 

First, it's cheap and it's fast--but the portions and the quality of the food will knock your face off. 

Second, get yourself some chicken tacos. As many other Yelpers mentioned, their all-white-meat chicken is shredded perfection. It isn't seasoned to all hell, just ever so slightly, so you can still taste the chicken. And yea, it's greasy--but it's because they deep fry those suckers fresh in front of you. Ermahgerd. And if you really want to taste it as it should be, just get shredded cheese and lettuce on 'em. That's it. Then top it with some of their delicious, homemade hot sauces. It's everything that's right in the world. And if one form of shredded chicken and cheese, deep-fried in a fresh tortilla isn't enough, then please let me recommend their taquitos!  We get them with just cheese melted on top with a scoop of their homemade guacamole. Perfection in crunchy, gooey, food form. 

Roberto's tacos are a Vegas must-try. Just ask the folks who live there or grew up there--they'll point you in the right direction. And I trust me some locals (and Yelpers!)
