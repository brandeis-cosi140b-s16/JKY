new mexican food in las vegas! great food with really good prices. 

the chile is authentic new mexican; both the red and the green are good. in addition to the best out-of-state carne adovada i have had, they are the only place outside of new mexico i have ever seen stuffed sopapillas. you can get fry bread, too! breakfast burritos are big and stuffed full of deliciousness.....good chorizo and bacon and hash browns. legumbres (carrots, jicima, cuc's in fresh lime juice w/ red chile)  make a nice refreshing treat when it is hot out.

they also have a decent beer selection (including a $1 house tap) and now make margaritas...very reasonable prices on good tequila (patron margaritas for $5!).

good stuff....very much recommend it to native and non-native new mexicans alike.

*updated to 5 stars and to include the booze/beer (not really a full bar, but they make some mean margs)
