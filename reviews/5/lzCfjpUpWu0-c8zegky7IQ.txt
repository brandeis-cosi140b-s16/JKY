I've been to Vegas plenty of times. I mean it is Vegas who hasn't. But I have to tell you, the food was awesome. But what made it better is our waitress. Andrea.  Remember that name Andrea. She was awesome. We as a table, got the "Hangover Cure". But she never let our drinks get to the bottom. That's service. She even gave her opinions on what she like despite if it was popular or not.  Thats honesty which is greatly appreciated. Don't know if everyone is like that here but our fist impression was a wonderful one.
