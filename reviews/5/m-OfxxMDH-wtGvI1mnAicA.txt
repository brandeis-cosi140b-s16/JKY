Place is amazing. It's like they took the best parts of in-n-out (friendly staff and great hamburgers) and added amazing tacos to the menu. The short rib tacos are what we came for and they didn't let down. I had a chicken one as well and it was also delicious.

The dulce-de-leche shake may be the best milkshake I've EVER had. We will be going back regularly. Also , the manager and staff that was on when we came on Saturday night was incredible, great service!
