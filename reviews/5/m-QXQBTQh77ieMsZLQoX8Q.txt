Very Good Mexican food with great pricing. It is not the fanciest place to have Mexican Food but it is very good. I recommend the Green Chili Pork Plate and the Guacamole which is made fresh when you order it.

Since the food is made to order, if you are in a hurry call and order before you go. If not, sit back and relax the service is always friendly and it is quiet enough to visit with friends or family.
