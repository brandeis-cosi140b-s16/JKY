It's an interesting mix of opinions posted about Chino Bandito. Frankly on my first visit I wasn't sure what to think. On my next visit I was hooked.  Whenever I find myself near the 17 and Greenway I'm thinking about stopping by for eat-in or take-out.

Chino Bandido is definitely a funky place as everyone says. It's in a not so fancy strip mall with not so fancy decor inside. But look past it and you'll have some fun. Even though it's kind of funky I did find it to be clean - and I'm extremely finicky about cleanliness.

Some of the menu winners include the #13 Pollo Diablo, which delights with garlic and hot peppers. Besides that the #10 Emerald Chicken has a wonderful flavoring including ginger that is well-teamed with the jerk fried rice. Enjoy the hot sauce and interesting mix of flavors.  I also like the chocolate volcano which is only available on certain days.

Yes it is an odd mix of Mexican, Chinese and Caribbean flavors, but it works. Chino Bandito is VERY inexpensive and highly recommended. Just keep an open mind.
