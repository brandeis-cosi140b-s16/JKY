We've been eating Rubio's this week.  Yesterday I called for something for my husband and a super cheerful person answered the phone.  Incredibly friendly and sounded sooo excited.  My daughter picked up the order.

We've been to this Rubio's quite a few times over the years and just like the other Rubio's, always excellent food and excellent service.  People tend to look happy at most of the Rubio's we go to, which bodes well for the company.  Not just a fluke, because this week, we've had many of our meals at different Rubio's depending on where we are.

Thanks for consistently good food and service!
