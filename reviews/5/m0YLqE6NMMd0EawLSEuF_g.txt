The strip has so much terrible food and terrible drinks for SO much money.   My wife and I stopped here and good old Chipotle was better than every other meal we had over the course of a week with the exception of Fleur de lys.

So for the record Fleur de lys = #1, Chipotle= #2, and everywhere else isn't worth the effort.
