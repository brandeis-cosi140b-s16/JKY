I have eaten at this specific Taco Bell many times before. The service is excellent, the staff are friendly, and they have never messed up an order! You can really tell that the employees here are not mad or rude like you often see at fast food joints, and are simply pleased to serve their customers

As far as their drive thrus are concerned, I have used their drive thru before and I haven't had the lengthy wait times many have complained about, but I guess I could have just gotten lucky!

Overall, if you live in the CU area, this is definitely one of the better Taco Bells to visit!
