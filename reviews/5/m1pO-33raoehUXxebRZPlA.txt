Had dinner here last night for my sisters bachelorette party. We made a reservation for the downstairs cellar and when we got there our tables wasn't ready just yet so they set us up at a nice cozy fire pit and we ordered a round of drinks. Everything was delicious. Once we sat down at our table, our server, Ashley J. Told us all about the menu and we put our food orders in. The food came out quick and was so tasty. We had the #4 pizza, some burgers, and some skewers, and calamari. Everything I tasted was great! When we got out tab, they took care of all of our bride to be's drinks. They were very accommodating, Ashley was an amazing and fun server.  After we had left and moved on to our next place, I realized I lost my house key. I called rokerji to ask if they found any, and they asked the new table of people sitting in the table where we were to get up so they could look under the table. To me that is just such great customer service. Definitely recommend this place to all my friends. Nice small and cozy. I had a great time and j know everyone else in the party did too. Thanks Rokerji for everything!
