I travel an insane amount for work. So much so, I barely see my own city or the inside of my own kitchen. Normalcy and consistency are beloved when on the road, as is the occasional routine. 

I kind of have an addiction to Chipotle. This particular Chipotle. I stay at the hotel across the street and am here pretty much every night for dinner. Compared to the offerings around Happy Valley Road, Chipotle can offer food that isn't lukewarm microwaved astronaut food. I know I can go in and get a relatively healthy barbacoa salad. 

I come in so much the staff knows me and my order. And even when it's busy, they're cranking those customers in and out, quickly and efficiently. 

This location is also always clean. Snaps!
