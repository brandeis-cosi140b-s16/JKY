I've been going to Macayo since they opened and I love it!  It's Mother's Day and it is my choice to take the family wherever I want to go so I choose Macayo.  The food is exactly what it has always been even down to the two bowls of complimentary sauce and chips you get before the meal.  It's not too spicy or greasy and the portions are perfect!  I've seen many restaurants fold up in my 69 years here in Vegas but Macayo remains open...........that should say something!  I'm guessing some people are use to food from their homeland and maybe it is different but for those of us who like it mild and delicious..........this is the place! The pictures don't do the food justice.
