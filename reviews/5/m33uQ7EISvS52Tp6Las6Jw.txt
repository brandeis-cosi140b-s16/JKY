So I wanted something quick, fresh and economically savy for lunch today and decided on Chipotle even though it is a chain.  I have found a new lunch spot to add to my list!  I had the chicken bowl fajita style, the chicken was really juicy, the peppers and onions crunchy.  The sala fresco was fresh and the pinto and black beans were the perfect consistency.  For a little over $6 I have enough food to feed me for 2 meals.  The place was very clean and the staff was very friendly.  The only thing I would change is to offer brown rice as well as white, but I will definately be back.
