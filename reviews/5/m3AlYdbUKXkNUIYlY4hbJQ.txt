I had been to this place a few years ago several times when it was Chuy's and was not impressed. Now, it's my favorite quick stop for great casual grilled grub!  They have a good Friday fish fry, great Tri-tip and chicken combos plus cheap tasty Margaritas.  Fast service, friendly staff and great prices!
