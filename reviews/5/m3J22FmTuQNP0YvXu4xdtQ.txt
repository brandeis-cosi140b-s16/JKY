Reviews for your big chain restaurants are almost useless but this is more of a personal review. Exceptional service. I'm very picky with what I do and don't like in my dishes and I've never had them put something on my food that I specifically asked to be off. Other than that, it's your basic Taco Bell. I just simply prefer this one due to the fact that I like my service consistent and they accomplish that. Well done.
