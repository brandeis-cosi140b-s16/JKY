This was excellent food and reasonably priced for being on the strip and at the casino mall area.  I ended up eating here twice since the food was so good.  The staff was also friendly, polite, and quick.

The chips were well made, light on the oil and moderate on the salt.  The salsa was thick with nice tomato flavor that was bright, rich, and crisp.

First time I enjoyed the fish tacos. The tortillas were soft and substantial enough to not fall apart on me during my meal.  The fish had a crisp breading with a moist interior that was evenly cooked.  The lettuce was fresh and the tomatoes juicy.  The guacamole was creamy and had a small hint of lemon for freshness.  The additional bonus is that you can order an extra taco or two if you are really hungry.

The second vist I went with a pork burrito "wet" style or covered with sauce.  The burrito was large and well filled.  The pork was tender and rich in flavor that was been roasted.  There was also a crisp crust on the pork that added another dimension to the flavor.  The brown mole was thick and rich with a complex smokey flavor that blended well with the pork and the cheeses.  The rice was soft and served as a nice counterpoint to the rich mole and juicy pork.

Side dishes of beans and rice were standard but didn't stand out in my mind.  However, you don't go there for side dishes.  Overall this was excellent food and I would happily return to eat here.  I would probably even travel to get to Mandalay to eat here.
