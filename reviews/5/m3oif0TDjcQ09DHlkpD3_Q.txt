Great Food!! I have been stopping by this place for years. Steak Ranchero platter is one of my favs! Got a chance to talk with the owners daughter the other night.  Very kind and sweet lady, let her know that the food has always been great and the service from the people that work there is amazing! 

KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!
