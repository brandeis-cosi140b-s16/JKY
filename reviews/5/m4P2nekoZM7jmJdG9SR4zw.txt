Fast and Yummy!  Too bad they had a jerk yelling at the employees while we were there. The employees are awesome but they were getting a tongue lashing from some lady that was getting her hair colored next door- not sure if she was the landlord or manager or what but she was super rude and not even embarrassed to be so rude in front of others (especially customers).
