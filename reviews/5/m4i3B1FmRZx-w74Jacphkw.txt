Really enjoyed this place.  Found out about this gem through my Non-GMO Vegas FB account and researched it further.  After all of the positive reviews on Yelp, I decided to give it a try.  I am a big fan of organic/non-gmo food and try and eat this whenever possible so I was really excited to see this new option in town.  Took my parents and met a couple good friends here for dinner.  I was hoping that it wouldn't disappoint as I was the one who recommended the spot.  It did not disappoint!  Food was outstanding and service was spot on!  Kai did an outstanding job serving our table and had a great attitude as well!  Chef Paco was awesome with everything.  It was all really delicious with a great presentation as well.  In fact, 3 in the party commented that their tacos were the best they ever had!  High marks for this place, and I hope to see it succeed as we need to let our wallets speak.  It is time to start supporting people who serve real food, and not food that is chemical-laden and full of GMO's!
