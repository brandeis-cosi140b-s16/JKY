I seriously love Los Fav's- I eat there at least three times a week, usually at the Ellsworth and Main location but I've been to McQueen. Their beans are exceptional, especially when compared to Filiberto's. Another positive is that they ALWAYS get my order right, unlike the Filiberto's just down the road. My mom and I always get sides of guac and it always impresses. We usually call in and pick up so I don't have much to say about the "dining in" experience, but it's clean (but not in that "smells-like-Pine-Sol-and-ammonia" way) and pretty much looks like your standard taco shop.
