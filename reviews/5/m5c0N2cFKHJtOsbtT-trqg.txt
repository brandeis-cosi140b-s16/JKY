Found this place on accident tucked away in an orange grove at the bottom of a small ravine. Went back for lunch yesterday and so glad I did. I had the 1/2 lb brisket sammy with the macaroni salad. To be honest I just wanted the brisket and was never going to eat the bun, but the bun they used was so soft and delicious, yet it stood up just fine to the meat and sauce I ended up eating it all. The brisket was perfectly smoked with a great smoke flavor. The rub wasn't overpowering. The Buck sauce was vinegar based and had a nice little kick to it. And the macaroni salad was good, maybe a little too sweet for my taste but I still ate it all. I will for sure go back, maybe today! They have a limited menu so be prepared. I saw lots of people ordering the burritos as well but I'm going back for more brisket!
