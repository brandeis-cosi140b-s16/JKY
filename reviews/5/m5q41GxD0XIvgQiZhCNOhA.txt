Heard great things about this place and saw their Gilbert location get featured on the news one morning, so decided to finally give them a try.  I went in on a Tuesday, and sat through a 35 minute wait time, so to me this was a good sign this place will be good or they were giving away Free tacos for Taco Tuesday, either way it was good.  I was not disappointed the tacos were great!, fresh ingredients, very well seasoned and marinated meats. 

I really like that they put their own twist on each taco and add the right toppings, seasonings, to make it that much better. When you don't even need to add the hot sauce you know is good stuff!  Plus the service was great, I will be back for sure!
