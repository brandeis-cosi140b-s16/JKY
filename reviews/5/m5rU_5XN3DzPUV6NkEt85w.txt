By far the best taco spot in Las Vegas. I first came here when I went on a date with this guy; I still thank him for bringing me here lol. But ever since then, i can't stay away! I come here at least once a week and every time my taste buds praise me for gracing them with such great tasting food. I also brought my family here with me one day and they all fell in love. 

I've tried both the carne asada and the spicy pork tacos but I have to say that the spicy pork tacos are my all time fav! The people are always really nice and the guys working the grills be movin! I can't get enough of this place!! Great food for a great price... That's what I'm all about.
