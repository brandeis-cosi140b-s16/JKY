Already addicted (2nd time here within a week). Tonight I got the Carne asada quesadilla.....it is soooo good. Meat is marinated perfectly. It comes with quac and sour cream. My kid got a bean burrito....didn't like it bc he's a cry baby and only likes refried.... The owner saw my kid not eating and came over.... He asked if he wanted something else.... Then offered to make refried beans..... He went above and beyond!!! My kid was happy after that and enjoyed his burrito. Yummy beans. I love the decor, really simple with "Loteria" artwork on the walls... Love it! We will definitely be back.
