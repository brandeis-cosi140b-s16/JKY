Tacos. It's a need it my life. Finding a good place for tacos isn't easy...Finding a place to replace the hole left in the heart after the closing of Verde? Impossible....until last night!

We went to the Grit and Grace late night Happy Hour for some amazing snacks and drinks and wanted to finish with an amazing meal. I've been dying to get in to Tako. I have seriously been waiting since the day it opened! We walked up at about 10:30 pm and they were able to seat us! 

The ambience in this place is sexy and fun. The red lights and the giant cracken in the wall are so damn cool. Even though the tables were super close I had no trouble focusing on the conversation at the table.  There is an upstairs that looked pretty great. I'd like to try that next time.

We ordered the quacamole with the editions of pepita, bacon, pineapple, and charred poblanos. It was perfection. The chips are thin and crispy and salty perfection.

My friend ordered the Duck Confit taco. Damn. Damn. It was so good. I was hoping he'd offer me more. But I took the liberty of sipping on his drink with out permission so...I won. He had the El Diablo. The drink was so good and fresh with ginger beer and lime that I'm dying too go back for the drinks alone!
I had the Chicken Asado. It was classic with avacodo and crema. My favorites! It was the best chicken taco I've ever had. 

If you plan to visit Tako you have 2 choices.... waaay advanced reservations or a late, late night meal. Either way DO IT!
