My first time here was really good the Horchata had strawberry in it and cinnamon on top. I got the shark and shrimp burrito and it had lots of flavor. The Burrito was big enough to probably share with two light eaters. The salsa bar was great I tried somethings that were outside of my normal but it was a good experience all around. Other than the place being small I have no complaints. Great place.
