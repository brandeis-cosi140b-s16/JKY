I've eaten here several times now, and simply must add a 5-star review!
Besides the awesome shrimp burritos, delicious and diverse condiments, and friendly service, I've noticed that the clientele seems particularly happy.  And with good reason!  

Tonight there were firefighters waiting for takeout, which reminds me to recommend that option if you don't have time to stay and eat in.

The menu extends far beyond shrimp, but the shrimp burritos are particularly juicy!  

Totally worth making a turn off the main Beeline highway.
