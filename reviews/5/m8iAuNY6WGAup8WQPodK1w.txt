Amazing what a splash of paint will do. No matter what the walls used to look like the food is always amazing here and the partial remodel looks great. The Pollo Palomino entree is to die for. Family owned real deal Mexican food in a town with not much else to offer. Well worth the trip out from anywhere in the area. We come here all the time and feel right at home every single time. Do yourself a favor and check it out!
