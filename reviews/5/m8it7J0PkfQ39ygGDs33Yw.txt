Beats anything in AJ.  Nice, hidden away.  Mexican comfort food.  Great food when ya just wanna eat cause your hungry food. Nothing fancy, but yummy good.  Started out slow with the three item combo plate for $7.50. How good could it be?? It was delightful.  Got the chili relleno, taco and tamale.  Just like mama would have made if she was a little Mexican lady.  The young man that served us was very polite and our food arrived in a timely manner. 
Now let's talk margaritas.....these are no wimpy margaritas.  These will put hair on your chest.  We will be back and we are bringing relatives. Great find.
