We've been going to Bonito's for a few years and I'm not sure why I haven't added a review yet.. Anyways the food is great, the staff is friendly and it's a fun place to go.  Juan the waiter is a superstar and I think he has quite a following.  Always hugs both my husband and I when we arrive and leave.
The guacamole made at your table is so good, and last night I tried their ceviche for the first time and that too was yummy!  Of course the margaritas aren't bad either!  Love this place!
