This place has one of the best Breakfast Burritos in the entire Valley. I've lived in Scottsdale my entire life and never heard of this place until a few weeks ago. I'll knowingly make myself late for work and classes just to pick up a bacon or chorizo  breakfast burrito. I live 30 minutes away from this place and I will pass 50 other Mexican restaurants on the drive, but after one bite, It's absolutely worth going out of my way for. I'm a huge fan of Mexican food and many times a restaurant's food can feel "half-assed" but that is NOT the case here. You really can tell that there's some love put into Los Favs' food, no wonder they have so many regular customers. I'll be going here for the rest of my life.
