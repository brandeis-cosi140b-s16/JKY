I love this place!

They sell delicious Mexican desserts that you must try at least once. This location has been recently renovated and made bigger. Before it was really small, but now it's a lot bigger, and it looks like a comfy ice cream shop you can hang out at. Lines tend to get long, but it's worth the wait, the food will not disappoint!
 
I would say their specialty are the raspados.
