My husband and I have been coming here for the past 4 years.  The food and service has always been great.  My husband enjoys the beef tacos and fajitas.  I enjoy the chicken chimichanga and pollo diablo. And we must get a frozen margarita to go with our food = yummy.  We love the food here so much, we visit at least 3 times a month.  

Melissa, our typically assigned waitress (she is always there) knows what we like.  And even when it gets busy, she always makes time to chat with us.  Love her!! 

Prices are awesome, food is delicious and service has always been good to us.  I highly recommend this place.
