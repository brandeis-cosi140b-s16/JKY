Doesn't look like much from the outside, but serves up awesome food.

On a recommendation from DarrenC, I tried this place.  I drove right past it on my first pass, totally didn't even notice the little stand-alone building sitting back from Broadway in the ghetto.  They have burgers, BBQ, Catfish, sandwiches, etc.  The owner is, apparently, a preacher and likes to blast emotional, uplifting gospel-type music which, surprisingly, adds to the enjoyment of the place, and I am not a fan of church or religion.

Oh, and the best part.... they serve up sweet tea.  If you work around here, just try it, you will be adding it to your rotation, guaranteed.
