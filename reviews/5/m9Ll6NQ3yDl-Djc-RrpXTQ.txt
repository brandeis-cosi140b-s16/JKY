"Come to mama" salsa verde....thick and spicy! Oh so good. 

First time eating at this glorified Mexican food truck. We had the steak tacos, ordered as a flight, which came with a tapa, chips, salsa and a drink...all for $7.99. 

We chose the chicken empanada for our tapa, which was good....served on shredded lettuce with a Mexican crema and a tasty chipotle mayo. Next time, I'm going to try the ham and cheese croquetas. They looked really good.

The steak taco was amazingly delish! The beef was well marinated and super tender. The flour tortilla was fresh and chewy, with a dry floury texture on the outside. Taco was served with lettuce, tomato, mancheca and guac. The tacos are small ( a little bigger than a street taco) but pared with a tapa, should be fine for lunch. 

The green chips were delish. Not oily at all, fresh and crisp. We chose salsa verde, but there were about 4 or 5 other salsas to choose from. The green salsa was like nothing I've ever seen. I thought it was guac at first, because it's that thick. One small container just didn't seem enough for the big bag of chips.

We parked and walked up to their window, but In the summer, drive through is a must, because you bake in the outside seating. No inside seating available.

So glad after a year of saying I have to try this place, I finally did. Seems like it's always crowded, but line moves pretty quickly as do the orders. I sometimes see Groupons come up for this place, so keep an eye out. 

We'll back very soon!
