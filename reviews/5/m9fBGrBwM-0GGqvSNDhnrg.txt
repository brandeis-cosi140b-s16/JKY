Don't let the sparse patrons deter you it just means Sabor is  undiscovered and the chef/co-owner can spend quality time preparing your meal. I thoroughly enjoyed every bite of my Guaijllo Scallops. The California enchiladas would not be a dish that sets them apart from others, so  I would try items more unique to their menu.

They also have a long bar with a good happy hour ending at 7.
