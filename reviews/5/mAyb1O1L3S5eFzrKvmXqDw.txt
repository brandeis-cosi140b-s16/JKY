Very good Mexican food at a very good price. Super casual atmosphere, with telenovelas playing at seeming all times. Always walk away full and content. We like the enchiladas in particular. I go with the verde sauce, which has plenty of kick. The red sauce is practically volcanic. Warning: no booze.
