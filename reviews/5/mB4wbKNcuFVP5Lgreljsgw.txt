WOWWEEEE!!!!  This is the best taco I have had outside of Mexico in a long time.  Let's start with the salsa.  Amazing stuff, they have a full salsa bar with a variety of homemade salsas.  Each as tasty as the next!  The chips are cooked to order.  The guac is fresh, delicious and not overly mixed, so it's like homemade!  

I was excited at the prospect of ordering everything ala carte rather than being served a pound of beans and rice with everything (although that is an option here).  I ordered up four tacos, the carne asada, al pastor, barbacoa and the chicken (marinated and smoked in adoba sauce).  I really can't say what was better.   The meat is plentiful and they have bold flavors.  You don't even need the salsa, but I recommend it because there are some really spicy salsas to get your nose running!

Finally some Mexican street tacos that taste like a Mexican taco.  Very reasonably priced.  They serve all their meats as tacos, burritos, and quesadillas.  They even offered menudo, chorizo, Chile relleno and even a 21 day dry-aged prime ribeye dinner, so they do it all!  

If you want amazing Mexican food, in a taco shop atmosphere, but with amazing flavor this is it!  Tired of the usual bland Berto's places?  Me too!  You can't beat these guys!  A definite must for taco lovers!
