I was looking to try some place new for lunch and found this place while browsing Yelp. Based on the other reviews I decided to give it a try.

I am so glad I did as the service and food was amazing. I was greeted by a very friendly employee and even though I was only ordering to-go she offered me a seat and some free chips and salsa while I waited for my order to be prepared. I ordered two pupusas (one cheese and one pork) and they were easily the best pupusas I have ever had.

They make all of their salsa in house and they were even nice enough to label the ones I received as either for my chips or my pupusas since they had different salsas for each.

I will be going back here soon as the whole menu looked pretty tasty, and luckily for me they are a five minute drive from my house.
