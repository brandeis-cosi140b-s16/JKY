Going to Three Amigos on Saturday for a UYE was bittersweet. On one hand it was frickin fantastic but on the other, I've been in Charlotte for five years and never experienced this place before--what gives? 

I try not to judge a book by it's cover but sometimes you got to with restaurants and looking at Three Amigos, I really didn't expect much. I drove up and asked myself "Is this the right Three Amigos?" and as soon as other Yelpers came in, realized I got the right one.

What can I say that others haven't? Probably not much but the highlights
*Mexican Coca-Cola-this stuff rivals McDonald's Coca-Cola (aka the best Coke in the world)
*Tortilla chips fried to perfect with a bit of seasoning on them
*Guacamole so smooth and creamy that I wanted to break out some Gerardo and start singing "Rico Suave"
*Meals that could feed a small nation. Seriously. I ordered the chilaquiles verde with two fried eggs and feel like I could do some bicep curls with my leftover box. 
*Cheap prices. Said plate that could feed a nation was $5.99. What the hell?? I love it and again, sad that I haven't been going to Three Amigos all along.
*Friendly staff and owner--they kept stopping by, making sure everything was to our liking--the service couldn't have been more spot on
*People watching. Oh yes, it was good.

Now if they would have cardboard figures of Chevy Chase, Steve Martin and Martin Short-I would be in heaven.

 Te amo Three Amigos!!
