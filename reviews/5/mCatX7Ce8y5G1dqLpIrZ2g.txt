We came here for my husbands bday.  We were too late for reservations, but came early to get a table for 20 people.  We waited at the bar and the bar keeps and patrons were so much fun.  Food was great too. I had chile rello de pollo. Not fried at all! And frozen margarita was good too.  Best Mexican food in the area for sure.
