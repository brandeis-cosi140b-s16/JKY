Hands down the best taco experience I've ever had and this is coming from someone that's born and raised in Los Angeles. Anyone outside of Vegas visiting needs to come here as it is worth the drive off the strip! Asada, barbacoa and carnitas were ridiculously moist with loads of flavor! Can't go wrong with tacos or a burrito but you're better off getting tacos as you can try more than one meat to find your weapon of choice.  And save room for an Elote/corn on the cob!!!!
