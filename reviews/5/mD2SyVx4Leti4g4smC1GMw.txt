My daughters and I stopped in here on a whim one afternoon and fell in love. This tiny, hole in the wall joint is truly a gem. We've made it our #1 stop for delicious Mexican food and find it hard to go anywhere else! The family that owns (and operates) this tiny, tasty restaurant are always super friendly and treat their customers like family. Best horchata EVERRR!
