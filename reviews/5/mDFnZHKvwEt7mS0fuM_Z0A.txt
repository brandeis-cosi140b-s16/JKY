I want to take this Taco Shop home with me. 

This is the first Mexican place I've been to where they had a little "hot sauce" bar. Sort of like a salad bar for hot sauces, veggies for your tacos, and those awesome jalapenos, onions & carrots.

I had the steak taco, torta, & chimichanga...all top notch delicious! They didn't skip a beat in the way they marinated their meat, the pico de gallo they added and all the extra toppings. 

Plus, they're open 24 hours and have a drive thru. 

Love you Roberto.
