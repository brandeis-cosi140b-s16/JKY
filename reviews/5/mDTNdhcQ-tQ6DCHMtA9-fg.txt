Its REALLY good. My best friend and I came in on a Monday night a little less then an hour before closing. It wasn't really busy, there were about 4-5 other tables occupied. Service was exceptional (6 stars!). The staff was so friendly, through out the entire meal. We lost track of time talking and didn't realize that all the patrons had left and that it was waaay past closing (45 minutes +) and no one rushed us out. Even after we left and were getting in our car, someone came out just to say thanks and to have a good evening. On top of the outstanding service, the food was excellent and well priced. The complimentary chips and salsa came with beans and grilled onions and peppers. We ordered the guacamole and fajita steak nachos. Margaritas were only $4.50. Everything we ordered was delish! I highly recomment this place for a casual spot for good food and sipping on margaritas.
