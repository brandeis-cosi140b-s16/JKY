Everyone in here is very kind and helpful. The food is exactly what I expect. I enjoy having a variety of burrito options and I'm thrilled Tijuana Flats is back in the area. This is not Chipotle. Chipotle is delicious too, but variety is awesome. People complain over the silliest things. I'm just glad there are more options other than fried food or big chains coming to Concord Mills. And I'd like to see Tijuana Flats remain the the area! I'll continue to be a regular. 

I typically get a bowl to avoid the extra carbs in the tortilla. The contents are always good and the sauce options are great!
