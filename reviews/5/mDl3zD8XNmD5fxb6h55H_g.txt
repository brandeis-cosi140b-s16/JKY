You need to check this place out!!
I pass by Rosa's every day for work and have always wanted to try it, so we decided to check it out tonight. I was very impressed. The atmosphere is great and really well decorated and the food and service was fantastic! We were on our way out, very satisfied, and ran into the new owner who introduced himself to us and stopped to talk for several minutes. Cory, the owner, was very nice and is excited about creating a great restaurant. I am very confident it will only continue to get better under his leadership.

I have never been more impressed by a restaurant experience and will definitely be coming back and bringing friends!
