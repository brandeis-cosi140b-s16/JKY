Came with the boyfriend to have lunch Sunday afternoon. I ordered a salad. I'm a HUGE Chipotle fan so I always rate my salads from places like this (aka Mexican American grill joints) based on what I like from chipotle. Anywho. I ordered a shredded beef salad and it was pretty delicious! The option of shredded cabbage was a big plus for me. If I was to combated it to chipotle it would say it tops it for sure.
