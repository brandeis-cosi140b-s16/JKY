Dan or no Dan this place is still amazing!! I actually found the service to be on point! They are actually giving more lemons with your meal than before (there's no one controlling the amount of lemons they give out anymore). Food is still awesome! Now they have churros. I actually wish they were open now because I'm jonesing for some lengua tacos uhmmm... Anyways make sure you check this place out!
