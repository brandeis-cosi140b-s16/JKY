Oh my gosh these fajitas are to die for.   The tortillas are hand made, hot and fresh.  I love the veggie fajitas -- they come heaped on a sizzling pan - peppers, onions, black olives, all caramelized and topped with seasoned grilled zucchini. The onions and peppers are WAY better even than the ones you get with the meat veggies, so everyone always steals mine. But there's plenty! Tell them you're vegan and they sub guacamole for the cheese and sour cream on the condiment dish, free of charge. I love this place!
