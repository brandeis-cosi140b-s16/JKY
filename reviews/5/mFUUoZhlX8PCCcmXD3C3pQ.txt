I tend to go to all the locations they have here in phoenix. But this is my favorite one, since I live near it. The first thing that will grab your attention, is the employees. They have what are perhaps the nicest, most Courteous employees that can be found! They blow you away with the hospitality here. 
The food here is also ridiculously flavorful, and delicious. I usually always get the Tortas, but when I bring friends along, or the wife they all get different things. I have tried just about everything here. The aguas, and fantastic. I've only ever had one issue, but it was not at this location but at the cave creek one. It seems that sometime the Pi√±a Coladas are made differently. But other than that always great food. Try the licuados!
Last but not least, the employees. The waitresses, and especially the hostesses are the definition of hospitality. They treat you like you are part of their family!
