We were in town for the weekend and wanted to grab a quick dinner before heading back to Cali. We found this on yelp and decided to try it out, and we were NOT DISAPPOINTED! I ordered and Cali Burrito, and it was made to perfection. The carne asada was cooked just right, the tortilla tasted homemade, and there was also fries in it which was the cherry on top. My lovely wife and I are definitely planning on coming back next time we're in town. I highly recommend it!
