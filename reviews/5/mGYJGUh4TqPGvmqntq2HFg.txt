Went for a girls long weekend and stayed at Luxor, so, this was a perfect place to go within decent walking distance.  One of the girls in our party is Gluten free, and they offer several GF options which, also includes their chips (which are ridiculously delicious).  Their prices are similar to a decent Mexican restaurant in BOS which, was great.  I am not big on Mexican Food, at all.  I strip what everyone loves out of the meals and eat basically the protein, the carb and the cheese, I love the flavors.  With that said, the Queso Fundido is AH-MAZZZZ-ING.  This is a MUST try!  I ordered the carne quesadilla with only the carne and the cheese (no onions, guac, salsa, etc.).  This CAN be shared with someone else, the portion is huge.  It is cut into 6 slices, in fact, I took half of it to go.  Actually, this went for all of our meals, so, try to share what you can to avoid leftovers, especially if you do not have a micro in your hotel.  This is in no way a negative criticism, for $19, it is the perfect size.  The drinks were great, I did the Cadillac Margarita, it was so good, I had to try it twice.. = ) 

Our waiter was Michael, he was attentive, and very knowledgeable and considerate to my friends Gluten Free allergy.  In fact, I put the flour tortilla from the queso on top of the chips and he has pointed out that I "contaminated" the chips (jokingly of course..) and brought her "her own chips that no one else should touch".  He was very witty and made us laugh.  If you love Mexican, give this place a whirl.  We sat on the covered patio and it was breathtaking.
