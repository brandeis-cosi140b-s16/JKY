Went on an office-lunch adventure looking for Mexican food in Charlotte.  Came upon this joint:  warning, this is  mainly a carnicer√≠a (butchers shop) with NO seating whatsoever.

Walking in, my group was immediately offered samples of the meats: shredded pork, beef and many other options.  The free samples came with tortillas and were equivalent to an entire taco.  

I plan to go back for the pork, buying in bulk and taking it back to the office.. Plenty of Mexican drinks available to take away from cola to cerveza.  Super cheap.

I left not buying anything more than $5 bucks worth of Cokes since we were looking for a sit down meal, and felt guilty.. The samples were free and they wouldn't take any money for them!
