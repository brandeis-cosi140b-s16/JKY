"YAAAAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!" -my reaction upon hearing Salvatore's was opening on E Johnson

But seriously, Salvatore's will forever change how you think about pizza. Their slogan of "All Wisco, no Sysco" and their commitment to using only local ingredients sets them apart from the competition. 

The dining room is very small, so if you have your heart set on eating there, be prepared to wait 30-45 min on a busy night. Alternatively, you could get carry-out, which tastes just as great. Johnson Public House apparently lets people eat pizza in their space (presumably with the purchase of a coffee or other beverage; I think they have beer too) which is probably the better option.

If you get a large pizza, you have the option of doing 2 flavors on one pie. The Fig & Bacon and El Mapache Loco were real winners. To be fair, bacon goes great with everything, and fig on a pizza is not as crazy as it seems. The Mapache had adobo chicken, roasted poblanos, potatoes, and queso fresco on it, and was definitely my favorite (and also because our waitress told us that Mapache Loco means 'crazy raccoon' in Spanish).

Next time you are thinking about ordering from Domino's, slap yourself in the face and go to Salvatore's instead. You're welcome.
