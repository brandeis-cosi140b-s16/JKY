I've always wanted to try Pinches Tacos but their Las Vegas location was in Downtown. As a local, I try to avoid going to the strip or the old strip for that matter because of traffic. So imagine my excitement when I learned that they opened a new location in Spring Valley! 

My boyfriend and I went here for dinner last night (Wednesday). We were immediately greeted by who we later on learned as "Javier", one of the Anaya brothers - creator of the awesome Gringos Tacos. He gave us a couple of suggestions from their menu so we decided to get the combo to be able to try almost most of it: Gringos, AlPastor, Asada, Shrimp and Fish Tacos. Everything tasted wonderful! It was so delicious we told everyone we know that they must try this place. 

However their grand opening might not be until mid-November (or so we're told), so if you do decide to swing by, just remember to BYOB. Overall, this place has impressive food and it's always a plus when you are treated like family. This will definitely keep us coming back for more!
