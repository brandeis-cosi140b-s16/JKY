I first heard about them at the Roadrunner Park Farmer's Market (on Cactus near the 51), a while back. I tried a sample, as they are gluten free, not many things are at the market. They were delicious! Ended up purchasing quite a few, including some pumpkin dessert tamales, which were really good as well. They come in a 2-pack and what I really like is the convenience of a tamale. They heat up quickly and are great for a fast dinner or to take to work for a quick lunch on a busy day. Add some tortilla chips, maybe a little salsa and/or guacamole and boom, instant meal. YUM-O award!
