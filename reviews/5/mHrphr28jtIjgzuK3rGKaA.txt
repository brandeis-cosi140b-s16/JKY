Wow what can I say!  I have going to the 18th ave location for years, but this was my 1st venture to this one, and I am glad we went.  It was lunch, 11:45am and the place was PACKED!  We were seated quickly and orders taken.  The server was friendly and efficient.   The chips were warm and tasty, the salsa was great.  I had a cheese enchilada and a mole-covered tamale and it was incredible... all for about $8.   I was ready to bust I was so full and will go back any time.
