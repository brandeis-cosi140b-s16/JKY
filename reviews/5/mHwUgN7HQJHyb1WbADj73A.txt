This place is my new favorite for Tacos!!! We came on tuesday and got $2 tacos that were out of this world! The rice and beans had so much flavor, and I don't ever like beans but it was only $2 to add them to the tacos! They have a raspberry hibiscus tea that is the best I've had in Arizona and they have hand squeezed mint lemonade, delicious horchata, southwest limeade, and stevia sweetened lemonade!  I could go on but I won't,  just try it!! :)
