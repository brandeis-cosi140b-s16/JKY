Delicious!  Loved this very authentic mexican food.  The waitresses are friendly, but it's obvious that english isn't their first language.  It was very nice that a 2nd waitress came by to confirm our order.

Only negative comments are that we asked for ice tea and instead got sweet tea.  Also, the 2 baby highchairs we looked at had broken straps.  Otherwise, it was great.  I'm sorry I hadn't tried this restaurant sooner.  I can see why it has so many positive reviews.  I think they may be open only for breakfast and lunch.
