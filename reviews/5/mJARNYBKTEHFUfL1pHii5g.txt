If you're driving the Apache Trail I would really recommend stopping in for some prickly pear gelato. It's absolutely delicious. If you can stop for lunch I would really recommend the chili in the bread bowl. The atmosphere is pretty cool too, the wallpaper is a bunch of dollar bills plastered all over the wall that people have drawn all over and they played a bunch of old Hank Williams music when I was there.
