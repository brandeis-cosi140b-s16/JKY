Wow is all I can say! We have been waiting and waiting for this restaurant to open.  We know about Tia Rosa's from their location in Mesa.  It was worth the wait!  The inside looks like an old castle with so much detail.  There are arched brick ceilings, amazing tile work and awesome authentic light fixtures.  
AND the food was outstanding.  I had my favorite the low carb plate with all three meats.  I just love that I can go to a mexican restaurant and feel like I am getting something somewhat healthy.  The meat is to die for!  
The service was excellent as well.  Usually when a new restaurant opens, it takes a little while for the everything to flow appropriately.  We were greeted immediately by our server who really knew the menu and also had chips and two kinds of salsa upon sitting down.  It sure is interesting how the chips really do disappear quickly, but as soon as we had one basket down they had another at our table.  Outstanding service!  
This will definitely be one of our regular spots!
