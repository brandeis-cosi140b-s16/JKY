I grew up going to Caramba for a quick lunch and basically all of my high school functions were catered by them. 

The nachos with chicken are amazing!  Totally loaded up, hard to find chip that is not covered in gooey goodness.

The catering is also very reasonable and great tasting. I grabbed some beans and rice to go along with our homemade enchiladas last night for an event and they did not disappoint.
Just wish they would branch out of the NW valley a bit and add a spot in downtown phx!
