Excellent.  From the moment you walk in staff greet you with a friendly hello.  You have your choice between a "mini" taco with choice of meat, onions, and cilantro or a "regular" taco with more toppings.  I had the Pork Carnitas and it was fantastic.  Hubby had the carne asada and it was ok, but not as good as the Pork.  Overall good food, good price, and friendly service.
