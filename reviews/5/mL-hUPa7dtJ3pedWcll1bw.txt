Qdoba is just another cheap Mexican place (very similar to Chipotle) but it's still really good!

Expect the usual combinations of rice, bean, meat, etc... but they have a wider variety of choices like taco salads and quesidillas too.

The place was clean and the staff was quick, helpful and polite.  Plus Qdoba offers a frequent buyers card and you can redeem your "points" for free food.  Eveybody like free food!
