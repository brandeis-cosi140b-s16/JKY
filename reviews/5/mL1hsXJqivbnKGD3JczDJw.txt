Heard of "Don't judge a book by its cover", well if you saw the outside or where this restaurant is located you'll think to yourself this place can't have good food but let me tell everything on their menu is like homemade at least I believe they are...  :). Our family favorite is their green chilie burrito, it's so spicy that you mouth will burn but at the same time you don't want to stop eatting it because it is sooooo good.  It's addicting.  Must try!!!
