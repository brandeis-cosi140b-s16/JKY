I loooved it ! The service was even better, than most places ! I felt as if i was back at home with how great they treated &lets not forget about the food, it was amazing. I ordered the number 4 combo & that carne asada burrito was very juicy& filling . the rice was my all time favorite, & I'm not a big rice person ! I will definitely be back ! I highly recommend this place if you're looking for some real authentic New Mexican food !
