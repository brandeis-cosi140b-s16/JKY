The food was good.  It took about 13 min. to get the other half of our order and then it was wrong so had had to wait another 3 min.  It was pretty busy but there was 2 mistakes on my order.  One from the cashier and one from the cook.  Will I come back?  Probably so because I like their chicken and coupons!
