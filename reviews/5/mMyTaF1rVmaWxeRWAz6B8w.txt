Right off the bat, we liked the decor and atmosphere. Not too loud, casual, and not overly decorated as many Mexican restaurants can be. Our waiter, Freddie, had a great personality and made jokes keeping it interesting. They give an extra small soda pitcher so you're never out. Kept checking on us, food was great. Boyfriend had the diablo steak which has a spicy sauce he raved about. Mom had the chile colorado and said meat was perfectly tender, sauce was fairly good but not the absolute best. I had the chicken burrito and I couldn't complain- simple and good. My margarita was good, didn't specify a size and was given a medium which was pretty big.. Only $10! We will definitely be back. :)
