I'm from Oakland , CA and visiting Phoenix for the first time to meet my friend who is living in New Zealand.

 I'm huge into local, artisan,  and organic farm to table food with high quality meats and make it a huge priority in my diet.

 I decided to stay at the Clarendon in part because of my research into the good scene at Phoenix and reading  the extremely good reviews of Tranquilo. I take yelp reviews with a grain of salt to manage my expectations, but Tranquilo completely blew my friend and I away with the impeccable kind service and extremely high quality value of delicious food. They use cast iron here , no microwaves and are proud to source their dishes from local farms and high quality butcher shops. Even without the free breakfast vouchers, the meals are an absolute steal for what you get. It made a very picky East Bay SF food snob very happy.

Jacob, the manager was super sweet and accommodating to my possibly strange requests. Jacob was super passionate about the food and incredibly welcoming to a new visitor. He told us where the food was sourced and gave all sorts of cool recommendations on other places around town.

 I also love that they are gluten free friendly and have Grass fed beef. We are definitely getting breakfast there tomorrow!!! 

 I'm excited to come back to Phoenix with my boyfriend and friends  and stay at the Clarendon. 

I am so impressed and surprised that Phoenix is now the place to go for high quality farm to table food without Bay Area prices!
