I freaking love this place. I haven't been back in forever, as i now live on the opposite side of town. Menu is huge,  offering something for even the pickiest of eaters. Food is amazing, table-side guac is to die for,  service has always been top-notch. Don't even get me started on the margaritas.. they're delicious and made perfectly. I've celebrated mine and my daughter's birthday here,  and they always make it fun! Side note,  the view is AMAZING!!
