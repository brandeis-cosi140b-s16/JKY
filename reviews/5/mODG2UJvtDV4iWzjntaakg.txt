I thoroughly enjoyed this place.  My boyfriend and I were visiting Scottsdale for the weekend and I found this place on yelp.  It caught my attention with the fun atmosphere and the drinks!  I saw a picture of the salty chihuahua which is like a spicy margarita and I was sold!  We arrived on a Sunday but earlier in the day when there were less people.  But when we left I could tell the party was just about to get started.  We got carne asada fries and being from San Diego, where we basically INVENTED them, :) I was pleasantly surprised. They added like a green chile or nopales on top which I thought was a cute Arizonian touch. Our bartender/server was really awesome and attentive not to mention drop dead gorgeous. The girls that work here are all really pretty. Props to her though because she was so attentive and I really appreciate that. She had like a blue and green bikini top that looks like a bra. Anyway, such a cool area to visit if you're in scottsdale for the weekend and want to PARTY! :)
