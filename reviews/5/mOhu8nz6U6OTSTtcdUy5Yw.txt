I found this place in high school/college days 10-15 years ago, used to eat here all the time. Moved out of the area a long time ago and just visited my dad nearby, remembered this place and came back and it was just as awesome as I recalled. The food is very authentic and delicious, always fast and piping hot. Everything on the menu is good and worth getting. The guys behind the counter are crazy nice, they treat my little girl like family. Hey, the area is a bit seedy and it's location is a little out of the way but the food and service are top quality.
