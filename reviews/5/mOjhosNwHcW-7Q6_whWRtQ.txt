Smoked brisket was tender with very little fat - excellent flavor. Just right amount of smokiness, tender with a peppery finish. It melts in your mouth. Choice of four sauces-we tried the Mexican Hot and the Mud. The bun held together and was perfect. Excellent fare! Cole slaw a little sweet - not my fave. Thank you for a delicious meal.
