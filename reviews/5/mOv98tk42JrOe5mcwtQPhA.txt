WELCOME TO MOE'S!! Love this place! Super close to where I work, and the $5 specials on Mondays on ALL burritos (yes, even the Homewrecker) are enough to keep me going back each week. I still need to figure out how they fold those darned things when they're THAT BIG so I can do this at home without a mess! :) They fill the burritos up with as much "stuff" as you want, enough for two full meals for me. And they have chips and a salsa bar. Their fresh guac is FANTASTIC and you really can't beat their service there! Always welcoming, always helpful, and superfast-this is the perfect place to grab a quick bite for a heck of a deal!
