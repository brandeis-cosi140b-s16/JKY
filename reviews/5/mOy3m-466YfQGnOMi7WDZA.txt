This is by far the best Mexican restaurant in LAS VEGAS. Being of Mexican decent, I grew up eating Mexican food made by my mother who was a superb cook in her own right, so I have something to compare to. I rate a restaurant on the food, everything else is just filler. The neighborhood is older & mainly Mexican. This place is my favorite Mexican restaurant in all of the Las Vegas Valley. I have recommended it to all my friends.                                                                                                                                                                          First of all you get the requisite chips & salsa. One can order the signature dish of either chicken, beef, the combo which is chicken, beef, & shrimp,  or the seafood combo which has shrimp & octopus. In the same bowl you also get roasted peppers, nopales (cactus), lime wedge, radish (not turnips), a square of Queso cotija, a slice of tomato, slice of avocado & grilled mexican onions. Everything is covered in a superb red sauce. They all taste excellent and come served piping hot in the namesake Molecajeta, the stone vessel made of volcanic rock shaped like a bowl. You get more than enough tortillas to eat with. You can eat fajita style by putting the ingredients of choice in a tortilla or use the tortilla to eat straight out of the Molecajeta. There is an enormous amount of food for one to eat. In fact i've yet  to finish an entire meal in one seating. I always take some home for later. The staff is very friendly & helpful. The menu comes in English & Spanish for the Spanish challenged amongst us.  There are other choices on the menu beside the above mentioned. My son prefers the tacos, be it fish, carne asada, or carnitas. The have seafood also on the menu which is also excellent. They serve beer & soda. On weekends they have roving musicians that play mexican music for money. There are also vendors who can be annoying at times selling CD's, DVD's & various trinkets. Just tell them no & they will leave you alone. Cash is king here. Don't forget to tip.
