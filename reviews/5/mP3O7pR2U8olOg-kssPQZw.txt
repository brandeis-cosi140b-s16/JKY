Loved the food. I have been a few times and every item I have ever ordered is fresh, hot and really good. Only complaint is my cabesa mini tacos were average. I like more substance to my cabesa tacos. Other than that, DELICIOSO. Great salsa, clean restaurant, friendly staff. Oh... And their dishes can be made Gluten-free! Yay for Celiac friendly restaurants!!
