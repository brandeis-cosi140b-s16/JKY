Only 229 reviews, so I'll add another one!  I found this on Yelp, and it was only 4 miles from my hotel downtown, so I had to try it.  Best tacos I've ever had!  I ordered a chicken flour taco, a beef corn taco, and a chicken lettuce taco, and was served complimentary chips, salsa, and guac, along with bottled costco water, and the check was $5.25!  I ordered different variations of Tacos all 4 times I went, so I can't comment on the rest of the menu, but both friends I brought with me during my later visits loved it as much as I did!

If you are in Vegas, don't skip this place!!
