I've been to Los Dos a few times in recent months, and I am reminded every time I go that I love this place.  Margaritas are amazing, the food is so good and authentic and spicy, and the ambiance is awesome.  The service always sucks, so if you have an impatient mother-in-law, take her elsewhere.  Now that you know that, it is absolutely worth it.  pop an extra xanax, slug down a margarita on the patio (if, of course, you have a sense of reckless abandon and good health insurance) and wait for the glory.  If the words "Machaca Crispies" are on the specials board, ask for at least two of them.  Even if you are by yourself.  Especially if you are by yourself.  Everything on the menu is tasty; you really can't go wrong.  I brought my mother, sister and her two babies here.  When my mother asked the overly busy waiter which of the salsas were mild, I was tickled when he took a moment of his time to look at her with mildly disgusted contempt and reply, "Neither."  For that, five stars.
