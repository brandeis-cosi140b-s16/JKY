Even though Filbertos has been around forever, this was my first time to the local one by my home. My family has talked about it for a while now. 

My wife got the # 20 which was an enchillada and taco, I got way to much food I tried there burito, which is now in my fridge to eat sometime later on, I got a chicken taco, and beef taco. 

Wow there was soooo much food, the price was awesome. If you order right you can easily spend $10 for two people, and be stuffed. 

I would highly reccomend this place for the ammount of food and the quality for the price was really good, I was very impressed. 

This is also a great place for drunk food, I am now looking forward to having some drinks with my family and friends and going to this place after for $5-6 and being stuffed. I love good drunk food places, and I could tell this is one of them.
