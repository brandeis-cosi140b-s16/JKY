What a concept this place is. Two countries' flavors that play off of the other so well.  I love Lomo Saltado, so naturally I was bound to love this place.  I have to make a visit there every time I stop by these. I haven't had a bad dish there, as is Jose Andres fashion.  Get the 20 vegetable fried rice.  The dish is an amalgamation of so many different flavors that somehow just go so damned well together that you'll wonder why you don't see more Chinese-Mexican babies out there.  Yeah, it's that good.
