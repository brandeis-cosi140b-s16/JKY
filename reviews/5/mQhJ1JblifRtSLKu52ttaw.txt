I stopped by "Big City Burrito" as I was walking to Wendy's to get a chocolate frosty and a Double Stack. I was only going to check out the menu to see if there was something that I may want to try on a future trip. It smelled so good in the restaurant that I decided to skip Wendy's and get something at BCB. I was going to get a bean and cheese burrito until I realized that they didn't have refried beans. No problem. There are lots of places where I can buy a bean burro, enchilada style. I had a breakfast burro with eggs, potatoes, cheese, bacon, and chorizo. It was excellent. It was something I haven't had in a long time. It was likely twelve(?) times larger than the breakfast burritos that you get at McDonald's for $1.00. I look forward to going there again. I read that parking is difficult unless your an ASU student. I personally parked at Apache Blvd. and Price at the Park & Ride. I then took the light rail west to the station at Rural Rd, and walked south to it's location. There is also a southbound #72 Scottsdale Rd/Rural bus that can get you from the light rail station to Rural and Apache Blvd. You can then walk west to the restaurant at Paseo Exchange at Vista Del Sol, which is just east of McAllister Avenue on the south side of Apache Blvd (681 E Apache Blvd.). I have to leave the library now. I will check this review for errors later. I also took about fifty photos of "Big City Burrito" with the owner's permission. When time allows, I may tweek some of them to make them lighter, etc.
