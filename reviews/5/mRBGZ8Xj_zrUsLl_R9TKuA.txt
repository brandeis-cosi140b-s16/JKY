I picked this place because it came up on yelp with raving reviews and it was close to my hotel.  I get a lot of Mexican food- and some of the best considering I live in California and have bestie who's mom cooks from scratch.  This place is a hidden gem.  At the recommendation of my amazing server I ordered a few things off the menu, I started with a glass of Horchata, a pork and steak taco, and sides of beans, rice and guacamole- it was all delicious, but the tacos were so delicious I had to order two more.  The salsas were also delicious... I can't wait to return tomorrow night and try something new...  I went back- and the day after as well.  I had the pork torta, the fish taco, the tres leches cake.  The salsas are amazing.  On Wednesday they had a little flamenco show and the ambiance was fun and inviting.  My server each night was a girl named Stacey, and she was extraordinary- and the rest of the staff was all accomodating and friendly.  I felt like a regular, even though I was just there a few days.  Order the Tres Leches cake early- it's popular and they might run out.
