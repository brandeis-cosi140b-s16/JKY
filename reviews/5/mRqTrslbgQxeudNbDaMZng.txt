We ate there last night.  Noticed the outside looks inviting.  Nice comfortable booths and tables inside.  It's small but that's what so charming about the place.  The option of 3 sauces with your chips is totally amazing.  I tried them all and ended up mixing them.  I just wonder what happens to them after people are done???  are they recycled???  The waiter was attentative and the food was very flavorful, too. Very large soft drinks.   Hand made items.  I think it cost a little over $20 for two adults.
