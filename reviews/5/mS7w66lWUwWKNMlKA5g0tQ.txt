This was the first time I came here... 
This place is nice and spacious... It has a very relaxed feel to it...

The servers were very nice and looked happy to be there... That I feel contributes a lot to the meal experience.

l am not expert in mexican food, but the chili rellenos we ordered were the best ones we have ever had.
