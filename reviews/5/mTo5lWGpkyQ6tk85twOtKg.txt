I've finally found a legit Mexican restaurant in Vegas plus it's fast food & has a drive-thru window! Food is delish! I always order the carne asada taco combo lunch special, even during nonlunch hours. They make the exception & always provide speedy service. Great prices & food! Wayyyyy better than Roberto's.
