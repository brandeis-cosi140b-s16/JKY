First time here. Food was great and I'll definitely be back to try some variety. I do like how they are working on a healthier menu as well but will accommodate if you ask for a bowl or less oil, that type of thing. My biggest take away was the superb service. I've never experienced anything like it, especially from a taco shop in a gas station. The owner Ben knew every person that walked in there by name. You can tell he's a great sales person but not shady and genuinely cares about his customers. He has some interesting ideas and I know he'll do great things. Went in for 3 tacos and had a 2 hour conversation with the owner. It's almost like a networking spot. I'm usually not a very social person when meeting new people but this was a great experience and I'm referring everyone I know. Thanks again to Ben and his crew!
