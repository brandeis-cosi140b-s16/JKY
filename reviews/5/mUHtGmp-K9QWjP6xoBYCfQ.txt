This place has been a family staple of ours since it was in Phoenix. I think my older sister only comes home at Christmas for the fridge stocked with green chile mixed burros. Make sure you try their guacamole & salsa they are by far the best around and can make your Taco Tuesday at home really special. The service is always top notch and we are welcomed like long lost family.
