My family was looking for good Mexican  food but for the budget of a family of 7.  We were greeted right away and our drinks came quickly. The restaurant was very clean as well. 

We liked that their was a children's menu and a great selection of food. We had the Parrillada's and they were amazing!!!  Lots of food, great prices and quick service. We want to add a special thank you to Dennis, a regular at Habanero's who was especially kind to our family. Thank you!!  We will visit again.
