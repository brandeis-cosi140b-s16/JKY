Although we had to wait over a half-hour to be seated, (which we expected because it was a Friday) the service was fast, efficient, and excellent! I enjoyed the Pollo Fundido with the award winning house Margarita! 
We sat outside near the heaters and it was absolutely beautiful!! 
Definitely will be back soon!
