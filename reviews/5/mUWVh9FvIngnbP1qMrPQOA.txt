Delicious tacos! $6something for 3 tacos beans and rice and a mini salad. So good! Me and my husband both had the carne Assad tacos and they were good! My husband said his was kinda dry, but the flavor was there. Don't come here looking for a posh environment because it's not. It's a good ol taqueria and I wouldn't change a thing.

Parking lot is a little small, and it's kind of hard to spot the place at first glance but once you make it in there you'll be glad you tried them out! The red salsa is better than the green one, and they have Pepsi in a bottle! :)
