Okay perhaps it's only 4 stars but I have to counteract people who give it 1 for silly reasons.  Not authentic Mexican?  Perhaps not standard but Mexico is a big place.  Had vegi enchiladas and my wife had vegi fajitas.  Delicious,  fresh, crunchy vegetables.   Nicely flavored, not too spicy.  I may ask for some jalape√±os sliced next time, I like spicy.  Hesitated because of yelp but the place is always packed.  There is a reason. Give it a try.
