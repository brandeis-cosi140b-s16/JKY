Le√±ero Mexican Grill is a new Mexican restaurant tucked into a corner next to Egg I Am.  My family and I discovered it on a recent Sunday morning and it's become our new "goto" brunch and weekday Mexican destination.
The food is great, the service is attentive and personal, and the chef will happily make something "off menu."  There's a full bar (great margaritas and bloody-Mary's!) with daily happy hour specials on food and drink, and the ambiance is nice enough to take a date.
Scottsdale's winter residents haven't discovered this hidden gem, so it's still possible to get seated for brunch or dinner right away.
The few restaurants in this location failed pretty quickly, so check it out before we lose a great Mexican option in the neighborhood.
