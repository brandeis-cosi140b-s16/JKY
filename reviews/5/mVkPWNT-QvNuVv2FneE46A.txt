I love Mexican food so I had to try some while I was in an area with so many Hispanics; this place was close and had good reviews so I chose it. I ordered 4 different tacos, one al pastor, carne asada, carnitas, and lengua. They were all very good and the al pastor tacos had pineapple (a very good sign). There was a lot of meat on all of the tacos. I also ordered agua de jamaica, which was homemade and delicious. Overall, I would definitely recommend this place!
