La Hacienda is one of the best - if not the best Mexican restaurant in town. Casual dining. Good prices. Helpful staff. I have been eating here for years and I highly recommend the place. My favorites are the enchiladas, nachos, or fajitas. I hear the margaritas are amazing as well. The decor is sub par - and the salsa isn't my favorite but, overall La Hacienda is delicious!
