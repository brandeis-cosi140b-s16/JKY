I've only been in Tempe for 4 days, but I've already been here twice--once a tad inebriated, once completely sober. And both times, I was pretty blown away. 

The portions are beyond generous, cheap, and come with a variety of toppings depending on what you order: cabbage or jalapeno, cilantro and onion  or onions, tomato and guacamole. In addition, this one of the few restaurants (certainly of the fast-food ilk) that offer lengua or beef tongue. Their beef tongue taco was tasty, rich, greasy and fabulous--producing in me the mixture of bliss and self-loathing than can only be matched by the consumption of a Cinnabon.

Filibertos on Apache Boulevard is right across the street from me. And it's open 24 hours. I forsee many future visits for me, particularly when a little sloshed and starving--a time when I would much prefer some greasy cow tongue in my mouth than the tongue of a hot blonde.

Well...except for January Jones.
