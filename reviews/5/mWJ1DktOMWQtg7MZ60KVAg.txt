Lindo Michoacan is my favorite place in Las Vegas for Mexican food.  The view at the Carnegie location is amazing too.

My favorite dish here is the camarones sarandeados which is a lovely shrimp dish that is not too spicy.  Their enchiladas and steak dishes are very good also.  If you're in the mood for dessert, the fried ice cream is huge and very yummy.  The flan was also very nice.
