I give them 5 stars because I there is no 1/2 point. They are excellent. I bumped up to 5 because the service was so friendly and the food really was worthy of 5 stars. My only MINOR sadness was no cilantro for my menudo (I forgot to ask and should have-can't fault them). I ordered the barbacoa taco (beef cheek) EXCELLENT--flavorful with onions, cilantro and a squeeze of lime to cut the richness. No skimping on the meat here, either! The menudo is some of the best I've had. No "gamey" flavor. Rich, flavor broth, tender tripe,  Mexican oregano (I have never seen that offered on the side before!) and the bread--the aroma wafted from the bag and was intoxicating!! I wish I had asked for cilantro and some cabbage, but again..my fault. And the "piece de resistance" NACHOS I deviated from the usual carne asada and got the shredded beef because it just sounded good. These are better than "Bob's" on SOOOO many levels!!  1: The chips - Fresher, not greasy, better flavor and enough salt. (and more of them). 2. The beans Not a glob of refried beans! Actual pinto beans and delicious at that! 3. The beef Tons of it, tender, flavorful, delicious. 4 excellent pico de gallo. 5. fresh guacamole evenly dispersed 5.what tastes like mexican crema again, even dispersed across the nachos. 6 Finally, and this is a biggie for me COTIJA cheese, not cheddar. Cheddar is greasy--cotija is not. It is a white tasty cheese. Their salsas are also really good they have a red and green, neither overly spicy, but flavorful. I am sure they have some hot stuff, and I can't wait to return to try more, just didn't want to seem a pig my first visit :)
