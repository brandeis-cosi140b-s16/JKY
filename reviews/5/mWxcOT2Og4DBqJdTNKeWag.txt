My favorite place in the valley!  Mostly because it is next door to where I live but have ALWAYS had a good time here.  Some people in the Scottsdale/Chandler area do not like it because it is not exactly the "Scottsdale" crowd, much more laid back. You don't have to dress up in heels to go either, flip flops are fine on Friday and Saturday nights.  But if you are in heels, beware of actual sand outside. Bartenders are always friendly, just a good place to chill with friends.  Also, the Baja fish tacos are awesome here!  The nachos are ok too.  They also show UFC fights each month and a fun place to watch football on the weekends.
