I have been hesitating on reviewing what I feel to be the best tacos in Phoenix.  The hesitation is in part that I want primos/huichos to be kept secret.  Enough of me being selfish, this spot is Lo Mejor!
You can't go wrong with the carne or pastor but for a real tastebuds treat, treat yourself to the cecina.  Whoever dissed the tripas was wrong, not sure how they can be soft when they throw them on the grill right before your eyes.  Lengua is on point and so is the pollo.  
I have been visiting this shop for well over a year and have never had anything I did not like.  My new go to is their burritos, so good.  So for some legit tacos, burritos, even some take home meat Primos is the place!
