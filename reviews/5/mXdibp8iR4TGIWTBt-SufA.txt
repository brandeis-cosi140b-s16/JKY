Have been there several times and never have been disappointed. The food is very good. Simple, good Mexican food! Very clean restaurant located in a great spot. Tons of parking out back (if you don't get a street spot), beer and drinks are VERY good. This is NOT a "dive" Mexican restaurant that you see in every other plaza. This is a great place. Went for my birthday with 7-8 other people and it was great! Rarely crowded and the bartenders are very friendly and professional! Also it is located in an awesome part of town on Elizabeth!
