We really enjoy the seafood here.  Our favorites are fried fish with diabla sauce (really hot!) and fried fish with culichi sauce.  The ceviche tostada is great too!  Our sons like the fajitas.  I have recommended it to my sister and family when they travel to phoenix.  We have been coming here for years.
