Ok. I just got back from my 3rd trip to this Federicos since it opened about a month ago and I am thoroughly pleased.

The staff is extremely professional. The service is VERY fast. The facility is sparkling clean. There's always plenty of seating. And even best, the food is amazing.

I've had the california burrito, adobada fries, and the chicken tacos. All 3 meals were made perfectly and served very quickly. 

*Note: Any military members stationed at Luke... This is the best mexican food you will find close enough to base to visit during your lunch break... and military gets a free medium drink with their meal*

The people here work very hard and they deserve our support.
