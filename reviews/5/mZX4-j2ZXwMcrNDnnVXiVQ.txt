We went in today for a Happy Hour / Cena with a Spanish Language Meetup group. We enjoyed an amazing event! The Happy Hour items & prices were fantastic! I've been eating Mexican food since 1954, and I grew up on Sonoran cuisine, The excellent appetizers and entrees were unlike any other restaurant I know, and the staff was so friendly, so this was a new experience. The Jaliscan specialties were all staggeringly excellent, and we shared so many plates of them! The shredded beef, house-made chorizo, and salsa were perfectly tasty & original. Shrimp wrapped in tocino? WOW! Some items were too salty. I got a birria burro to go for breakfast, and I'm confident it'll be the high point of my day! Our group unanimously agreed to come back here to sample the extensive menu. You can't go wrong here!
