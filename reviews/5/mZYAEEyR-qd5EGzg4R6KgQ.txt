OK, I know many of you may not get it, my husband doesn't , but I love this place. It might be nostalgia, I lived in No Cal and there was a Super Burrito right by my work. I went there all the time. I didn't have a lot of cash living in Cali, so I usually got the Bean and Cheese burritto.  I love the seasoning, the whole beans and the real cheese.  I can make a refried bean burrito at home. This one is unique.

Now that I can afford it, I've moved up to the carne asada Super Burrito. With their verde salsa, I can't think of much better.  PS you must have the salsas, they rock!
