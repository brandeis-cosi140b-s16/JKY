I love Mexican food but I've never really been a fan of tamales. Now I get it! These things are absolutely delicious. 
My wife called me up after placing an order and told me I had until 4:00 to pick them up from their tiny storefront on Cave Creek road. Later that night we steamed them according to some directions we found on the web. Great diner !  My first 5 star Yelp.
Lastly, this is not a restaurant, but as the name implies, a store. You pick them up frozen, or sometimes I hear they have some hot. But plan to take these home, or to a friends house and serve them.
