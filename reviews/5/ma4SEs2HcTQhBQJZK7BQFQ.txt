Great food and prices. This place is always clean,courteous, and fast. You order at the counter and they call your number.  So not a fancy place but with kids it's great. I've been going here for years and it  is always delicious.  My favorites are the carne asada tacos and cheese quesadilla.  My kids love the bean burritos. Has quite a few tables and booths  for seating and high chairs if you need one. Definitely give this place a try.
