Let me start off by saying that based on the reviews, I truly believe patrons are reviewing the wrong restaurant. This is the place you want to be for the most authentic Cuban food in Vegas in the cleanest environment. (aka NOT Rincon Criollo)

Phoenix has yet to produce an authentic Cuban restaurant but thank goodness we found Havana Grill. This place makes me feel like I'm back in Miami. One thing you must know about Cubans...our lives pretty much revolve around family, food and really big get togethers. That being said, I have been a patron of Havana Grill for years. My Abuela pretty much knows all the service staff. My parents even had their Anniversary dinner here. Let me tell ya, these people know how to throw a party my goodness it was amazing!

When you walk in, the atmosphere changes...whether you're stopping in for a casual lunch or a romantic dinner, you will find it all here at Havana Grill. As soon as you sit down you want to make sure you order at least one of the following or both: Pan (bread) which is pressed with butter and oh so delicious and/or marequitas which are pretty much thin slices of plantains fried to a golden perfection served with a mojo with is a heavenly mixture of fresh garlic and lemon juice.

I ordered my favorite, Pollo a la plancha with moro and tostones. Pollo a la plancha is chicken pounded flat, marinated in a lemon, garlic, salt and pepper that grilled to a juicy perfection. Juicy on the inside with a toasty outside. SO GOOD! Moro is a lovely mixture of rice and beans that is just to die for. Tostones (plantains fried, smashed then fried up nice and crispy) and you've got the perfect meal! (In my opinion of course) the service never ceases to amaze me! I make it a point to come in everytime I visit my Abuela in Vegas!!
