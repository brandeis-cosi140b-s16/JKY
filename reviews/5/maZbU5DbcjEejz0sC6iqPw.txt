Absolutely delicious food and quick and friendly service. Be sure to get pupusas revueltas (pork, beans, and cheese inside a tortilla). Also, the fried yucca and chicaronnes are great. 

Super authentic food. I'll definitely be back!

(Only complaint: they close at 7. Such an odd closing time for dinner.)
