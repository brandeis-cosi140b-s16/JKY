Tried Queso Good for the first time at the Gilbert Food Truck event on Fridays. SO SO SO good!! Had the carnitas quesadilla and a huge mason jar of fresh cantaloupe juice. The quesadilla was flavorful and delicious. Nice and cheesy and messy. The juice was unbelievable. I bought another jar to take home and put vodka in...Don't judge me.
