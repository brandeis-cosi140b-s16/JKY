Delicious. The service was amazing and just what we needed. Our drinks were always filled and our chips and salsa was always filled. The servers were on top of it! They weren't pushy but made sure we weren't lacking. 

The food. We ordered two three combination dishes and two tamales. Every single thing was amazing. My favorite was the pork enchilada and the chicken tamale. The sauces were slightly spicy but perfect. The cheese was actually melted in the enchilada. If you get cheese enchiladas a lot then you know most of the time the cheese inside is not melted. 

We will be back. It was amazing!
