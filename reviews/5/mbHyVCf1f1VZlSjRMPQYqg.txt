This place truly could not be better. I came here for dinner with some family after reading some good yelp reviews. Upon entering, we were warmly greeted by the owner's father. He brought out chips & salsa for the table immediately and answered all of our questions about the menu. The food was insanely delicious - I had the CC Sizzle sopaipilla style. It was so good that I devoured the entire thing, which left me in a ridiculous food coma - but so so worth it. The rest of the family loved their meals as well. Before we left, the cook came out and placed warm sopaipillas covered in cinnamon on our table & said they were "on the house". Once again, delicious. As we were leaving, we paid & tipped our lovely waiter. Much to our surprise, he did not even want the tip! After some insisting though, he did kindly accept. He went above & beyond to make his son's customers happy and that alone was enough to bring us back here. Try this place - you won't be disappointed!
