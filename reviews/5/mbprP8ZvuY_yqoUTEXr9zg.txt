Great food, great drink and great service. Every time I have been here, which is often has been a great meal. 

The tacos, burritos and enchiladas are amazing and trumped only by the cheese dip. They could stand to have a better beer menu, but that's the only flaw I can find. Eat here and I'd get the tequila flight if you are a tequila fab.
