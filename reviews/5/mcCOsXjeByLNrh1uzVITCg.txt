First off I have to say thanks to the fellow yelpers!!! 

I have worked downtown for over 5 years and drove by this place every day twice a day.... and had no idea it was even open for business. The place looks abandoned and quite scary.  I have seen some interesting people next door and I would have never given the place a shot if it wasn't for you all!    On to the food :) 

Since this was my first time I thought I would try the basic Mexican food combo to judge the place.  I had the #17 Taco and Enchilada rice and beans I added beef to the enchilada. (comes shredded unless you specify ground) I can't say one bad thing about the dish. It was amazing. The rice was perfect for my taste and even the beans were good.  I really enjoyed the salsa. Some may not since it is not a fresh tomato and onion type of salsa. It is more like a hot sauce. The service was good. The atmosphere was good.  Prices are good. 

This will absolutely be added to the Mexican Food Lunch rotation!!
