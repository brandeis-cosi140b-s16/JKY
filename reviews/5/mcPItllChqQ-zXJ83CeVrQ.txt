I love everything about this place. The burrito bowl with guacamole feels a bit expensive, but when I want fast food without feeling fat, this is the place. Not only is the food perfect, the vibe is awesome. I'm not sure how they do it, but Chipolte makes me feel glad to be alive. Maybe it's the unfinished wood, the music, or employees who actually seem happy.

I experienced a hiccup when I ordered over the phone, however. I was rushing to work and wanted to pick up some Chipotle. The food wasn't ready when I arrived 15 minutes later. They wanted to make it on the spot, but I didn't have time to wait. They made it up to me by providing a free bowl another day after I called to ask what happened.
