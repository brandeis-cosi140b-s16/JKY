Great food, unique atmosphere, decent price, great crowd. I can't rate this bar-wise yet as I've only stopped by past 10pm in hopes they were still serving food (just moved to Phoenix recently). I'm giving this 5 off the restaurant atmosphere, quality, service, and food. I always recommend this place when we have visitors.
