This my 3 time back to Tia Rosa I am liking this place! The food is out of this world delicious! The expansive list of margaritas is as delicious as the food selections! 

And the service has always been attentive, flexible, and upbeat! You should not go wrong in this place. The only thing to worry is how busy this can get so get there early.
