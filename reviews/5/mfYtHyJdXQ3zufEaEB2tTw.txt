My husband and I were so excited to hear there was a Chipotle close to my sister's house! Our first time in Vegas so we didn't know if we would see any familiar restaurants. My husband and I walked in and we were welcomed by the line cook and the chef. I've never had a Chipotle do that before(so exciting lol). I got myself a delicious sofritas bowl. The line boy Ramone was so friendly and didn't skimp on his portions like other stores. Only issue was that they didn't have guacamole, but Ramone assured me that he would get it out to me as soon as possible. A few minutes later I hear my name called out. I was never so excited to receive food in my life. I nearly ran for my delicious guacamole. I was assured that it was fresh by the grill boy(even more exciting)! My food was delicious! The amazing customer service from this store made the food taste even better. This Chipotle really brought up my standards for other Chipotles! My husband and I will definitely be visiting this store again when we come to Vegas.
