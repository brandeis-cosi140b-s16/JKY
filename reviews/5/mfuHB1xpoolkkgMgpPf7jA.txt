I love Lina's!! My husband and I go there at least once a week. He gets so disappointed if they run out of horchata because it's amazing. Everything on the menu is great. It's a real authentic mexican restaurant which I have missed so much since I moved here. The smell of the restaurant, the family feeling, the great food.. so original!! Anytime we have friends visit, we take them to Lina's and they say the exact same thing. Lina's is great. I wish I could eat there every day and I wish more people knew about them!
