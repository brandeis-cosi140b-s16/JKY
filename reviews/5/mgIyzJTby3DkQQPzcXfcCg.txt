BOMB DIGGITY

These tacos are the best I've found in Pittsburgh so far and easily the most authentic. I always order whatever meat they're currently grilling and have yet to be dissapointed. The bar of accoutrements is impressive and there's an aesthetic to stuffing a taco into your face in the middle of a dirty sidewalk while chugging a half liter of mango jarritos.
