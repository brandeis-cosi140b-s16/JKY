Before I take a hike from Yelp, I really want to give credit to the hard working employees at this location. I usually don't like to review chain restaurants like this, but I don't know a group of guys who treat me better. 

I've probably eaten here over 100 times this year. The food is really good and the service is outstanding. I actually think this place is pretty close to authentic because they don't use ground beef in their tacos. 

9 out of 10 times I come here after midnight. On weekend nights, you get a lot of drunk girls in club dresses who are coming home from a night of drunken stupidity(I am hardcore straight-edge, so yes I believe people who drink alcohol are pathetic...and yes I'm talking to you reading this), and some will say racist remarks towards Mexican people. I can't count how many times I've had to sit here and listen to that. The Mexican-American workers here have a lot patience having to deal with that. I always tip them extra for having to endure that crap.

9 out of 10 time I get the Al-Pastor fries!! It's a part of the secret menu so you won't find it on the board. They get french fries and put salsa, beans, sour cream, guacamole, and tons of Al Pastor on it. They also got 99 cent Taco Wednesday!!! 

The guys work really hard here, especially Arturo. They keep it spotless and clean. The salsa bar is really upscale compared to other Mexican restaurants!  

Actually, I did review this place back in January of 2012, but the yelp filter kept eating my review...apparently the filter thinks I work here. Let me just say that the Yelp filter is a complete dumbsh!t because I don't work at ROBERTO'S TACO SHOP, I work at Burger King off of Martin Luther King and Eastern. If you don't believe me, ask Yelp Elite Jen G. She just happens to be assistant manager.
