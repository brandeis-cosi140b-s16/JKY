Gecko Grill is some of the best southwestern style barbecue and food in the valley of the sun. Tucked into a strip mall.
Like Garcias and Serranos, this place serves several salsas and a bean and cheese dip with a basket of chips to every diner. One could easily make a meal of this, but be warned: it is very filling, and yes, the entrees are belly-busting good!
Originally, I am told that this place just did barbeque. Myself? I am thankful for the neo-mexican stuff as well, but the chicken that this place cranks out as either straight forward smoked-barbecued chicken with a sauce on the side, or stuffed into a colossal burro (and I am a burrito HATER, I usually don't like them.) is AMAZING!
Once I met my friend Juliet and her family here and all of her kids aparently adore the place. The kids were all about the bean dip and the french fries. It was tre' cute!
Great service too!

The shrimp mango quesadillas are the best! They are adorned with just a little green pepper snap. an order is too much for me to finish my myself.

The smoked chicken wings are good.

Really, you can't go wrong with this menu. If you go on the wrong day, and they are closed, there may be disappointed sighing. They close early, so go in the evening.
