Wow. Where do I start? The menus. I couldn't read a word on them. That means I'm at an authentic Latin restaurant. So I close my eyes and throw my finger at the menu and it lands on enchiladas Suiza. AMAZING. The cheese on top, the beans and rice. HOLY SHIT. Sorry for my language but HOLY SHIT. So good. Also, the house margs. HOLY SHART. So good. The staff too. The pregnant waitress! So nice! Everyone! 5 stars. 5 shartin' stars, man. I recommend! I recommend! Peace
