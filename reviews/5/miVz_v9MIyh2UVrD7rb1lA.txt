Okay, this is your typical Phoenix short order Mexican joint as far as atmosphere goes. Hint: Don't be scared of the bars guarding the register and kitchen, honestly, I love the atmosphere of this place and have never seen sketchy people in there. The food is outstanding! The carne asada has crispy edges from being cooked on the plancha but it's not dry at all and pack some great flavor. The tortillas are soft and fresh and the Pico is on point with the perfect amount of lime juice and perfect sized cuts. Also the tacos are outstanding and only 99 cents on Tuesday and Wednesday. This is my new go to spot for a quick and delicious bite. Do yourself a favor, skip Filibertos and come here for better food at better prices. Love it!
