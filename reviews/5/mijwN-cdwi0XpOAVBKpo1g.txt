Dropped by here last night on my way home from the gym for a quick snack. Ran into my fellow Yelp Elite Nader in the bar and enjoyed a carnitas taco and a cold beer. The taco was really good and flavorful. I saw some nachos go by I have to try at some time in the future because they looked really good. Service was over the top, everyone in here is really awesome. I'll be back again!
