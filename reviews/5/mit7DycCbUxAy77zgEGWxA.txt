I love this  place.  You can sit in the outdoor garden, where the trees that surround you are lit with little white lights or in their atrium that has a beautiful fireplace and views to the outside or in their inner dining room, oh plus they have seating on their rooftop which looks beautiful.  I've only sat in the atrium and the outdoor garden.  My husband got the traditional eggs benedict that came with home fries and fruit.  I got the strawberry cream filled stuffed french toast that also came with fruit and I ordered the compote on the side, which was warm and delish.  You have your choice of stuffing the french toast with the strawberry cream or the compote so the way I ordered, I got both and ate all of it.
