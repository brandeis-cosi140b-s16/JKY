The service at this location along with all the employees are absolutely wonderful. They take care of their customers so well and so efficiently that I will continuously come back to this location over and over no matter where I live inside Las Vegas. The manager of this location she is a lovely woman and I always enjoyed her company when I order my food. Hands down the best
