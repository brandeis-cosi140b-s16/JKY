No idea why this place is rated so low, but here is my 2 cents after multiple visits to this cheap, delicious hole-in-the-wall.

Their food is very good, much better than most fast-mexican type places like this, and their prices are cheap, like a 1.25 for a street-style taco.

Carne Asada, Al Pastor, Carnitas, Lengua all excellent, and they do small street-style tacos right, cheap and fresh.

Also had their torta, which was great. It's notable they also have more seafood than most fast mexican places.

Soccer usually on the big screen in the dining room is simply awesome too.

For the price and quality of food this is one of the best places in the area, try a few taco's and see for yourself....
