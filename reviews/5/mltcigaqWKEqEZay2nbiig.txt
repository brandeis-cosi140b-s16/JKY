Normally I'm not one for fast food but I decided to stop in here on my lunch break to re-experience the Mexican-American fusion chain of my childhood. I was not disappointed. 

When I first walked into the store, I was greeted by a friendly and cheery guy behind the counter -- Clark was on his nametag -- and he took my order attentively. He seemed to be very customer-service oriented and interested in the overall quality of my lunch break. I could tell he really cared. One of the nicest people I've seen in a restaurant, fast food or otherwise. 

I ordered two half pound bean burritos -- bold, of course, where they add their signature crinkle fries and that oh-so-mysterious secret sauce I'm always craving -- and I received my food within minutes. Hot and delicious as always, it was truly a treat to eat here. 

While the food is similar to any other Del Taco location due to their standardisation, I can say that this store is set apart by the amazing staff. They all seem to be genuinely nice people and they are both service oriented and friendly. A really top-notch team of professionals that I've seen unparalleled in my dining experience. I think it was just as good to interact with them as it was to enjoy my food; they truly made my day.

Store is incredibly clean and well-kept. Seems to be like a flagship store, the decor is modern but incredibly clean, and I can tell the store is exceptionally well-maintained. 

Clark, and the rest of the Del Taco staff at this store, thank you for defining my eating experience. I'll definitely be coming back regularly.
