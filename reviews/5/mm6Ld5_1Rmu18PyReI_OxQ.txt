I've always enjoyed Chipotle. It's fresh, hot, employees have been friendly and efficient, and the ingredients are good stuff. 
I get the chicken bowls for the most part with hot salsa, corn salsa and grilled veggies with brown rice. It's so satisfying and if you get it to go, it still tastes good if you don't get to it for about 30 mins.  They also offer beer and margaritas if you eatin in.
