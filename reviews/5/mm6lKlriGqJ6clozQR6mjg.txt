We had around 25 people for our daughters graduation party on Saturday 6/15/2013. I have to say Serranos in Queen Creek did an excellent job. They were very attentive to everyone in our party. We had great service with Ivan.  He worked very hard and constantly asked if we needed anything or drinks. There also was a very nice young girl who worked that night who we really liked also, but I didn't get her name. Wish I did. Dan the manager was great. Food was great. It just turned out to be a fantastic evening. Everyone at Serranos went above and beyond to make our evening for our daughter a huge success. I want to tell Serranos in Queen Creek Thank you very much and we will definitely be back.
