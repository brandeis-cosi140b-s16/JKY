Location, Location, Location! This restaurant has an amazing view of Las Vegas, I would recommend going at night as you can clearly see the Stratosphere and the Luxor Light. Perfect for date night or family dinner. 

The staff goes out of their way to make you feel welcomed. What I love is that they always give my son sopa de fideos, noodle soup in a tomato broth. Chips, salsa and beans are given complimentary, which is a plus. I hate when Mexican restaurants charge you for chips and salsa.

The food is OK, not amazing, however the service and view are what really make this place stand out.
