If you're in D concourse in PHX, and you're hungry, then this is a decent spot for eats.  They do the lot, and prices are not horrible.

I don't know what happened to the first reviewer--[perhaps someone should flag that?]

As for this eater, I stick to the red tamale combo--beans / rice added.  The masa is first rate and the shredded beef is spiced well for a real mc coy. 

You can wash that one down with a tamarind soda or horchata if you like.

My tip for fellow yelpers east of the Mississippi river, where good masa is hard to find, go ahead and order a dozen tamales packed cold for your carry on bag--even a five hour flight gets them into the freezer to stay great tasting for months.

My fellow travelers have taken on the burritos and tostadas, with positive remarks.  Tortillas are genuine--hard to ruin a bean/cheese otherwise. Again, this is not the best Mexican you'll ever eat, but it is the best you'll ever eat in an airport--so that's how I justify the five stars here.
