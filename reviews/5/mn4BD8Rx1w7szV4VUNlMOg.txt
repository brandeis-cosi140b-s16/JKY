My wife and I discovered Los Olivos Norte on one of many trips to Scottsdale before we move to AZ.  We have always enjoyed coming here and the food is always excellent.  We've tried so many Mexican restaurants in the area but we keep coming back to Los Olivos Norte.  It can be quiet or busy; but we always get great food and service.  

My wife's favorite is Polla Ala Crema.  Our waiter knows it's her favorite and always reminds her when we are seated. I will order from all over the menu and each entree that I have tried is always great.  I tend to go for combos so I have variety.  The chips and salsa are also a treat and we can also make a meal with them alone because they bring a large serving.  Anytime we have business in the area or are attending an event like Barrett Jackson, Los Olivos Norte is our last stop before heading home.  It's the crowning meal on a great day.
