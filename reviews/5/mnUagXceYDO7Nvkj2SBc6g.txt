As others have suggested, the green chili is fantastic.  It really is the best.  

Their beans are very good too.  Not too salty like other places.  

I wasn't overly impressed with their tacos though.  It wasn't bad, just that I've had better.  When I go back (and I will be back!) I'll pass on the tacos, but that just leaves more room for green chili burros.
