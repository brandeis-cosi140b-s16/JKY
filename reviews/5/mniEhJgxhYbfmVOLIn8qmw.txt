Hands down the best Mexican place in charlotte... May have just toppled taqueria Mexico on south blvd as number 1 from my list. The server we had was very pleasant. Ample seating, their booths are really spacious... They have a huge projector screen, would like to go and watch some soccer there if they play on TV. The food was really really good. Pollo adobe is a must try. I couldn't finish more than half of the dish, so the portion size is big. Pollo con crema is also good. Flan was also very delicious. I know what's my go to place in charlotte for Mexican from now on...
