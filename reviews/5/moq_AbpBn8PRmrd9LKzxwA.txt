The whole experience was fantastic. The food was very tasty, fresh and healthy and the atmosphere clean and comfortable. But the best part was the service. Belinda and Brian were very helpful, friendly, and spent extra time explaining the menu and options. I will definitely be back and probably a regular customer at this location.
