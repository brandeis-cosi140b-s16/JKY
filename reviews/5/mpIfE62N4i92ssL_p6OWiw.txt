i received a 10 burrito order, without cheese, only to get home and find cheese in them. I called and talked to the manager who told me to return with the receipt and he'd replace them with 10 new ones, to keep the ones I had. I gave them to my Dad, who returned to the store. There he received an apology, 10 new cheese-less burritos, and 2 $5 off coupons. He said the manager was very sorry about it and hoped I'd return in the future. I definitely will!! I understand mistakes happen, espacially at fast food places, but this store manager handled it very, very well.
