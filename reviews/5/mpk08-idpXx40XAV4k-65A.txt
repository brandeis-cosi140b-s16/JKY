First, I want to say that whoever listed the address on this place, was DEAD WRONG, because I ended up at Dick's Hideaway. 

OMG this place is magic. You must must MUST go down the murky stairs to the dimly lit bar with real candles illuminating the room. They serve lunch and dinner down there now, too.

I ordered a nice red, and was also pleased at the selection of micro-brews available. (The bf loves his porters!) 
Happy Hour is until 6pm...and all small plates (like tapas) are only $5!!!! You must try a few...especially the Veal Meatballs.

I ordered the surf and turf (6oz beef tenderloin topped with 2 lg shrimp and jalapeno hollandaise, two dungess crab enchiladas and pinto beans) YUM! This food was simply divine. Oh, and if you get an entree, make sure you get the spinach salad (one of three salad choices). The bf, who is less adventurous in his cuisine choices chose the chicken enchiladas, which he ate every bit of. 

The atmosphere is sophistacted, but not uppity, the service is superb and the wine list is nice, but not too pricey. You must go at least once in your life.
