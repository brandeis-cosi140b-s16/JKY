It's right here in our historic hood! Home cooking by wonderful Irma and attentive service by Julio. While we ordered just 3 tacos it came with delicious yellow rice and smooth refried beans, ripe fruit and some salad veggies, beautifully presented. As a special treat Irma let us try us try her "homemade green juice" that mixes veggies, oatmeal and lemon for a refreshing chaser. Go visit and enjoy! Sandy and Robin in Fairview Place
