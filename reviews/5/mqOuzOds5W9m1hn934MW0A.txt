Juan's is definitely an awesome place for tacos and burritos.  I have eaten at Juan's for a couple of years now.  The only thing is that if you come for lunch on your lunch break you will have to make sure you tell your boss that you will be gone for a couple of hours.  :)  I say that because they are always really busy and the place is not really that big.  It was nice when they expended the restaurant last year.   

I love there tacos,  it is really worth the wait.  So,  if you are driving around and looking for a place to eat you should head over to Juan's.  The wait staff is always really friendly and they go pretty quick too.
