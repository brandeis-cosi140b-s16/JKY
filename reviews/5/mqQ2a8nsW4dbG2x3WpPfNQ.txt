Place was clean & staff was friendly. I had the sizzle sopapilla & my husband had the combo burritos (it comes with 2 full size burritos, beans and rice) both dishes were incredible!! The sopapilla was flaky & the meat had so much flavor. I was skeptical about the cabbage but it really enhanced the flavor of the dish. My husbands combo burrito was just as flavorful and the homemade tortilla made it even better!! I grew up enjoying my grandmothers homemade tortillas and it was so nice to finally taste a real tortilla again!! Afterwards, I had a vanilla capuccino that was made with this manual hand press thing. The foam was nice and thick, but also light and fluffy and made for an excellent cappuccino. This may end up being my go to place for my daily coffee! The dessert sopapilla sprinkled with powdered sugar was delicious.  I'm so glad I saw that groupon, otherwise I may have not ever known that this little place existed. Will definitely be a return customer!!
