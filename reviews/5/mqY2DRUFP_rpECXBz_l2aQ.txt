Suprise! I've been there twice and both times, unexpectedly, they gave us a free appetizer and desert! Not sure if this is standard practice or not, but between those 2 freebies and the unlimited chips and salsa, we wound up taking home a lot of our food to eat the next day.

Nice place, good environment, good food, great unexpected freebies. They have earned my return trip(s).
