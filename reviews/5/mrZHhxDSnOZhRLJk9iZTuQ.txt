This is THE best Mexican food in Charlotte.  It is extremely rare for me to never have a bad experience at a restaurant, so Taqueria Mexico is the exception rather than the rule.  

It isn't fancy, they didn't waste a bunch of money on making it look pretty, they just cook great food, everyday.  

I recommend the carnitas, either the plain or the red or the green.  Beware on the red however, it is spicy, it will creep up on you, it is basically their pork tips slow simmered in a spicy chipotle sauce.  They serve it with either corn or flour tortillas, with rice and beans and all the good stuff to make little tacos out of your platter.

I read on here that their portions aren't big.  Which is true, they are a normal size portion, which is smart, generally there is a lot of wasted rice and beans at a restaurant like this.  Personally I love the portion size, it is just enough to fill me and I don't feel stuffed like a relleno afterwards.

The burritos area great, but it's a burrito, you can get that anywhere, try something different when you are at an authentic place.  As for the bar, not too many options, but I'm usually busy drinking salsa at this place.

Just phenomenal.  It's that place where I can look at my wife and say "I'm craving..." and she will answer "Taqueria."

Try it, if you don't like it you should probably stick to On the Border, or another pre-processed gringo-safe TexMex restaurant.

L'chaim!
