I have to agree with Lucian. This has become my favorite place and offer more value than any mexican food drive-thru and the food is very good. It's in the center of town for me and they're open late. I like that I can get a free drink for some of their combos and a free burrito if you purchase $5 or more! If you are looking for a fancy dine-in, this is not your place.
