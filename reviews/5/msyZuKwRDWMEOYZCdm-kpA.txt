Phat Phan here.  Highlights of the best damn burrito shop in town:

-100% Best breakfast in Charlotte, bar none, from 7 to 10am every damn day of the week.  Get the Camden block with chorizo, and then try everything else on the menu.  It's ridiculously good, well portioned, and priced perfectly.

-Their lunch specials are amazing.  I recently had some thai peanut curry'd beef lettuce wraps that were out of this freaking world.  I could eat those all day.

-Their normal menu items are great, too - salads are delicious and filling, and also beautifully presented.  Can't beat the quesadillas, too.

-Fridays mean pulled Pork tacos.  These are not to be missed.  

And, I mean, the staff is pretty awesome, too.  Tell 'em I sent you! ;)
