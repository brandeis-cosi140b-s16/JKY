I am personally obsessed with Cabo's.  Very authentic Mexican dishes available!  Great beer specials, good for kids and the food is incredible.  On Saturday night's they  have live music and it makes for a fun dinner!  Two outside patio's are awesome for a fabulous outside night if you are in the mood!  One thing I also really appreciate is that the owner is always walking around the restaurant helping out with no hesitation and is always very friendly!  I would recommend Cabo's to anyone!!!
