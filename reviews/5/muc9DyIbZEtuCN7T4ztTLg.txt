I walked in, and was greeted with a smile. Unfamiliar with the food, I asked for her recommendations. She had no problem giving me suggestions, and I ultimately went with the fajita burrito and a side of Guacamole. Super friendly staff, good food, and well priced. What more could you ask for? If I lived in the area, this place would be my "go to".
