The carne asada is so tender, my wife loves their super asada fries. I usually get their shrimp burrito. I was saddened when I visited them on the last day at their previous location, I am very happy to see them back in business again.
Their food is excellent, the restaurant is clean, they are very friendly.  What more could you ask for. :)
