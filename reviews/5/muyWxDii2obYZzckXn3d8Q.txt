I'll admit that every single time I've been here, I've had the huevos rancheros, which are amazing and only $5.99.  The rest of the menu could be garbage, but based on bites stolen from my wife's plate, I doubt it.  Of those swiped bites, the enchilada sauce has been the best.

The menu is pretty expansive for a small place, and I plan on getting around to the tortas and stuff sometime soon, as soon as I can pry myself off the huevos.

If I had to pick on one thing, their canned beer prices are a little steep.  $3.50 for a Tecate?  Enh.  But the food more than makes up for it, and I only order a beer once in a blue moon anyway, so I'm over it.

More huevos, please.
