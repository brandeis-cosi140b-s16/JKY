Whatever the tilapia special was today, it was amazing and compelled me to write this five star review! Service is always friendly and I like the low key vibe. I really enjoy the palm salad and it's unexpected but delicious combo of beets, pinto beans, hearts of Palm and an amazing cilantro dressing. I'll be back.
