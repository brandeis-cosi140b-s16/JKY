While visiting our friend in Phoenix, she took us to Los Sombreros, a Mexican restaurant that she had seen featured on TV.  Authentic Mexican food, beautifully prepared.  Joaquin was our waiter.  He was great.  We had margaritas.  They were great.  I thought the food was some of the best Mexican food I have ever eaten.  We ate outside on the patio and had a wonderful meal.  I had the chicken enchiladas and my husband had the fish tacos.  All the flavors were subtle and everything was cooked perfectly.  Typical American location, a shopping mall.  But at least you can find a place to park.  Give it a try, you won't be disappointed.
