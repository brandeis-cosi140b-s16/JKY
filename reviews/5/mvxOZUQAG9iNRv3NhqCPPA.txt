My fellow Yelper Jessica and I wanted to have a last meal before I went under the knife. I wanted Mexican and she had this spot bookmarked. Plus, I love seafood. 

Don't let the fact that it's in a slightly sketchy part of town and in a run down strip mall scare you off. They also close kinda early, but trust me it's so very worth it. 

We decided we were going to split everything because everything on the menu sounded amazing.Of course we used our Yelp check-in offer of a free Horchata. Normally i'm not a big Horchata fan, but this was homemade and delicious. The chips and salsa set the tone of awesomeness right away.
Ultimately we decided on starting with the Shrimp Empanadas. Next, Seafood Molcajetes and the A La Diabla Filete. The Shrimp Empanadas came out steaming hot, crisp and full of shrimp. You get three in an order and they are truly little pockets of goodness. When the Molcajete came out we were both shocked! They serve it in a heavy stone mortar that is super hot. It was filled to the brim with seafood, broth and completely covered in cheese!! It had crab legs, clams, shrimp and fish. The broth had a great spice to it. It was like nothing I've had before. It got even better when the La Diabla Filete came to the table. It's a whole deep fried fish (Yes, head, tail and all.) and they cover it in a spicy red sauce. This was excellent. The flavor of the sauce and the tender fish made a great combination. I could not stop myself from picking at it even after I was full.
Not only is the food amazing, but the staff is super friendly as well. Even though we were still eating past closing they didn't try to rush us out at all. I love family owned businesses and this place has great charm all around.

If you love seafood and mexican food this is the place. I'm so thrilled to have been able to try it. I've been dreaming about that fish ever since. I can not wait to return!
