This place is the real deal. Seeing their commercials every day on channel 38.3 made me finally decide to stop by. The enchiladas are incredible. The enchilada sauce was great. Never tasted enchiladas this good before. The chili rellenos are just as good also. Rice and beans were great as well. Service was also good. I definitely recommend Pitic Restaurant. Five stars!
