Lucky for me I work close to this place because I am addicted! 3 tacos for $7 and they are not small, at least in my opinion. I had the chicken, chorizo, and carne asada.... I thought the chicken and chorizo was amazing! Spicy, but not too spicy, you will know that you are alive. I had some chips as well, they were great and reminded me of the chips from Chipotle that I totally love. This place was cheap, very fast, and sooo good om nom nom nom.
