Hands down, AMAZING.
My mom has been loving this place, so of course she took me to try it. I love everything about this place. All the art work on the walls is by a local artist, they use local products and the owner is an awesome guy! Definitely good vibes all around.  
My mom and I both ordered the veggie torta, everything was seasoned perfectly and the bread, oh man, the bread!! I also order the house margarita, which was awesome as well. We weren't going to get dessert until I read what the options were... Well, ended up getting the bunuelos (they are tossed in cinnamon sugar, drizzled with local honey, topped with spiced walnuts and black berries, all which is laying on a bed of cinnamon cream goodness).
I seriously cannot wait to go back.
