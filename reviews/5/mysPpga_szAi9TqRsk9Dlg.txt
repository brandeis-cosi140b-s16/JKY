What can I say about El Taco Fresco that hasn't already been said? It's incredible. The food is great, it's crazy cheap--especially if you get a couple of their $0.99 specials with your order--and ready fast. I don't think I've ever had to wait more than ten minutes for food, if that. It's open 24 hours a day, with 24 hour delivery. 

The menu is pretty varied. They have a lot of vegetarian options, which makes someone like me happy, but they have even more to make you omnivores happy! I usually get either veggie tacos, the bean and cheese burrito, or the cheese enchilada and I am always happy. My boyfriend loves their beef taco salad.  It's a hole-in-the-wall kind of place, but that kind of enhances the Taco Fresco experience, if you ask me. I definitely recommend it.
