Best food concept in awhile...skeptical at first...but if u love sushi and love burritos, then this is "Heaven"...very reasonably priced and good thing i didnt order 2 cause burritos are big ( but I'm sure I would've ate it anyways cause they're that good)....we were more than pleasantly pleased....have been there 4 times since they opened less than month ago...my new guilty pleasure...get there early though...lines can be long but very well worth it !!! HIGHLY, HIGHLY recommended !!!
