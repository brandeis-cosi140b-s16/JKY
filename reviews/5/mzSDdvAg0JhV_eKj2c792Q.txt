A gem of this city. If you understand and appreciate southwest-style Mexican food, you'd wanna give this place 6 stars. Honestly, I have not had a better burrito outside of Southern California or Arizona than what I get at Los Cabos. (And I've lived in Chicago, Texas and all over the east coast). With that said, if you're looking for a trendy date night/ hot spot, this is probably not it.
