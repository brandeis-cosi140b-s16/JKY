Staying at the Mandalay for an industry event, we spent a great happy hour at Border Grill. So, I don't do five stars, but I'll slip one in for BG or a couple of reasons. Cantina Tex Mex is such a great cuisine, and so often under served. This food here was really good, reasonably priced and completely unpretentious - a nice change for a Vegas venue. The Margaritas were excellent. The ceviche sopas were fresh and snappy, not o saucy and just macerated enough. The guac and salsas were super fresh and flavorful, with enough house flair to make them mentionable. I see short ribs all over the place these days, but the rendering here was a Delicious little taquito that did it for me. El Yum-o. If in the Mandalay, the BG is a great bet for happy hour, or just a quick bite on your way from the convention center to the hotel. Andale to the Mandalay, con mucho gusto.
