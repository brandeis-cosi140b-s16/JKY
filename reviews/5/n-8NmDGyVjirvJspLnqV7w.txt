This is place was great!  I've actually had food from the grandfather of all food trucks, the Kogi truck, that helped pioneer the Korean/Mexican fusion cuisine.  This place was sooo good.  Ingredients were very fresh, marinated meats were so tasty and everything was so flavorful.  I sampled the chicken tostada, beef tacos and lettuce wraps (all fusion).  I was delighted by it all!
