There are just not enough stars...purchased on Groupon...no problems to use but did have to pay $2 bucks extra for the Cadillac Margarita. The food DELICIOUS! Everything is homemade even the tortillas both corn and flour. Great customer service. Noticed they have way too many employees but that is what set them apart, they all seemed happy and willing to help each other. We went back for breakfast and again were pleased. If you go to Vegas you have to stop by and eat, I know we will. We even got a free photo.
