Went with the family for something new. Ordered the house special Molcajete, all I can say is WOW.

It had shrimp, octopus tomatillo sauce, beef, chicken and fried fish. Every food group you could possibly imagine! :)

We go the green sauce, the red sauce is a LOT spicier than I expected. If you want delicious Mexican food you can't beat Moriscos Play Hermosa. Don't be afraid of the location, my wife and I were a bit worried as it does seem like it's in the middle of nowhere and in a shadier area but well worth it!.

Make sure to check is as well and get that free slice of cake (we grabbed the coconut one mmmm).
