We were shocked at how good these dogs were! I had the ny dog and my husband had the Sonoran dog. The salsa was made fresh for that one. The sauerkraut on the by dog was rough chopped and amazing. A must try if you're in the area. Service was super friendly as well! We enjoyed ourselves at this quaint little place
