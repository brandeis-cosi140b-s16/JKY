Exceptionally fun place. I ordered the Charlie's Tacos. It was very flavorful especially with the melted cheese!!  The atmosphere was lively.  The staff was full of personality & engaging.  Big food portions, big drinks, mixed with group/line dancing and birthday surprises was the highlight of the night!!
