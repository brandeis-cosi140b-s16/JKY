My boyfriend has raved about this place on and off for the almost two years we've been going out so one day we grabbed a couple and drove on up with a birthday being the excuse for coming here. (Excuse so not needed by the way, a fact that I now know!)

There's indoor and outdoor seating and naturally we sat outside. There's a lovely duck pond filled with ducks, obviously, and some geese in the center and while it does smell a bit pond-ish it is worth it. The back of the menu informed me that the decor tries to capture the style of Mexican restaurants and I'll have to take it's word for that as I wouldn't know from experience. 

The food is glorious! I had the Pollo Fundido and I HIGHLY recommend it. I have never tasted anything so good. After dinner we informed our waitress that it was our friend's birthday and she told us she'd be back with some free deep fried ice cream. Now, usually when a restaurant gives a free dessert for birthdays they're on the modest side but what came to our table was MASSIVE and way more then enough for four people to split.

If you're ever up in the area and looking for a nice atmosphere with good food then give El Encanto a try.
