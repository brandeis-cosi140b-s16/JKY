THIS PLACE is GOOD. I will definitely be coming back. OVER and OVER.

It's like, they make each ingredient of your order great, on its own. Then, when they combine them into your food, it's BOMB. Try it out. All these reviews aren't getting it wrong!

But caveat: Although it is a franchise, they have an issue they should fix and the gentleman at the counter said is true: A problem with CONSISTENCY.

That is, not all the Roberto's Taco Shops foods are made the same. So, THIS SPECIFIC location's food is good in a different way than all the others. They get to prepare food differently, location to location.

This Roberto's is GREAT! Five Stars!
