Top notch breakfast burrito. All ingredients are fresh; they also don't follow the trend of other places by using tons of potato filler in there. I tried the machaca breakfast burrito - it's got peppers, tomato, green chile, cheese, egg and potato. Great mix, piping hot, and huge. For around $4. I could probably split it and still be full. I will be back regularly for this quick stop. Next time I'll try the chorizo - they make it themselves and claim it's lean and not greasy.
