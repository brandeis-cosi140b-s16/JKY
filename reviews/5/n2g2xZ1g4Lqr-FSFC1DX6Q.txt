Totally off the beaten path and a little deceptive at first but don't be mistaken by its size or location! The service was timely, the drinks were strong, the food is fresh and prepared to the "T!" We started with the Fresh guac and blueberry margaritas, had the "Cochinita Pibil" and was extremely satisfied! I will be back with larger parties than the 10 I brought with me tonight!
