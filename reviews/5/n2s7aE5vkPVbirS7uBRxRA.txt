Man oh man!  This food always makes me smile and my mouth water before I'm about to dive into it.  I have been here countless times and have yet to be disappointed.  One yelper mentioned that it TB and Del Taco paled in comparison, man was she right on the money!  I love the rolled tacos, all that guac and under 3 bucks; *drools*  The staff is friendly who takes your order and the environment is lax.  I have heard that the food is different depending on which Roberto's you go to, so I'm only speaking for this location.  Come one, come all - you have to check this place out!  Oh, and need I mention, Roberto's = drunk munchies haven!!!
