Restaurant lives up to its name... If you've been craving mexican food like how its served by the street vendors and hole in the restaurants in Distrito Federal (hence the "DF"), this is the place to go! No, there isn't any lettuce on their tacos. Yes, their gorditas are stuffed with LOTS of meat. Portions look small, but don't be fooled because they are DENSE.

Try the huaraches, 1 order comes with 2 and you choose either beans or cheese for filling. Topping is up to you, we had tlacoyos which are the huaraches topped with nopales (cactus). They're more flavorful stuffed with cheese than stuffed with beans. For people who like salvadorean food, they're "kinda" like pupusas.

Please support this business! Who would of thought that a restaurant that airs a B-rated commercial TV ad in vegas could produce authentic Mexican food this yummy. For out of towners, it's worth the couple-of-miles drive off the strip :)
