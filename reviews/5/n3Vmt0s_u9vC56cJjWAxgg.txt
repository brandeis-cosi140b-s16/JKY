Tacos & Beer had an awesome Groupon for chips & guacamole, two sides, and six tacos. I went to try it out for the first time with my boyfriend, and it was more than enough food. 

I enjoyed the guacamole and chips as a starter. The guac had a nice hint of lime, and the server was really great at refilling our chips. I ordered the shrimp, baja fish, and al pastor tacos. The seafood tacos were flavorful, and my boyfriend, who doesn't fancy seafood much, helped me finish my baja taco. I loved that the al pastor had pineapple chunks it. The only little downside was that it was a little saucy for my liking. 

Overall, the food was amazing, the portions were great, and the service was on point. I definitely will be coming back again, and I'm looking forward to checking out the happy hour specials!
