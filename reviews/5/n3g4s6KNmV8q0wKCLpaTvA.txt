The outside is not pretentious but when you walk in your greeted by the owners Victor and Laura and an aroma of garlic, onion, chile and fresh tortillas that makes your hunger go through the roof. The corn tortillas are hand made as you order. They melt in your mouth! The burritos are big but not sloppy and packed with flavor. The tostadas are incredible. The ceviche is out of this world! If you are in the mood for breakfast. Don't hold back. They serve breakfast all day. Eggs a la mexicana, eggs rancheros, chilaquiles, chorizo and egg. Oh my God the combinations are incredible! In fact the experience I have had is that they will customize any dish to your taste. They even have a vegetarian dish comprised of all stir fried veggies with no grease whatsoever. So, whatever your taste at the Cocina Economica, don't hold back, order away! They deliver in the area. I call often and have Victor or his staff deliver my food. Thanks Cocina Economica and
