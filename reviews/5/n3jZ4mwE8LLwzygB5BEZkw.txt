TL;DR: Food and Service were excellent. Get the Guacamole, worth the $4. Food is well spiced but not spicy at all. 

My wife and I came in for the first time on Sunday evening because most of our normal Mexican food spots were closed. 

The sign said please seat yourself but our server was just coming out of the kitchen and showed us to a table before we could even look around. 

He took our drink order before heading off to bring us some chips. The high quality and speedy service continued the whole visit. 

The chips were fresh and warm and the salsa was tasty but on the mild side for us. When our Guacamole arrived we were immediately pleased,  clearly made in the last 5 minutes, it was great and a good size serving.

I ordered a number 2 combo with a cheese enchilada, beef taco and chile rellano. The enchilada was extremely tasty and the taco was well spiced and served with generous amounts of very tasty white and yellow cheese. If you are a chile rellano fan you know there are 3 types, 1 is just egg wrapped, 1 is a very crispy deep fried batter and the third is a very spongy, eggy batter that is prone to get greasy. This rellano was of the latter type, but was done extremely well and wasn't greasy at all. Generously filled with cheese. If you are looking for the really crispy type of rellano, I would order something else, but it was very good if you like this type.

My wife ordered the mini chimi combo with 1 beef and 1 chicken. It was a great choice because choosing between the 2 would be really hard. They were both delicious. 

The rice was well seasoned traditional Mexican rice and the beans were niceley prepared refried beans but only very lightly mashed, preserving a great bean texture. 

Overall, excellent food for a very reasonable price. Nothing is overly spicy (we like it hot, like Los Dos Molinos hot), but everything was well spiced and flavorful. Will be on our new list of favorites.
