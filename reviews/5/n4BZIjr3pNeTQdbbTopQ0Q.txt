 Did I mention Delicious?

I go to el Chino about twice a week. I acknowledge this with no shame. Since they have opened the service is much more streamlined and fast. The ingredients are fresh and with variety for those that really like to pile their tacos with a multitude of toppings.

Tacos are street-style size. Burritos are large in size. You will leave satisfied without feeling miserable. 

Suggestion: Get the Turkey taco. . . it will not disappoint. Make sure to put cheese on it.
