I had to wait for a tire to be put on my Gold Wing and came here for lunch. I thought this place was crazy good.I started off with fresh hot tortillas, fresh salsa bar, & all you can eat tortilla chips. I had the Chili Relleno combo plate with rice & beans. Everything tasted fresh & hot. This place was great, I will be back.
