Omg, what a hidden jem! ! Warm service and amazing food. Seven seas soup was loaded with seafood and so good. Lobster contras were like nothing I've tried before, delicious. Sorry I didn't post pics, we wolfed down the food before anyone could remember to snap some pics. I'll post next time, like tomorrow...
