My family and I moved out here from Southern California recently and have been trying to find a good Mexican restaurant. So far nothing has blown us away, until now. Service, food, drinks are all top notch at Juan's. From the salsa, bean dip, and fried onions/jalape√±os they bring before the meal to the great enchiladas, Juan's is hands down the best Mexican food in Vegas!
