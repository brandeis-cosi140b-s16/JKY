Cheap and good, plus ambience.  It feels like being somewhere in Mexico.  I ordered a burrito for less than $5 with tax, which was not only huge, but good quality; filled with nice tasty chunks of chicken you don't have to spit out because of fat or gristle.  The woman who took my order at the counter was very friendly and so was the person who brought it to my table.  This place is so authentic, they naturally assume you are Hispanic and begin talking to you in Spanish.  I liked that.
