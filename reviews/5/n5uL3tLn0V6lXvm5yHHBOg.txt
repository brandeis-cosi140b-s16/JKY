Despite not being able to find the place at first because Google didn't tell us it was right next door to a gentleman's club (literally. Same building, same parking lot. Just off to the left of the gentleman's club). 
But amazing food!! All organic meat too! Our waiter was on top of everything, refills, asking us if we needed anything. I mean he was seriously amazing. We're from Idaho and this is by far the best Mexican food we have ever had! 
Highly recommend this place!
