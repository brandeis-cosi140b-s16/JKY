stopped here while driving through Arizona. Service was amazing - lady at the front explained all the food to us and offered suggestions. The flavored water was really good and not full of chemicals like some artificial ones. I had carne asada tacos and they were excellent. Free chips and a salsa bar to top it off. excellent!
