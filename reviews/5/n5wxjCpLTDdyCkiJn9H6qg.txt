I grew up in the East Valley, but my best friend and her family are from Peoria. For years, I heard about the food and margaritas at Carambas, so when my husband and I came to visit over New Year's, we had to go. 

I loved it. The atmosphere is laid-back and unassuming, and perfect for the price point offered. The $3.25 margarita is better than many served at the larger restaurants for upwards of $7, and the salsa bar is fresh and tasty.  Although other reviewers take issue with the $.25 refill policy, I was more than happy to dole out a couple of quarters. In this economy, I am grateful for the large portions and cheap prices at Caramba's. Perhaps Phoenicians are spoiled with the "free refill" policy at so many places, but after years of living elsewhere, I have an appreciation for a smaller business that is keeping its doors open and prices down as well as respect for a small $.25 instead of the higher $.50 and $.75 found in other major cities. 

I ordered the enchilada, chicken taco combo with rice and beans, and I couldn't believe the price for the amount of food, let alone the great quality. My husband, who is a life long vegetarian, enjoyed how many options he had, and on our second trip to Caramba's he even attempted the Giant Caramba done vegetarian style!

After 5 years in Seattle, my mind had built up a shrine to good Mexican food, and Caramba's delivered. If I travel back to Phoenix, even if I'm staying on the other side of town, I will definitely be making the trip out to Glendale. My only regret is that I didn't get to try the cheese crisps...Next time!!
