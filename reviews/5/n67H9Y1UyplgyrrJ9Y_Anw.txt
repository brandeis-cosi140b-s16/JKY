Casa Reynoso is the best. Always friendly family service and delicious food to boot. When my husband and I loved in Chandler we were here once a week. Favorite things include the Gallo burro, green chile pork, shredded beef tacos, rellenos and their cheese enchiladas! It's unpretentious, indulgent home cooked food. 

Their salsa is so addictive we used to buy it to go. We're now in California, but every time we're back in Phoenix we stop here. Still a friendly smile and warm greeting every time.
