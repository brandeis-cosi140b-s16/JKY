I used to basically despise Rubio's until last last year. My previous experiences with the chain has always resulted in bitter disappointment. The sauces were somewhat nauseating and the food always seemed to come out cold. 

Late last year a girl I was dating talked me into going to a nearby Rubio's. Wow. What a difference. I can only assume that Rubio's management changed at some point during the intervening years. The menu was diverse and offered a ton of options for a seafood eater like me. 

The most outstanding dish is the Chile Lime Wild Salmon burrito. This is truly delicious fast food. Grilled salmon and a wonderful light cream sauce. The whole lineup of tacos and burritos is great, with some of the new shrimp creations being the real standouts.\

The location at Riverview is always clean. The staff is efficient, professional, and friendly. I had an issue one time when someone walked out with my order. The manager comped my meal that time and comped me a future meal. I didn't even have time to complain.
