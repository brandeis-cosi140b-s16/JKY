If you ever go here, make sure and get the Pollo Fundido!!!  The best ever!!  And make sure and get the FROZEN margaritas, NOT the regular margaritas, because they are way stronger than the regular.  I love this place and would highly recommend it for a date, or a night out with some of your friends.
