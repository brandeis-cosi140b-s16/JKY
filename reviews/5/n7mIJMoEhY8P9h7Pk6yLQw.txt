I've  Lived in the Phoenix area since 1977 and have tried many Mexican food restaurants all over the country. If you want some great Mexican food, you'll need to try Arriba's. Once you sit down, you'll get tasty, hot tortilla chips, flavorful salsa and bean dip. My husband & I normally order a carne asada burro, chicken con queso, chicken burrito and cheese crisp. Everything is made to order, so if don't like green or red sauce, you are good to go. I like their chicken dishes because the chicken has flavor and is not mushy. I hate going to a Mexican restaurant  & find their salsa is a can of tomato sauce & some red pepper flakes - you won't find that here! We go to Garcia's (marginal) amd my kids like Casa Reynoso (I'd rather eat dirt!) and I hate that I waste my money at these so-called "authentic Mexican" restaurants when you can find much better food! Give Arriba's a try! We go to the Arriba's in Chandler at least once per month and have always had great service.
