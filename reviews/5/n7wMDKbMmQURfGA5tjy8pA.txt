Second time, same experience. Thank you to Chef Paco for another fabulous lunch! We were able to bring a local friend who had never been there before and he thoroughly enjoyed it as well. Killer street tacos for a buck a piece! Don't pass this place up if you're looking for Mexican food in Las Vegas. You won't be disappointed!
