On hot days, I crave soup to lower my body temperature. The reviews of the tortilla soup were convincing and tempting to try. No disappointment here. In fact, it exceed my expectations. It's a very generous portion- so much so that I wasn't able to eat it all- a little broth left behind. It has a very light tomato base, not ketchuppy the way some are. The chicken is grilled then added, so the blackened seasonings soak into the broth, adding to the several depths of flavor. It is loaded with chicken, fresh avocado and the Mexican cheese. The tortilla
Strips are added so they soften, adding more flavor and easy to eat. I could eat this every day. But I also hope they offer pozole someday, as that is my favorite. 
They also have an impressive and extensive salsa bar. Don't miss this gem!
