Los Alamos with Julio, its owner, is one of those rare jewels that keeps us searching HolesInTheWall for Nirvana. 
We started eating there weekly in 2007 until recently when I moved and go back whenever in the area. Have sampled every item on his menu over the years, at Julio's insistence, and found not one I didn't find excellent, even if skeptical at first! 
Especially like his signature Alamo Torta with three meats- It's To Die For and Huge.
Not only is the food great, but Julio's personality makes it all the better. We quickly became friends (you can't help it) and good friends shortly after, sharing life stories. Julio and his brother (Los Alamo's regular chef) are accomplished in the Kitchen and it shows. 
Many dishes are Julio's own recipes with the remainder coming from grandparents near Sonora in Sonora.  Lord, they must eat well on that rancho.
