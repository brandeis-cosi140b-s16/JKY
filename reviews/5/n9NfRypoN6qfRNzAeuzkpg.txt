So here I am driving around in a strange town looking for something to eat.  Usually this doesn't end well. Not knowing where to eat I checked Yelp on my phone and it guided me to Senor Taco.
 We pulled into the drive trough and the menu was huge. after a quick study I ordered the 5 rolled fish tacos, 5 rolled beef tacos, 2 sides of beans and 2 sides of rice. All of this was under $20. service was quick and we were on our way.  When we got back and set it out there was a lot of food and a butt load of salsa. This was plenty of food for 3 of us we even had leftovers. The food was great for quick Mexican food.
 Next time I'm in Mesa i will be stopping by Senor Taco good stuff man.
