Stopped by with my laptop late last Friday afternoon to enjoy some craft brews and prep for a class I'm teaching Saturday morning.  Normally I have nothing but great things to say about Mad Mex in Scott Town Center, but I was mildly annoyed by a new server who seemed to abandon me after finding out I wished to stay and work after purchasing my meal and buying several craft brews.  This is not the normal treatment at this establishment for the guy at table #28 with the laptop.  In any case, great food & great selection of microbrews!
