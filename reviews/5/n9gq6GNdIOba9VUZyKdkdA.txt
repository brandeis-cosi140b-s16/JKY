One of my favorite new spots! This is an authentic mexican restuarant & I loved it! I felt like I was on the beach in Rocky Point. We had the carne asada fajitas, chicken chimi & the fried ice cream for dessert. The steak was so tender & flavorful & the guacamole salsa they bring out with the chips at the beginning is to die for! They have salsa dancing on friday nights & the dance floor is pretty big. Great find :) Will for sure go here again
