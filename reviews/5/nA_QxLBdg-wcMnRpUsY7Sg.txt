I went on a trip to Vegas and stayed at the down town grand. I found myself eating at the commissary almost everyday. The food is good, fast and hot. You know it's fresh when they are making it in front of your eyes. Love the cubano torta which has ham, carnitas, and Swiss cheese press together in a panini machine. 
I wish I had a place like this in my home town. 
Also, this place is the only walking distance for lattes, and coffee drinks! My fav is the dirty chai, it's a chai latte with two shots of espresso. Yum
