This is my first yelp review ever, and this place is deserving of it. I work and live right down the road, so this place has become a staple.  They have this huge 16 inch burrito  (no joke) super reasonably priced and to mirror the review before me, the food is outstandingly fresh.  Recommend for good authentic burritos!
