This is my favorite Chipotle in Phoenix. I really like the converted historic building that it's housed in, and the food is consistently yummy. Also, it's rarely as busy as other Chipotle stores in Phoenix or Scottsdale. There is usually plenty of parking, plus a nice patio that is good for people-watching.
