Looking for something special...this is it. I love this place. I go here for that special date night, or the I just need a good night out night. I can not say enought about the staff. The owners make you feel like family.If you see Linda one of the owners, you will feel like you are meeting an old friend. .the menu is every chefs dream. just waiting for you to enjoy. Do not miss the sunset deck..or the outside garden eating area.. it's a must see and eat Joann Hardy
