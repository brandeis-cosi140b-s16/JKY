I have found a competitor for best Mexican restaurant in Madison! It functions as a grocery store as well, so I can buy some Mango Juice when I have cravings.

I went with the Bistec Encebollado, which is enough food to feed a small Mexican family. I decided to add a steak taco and gordita pastor to it, because why not. Massive portions, very tasty and the price was so cheap! I will most certainly be back!
