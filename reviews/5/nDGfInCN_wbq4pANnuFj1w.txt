The food was fantastic and fairly priced. Our server was very friendly, helpful, and enthusiastic about the dishes he recommended to us. 

The happy hour specials are also at convenient times for dinner, bringing the cost of booze down to better levels. Try the Baltika 6, it's a darn good beer!

The interior is spacious, but still feels cozy.  There are tables and chairs, as well as lounge seating if you want to relax.

All in all, a great experience. Would come again!
