As far as an inexpensive but still really excellent burritos is concern, this Roberto's is the best out of the ones (the others are located in the SW) I have actually tried.

Unlike the other locations, the burritos served here comes to you nice and hot. The burritos is packed with the filling you ordered, and not with rice and beans.  The burrito I love ordering here the most is Lengua (tongue), it is simply the best.  I actually went here for lunch and again for dinner after my class in the same day.  And they do serve Shrimp Burrito at this location.

They also have a simple fresh juice bar, where they will squeeze fresh oranges or carrots for your real fruits and vegetable juice.

The decore is not impressive, although a crew was in there tonight to do some remodeling. So next week, when I go back, the interior may look a lot more presentable.  They still have a few arcade games in there, and the jukebox too.  The salsa, cucumber and other garnishes are still available in the self served bar.

The staff here have no problem taking my order in English. The drive through is pretty active, but I didn't see a huge crowd in the store or in line for the drive-thru (could be the late lunch and late dinner times I was there).

Parking is not a hassel here. Location-wise, I would recommend it to any CSN student attending classes or works at the Cheyanne campus and others in the area.  I would not recommend driving to North Las Vegas if you live or work too far away just to eat here.

5 Stars for delicious burritos, good value for the money, and nice hard working staff in the kitchen.
