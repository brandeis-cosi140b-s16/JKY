Yelpers! You're letting me down here. Why has no one else reviewed Las Glorias yet? There are so many good reasons to go but I'll list a few:

*It's only 10 minutes south of downtown. Yes, it's South Phoenix, but you'll go further for Los Dos Molinos and it's not even that great. 
*The people are incredibly nice. They don't speak any English so you'll have to order in Spanish, but they're always polite and smiling when I go in to eat or pick up. 
*The food is damn good. Fresh seafood options include incredible ceviche tostadas, mouthwatering Camarones Culichi, grilled fish in garlic sauce and more. 
*This place needs the support of more Yelpers to survive. It's weathered the last two years, but I'm always afraid they'll close their doors. And that would be a loss. 

Come on, give it a shot! If you don't want to eat in, you can order to go. We've done it many times and the food is always great to have in front of the TV with beer.
