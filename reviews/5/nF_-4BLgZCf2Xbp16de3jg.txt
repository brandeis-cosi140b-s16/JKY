Since I haven't had my dose of Gallo Blanco, I had heard that there was a sister restaurant to Gallo Blanco, Otro Cafe. My boyfriend and I decided to try it out today for brunch. I was happy with the whole place and their food! It took me back to Gallo Blanco days.  We will definitely be coming here often for some delicious food.
