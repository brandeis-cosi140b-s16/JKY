I had the burros, which is actually a mix of 2 carnitas and 2 shredded beef, and they came with a scoop of guacamole.  They have a fixins bar with various pickled items, salsas, and limes.  I recommend the pickled onions, and the green salsa is very good too.  A great value, being that we often spend more at taco bell which isn't even in the same realm as this place.  Everything was made to order and very fresh. Next time, I will definitely have to try the amazing desserts they offer which included homemade popsicles, ice cream, pastries, and cakes, they looked sooooo good!
