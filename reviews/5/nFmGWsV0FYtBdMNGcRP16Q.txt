I've had some amazing tacos from taco trucks and being that I was in the area with my mom visiting my dad in the hospital, I was craving for some Mexican food. This is about as authentic as you can get on Craig Rd if you're looking for good solid Mexican food. They are made fresh and fast. The military discount is a nice touch, thank you!
