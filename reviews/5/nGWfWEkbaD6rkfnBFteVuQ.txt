We are seasonal residents of Wickenburg and have sampled many Mexican restaurants all around the country.  El Ranchero remains one of our favorites.  There are many selections on the menu that are seldom offered at Mexican restaurants.  We love to sample new items here and have never been disappointed.  Yesterday I had Tamal for the first time and it was outstanding.  My wife loves machaca and considers El Ranchero's the best she's had at any restaurant.  Definitely the best Mexican Food in Wickenburg.  Friendly service from the family-owned and operated restaurant plus great food and very reasonable prices.
