Had a wonderful lunch here today! Our server was great and went out of his way to make my boyfriends salsa extra spicy by cutting up jalapeños and adding them to the salsa! 

I ordered the 4 item combo with chicken tamale, beef taco and chicken flautas! The jalapeño jelly for the flautas is amazing! My boyfriend had carnitas fajitas and loved them. Good flavor! Also had a half piña colada half daqarui drink and it was really good.
