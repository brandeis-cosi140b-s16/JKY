I'm hopelessly addicted to the Guacamole Unico (fresh guacamole with dungeness crab meat on top) and their fresh tortilla chips. 

Had their chicken tacos this time - the chicken itself is delicious and has an amazing mix of toppings. It was the perfect amount of food - didn't leave me hungry, but also didn't leave me too full to order dessert (churros!). I didn't catch our server's name but she was very polite and friendly, and the service was quick but not rushed. Overall, a great dining experience. We'll definitely be back.
