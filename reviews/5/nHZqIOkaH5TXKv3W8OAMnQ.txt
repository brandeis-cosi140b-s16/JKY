I'm an easy grader, I know.
But I loved the place, remined me of being in Mexico.

Pouring rain, ambient lighting inside, great food and nice people.

I had a plate of 3 little tacos: Barbacoa, Carne Asada and Pastor.
Very tasty, and the double corn torilla ensures they behave as they should.

Rice and beans on the side - properly seasoned.
REAL beans - not lard beans.  Actual beans, made by hand I am sure.

Good ice tea.
Clean, well lit and a nice clean bathroom.
