I am surprised too that I am giving a 5 star rating. However, this place deserves it. This location in particular just wow-ed me. Both employees that I met where extremely nice and had outstanding customer service skills. It shocked me and I was pleasantly surprised. They kept addressing me by first name after I told them my name, nice touch. They made my order exactly the way I wanted it and verified my specifications to be sure I got what I wanted. The food was good, fresh, and I got exactly what I paid for. I had a salad with grilled chicken, pico de gallo, cheese, guacomole, romaine lettuce, and pinto beans. YUM!!! Plus more low-cal than most other fast foodie type choices. Overall great experience, I will definitely be going back.
