I went there for dinner with my father Friday night and have never been a fan of Mexican food until now.....What a place!  Everything was delicious, with unique flavors.  We are definitely going back- it's our new favorite restaurant at Red Rock. What made it even more special is that the owner took time to come over to our table and chat with us! Wow! He, Hayes Swope, obviously knows what he's doing!!! So many restaurants lack that personalization from the owner and staff.  He is charming, intelligent, and works so hard to make sure that the staff and guests are happy.  My father couldn't say enough nice things about him. Wonderful experience!
