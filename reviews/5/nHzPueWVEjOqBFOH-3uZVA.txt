Decided to check this place out based on all the rave reviews. The location threw me a little bit, being located in a strip mall across from Walmart. Once inside however, it's clear the owners really care about the store. Very clean, and the employees are very welcoming.

My girlfriend and I split an order of fish tacos and fries. I put their Tatar sauce, coleslaw, hot sauce, and chipotle sauce on mine. My god, the reviews can't do it justice. Let me say that I'm not normally a huge fan of fish, but the fish was so melt-in-your-mouth-delicious, you can't help but fall in love. The fries alone are worth a visit. Even splitting an order, I was full.
