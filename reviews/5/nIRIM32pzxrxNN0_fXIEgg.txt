Best tacos on the strip.  Open 24/7.  No ambiance just a cafe with some limited seating.  Food cooked in the middle of the room--you see what you're getting.

Went down here a couple times this week.  Good tacos.  Fresh sliced and cooked meats, pastor tacos were well spiced and flavored.  Big plate of peppers came along with it.  

24/7 was a big help:  tacos at 3am.  Mmm.  Bought total of five tacos for myself and the cab driver with two drinks total $13 bucks and they take American Express.

Give it a try.  Real good value and great hours.
