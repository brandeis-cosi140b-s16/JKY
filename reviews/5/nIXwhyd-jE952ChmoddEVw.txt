Just had the short rib tacos and the chicken tacos they were delicious my favorite would have to be the short rib wow the patio at this restaurant is huge it is a beautiful outdoor setting and our server was awesome his name was Christian. The traditional guacamole was very fresh.   This is a great place I highly recommend.
