HIGHLY RECOMMENDED:  Fili B's rocks!  Open 24/7 so whenever you've got the craving that only Filiberto's can fill. 

My review is rather limited, as I admit that I order the exact same menu item EVER single visit. I hear they have other delicious menu items although I'd never know. 

I order the carnitas burrito and it is delicious. Starting with the fresh tortilla...  It's perfect. Warm, fresh and very tasty...  It only gets better from here. The pork is succulent and perfectly caramelized perfection. They've added fresh guacamole and pico de gallo that add an additional explosion to your impatiently waiting tastebuds. Top this off with their salsa bar and pickled carrots and you've got one of the best burritos in the Valley!

They have 8 valley locations and offer weekday specials.
