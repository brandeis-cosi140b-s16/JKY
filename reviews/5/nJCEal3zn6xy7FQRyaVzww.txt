The food here is just so good! This restaurant doesn't look like much on the outside but looks can be deceiving though. I came here with two of my friends and we were impressed with the quality of the food here overall. The location is not in the best area of Phoenix but overall that shouldn't deter you from coming here at all. At least it's fairly close to the airport making it a great spot for a meal.

I had the grilled fish + shrimp with the garlic sauce as well as refried beans + mexican rice. Everything was great! I'm looking forward to my next visit here already.
