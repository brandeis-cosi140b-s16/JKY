Awesome.  Great margaritas. Pineapple habanero salsa and black bean dip FTW.

This is not traditional Mexican by any stretch, and that's a good thing.  It's more of a tex-mex style.  The portions are big so expect to take some home with you.  Other reviewers mention the food being hit and miss.  My mom lives nearby and I make a stop nearly every time I'm home.  I've eaten here more than a dozen times and never had a "miss".

Enjoy flipping through the menu looking for their little comedy gags and puns!

The bar gets crowded and closes at midnight.  It's too bad they don't stay open later because it could be a great suburban hangout when you don't want to mess with traffic.
