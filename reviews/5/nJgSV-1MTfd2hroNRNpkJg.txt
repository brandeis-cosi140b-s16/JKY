My first review on YELP...
What a great place.  I go to Vegas every 3 months, and ALWAYS stop to see the ladies at YOLOS...great food and they are caring wonderful servers ! 

In 2012 I met my now girlfriend at YOLOS...stopped with a buddy for a drink, she walked in and BOOM...evidently YOLOS is becoming known as a place for people to meet and actually start a relationship in VEGAS....who knew !

Im from Canada and she is from phoenix and guess where we meet every 3 months !!  YOLOS !!!!

Mexican food, fresh made, great drink deals and mixed drinks, and wonderful staff...I cannot give them enough stars.  Great location for people watching and near an exit door and washrooms for those who need such things.

Try the chips and (3 kinds) of salsa...awesome...and the lunch specials are great too.
