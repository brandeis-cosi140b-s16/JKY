Having tried Mexican food in Corpus Christi Texas, I'm pretty confident when I say I've had authentic Mexican food, and this place has legit Mexican food. I've tried several different "Mexican" food places in Charlotte, but this one is by far my favorite. Freshly made food daily, great seasonings, generous portions, decent prices...Give this place a try!
