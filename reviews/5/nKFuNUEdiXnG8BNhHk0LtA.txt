I have been coming to this restaurant since it opened. The food is usually spot on and delicious.  Over the years they have moved locations to accommodate their growing popularity. The food has taken a hit unfortunately and isn't as good as before. Probably because they are so busy now a days.  However, I still love their food and love to see Margaret in the kitchen after all of these years :)
