THE best salsa I've had in a while and great, crispy chips.  Our waitress, Laurie, was attentive and food arrived hot and fast.  I had the Chicken Pibil Tacos (in honor of the Taco Festival in Scottsdale this weekend) and loved them.  A focus of Manuel's seems to be on customer service and it shows.  Great place for lunch-will be trying out the dinner menu soon.
