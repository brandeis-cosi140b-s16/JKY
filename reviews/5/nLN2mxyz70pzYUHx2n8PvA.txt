Ok, so I had been scouting this place out for a while, mainly because it looked like such a dump and was located next to a bus stop.  I finally stopped in a couple months ago and it was... really tasty!  Don't let the shack-like appearance of this place fool you - it's damn good mexican food.  Best I've had in the Downtown area actually.  I definitely recommend the "gorditas," which actually taste a lot like what Taco Bell call chalupas.  Sort of a thick, buttery, fried taco.  Good stuff
