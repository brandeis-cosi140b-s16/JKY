Their food is both simple and excellent.  Perhaps the best I've had in Madison.  Lunch was $5.99 including a soda to drink.  I've tried their Steak Chimichanga and chicken flauta.  The steak was excellent, and the chicken was too, and I'm not a fan of chicken generally.  Salsa was tasty, and everything was fresh.  I agree with the previous review, that it's not really a panaderia, but a taqueria.
