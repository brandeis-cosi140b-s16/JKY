Definitely a great place to check out for lunch downtown! $12 got me a gigantic burrito and a mexican soda. They have a great variety of meat you can choose from for either a taco, burrito, quesadilla, nachos and more. The staff was incredibly friendly and the food was delicious. The food was delicious and I will definitely be going back soon to try more of their menu items!
