On business in Tempe for 5 weeks and I've been her 6 or 7 times. The tacos are a buck fifty a pop and they are all delicious. I loved the barbocoa and the cabeza tacos. The Birria was amazing. Braised forever and so tender with just the right amount of spice. Try their sister restaurant on the other side of the market for the freshest seafood you will find in the desert!
