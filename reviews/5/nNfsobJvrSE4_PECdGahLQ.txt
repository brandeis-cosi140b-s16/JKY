The chips and 5 different kinds of salsa are homemade-everything is fresh and made from scratch, prices reasonable, portions generous, the place is well-lit and clean, the service great and staff friendly. On a Wednesday night, this place was PACKED and there were constant carry out orders being made, as well. I want to go back there and try every single thing on the menu! Over and over! This place is every bit as GOOD as Manzella's is BAD! My sister and I both agreed we will keep going back for more!!!
