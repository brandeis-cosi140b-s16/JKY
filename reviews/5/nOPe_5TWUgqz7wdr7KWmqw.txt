Our first visit to Rubios and we will definitely be back.

Why 5 stars? If you read my other reviews you'll see I take the whole experience into consideration. So, while a casual restaurant certainly won't ( in most cases) compare to a gourmet venue, each deserves a score based upon reasonable expectations for that particular class of establishment.

Their basic fish tacos rival or surpass those we've had at 'fine dining' locations. The fish was fresh, the batter crunchy, cabbage and toppings crisp and the corn tortillas a perfect complement to the batter... plus they didn't fall apart.

We also tried the salmon taco and blackened Ono taco. The salmon taco was very good but the blackened Ono was exceptional!

We also enjoyed the mashed pinto beans (not refried with lard) and nice selection of flavorful salsas.

The service was friendly and fast and when we jokingly asked if there were any specials for first time customers the woman taking our order gave us free drinks... now that's someone who knows how to make a good first impression. 

When the same woman brought our order to the table she saw the sun was in my eyes and cheerfully offered to lower the sun shades. Wish I'd gotten her name to write a note to Rubios HQ.

The place was CLEAN... all tables, salsa bar, drink area and restrooms.

To sum up. Can this Rubios compare to a place like Capitol Grill? Absolutely not. But in it's class of establishment Rubios is a standout and deserves a 5 star rating.

We'll be back often.
