I went into Canteen, I really like the new setup that they have there, the new menu's alright a little different from what I had initially expected, had great overall experience with great waiting staff. Chris and Kelly gave us great service and were great to us making it a very good time.  Will come back and try a different meal if they keep up the great service. Very enjoyable!
