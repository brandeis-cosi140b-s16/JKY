My friend and I had time to kill before the Cirque/MJ show and so stopped in at Hussong's. Lucky us! We had a great time here. Our bartender was sweet, attentive and personable and the drinks were STRONG. 

The Cantina has fun decor and although it might seem strange to rave about chips/salsa/guac...Hussong's is that good. The green tomatillo salsa was so nice and smokey and the red salsa had the perfect bite and tang. Delicious guacamole. 

One of the highlights of our visit to Hussong's was the rockin' Mariachi band! The troupe started out with Mariachi classics but then performed the likes of Pink Floyd, Johnny Cash and and Neil Young. I'd come back just to see these guys!
