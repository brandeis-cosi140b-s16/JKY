My first time here and I went to the new Warm Springs location.  I have to say I'm never going back to Chipotle!   I walked in the door and was greeted by the whole staff with a smile!  Even the owner/manager, I believe he was, thanked me for coming and I had just step foot in the door!!   Hard to find that kind of customer service now days.  I told them this was my first time here and they let me sample all the proteins.   It was very hard to pick what I wanted it was all so damn good.  The staff walked me through the whole process and explained every ingredient.   Kudos to management for hiring competent employees!   
 Down to the awesome iPad payment system, you guys kick @ss and definitely have a return customer.  

Oh, and the coconut bark is freakin ridiculous, I'm trying to eat healthy and that is just too good to pass up!
