Great cheap Mexican food in the area. Salsa bar, great pricing and they don't charge you for every little extra thing like annoying Mi Familia. Caminero is definitely a Mom and Pop style Mexican Restaurant with a understanding of mexican spices for flavorful food, which I appreciate, We are lucky to have family businesses that still care about what they're serving to their customers. I love eating the  Burritos, Chimi's , Nacho's and tamales that I stick in the freezer for a quick meal during the days I don't want to cook.
