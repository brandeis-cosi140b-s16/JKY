Unlike one of the reviewers who had so many negative things to say, I think Chipotle's portions are indeed huge and extremely generous. I love the customer service I receive everytime I come here. The staff is always very sweet, upbeat, and fun!

Chipotle is by far my favorite place to eat because they are organic. Food with Integrity indeed. 

As far as extra servings, I've never been charged extra for anything. Perhaps that's because I treat people with respect while some might bark out demands. Either way, Chipotle is awesome... and their guac kicks major ass!

Hooray for yummy chicken salads with pico!!
