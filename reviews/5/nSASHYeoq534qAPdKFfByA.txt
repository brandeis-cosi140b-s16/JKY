Came in on Valentines night and was welcomed by Olivia at the bar. Great personality and attitude that flowed with the customers. She took care of me and my husband from the time we sat down. Ordered our usual the El Primo Margarita's and by far they are the best in the town. Love how this place is very attentive to the customers. We frequent Nachos quite often and this is by far the best place to relax and have a great time to unwind and relax.  Shout out to Olivia for taking care of us and bringing us a Coconut Flan on her. She is the greatest and has gone above and beyond to take care of us!!!
