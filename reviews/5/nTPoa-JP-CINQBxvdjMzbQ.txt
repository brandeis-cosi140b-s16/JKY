My dad and brother first discovered Chipotle a couple of years ago. They loved it and were always talking about it. I went with them once to see what the big deal was, and not knowing what to get, I ordered what my dad usually gets (barbacoa beef with hot sauce and fresh salsa). I'm kind of a dweeb when it comes to spicy food, and the barbacoa beef and hot sauce at Chipotle are not messing around. I'm sure a hardcore Mexican food fan would smack me on the forehead like those V-8 commercials, but while it was tasty, I'm pretty sure I lost a solid thousand tastebuds that day. 

That soured my first experience there. But, a few months ago, I returned. I had the steak bowl with pinto beans, rice, fresh salsa, cheese and extra cilantro (you can never have too much cilantro). I swear to god my eyes went black like a shark's when I started to eat. I was sold. I loved Chipotle now and I would sing their praises like a Jehovah's Witness. 

It's not just the awesome, fresh, relatively low-cal (if you stick to the bowls) food. It's the employees and the restaurant, too. The second time I came in with my dad and brother, a couple of the employees recognized us and remembered what we had gotten. They're always friendly, quick, and organized. And you know what? They genuinely look like they love their jobs. They're always happy, laughing, and smiling every time we're in there. The store is always immaculate and they are hardly ever out of any of the food. 

Definitely hit up this Chipotle. You won't be sorry!
