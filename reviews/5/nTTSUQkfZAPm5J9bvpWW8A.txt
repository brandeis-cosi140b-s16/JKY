i haven't tried every mexican place in champaign but i'm just going to go out on a limb and assume el charro is the best out there.  it reminded me of chano's back home in los angeles, good solid taqueria food that isn't culinary brilliance but is most definitely authentic and delicious.  the milanese torta was awesome - it was perfect proportioned and neatly put together which is a must when it comes any type of sandwich for me.  the tamales are smallish but yummy.  i was also very very excited to see la lechera (the best way to top berries, hands down) and all the different flavors of jarritos! yay for el charro for giving me a reason not to miss home as much as i potentially could have!
