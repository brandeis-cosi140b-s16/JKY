What a turn-around.

After our horrible experience a couple weekends ago, the owner of Migos sent me a very polite email apologizing for our experience and asking us to come back and give them a second chance.  I figured if they took the time to read my prior review and to reach out to me, that I could give them a second chance.  I am glad that I did.

First of all, the buffet had food and it didn't run out.  So that was already a huge improvement over last time.  In all seriousness, through, the buffet was great.  It includes the following: scrambled eggs, pancakes, bacon, steak fajitas, corn tortillas, flour tortillas, beans, rice, chorizo with potatoes, onions with potatoes, and chorizo mini chimis.  In addition, you can order from your table fruit plates (which were delicious.  They included watermelon, cantaloupe, strawberries, and pineapple), chilaquiles, huevos rancheros, omelets, and menudo.  My only suggestion would be fpr Migos to add some shells, lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, and guacamole so that we can make tacos out of the steak!

In addition, you can get the buffet with unlimited memosas.  They have three kinds but we stuck to the orange juice memosas.  They tasted good.  Also, unlike last time, they had a singer there who sang songs to a track and also with his guitar.  He was a very good singer and very nice.  He also had his son sing a couple songs, and his son was a good singer.

Finally, the service was much better than last time.  Our waiter was on top of things from the beginning.  He was very good about refilling our drinks, offering us things off the menu, and asking if we would like a clean plate for the buffet.

All in all, it seems that my first experience with Migos was a fluke.  I highly recommend this place and will definitely be returning!
