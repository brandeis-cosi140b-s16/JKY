I just moved to Scottsdale and wanted some good Mexican food and a fun place. Our server was prompt and friendly and when I asked what her recommendation was she gave me several options. 

The chips and salsa were perfect and the waitress refilled them without us even having to ask. Our food came out promptly and was delicious. As a whole, this restaurant was fantastic and I will absolutely be back!
