Stayed here at the Luxor for two nights and ate dinner here both nights. The first night was so good we had to come back again. Atmosphere is awesome, great music, great food, great service. I ordered the Taco salad the first night, and the chicken burrito the second. The chicken burrito is probably the best burrito I've ever had in my life, seriously! This place rocks! Definitely must go if your staying here in the Luxor!
