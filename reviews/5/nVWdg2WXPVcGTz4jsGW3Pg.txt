Los Taquitos was featured on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives, and I'm fortunate enough to live only about a mile away.

This will be one of the best Mexican food restaurants you'll ever go to and everything that I've tried on the menu has been really good. 

My favorite menu items are the Carne Asada Torta, the Bombero Chicken Burrito, the Marinated Pork Tacos, the Carne Asada Tostada, and the Chile Relleno. 

The Carne Asada Torta is one of the best sandwiches I've had. The Bombero Chicken Burrito is a chicken burrito that's covered in "Bombero Sauce". The Bombero sauce has an amazing flavor to it; it's kind of sweet and spicy at the same time, and unlike any sauce you've ever had. 

Another plus is that it's a family ran business and the women that work there are gorgeous. 

Authentic and great tasting food, quick service, large menu, and beautiful women; gives Los Taquitos five stars.
