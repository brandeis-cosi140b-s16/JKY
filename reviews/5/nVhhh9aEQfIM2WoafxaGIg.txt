The feel of this new Upward Projects concept is amazing!  Mid Century Modern with a Mexican twist... so unique.  The people working here are very friendly and the despite being a newer place, the service doesn't seem to have kinks to be worked out, which is nice.  The food is very good, with the exception of a couple "just ok" experiences.  The drink specials, and atmosphere keep us coming back for Sunday Fundays and weeknight dinners!
