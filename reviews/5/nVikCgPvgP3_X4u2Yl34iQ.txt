In town on last day of western holiday, craving some Southwest flavor

After 10 years in Houston, followed by 12 years in 'Mexican cuisine hell'....Europe, Cincinnati and now Charlotte.....we were blessed to find Blue Adobe near our hotel

Meal was outstanding.  Wife had tamales, oldest son had house specialty carne adovada, and I had jambalaya....yes, I said jambalaya.

All were flavorful, spicy and smokey, and did not disappoint.  New Southwest flavor with kick, heart and soul

Highly recommend a stop in when you are in Mesa area
