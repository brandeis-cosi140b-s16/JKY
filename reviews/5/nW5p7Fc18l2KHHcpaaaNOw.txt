I have been there twice now and both times had an excellent experience.  The first time was on a weeknight and so it was relatively quiet.  The food was good (I ordered off the 550 calorie menu and was very happy!) and the salsa was phenomenal.  The second time was on a CRAZY busy Saturday night and had an equally good experience.  Loved the pork sliders!  Friends had the fajitas and were raving about them, too.  I'll be back!
