On my way to Hanshiktaco I was thinking to myself . "How could I crave for something I've never had? " I tried coming here a couple of times based on the Yelp reviews but I'm so lazy when it comes to driving! Today I was determined and hungry so I finally made it! I had four tacos (Beef, Chicken, Pork, Egg and Tofu) I ate it all before 5pm so I didn't feel bad. The meat in the tacos were so tender and full of flavor. The Kimchee had just the right balance of spice to it and I liked that it tasted fresh. I was surprised that I liked the egg and tofu taco so much because I'm a meat eater! I think the tofu absorbed all the spices and I liked the strips of red chips on there it gave it more bite! I also had the donuts which were nice and warm. This was accompanied by some Chrome soda which I thought went well with the meal because it tasted light and it didn't drown out the flavors just enhanced them. I have a new place to go when my husband tries to drag me to get tacos every other day. He has Robertos and I have Hanshiktaco..it just feels healthier!
