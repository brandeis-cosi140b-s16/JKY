Authentic mexican at its best.  Armando is the owner who creates a kid friendly, casual restaurant and serves excellent food.  We've been going there for years and have NEVER had a bad experience with the food, price or service.  I always get the Texas Burrito, which has chicken, steak and shrimp.  It feeds me for two days.  The street tacos are fairly new and are awesome!  We've tried most of the mexican restaurants in the Charlotte area and Mexicasa tops the list!
