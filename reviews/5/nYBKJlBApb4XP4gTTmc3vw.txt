Yummmmm! So the idea is like chipotle but hawaiian. Pick a bowl, burrito, tacos or nachos. Then you have a variety of rices, meats, sides, salsas and award winning guacamole to top it off. 

Huli hula chicken, kalua pig....mango salsa, seaweed rice..and for dessert coconut bark! O.M.G!!!

So I had a chicken bowl with cabbage, hot tomato salsa, seaweed rice and guacamole with jalape√±os. Amazing!!

The employees are awesome too. So friendly and fun!!!
