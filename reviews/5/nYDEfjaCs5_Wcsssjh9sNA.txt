Soooooo good! I had the Jade chicken in a quesadilla, BBQ pork, jerk rice and black beans. Loved everything! The Jade chicken had such a sweet flavorful glaze and the tortilla on the quesadilla was really nice and cruchy. There was plenty of cheese too. I also really recommend the jerk chicken, very tasty. The meal also comes with a snicker doodle cookie which was nice and soft and warm. I loved it. Even the fountain drinks were good. I liked how they had about 3 or 4 sugar free options. I had the pink Sobe drink. Really refreshing on a hot day. The staff was also super helpful and walked us through the ticket process. I live out of state but if ever I'm in Phoenix again, I'd gladly go back.
