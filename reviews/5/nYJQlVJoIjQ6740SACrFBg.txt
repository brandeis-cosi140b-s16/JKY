Great friendly staff. They have the same set of servers everyday. My friends and I are regulars and the ladies that work there know our orders by memory. They repeat them even before we've made up our mind. 

They're very nice and take care of you well. They even help me work on my spanish, I appreciate that. 

The salsa is runny. This is a Salvadorian place so I'm guessing that's how they make their salsa. It's still good. 

The pupusas are FANTASTIC! I always get the rubuelta. It has everything (pork, beans and cheese). One pupusa, rice and beans is $4.50! Can't go wrong with that.
