Had lunch with my daughter today, who isn't a fan of this type of restaurant, and we both cleaned our plates! She had the Chopped Chicken Salad and I had a meal prepared just the way I like it, steak fajitas with pico, veggies, and avocado. Low carb is how I like it and that's how they served it. Dragana was the name of our server and she was prompt, courteous, friendly, and very welcoming. If every Dos Gringos had a Dragana working for them I would probably visit more of them. This is my hot spot for lunch. The food, service, and price was excellent!
