Stopped in here last night on the recommendation of many Yelp reviewers after running errands. I'm glad others mentioned that it was located inside the Mercado.  The door was locked but someone was exiting so I asked if they were open.  The customer, an apparently very intoxicated man, but most pleasant, greeted me and started talking to me like I was an old friend.  The employee, also most pleasant, said they were closed.  When I asked what time they closed she said eight and it was close to 8:30, so I said I would come back another day.  Next thing I knew, she was letting me in and asking me what I would like to order.  I told her I had wanted to try the goat dish, Birria I think it's called.  So they started preparing it for me (to go).  I looked around while waiting and discovered they also have Thrifty Ice Cream, paletas, various Mexican desserts including strawberries and cream, flan, etc, also Aguas Frescas made with real fruit.  I don't eat a lot of Mexican food in Az because it is plentiful in San Diego, but I WILL be back to this place, only a few blocks from where I'm staying.  

The food was delicious.  But the customer service is even better!
