What a gem! Seriously. This place is near and dear to my heart. If this place would've been open when I went to high school across the street I think I would've wound up super fat.

I get the brûlée burger, with a mushroom, and it is amazing every time. The BBQ chips have a lot of flavor and keep me coming back for more every time. Their shakes are super decadent also. 

One day, I won't be such a puss and will try some of their crazy specials.
