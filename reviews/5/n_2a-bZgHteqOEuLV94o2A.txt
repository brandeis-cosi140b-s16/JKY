I originally ignored this place when I saw a Chipotle reference (note: it's just counter style). Not that I don't love my occasional Chipotle fix, but that's not what I was looking for. I just wanted REALLY good food. After rereading reviews, it sounded tempting and I put it on my radar. Shortly after, we ended up in the area and were hungry, so we gave it a try. I am so glad we did!

The staff was extremely friendly. The prices were very reasonable ($2 for a super stuffed taco?!). The meat (between us, we tried the pastor and beef) was incredible. So were the sauces/salsa. I kept my toppings fairly minimalistic, but it's nice to know you can add what you want. The flavor of the food was fantastic. We all left so satisfied.

I will definitely be back, even though it's in an odd location out of the way (for us). Oh, and they serve beer.
