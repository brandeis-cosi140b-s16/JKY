I have to say that Pittsburgh has become pretty saturated with decent taco places. While I do wish that someone would come up with another food inspiration, I can't help but understand why the taco is the obvious choice. A good tortilla can hold an endless amount of imaginative food combinations and, if done right, can really satisfy any hunger your body may encounter.

That being said, I have been hearing delicious things about El Burro for a really long time. Despite how often I'm in the Northside (read Parkhouse), I had yet to have gone until recently. Waiting this long was a huge mistake! All of these years I could have been feasting on delicious burritos and tacos instead of getting drinking ginger beers down the street! I had their special of the day which consisted of two chicken empanadas, rice and refried beans. The rice was ok. The beans were awesome and definitely fresh. But the empanadas were, by far, the best part. They were so simple and almost elegant. Chicken and cheese in a crispy corn meal shell, topped with lettuce and cilantro. There was also fresh (and very hot) salsa that made the meal perfect. Both myself and my guest devoured our meals in mere moments. I can't wait to go back and try more! This might become a problem. At least it's healthier than drugs.
