Great mexican that is fresh, fast and good. I love the fish taco tuesday fish tacos for $1.50 (deep fried white fish, corn tortilla, white sauce, cabbage & tomatoes). They have a very good salsa bar; however I do wish they had a hotter salsa on it. If you are in a hurry I would call ahead your order and it will be ready when you get there.
