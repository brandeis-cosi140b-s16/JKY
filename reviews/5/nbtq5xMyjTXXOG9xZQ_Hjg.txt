Now that I've tried pretty much everything on Jolene's menu, I'm ready to update my review. There's no doubt in my mind. This is a 5-star hangout. Honestly, I think her Green Chile Chicken Stew is worth the price of admission alone. I've had it every single time I've visited and I absolutely love it. For me, it has quite a bit of heat initially, but that mellows out for the rest of the cup. I dread the day when Vegas gets too hot to enjoy a cup of this awesome stew.

As for the other items, I particularly like the Red Burger. It's not on her original menu, but rather one she added recently. It's ridiculously delicious. I also like the Breakfast Burrito. It's a knife and forker due to it being covered in Red and Green Chile sauce. I love the large chunks of bacon in it.

I won't regurgitate the other items from my original review. Bottom line: I highly recommend tracking this truck down and getting your stew on while the weather is perfect for it. It will be interesting to see if she brings on any new items once we hit triple digits.
