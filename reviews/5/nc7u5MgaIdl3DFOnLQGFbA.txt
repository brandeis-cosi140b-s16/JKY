I was originally attracted to this place by the bright color scheme, chic decor, and relaxing music. It seemed like a nice place to have lunch. Many such places use this as a ruse, then don't deliver on the menu. No so at Distrito. Everything we ordered was delightful. We started off with their fresh, crisp tortilla chips and a thick and chunky (as it should be) guacamole. Excellent. Then there was the ceviche: the lemon sorbet they put on top added a nice texture and perfectly complimented the dish. 
For an entree, I had the carnitas and my friend had the mahi mahi fish tacos. Both were exquisite. I was impressed by how they took simple dishes and tweaked them slightly to create something altogether new and exciting.  This was a great lunch experience. I hope to return here soon.
