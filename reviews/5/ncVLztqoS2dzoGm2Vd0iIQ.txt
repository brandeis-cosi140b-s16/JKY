This is a nice Mexican restaurant. The atmosphere is very peaceful and just very relaxing. Service here is wonderful and everyone is very welcoming and polite.

I ordered a "tanga chicken burrito" and replaced my sides with rice and everything came out beautifully. The burrito was exquisite and detail was very much paid attention to while making it. 

The queso was  to die for so I highly recommend to everyone who goes there to get the "five cheese Queso fundido" as an appetizer. You won't regret it! 

This is one of the best Mexican restaurant I have ever been to.
