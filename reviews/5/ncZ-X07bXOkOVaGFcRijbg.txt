Ask for Enrique as your server, and that sums it all up, suggested, the 1 pound carne Asada plate, wow, tasted like I was at home barbecuing carne Asada in my back yard!  Came with chorizo and cactus ( that's Nopales for my latino friends) Very authentic, a must to come back to! Only complain, wife wants to know how I know about Saphires strip club, next door, hahahha! No comment!
