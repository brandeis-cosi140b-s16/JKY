Loved it.  Good old fashion Mexican food.  Had the combo of tamale, cheese enchilada and taco.  Nothing fancy, just good old fashion mexican food.  Had the enchiladas with red sauce.  Used to go to Globe when I wanted old style Mexican dishes but I think this is close.  It's still hard to beat Globe for good mexican food but this is close.  I will be back.
