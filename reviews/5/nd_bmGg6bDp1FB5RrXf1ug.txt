Lindo's has several locations but the one located on E. Desert Inn is superior to the other branches.  

I am guilty of ordering the same thing everytime I am there which is probably at least once a month.  Their food is always consistent.  I give them kudos for making the best guacamole tableside!  The avocado is always fresh.  My lunchtime favorite is the Camarones de Sarandeado.  The portion is just right and the sauce is what completes the whole meal!
