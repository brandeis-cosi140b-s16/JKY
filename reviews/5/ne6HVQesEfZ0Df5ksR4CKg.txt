In a location as over the top as the Cosmo in Las Vegas, my wife and I were pleasantly surprised by lunch here. I wouldn't recommend as a destination for dinner, but if looking for a quick meal on the lighter side, it's one of very few options around, without being a stereotype of itself.

Good food, fantastic flavors, and enthusiastic service.
