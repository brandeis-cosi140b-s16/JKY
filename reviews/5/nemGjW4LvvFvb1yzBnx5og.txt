This place rocks!! Ryan was our waiter & he is awesome! Super nice & fun. This place is amazing. We sat immediately & put food was here so fast it was crazy. It was soooo good. I had the salad & the lettuce was shredded so fine that it was seriously the easiest salad to eat... I know that sounds weird but if you eat salad a lot you know what I mean. 

Anyway, awesome place & food rocks & chips are made right here & super hot :)
Thanks!
