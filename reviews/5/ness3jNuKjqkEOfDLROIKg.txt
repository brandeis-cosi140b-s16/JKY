Enjoyed lunch picked up here today for the first time. I ordered their Green Chile Burro with green sauce. OMG was it delicious! So fresh and flavorful .... Not much heat (which is good in my book) and a large portion for the price ($6.50ish). The chips were a bust and was not a fan of the salsa/hot sauce but that did not even matter to me. More room for my amazing burro! We will definitely be back ..... in fact I plan on taking the family there this weekend for some dinner! Good stuff! Try the Green Chile!
