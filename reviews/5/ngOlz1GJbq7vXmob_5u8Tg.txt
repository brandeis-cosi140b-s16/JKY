I absolutely LOVE this place! It used to be in a Shell gas station but it's now in Anthem, where it belongs! This place was featured on "Diners, Dives and Drive In's" for a reason! It's Great! 
If you like Spicy, ask Roberto for his special HOT sauce that he now sells in a jar by the way!
You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. It's all fantastic!
