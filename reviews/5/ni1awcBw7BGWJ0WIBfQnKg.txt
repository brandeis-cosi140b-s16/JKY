Bajio makes me sing "Loco Gringos Like a Party." Okay, so Bajio isn't really where you go to party I was just compelled to use Rev. Horton Heat lyrics in this review. You could say it's like that old joke there's a party in your mouth and everyone's coming. Except it's the Bajio food that's making the party in your mouth... Um, where is this going?
 Bajio is *Krills! The brightly painted walls hold the enormous and very cool paintings (Prints?) on the walls, the weathered dangling lamps Bajio's decor makes you feel as though you should be in San Diego and not next to a Home Depot off of Flamingo. 
 When you get down to business and make your order the set up is that station style (like Subway) where you get to pick and chose the variety of beans, rice, meat, etc. Everything down to the sour cream is seasoned and that's what makes Bajio different from the other chains of Mexican food joints. It's not authentic but it's a place that you can prolly bring those who don't like Mexican food and they would eat it and you'd be happy to be there.  
 *Krills is street for Crack Rock.
