I have been on a quest for quite sometime to find the best fish tacos in town. I've tried them at bonefish grill, yardhouse, wahoo fish tacos ect... Still I always come back to rubios for the best fish tacos out there. The pieces of fish are large and crispy. Better than any restaurant I have tried fast food or not. Highly recommend!
