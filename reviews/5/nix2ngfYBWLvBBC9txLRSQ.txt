This is hands down the best mexican food ive ever eaten. Ive been a regular at El Burrito in Las Vegas for years . I recently moved to Southern California and have tried dozens of mexican restaurants to replace my El Burrito I miss so much ( its in Vegas only) . Well I have to tell you I  have a whole new appreciation nothing compares!  Not only ai El Burrito delicious homemade Mexican food its high quality mexican food. Believe me when I tell you their meats , guacamole, margaritas everything you can tell the difference from other places. They pick THE BEST! Do yourself a favor and try it. I highly recommend it. Try their homemade noodle soup with cheese.,Fajitas, guacamole burrito enchilada style well really any burrito enchilada style. It is the BEST enchilada sauce. Their margaritas are fabulous they definitely arent stingy with the tequila.  I have a high.appreciationn for this Mexican restaurant now that I have tried so many.other mexican restaurants that fall short ..Do yourself a favor try it.. simply delicious.
