Coming here for 27 years, I hadn't been since Irma took over.  I arrived before they opened for dinner, but she recognized us and had us brought in anyway.  Great when people in the business know the locals.

The all new decor is updated to stunning but not overdone - chic.  Kudos to the owners for keeping the original building and that classic neon sign.  Well done!  

The food is an unusual fusion of central and south American, ultra fresh and beautifully presented. The drinks menu is also unusual and refreshing.  There is enough variety without going overboard.  The prices are good and the portions are sensible.  

Head Server Jose is known to foodies downtown, and other familiar faces are on his team.  Chefs Oscar and Elias both visited the table to make sure everything was to our liking, and to describe our selections and other options.  We will certainly be back!
