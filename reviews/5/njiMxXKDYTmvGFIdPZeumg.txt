Never disappointed! This is one of my go-to's. Their salads are totally worth the money - one is enough for two meals or two people to share. The chips and queso is soooo good if you're looking to splurge. It's also enough to share - one serving will serve 2+ people. 

Make sure to get their stamp card!
