I've been here two times so far this year. Both times I was not disappointed. I'll share my most recent experience. Came today about lunch time. Promptly seated. Chips, beans, and ridiculously good salsa shop up at the table right after being seated. drink order taken immediately. Their staff worked together to keep us happy. Our drinks never saw the bottom of the cup. I appreciated that because there's nothing more annoying than the wait staff letting your cup sit empty while your trying to wash down your meal. 

I had the carnitas fajitas with corn tortilla. These were THE BEST carnitas I have had in my life this far. Incredible flavor! My bf had shredded beef tacos with the crunch shell. He really enjoyed it. 

They also have a little station in the corner of the restaurant where they have a lady making fresh flour and corn tortillas. I haven't tried the flour so I can't comment on those. But the corn tortillas are amazing too. The best. 

I look forward to visiting this place again.
