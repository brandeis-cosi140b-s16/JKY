A hole in the wall for sure (imagine a dingy quiznos)...but THE FOOD is not messing around - THIS is TRUE mexican. Quality fresh mexican food.   The chips are freshly fried, the salsa is freshly chopped - the tortillas are those special tortillas that I thought only real mexican families got to enjoy.  We get our orders TO GO and take them home, or to a picnic somewhere.  The CALIFORNIAN burrito (potatos, steak, PICO DE GALLO) - so very good. Lots of menu choices. Green salsa is good too.
