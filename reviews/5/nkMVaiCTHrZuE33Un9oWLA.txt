Great customer service . I never empty my drink. They  always refill my drink. They always check back at us to make sure we are ok. Food is excellent. My favorite is fried whole red snapper. Dipping sauce is delicious.  Fried ice cream is good too. They put peanut in. The only problem is so hard to find parking because they always busy.
