Wonderful new restaurant in mesa . Baja tacos captures what I have enjoyed for years, a taste of baja!

The shrimp tacos are amazing, the owner is warm and accommodating.

The place is new but her kitchen soul is old and wise when it comes to taste buds.

Thier family are baja natives, they also have been involved in baja racing so bring some stickers or swag you like and put it up on the board !

True Mexican cane sugar coke is here too, this place is authentic baja. Lots of Mexican influence and a walk out of your ordinary.

Try this place out!
