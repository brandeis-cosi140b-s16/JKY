My husband and I ate here for dinner while on vacation.  We both felt that the food was as good as when we were in Mexico.  Authentic Mexican!   The guacamole was made fresh to order and served with fresh chips and homemade salsa.  My husband had Carne Asada and I Fajitas.  The seasoning used in the marinade was amazing.  If you are ever in Charlotte or Pineville NC don't miss this hidden gem :). Appeared to be a place the locals love.
