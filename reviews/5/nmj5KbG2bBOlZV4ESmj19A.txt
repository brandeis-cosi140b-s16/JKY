Our first trip to Ajo Als.We had a wonderful lunch here today. Really authentic tasting. Great values and service. The homemade chips were awesome. I had a chicken enchilada in white jalapeno sauce. Filled with loads of chicken and served with rice n beans. I'd order it again and only $9.00 .My husbands combo plate was very tasty also. Wish we had this place up here in Prescott!
