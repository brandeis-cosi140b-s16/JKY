I didn't want to love it. I wanted to stick to our neighborhood places, where the ambience is lousy but the food seems authentic. I didn't want the margaritas to be big and cheap and delicious and strong. I didn't want the plates to be so huge, or the food to be so great, or the prices to be so reasonable. But Don Pedro GOT ME! Yes, it IS in a strip mall out on Independence, with some neighboring storefronts that give "strip mall" special meaning. The interior does have a bit of the feel of a chain place, but it really is festive and fun, so why deny it? And sometimes there is a 5-piece mariachi band strolling around the joint ! But you are looking for good mexican food, so back to that - the food is excellent, the portions are huge and we've never tried anything there that we didn't love.
