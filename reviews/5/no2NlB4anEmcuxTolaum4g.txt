Can't believe I have lived down the street from Julio's Too since 02/01/10 and I only tried them 11/03/12. They have great combos, the re-fried beans and rice are perfect and the burros enchilada style are just what I crave when I want Mexican food. My husband is not as keen on Mexican food he thinks Chipotle is the best Mexican in the world but he has picked up lunch here several times without any suggestions from me. So this is our neighborhood spot now, so sorry I never visited before. The have a punch card purchase 9 lunch combos get the 10th free and also they offer free chips and salsa.
