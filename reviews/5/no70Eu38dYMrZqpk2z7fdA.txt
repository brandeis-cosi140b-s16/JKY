Best TACOS Ever!!  Located on The Strip after the Encore/Wynn and Ross Store.  This place is super packed and each line is for a different type of meat.  ALL KINDS OF MEAT!  Cabeza, Lengua, Carnitas, Carne Asada and some others I cannot remember.  

We were here the night after Thanksgiving and it was super packed.  Hubby and I split up and just stood in line.  We didnt know that each line was a different meat so thank goodness I wasn't in the Lengua line.... had it (not from here) and dont want to try it again. 

The tacos are small so if you are hungry get 3 or 4.  The people in front of me had about 5 people in their family and ordered about 30!!!  I kid you not!  So you know it was gonna be good!

Will totally come back here again! 
Not a lot of seating so find a curb or eat standing... its worth it!
