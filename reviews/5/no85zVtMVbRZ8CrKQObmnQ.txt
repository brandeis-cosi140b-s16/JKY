Most of the staff have been working at CR for years which is a reflection of their passion and dedication to the company and food. Because the staff know what they're doing, the food is extremely high quality, consistent, and authentic. The staff is friendly as well and works to get the line down as quickly as possible without sacrificing quality or presentation of the food. 

The environment of the restaurant is unique and comfortable with high ceilings and bright colors. Indoor and outdoor seating is available.

The food brings an authentic baja style taste. The enchiladas are my personal favorite by far. Corn tortillas, cheese, one or one of each of their delicious meats, red or green sauce, rice, and refried or black beans. I always add green chilies on top for a little extra kick and a little extra $. I also add sour cream and fresh green onions with a side of their delicious baja sauce and either their mild or hot salsa. All of the other menu items are delicious, fresh, and authentic as well. Thanks CR! 

Overall, CR is an extremely authentic, consistent, and delicious local restaurant that is well worth the price. Ask for a stamp card!

A friendly note: if you want Chipotle, go to Chipotle. If you want local, go to Cafe Rumba!
