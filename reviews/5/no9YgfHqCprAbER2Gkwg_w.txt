Christy was an awesome waitress!  The restaurant was hopping and she didn't miss a beat.  The food was delish!  Loved the chips (served warm) and salsa's.  The shredded beef tostada and chili verde was amazing!  Nostalgic, traditional mexican restaurant where everyone was treated like a local.  Give it a try!
