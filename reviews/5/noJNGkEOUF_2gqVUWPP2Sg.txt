This was probably the best dining experience I have ever had. I was so excited about their 120 kinda of tequila I didnt even look at the menu, so I told our server, Maybelle, to order me her favorite... Which turned out to be a MR steak, covered in Mole sauce, quite literally it was all my favorite things in one dish. 
I tried tequila sampler B, and each one outdid the one before... Though the anejo was more potent than i was ready for.
