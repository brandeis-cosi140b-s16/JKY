Chipotle. self explanitory, no advertisment needed.... its simply amazing.  The rice 
bowl with double rice, with that savory chicken ( of course you need to have a double
serving!) Im not sure what seasoning is in the rice and chicken but the combination
of the two mixed with the shredded cheese, pico de gallo, and the homemade
Guacamole! doesnt even matter if theres an up charge. its that good! The location
of this Chipotle is close to the house, the staff is friendly, and the are sure to keep
everything fresh and timely. great experience everytime. my only complaint is... well 
there is none. definitely top 5 things I'd want stranded on an island.
