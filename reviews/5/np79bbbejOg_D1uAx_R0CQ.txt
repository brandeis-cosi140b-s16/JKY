We have been driving past this corner for years and finally stopped last night to give it a try.  My only regret is that we haven't done it sooner.  Tortas, street tacos, and burros with your choice of meats including tripas, cabeza, asada, lengua, and many more.

The food is authentic, the truck is clean, and the people are friendly.  What more could you ask for?  One more thing I guess......great value!   My wife and I each had a delicious torta, my daughter had a quesadilla, and we each had 2 tacos for $18 which is less than we would spend at a fast food place.

They set up each day around 6pm, so if you are in the area Waldo's is a place you must stop and try.
