What a great place.  We were looking for something to eat in Vegas on Freemont Street and spotted this place.  

From the moment we walked in to the moment we left, we felt wanted.  Like somebody (namely our waiter, Jon and Brandon) really cared about us.  The food was delicious and plentiful.  Our friends had the Fajitas and there was plenty of food for the two of them and they had some left over. My husband and I each had a different type of Burrito and they were fabulous.   

We were thrilled with this find!! We will definitely be back on our next trip to Vegas.
