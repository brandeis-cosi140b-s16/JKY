Mexican is not my fave, but I have dined here now 5X and last night was the best! There were 8 of us. My guests from the Midwest wanted mole. They said it was the finest they had ever had. Our server was Jose. He was attentive, accommodating to some intense food request (!), warm, funny and teased us appropriately. Can't wait to go back. Thanks Jose!
