Dear everyone in Arcadia lite:

There's an unfortunate shortage of food delivery in our neck of the woods.  For all those times you're too tired to hop in the car, or sincerely just too hammered to leave the friendly confines of your living room; the food gods created Los burritos.

Food: 5 stars. You can taste the authenticity in their regular salsa. Wasn't made for gringo's.
Atmosphere: my living rooms awesome thank you for asking.
Service: 5 stars. Got to my house in under 20.

In short, these guys provide a great service to our residents. Next time you stumble home from Little Woody's hungry you'll thank me.

Sincerely,
Yelp User Cam
