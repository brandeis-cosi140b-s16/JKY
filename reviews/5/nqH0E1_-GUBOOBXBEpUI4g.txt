Chips and salsa please!!!!!!  I love it.  What a great place for my wife and I to walk to whenever we want.  Drink specials and two bars to sit at if you don't want to wait since there is more often times than not a small wait time.  No problem though.  I have a spot in my heart for some fried shrimp and their beer battered shrimp tacos are out of this world!  Very delicious and the shrimp are always huge and tasty.  The jalepeno mashed potatoes are my go to side when they have it since it is not year round.  If you want to test and see how much you can eat, order the shrimp fajitas.  I'm a big feller and it is all I can do to eat that whole thing.  More chips and salsa!!!!!!!  When the weather is nice, the patio seating is pretty cool since you get a chance to see all the characters we have in NoDa.  I am so glad we live very close to this place!
