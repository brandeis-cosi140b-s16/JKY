Love this location!

They have a drive thru which is amazing and convenient. They are always fast, friendly, and on point!

The inside is so so so clean and well kept!! Salsa bar is always full and fresh. 

Women working the counter was extremely friendly and did not stop working. 

Overall I totally recommend this location!!
