I come here about once a week, and the employees are always courteous. 
The food is great!

I lost it when I found out that you can no longer order Baja Chicken Chalupa's off the menu, but this place will custom make them for you, no charge, and you can even keep the sour creme on it if you're into that sort of thing.

Five stars for keeping the customer first priority!
