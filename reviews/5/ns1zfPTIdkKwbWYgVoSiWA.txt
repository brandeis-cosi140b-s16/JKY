I have eaten here twice so far and definitely plan to return soon. The Diablo Shrimp pizzadilla is excellent as is Cochinita Pibil which is a melt in your mouth slow roasted pork with a delicious deep flavored red sauce served with plantains and pickled red onions. A surprise on the menu for me was the cauliflower potato cake which was flavorful and filling. The flan and gelato are wonderful. The flan is huge and comes out on a diner plate so be ready ! Try this place the service is friendly and the ambiance is relaxed and warm - definitely a great place for a date!

P.S. You can watch the tortillas being made fresh... and definitely taste the difference!
