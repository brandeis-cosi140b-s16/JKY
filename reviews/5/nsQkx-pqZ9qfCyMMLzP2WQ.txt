What a great find!!  Absolutely the best little Mexican restaurant we have ever ate at.  And it is sooo clean, even kitchen area.  People working there are friendly and courteous!  The plates are generous proportions and delicious.  Wanted to order more food just to take home and eat later.  Give it a try, you will be satisfied!
