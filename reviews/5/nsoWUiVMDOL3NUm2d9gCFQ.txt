Bomb! Bomb! Bomb! I love everything about this place. 
1. Service is great
2. Food is as authentic Mexican and delicious 
3. Price is very reasonable.

Micheladas are the reason we first went here and they did not disappoint they are delicious with the Perfect amount of spice and lemon. Table side guacamole is always a must. The aguachile extra spicey was so fresh and delicious,everything just perfect. It's a must go to place whenever I'm in Vegas.
