On the lookout for lunch when we arrived, many places were closed so I turned to trusty yelp and found this delicious, casual, authentic spot.

Eve award: best chimichanga I've ever had, dish of my scottsdale weekend can't stop thinking about 

Highlights: 
- Chimichanga: Green chili shredded beef not my usual order but had to try when read the rave reviews. It was packed with hidden spice as you can't see green in the meat. Nice contrast and balance when eaten with the shredded lettuce, chopped tomatoes, and guacamole. Surprisingly not greasy for something so fully deep fried and delicious with the generous handful of Thinly shredded cheese which delicately melted on top. I so want another right now. 
- Cheese crisps: got introduced to this Arizona treat which caught my eye on the menu. It's a flour tortilla with a lot of melted, crispy cheese on top. Red sauce in the large squeeze bottle was the perfect amount of spice to go with it. 
- Seating: indoor area as well as small patio outside 

Lowlights: 
- Bathroom access: kind of odd you need a key as the bathrooms are inside... 
- Corn cheese crisps: figure I'd gluten free it since didn't with the chimichanga, but lady dissed them saying they're a lot smaller and can't get as crispy. That fine, but why don't you take em off the menu then? 

Fell in love with this chimichanga from my yelp find and will be back if ever in the area. I honestly was contemplating going back the next day but figure since I was visiting to mix it up a bit.
