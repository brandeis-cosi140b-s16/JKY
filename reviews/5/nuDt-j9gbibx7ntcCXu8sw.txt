What a lot of people don't understand about El Conquistador is that it is on par with the Soup Nazi from Seinfeld. You do not go there for ultra-friendly and speedy service, you simply be happy that you are seated at a table about to eat some of the best mexican food in the world...maybe second to Los Dos Molinos, but hey that's all the way down by South Mountain. Mark and Maria are wonderful people churning out some incredible food. My all time favorite is the El Conquistador burrito enchilada style. It's filled with steak picado, chile relleno and beans and smothered in yummy green sauce.
