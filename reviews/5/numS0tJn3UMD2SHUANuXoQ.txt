The bf and I dined here after the the 7pm showing of Mystere. 

Loved it! I must say, I was not expecting the food to be so good, but it was delicious. 

The chips and salsa were so addicting. The chips are served with three different salsas that all quenched my palate in a different way. 

La Isla is known for their Tequila, so of course I had to order a margarita. It was the best margarita I have ever had! 

For the entree, I ordered the carne asada burrito "wet". OMG - so good! The only downside was that the burrito seemed to be a bit on the small side. However, I am from San Diego, so perhaps I am a bit biased when it comes to Mexican Food. Regardless, I would order that burrito again and again. 

The Service - Top Notch. Like Kevin W., our server was also extremely friendly and attentive. We were waited on hand and foot. In fact, she is what made our dining experience so wonderful. 

Next time I am in Vegas, I will definitely be dining at La Isla.
