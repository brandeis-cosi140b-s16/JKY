For Vegas locals, they know how tasty Roberto's is but this place takes the cake! Clean, spacious, and the quality of their food is amazing! I've been to so many Roberto taco shops (bc I love me some Mexican food!) and this location NEVER fails to let me down when it comes to their service! Drop by if you're in a mood for a late night snack, and I guarantee you're hooked!
