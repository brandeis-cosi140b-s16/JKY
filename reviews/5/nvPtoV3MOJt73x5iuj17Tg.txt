Went here to see a friends band and the place was just top notch.  Super friendly people and the music sounded great there.  it's a small place that looks like an old restaurant converted into a bar.  If you pass by the location you might miss it.

We were also hungry, so we ordered some nachos and a cheesecrisp.  Let me tell you what.. they do not hold back on the cheese.  I know some people might not like that, but wow it was delicious!

We stayed there for a while and saw people come and go, the drinks were flowin and over all just had a great time there.
