I like to find my Mesa just so that I have an excuse to eat at Tia Rosa's, especially during the Halloween season! This festive restaurant goes all out for the Halloween seasons and is decorated head to toe with festiveness! We visited on Friday night and thought that there would be a wait due to the number of cars in the parking lot, but because it's such a big restaurant, we were seated right away! 

I enjoy sitting on one of their patios (especially the back patio) because they are charming and intimate. They have a long list of margaritas but I especially like their pineapple one because it comes with a slice of pineapple! Their stuffed quesadillas aren't your average cheese stuffed tortilla and instead are oozing with yummy ingredients.
