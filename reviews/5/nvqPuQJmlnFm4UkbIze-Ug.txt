'Gourmet tamales', I think as I drive past this brand new strip mall on Durango, 'that's interesting.' In fact, I wasn't even sure it was open yet. So I stopped in about a week later with my mother, and learned it had been open for biz'ness about seven weeks.

I thought it might be like an upscale fast food place, but Espee's is definitely a sit down restaurant. They're making everything fresh in the back, and it took a bit. That was okay, because like all good Mexican places, they had a TV dedicated to soccer and a match had just started. I'm impressed with their menu -- it's a Mexican restaurant with nary a chimichunga or burrito in sight. 

My mother and I shared a small side of guac. (Verdict: okay) Espee's also has a free salsa bar, I liked the mango salsa quite a bit. For lunch, we had puffed tacos. (A taco with, basically, fry bread as the shell.) We played it conservative despite the menu, she had grilled chicken and I had fried hallibut. They were both amazing perfection and lovely at 3.99 each. The fried shell burnt my fingers as I gobbled it down.

I also did try one of the tamales, again playing it conservative with chicken. It was perfection, and the sauce was an interesting chicken gravy. This was also 3.99.

Due to awesomeness, I will be back soon to explore the more interesting items on the menu: eggplant parmesan, raisin and nuts and caramel apple tamales. On weekdays they have pozole, on Saturdays they have Menudo. They also have a beer selection.
