You don't have to be slurring words to have reason to indulge yourself with Santa Rosa. Their $2.30 tacos are packed full of freshly grilled carne asada and heaping servings of pico de gallo and quacamole. One taco'll do ya, but I had two. The beans are delicious and you get free refills on Horchata. 

The service could not be friendlier. Santa Rosa also uses solid, reusable plates instead of Styrofoam, which was refreshing.
