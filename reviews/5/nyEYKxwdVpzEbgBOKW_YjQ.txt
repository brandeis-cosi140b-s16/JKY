Just ate here tonight for the first time! Yum!! Got the thai'd up dilla and loved the sweet Thai flavor mixed with the salsa. My son wasn't going to eat at first (he was being bratty and said he wasn't going to eat because he wanted a burger). Right when he saw the dilla, he quickly changed his mind. He devoured his chicken dilla and next time I'm sure he'll order without hesitation. We will be back! Oh yes, I recommend ordering extra salsas if you are taking out- they give a 2oz container, but it is so yummy that if you are like me, it's gone in the first 2 bites:)
