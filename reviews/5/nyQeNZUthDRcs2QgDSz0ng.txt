Great fast food place. In all honesty the only thing I like from here are the caramel cheesecake bites, I get my Americanized mexican food from Taco Bell but can only find these delicious snacks here. When I was in Iraq I ate cheesecake bites once every other week and I would count down the days to the next time they'd be available. I am so happy that I am back in the states and I can eat cheesecake bites until I'm sick of them. Friendly workers, fast service and reasonable prices.
