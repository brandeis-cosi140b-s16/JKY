My husband and I eat here somewhat often, never have had a complaint. We usually end up ordering for a few people, which makes the order quite large, and they never get anything wrong. Everything is always fresh and delicious, best Mexican I have had in Pittsburgh. I am from the Louisiana, we have authentic Mexican on every other street, and this is definitely the best, authentic Mexican I've had here. Nice portions too! People who don't like the rice there probably aren't used to how it's supposed to be made. delicious!
