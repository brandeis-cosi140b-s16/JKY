This place is such a win! I am so happy that this tiny, easy to miss burger/taco joint turned out to have such fantastic food/ambiance! You know it was good because after we devoured (literally) our burgers and fries, we stood back in line for a dulce de leche shake (after hearing someone else on the patio exclaim to his fellow diner - "This is the best shake I have ever had!!!" - so we knew we had to get one). It did not disappoint. They were even giving out samples of their banana shake, which was equally delicious. I am definitely going to be coming back because the service was attentive, the food came out quickly (despite the power apparently going out half an hour before we got there), and both the indoor & outdoor spaces were hip, cute & clean. In my opinion, the burgers here are better than In N Out or Five Guys. The Stand....I love you!
