Attended the Brett Dennen show on 3/17/14 and was really impressed by this venue. As a pretty regular visitor to all types of live music events, I think that I have a new favorite place to see a live show. Pretty much everything said by previous reviewers was true.
The sound is top notch.
The staff is customer-friendly at a level that I find perfect. Everyone I came in contact with was friendly and laid-back. Not over-the-top phony friendly and definitely  not a "billy bad-ass" attitude to be found anywhere (hear that Club Red?)
The bar prices are very reasonable and even at a sold-out show the wait at the bar was never more than a minute. 
For a bar with live music, the whole place is extremely clean. Even the restrooms are in good shape. It doesn't even have that old spilled beer smell. 
Didn't try any of the food so can't comment on that. 
Highly recommend for live music.
