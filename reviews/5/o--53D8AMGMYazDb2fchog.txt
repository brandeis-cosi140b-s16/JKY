Having withdrawal from no Epso's food for nearly a year was not a good thing. We tried but could not find a suitable replacement. I have been eating at this place for almost 25 years. 

Carne Asada Burrito Enchilada Style with Green Sauce is amazing. The old Red Salsa is the same. Flavorful and hot. We also tried the Chicken Enchilada's. For some reason it was cubed and not shredded chicken. Good but not as good as shredded and I hope they bring that back.

It was packed for lunch today and I hope they are on the right path to stay open another 25 years. 

Welcome back Leon!
