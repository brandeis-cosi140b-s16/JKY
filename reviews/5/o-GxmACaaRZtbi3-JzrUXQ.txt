Went there for the first time today and since its two hours from my home I had to get a little of everything ... Catfish,BBQ ribs,fish sandwich, peach cobbler fried pound cake and a cheeseburger... Everything was amazing!! That peach cobbler takes you back to them old school days of watching big mamma or Madea( depending on how you were raised) roll out the dough and peel the peaches from scratch !!! I am not joking!!! It's that good! I hate peach cobbler that looks like vomit! I like to see the peaches and the crust... Not have the shit all blended in together ewwwww
I wish they could Ship their Peach cobbler
