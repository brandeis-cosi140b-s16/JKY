We are from out of town and came on my sisters recommendation.  She always gets the rolled tacos but I ventured out and got the Ceviche tostada and the shrimp colichi.  Both were amazingly fresh and fantastic flavor. I have never tasted anything like the creamy sauce on the shrimp and they were perfectly cooked.  Would highly recommend and will be back to try other dishes.
