Little hole in the wall buffet. Very inexpensive for great food. The pollos magnifico was awesome and the owner offered me a taco which he brought right to me.  The only drawback was no beer but I was there midday during the week do I wouldn't have wanted one anyway. I think they have a drivethrough as well
