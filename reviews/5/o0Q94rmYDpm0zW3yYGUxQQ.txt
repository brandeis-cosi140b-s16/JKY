I'm a bit shocked the average rating is just 3 of 5 stars. My family and I went to Manny's and thought it was great all around. The food was tasty, the staff was attentive and the prices seemed appropriate (I did not have a Groupon). I mean, isn't that what you'd expect? 

We'll be going back (and with a Groupon it'll be even better.)
