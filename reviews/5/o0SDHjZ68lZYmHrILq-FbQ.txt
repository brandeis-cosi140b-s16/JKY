Based on the recommendation of fellow yelpers my companion and I made the smart choice and listened.   The staff welcomed us warmly and made us feel at home.   We indulged in a dish that is served in a hot lava bowl......WOW!!!   The cheesy, shrimpy goodness made our first voyage to the San Diego Bay all worth while and worthy of  "this is a repeat" status.
