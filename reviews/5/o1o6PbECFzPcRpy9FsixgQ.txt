Hands down, this is among the best Latin American foods I've experienced. I am not going to subtract points for customer service, or for servers not speaking English. ARE YOU KIDDING ME??? This is the reason WHY the food is so exceptional. Look, if you want the American experience of eating Mexican food, go to Taco Bell, or On the Border. But if  you want authentic, quality food that Latino people actually frequent on a regular basis, then this is it. My husband and I were taken aback when we were greeted in Spanish, and saw that the restaurant was full of Latin Americans, but it was a GOOD "taken aback"! LOL. What went through our minds was: "Oh yes, we're in the right spot!" And the food did not disappoint. If you're smug and are put off because you have to wait a few moments for them to bring and English-speaking host to seat you, then that's on you, but you're missing out!  :D
