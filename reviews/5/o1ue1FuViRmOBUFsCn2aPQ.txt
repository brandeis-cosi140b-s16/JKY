This restaurant is my go-to whenever I'm in town.  Their menu is pretty amazing and always has a great selection of interesting, unique southwestern food.  

My staples: the fish tacos, the catfish beignets, and now the Achiote Chicken chopped salad!  The tacos and beignets are always delish, but this salad is seriously scrumptious.  It has corn, avacado, and pumpkin seeds in it--which sounds like a weird combo, but it's great!  

Today, I also tried the southwester chicken soup.  So good-chunks of avocado with grilled chicken and tortilla chips.  The cornbread is always great too-definite comfort food.  

You can usually get a table pretty quickly there and their staff is always super friendly.
