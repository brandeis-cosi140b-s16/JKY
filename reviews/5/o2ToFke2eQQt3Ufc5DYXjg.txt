Leticia's is my go to Mexican restaurant when I'm in north Vegas. I typically try to get new things but I can't bring myself to break away from their tacos. The taco I get is a quesa taco which is stuffed with cheese I either get the  carne asada or  shrimp. They are sooo good! It took me a while to get used to the rice that comes with the taco plate because it isn't your usual Spanish rice. It has cheese in it and some type of pepper in it. The first time I got it I really needed to look because it was so dark in the restaurant . It is different but it is tasty!  The guacamole is also a nice size for the price you pay. 

The service is attentive and quick. They will fill up our chips or drinks before we have to ask. It's a great spot to sit and relax while getting a bite to eat.
