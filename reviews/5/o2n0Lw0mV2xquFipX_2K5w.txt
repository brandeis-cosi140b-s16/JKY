I was craving Mariscos for a while && a Michelada obviously. But I Honestly thought there was no place that was good here in Vegas until a cousin recommended "El Canelo." M first time going, I was pretty scared to order, the owner came greeted us and also told us their specialties. I love spicy food so when he told me about the Molcajete Diablo I was sold. This place is freaking amazing!!! Best Micheladas ever!! The Food is great, prices are even better. The service is this restaurant is great, super attentive makes you feel like your home. SINALOENSE style seafood, yes exactly just like my hometown. Just to think of all that food makes my mouth water!. Seriously recommend it to everyone.
