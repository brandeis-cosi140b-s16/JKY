So glad they finally reopened up this location.  We were here on opening night and have been back probably 4-5 times.  So good!  We are big fans of the food here and I have decided it's time to break away from my normal two rolled taco meals and try new things.  I have!

Service is always great and their chips and salsa is delish!
