5 stars, to offset my unduly low 3 star review from last year.. ROLBERTO'S TAKES CREDIT CARDS!!!!!! NO MORE HAVING TO HIT THE ATM FIRST! HOLLER!! ALSO, now that I've fully fallen into the dark world of tacos, Rolberto's has some of the ABSOLUTE BEST Carnitas, and Adobada in the area... Where as most similar places of this type serve an obviously processed, previously frozen iteration of carnitas and adobada, Rolberto's seems far more genuine and homemade. Also, it's very much a family owned/operated type place, and I just love the hell out of it!!! So glad it's so close to my house!
