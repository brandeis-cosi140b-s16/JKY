Pretty impressed!! Fast food, good value for your money! 
The rolled chicken tacos are amazing! TIP: if getting it to go ask for the guac on the side, by time I got home to eat mine they were all soggy :( but still good.
Bean & cheese burrito, holy smokes! I'm forever craving them! I know you are probably saying, it's just a bean & cheese burrito?! Yeah I know but there's something about this one that just leaves you wanting more! 
Beef tacos, excellent! Very tasty! 
This place is everything a fast food Mexican restaurant should be!
