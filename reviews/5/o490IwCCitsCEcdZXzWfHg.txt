Been here several times for happy hour, and I love it!! I've tried some of their margaritas...and they're all good! 

As for the food, I've had their catfish beignets, grilled shrimp and guac tostada bites, street tacos, these dumplings...which were AMAZING!! (Thanks to our waiter's recommendation) and probably some more that I can't remember.

The cornbread is amazing!!!! I would honestly eat the whole thing if I didn't remember that I actually ordered food. 

But yes, great food, and the waiters I had here were all so nice, making great conversation, offering suggestions, and always making sure we were taken care of.
