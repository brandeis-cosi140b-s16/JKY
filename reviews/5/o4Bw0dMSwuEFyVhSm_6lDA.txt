Can I just say this place made me fall in love with Mexican food all over again. And it feels like I'm cheating with my husband's grandma's cooking! Everything is authentic and it has that Mexican grandma's kitchen food vibe I've been looking for a while now. Customer service is great too! Oh yeah did I mention their flan is made in their own kitchen! 
I had the Carne asada plate and a bowl of posole (I know I'm such a pig! Lol) while my hubby had Chile relyeno, green enchilada, red Chile enchilada combination (not on their combo plate menu btw) everything was good! The Chile relyeno is worth the drive it self! Totally will come back!
