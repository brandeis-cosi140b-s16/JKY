Best Mexican place in Vegas! The service was amazing. My waitress Amber was fast and so sweet. And the empanadas from the Small Bite menu were yummy! Vegetarian friendly! Chef Paco has the food tasting great and the flan is unbeatable. Every Tuesday is Industry Night with FREE salsa lesson and Tequila bar! I'm definitely a happy customer! Don't pass it up!
