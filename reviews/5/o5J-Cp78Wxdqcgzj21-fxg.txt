I just had dinner with my 20 year old daughter and we have eaten at many Southwest Mexican type restaurants. And La Ristra is definitely the place to go. The food is absolutely delicious. The flavors in the meat and sides were exciting. 
  This was recommended by my daughter. I've never been here before. However I will be back with friends. Jake the waiter knew the menu well. I followed his recommendations. And all went well. Thank You. LaRistra
