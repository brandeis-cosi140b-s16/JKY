Oh, if only we lived closer to this place. We saw them featured on Check Please Arizona, and my husband grew up in New Mexico and misses that good, zesty food.

We arrived at 4:30pm on a Saturday and had our pick of the seating. Fantastic, cozy atmosphere in the dining room. Our waitress was fast and courteous--really, perfect service. I used the Yelp check-in to get the free chips and salsa. Delicious stuff--loved both salsas.

Since it was happy hour time, we order ala carte as a family: brochettes, grilled chicken quesadilla, habanero sliders,and New Mexican potstickers. The brochettes were primarily mine and they were awesome. Going back, I'd make that a meal all by itself. The chicken quesadilla was delicious, though the bottom was very crunchy and required the steak knife to cut through. The potstickers were great and not hot-hot but good flavor. I didn't sample the sliders because I can't handle the heat, but my husband loved those and the fries.

For dessert, we split the chocolate bread pudding as part of my Bread Pudding Quest. This was a solid entrant. The texture was perfect and the chocolate flavor in the bread was just right. I'm not crazy about butterscotch but it worked well here to add moisture and a touch of sweetness. It's not my favorite bread pudding but it's very good and I recommend it if you're a chocolaholic. 

I'm pretty sure next time we come here--and there will be a next time--my husband is determined we try the sopas.
