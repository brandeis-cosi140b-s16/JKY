This place is a gem. The food is fantastic, portions are generous, prices are reasonable and they are open later than many restaurants in the area. Even so, it was crowded for a few hours, which tells you its a local favorite for good reason. The service was really great, and the staff were so nice and friendly. I will definitely go there next time I'm in Phoenix and highly recommend it to anyone looking for delicious food at reasonable prices. It is not easy to get seafood right in the desert, but Mariscos Sinaloa has done it!
