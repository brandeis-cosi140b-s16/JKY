This was a recommendation by a recent U of I graduate. If she learned nothing else in college, she learned where the good places to eat are located.

We got to Maize about 5 minutes before they opened. The staff was eating and the door was still locked. While we waited,  a line began to form. The door opened and the line kept on going all day long. We had tacos, nachos and a burrito. All excellent. Staff was pleasant and helpful. It is not fancy and it is all counter seats, but Maize is a very worthwhile stop. 

Limited free parking.
