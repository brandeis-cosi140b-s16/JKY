My office is located in Old Town and I have been searching for some authentic Mexican food...well my search is over. 

Ricky's definitely delivered in authenticity. I ordered the carne asada tacos which I believe is their signature taco. Delicious!!!  Excellent flavor, juicy and tender and not fatty at all like some places. The rice had the traditional peas in it just like south of the border and the beans had a great consistency. Oh, we started with chips and salsa and the salsa was warm and very tasty. 

I will definitely be going back, probably to check out some other menu items along with the margaritas.
