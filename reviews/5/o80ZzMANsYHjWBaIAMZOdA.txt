So I've been twice now. The first time was crazy good, but I wanted to wait to write a review, just in case it was a fluke. It wasn't.

I just had the pastor (seasoned pork) burrito. Suddenly you feel like Chipotle is bland. This thing roars with lime and texture and spice. I had the spicy salsa--it's bright yellow and has layers of flavor. And the staff I've encountered are warm and quick to help.

This place looks like a hole in the wall on the corner of 1st and Green--I don't know what they're gonna do, but I hope this place is a permanent addition to Champaign and Campustown.
