Okay my wife wanted to try this spot a friend recommended. We ventured out to Phoenix to give it a shot. We parked in the back to walk around to the front entrance. Once we entered we were greeted by the friendly staff. The family ordered multiple tacos & a quesadilla. I was busy on the phone with a friend while taking a bite of my Carne Asada taco...I had to immediately hang up & take another bite then made my way to the salsa bar. Lots of variety of toppings to your liking. I kid you not. The food was so good that we placed a second order. The staff asked if it were our first time & they graciously gave us a bean & cheese quesadilla which was good as well. Overall great ppl & awesome food. We will be back for sure.
