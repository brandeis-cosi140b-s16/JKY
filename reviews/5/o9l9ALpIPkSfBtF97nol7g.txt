EXCELLENT FOOD.  EXCELLENT SERVICE.
We were stranded as our truck was in for repairs next door at a SUPER repair shop: Kelleys.
They suggested we wait at Que Bueno for lunch.  As we had our dog with us we thought it might be difficult for them to seat us.  They said no problem and so they opened their closed outside patio just for us.  We enjoyed our time there very much.  Monque our server was so sweet she even brought water for Bella.  I can't say enough about the service, their food and their hospitality.  These guys were great and Que Bueno (great name btw) is DEFINITELY the place for Mexican food in Fountain Hills!!!
AND
It is a super place to watch the fountain shoot up every hour.
