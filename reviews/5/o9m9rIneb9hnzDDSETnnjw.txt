This restaurant was recommended to me by a relative.  We all think we know about Mexican food so we constantly share new places that we find.  I took my entire family here and we all loved what we ordered.  The food was so tasty.  They make the  guacamole to order, it was great!  The atmosphere was very pleasant.  Not fancy, just a nice homey place.  Real good homemade dishes and great value for the money.  Today I am taking my old friend here because I am craving some delicious Mexican food.  Can't wait to get there.
