I could sit here all day and tell you the great things about Mexi-Casa.  I was really disappointed when they shut down last year, but the wait to re-open was absolutely worth it. Everything is basically the same as it was before, only SO much better now!  The management is responsive to customers and does a great job of keeping things interesting; really good daily specials, seasonal drinks and food items, TONS of different beers rotating on draft.  Everyone that works there is super friendly, and I think the fact that there are clearly a bunch of regulars speaks volumes.   
Mexi-Casa doesn't claim to be authentic mexican, so please don't expect that when visiting.  The burritos are amazing, as is really anything else on the menu and they will make it your way too.  New on the menu are fish tacos, and the tilapia is my new favorite.  The guacamole and queso are both some of the best I've ever had!  I already mentioned the rotating beer selection which is great, but those margaritas!  I wish I had one now =)
