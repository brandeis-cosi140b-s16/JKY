That this place is excellent is not news to the hundreds of you that are loyal to this place. Silvana is a force of nature, as you know.   Peg and I made our first trip to this place last week.  As is always the case with places that we love and visit again and again, there needs to be extraordinary everything. In this case, Marcos provided excellent service and the man (sadly, I do not know his name...yet)  who was taking care of busing tables, keeping beverages filled was incredible. In the midst of the whirlwind of activity, he was smiling and very efficient. The guacamole is legendary and will good reason. Pomegranate seeds in the midst of fresh ingredients and perfect avocados are genius.  The pollo poblano was a wonderful starter. The complementary dishes were tacos.....one featuring succulent pulled pork and the other, halibut..and they were simply amazing. When a familiar face is present, it makes the experience even more special. Julio Mata is one of the more accomplished chefs around and his skills elevate the whole playing field. We are delighted to include this place as one of our best ever places to relax and enjoy!  Dr. B
