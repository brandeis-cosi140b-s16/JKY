I've been coming here since I was in dipes. I eat here at least twice a month. Sometimes lunch, sometimes dinner, never on Mondays. My dad lives in Washington state and when he comes to visit, he literally goes from the airport directly here. I always get the enchilada/taco combo. Prices are great, food is excellent. The salsa is amazing, with a nice kick. My girlfriend actually doesn't like the enchilada sauce here because it clearly has cinnamon in it and apparently that's not her thing. The only thing I can say I don't like is that the taco has the cheese on the outside of the shell. ?? Weird. Yeah, the place is old, but so what? My grandmas place is old, too, but the best food I've ever had came out of her kitchen. Don't judge a book by its cover! Or, do, more for me.
