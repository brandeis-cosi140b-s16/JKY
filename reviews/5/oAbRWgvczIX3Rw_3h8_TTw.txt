I love this place! I have been here several times( I always forget to check-in, I am a rookie Yelper) and every time I am there I am NEVER disappointed. The Bulgogi is great. I love the chimichanga, and the tacos are excellent. If you are off the strip and looking for somwhere the locals go, THIS is the place!
