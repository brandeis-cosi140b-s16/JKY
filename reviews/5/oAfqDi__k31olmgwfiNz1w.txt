OMG besides my grandmas home made white menudo this has been the BEST menudo I have had in the US. They give you the option of white or red, maiz o no, pata o no. You can wash it down with a real Mexican coke. One of the best things is you gave the option of bolillo or hand made tortillas. They also have pozole, tacos, quesadillas and burritos. The service is great always stopping by asking if we needed anything else. This place is only 10 minutes from the strip. It's worth the drive
