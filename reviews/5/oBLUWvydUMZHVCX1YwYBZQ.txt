I've always loved this place, love their new location on 7th, food is always good. Guacamole is freshly made,  try crispy cheese crisp,  always a good choice.  Flautas    seem to be handmade.  My boyfriend had ranchero machaca burrito,  sucker was huge!

Service was good, Friday night the place was packed. 
I heard one family balk at the 20 min wait and said they were going to Sylvia's across the street! Don't do it, this place worth the wait! I would not eat Sylvia's, not worth it!
