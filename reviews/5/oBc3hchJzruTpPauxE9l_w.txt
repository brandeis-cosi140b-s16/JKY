The Husband and I went there for the first time on Feb. 24th around 2:30pm.  We had just gotten back into town from arctic Indianapolis and wanted to relax outside with margaritas and street tacos.

I looked on Yelp and found this place and we went here straight from the airport.  It definitely didn't disappoint!!!  Everything was excellent.  Chips and salsa were brought out complementary and we sat outside and had Margaritas.  I ordered the Carnitas taco (my favorite), Tinga taco (tastes great, but spicy), street corn (my new obsession) and Mexican rice (fresh and tasty).  Husband had a burrito.  Everything was fresh and delicious.  Atmosphere is awesome.  They play a nice mix of music and the art work makes it feel like an authentic, cool experience.

It was so good, we went back later in the week since we were on that side of town again...I got the same thing, except this time I ordered the fish taco instead of the Tinga.  It was very tasty.  It was lightly fried and had a nice spiced up tarter sauce on it.  Husband got the Tinga burrito.  I also tried the churros for dessert and it was absolutely delish!  Served with homemade whipped cream and diced strawberries on top.

Everyone is very friendly there.  Keep up the great service guys!
