So good! We were vacationing on the strip and needed something different and not so expensive. Cilantros has amazing, quick food made to order. They even have a drive thru. Delicious, quality food hiding in an unassuming little building in a semi industrial area, this place is a win!

P.S their green sauce is super good!
