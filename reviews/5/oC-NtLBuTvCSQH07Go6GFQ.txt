Not being very familiar with Mexican food, but knowing that many of the ladies in my club enjoy it, I booked Abuelos's.  They have enclosed their patio and it's lovely.  We had the room to ourselves.  Food was delicious. everyone enjoyed their choice.  The service was great......and very pleasant servers.  I initially dealt with the manager and every restaurant should have such a wonderful manager.  It's hard to please 38 ladies........but  not one complaint.
