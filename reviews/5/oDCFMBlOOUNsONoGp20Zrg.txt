This place is excellent. We had the vegetarian fajita, guacamole, mango and watercress salad, and lobster tacos. Their menu had a nice unique blend of taste that worked well together. Our server was very accommodating to our requests and the orders came in just at the right time. There's music, but not obnoxiously loud.They have a cute eclectic decor and huge tv screens for the sports fan, they even changed the channel for us to see the clipper game.
