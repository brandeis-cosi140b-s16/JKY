The first time I've ever recommended tamales I could buy at a restaurant or store! I'm from New Mexico where they've got to have some spice and some flavor and these definitely fit the bill. I'd compare these to a lot of the homemade I've had that were really good maybe not quite the best but these are way up there! plus if you want something really to burn the top of your mouth off, get a pint of their green salsa, it'll really bring the hair off your chest!
