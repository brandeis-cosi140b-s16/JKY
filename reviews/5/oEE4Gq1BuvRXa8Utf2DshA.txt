So glad Betitos moved in after Fusion died a long torturous death. The tortillas here are sooo good. I've only had their veggie burrito, but I consider that a pretty good indicator of the quality of a taco shop's food. SO usually gets their rolled tacos. We'll be doing our part to keep them in business. Get the hot salsa, it'll grow hair on ya.
