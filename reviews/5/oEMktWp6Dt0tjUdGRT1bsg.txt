First off by saying Josh is THE MAN, probably the best customer service around! It was my first time in the shop after I saw the shop on an episode of Taco Trip. He hooked me up with all the sauces, talked me through the menu, and gave me the true island experience, making me feel like family!

I got the Burrito with some Kaluha Pork. Damn! It was da bomb! Grabbed some coconut back since most of the yelpers hyped it up...Bomb.com too. 

10 out of 5 will recommend to the friends and fam!
