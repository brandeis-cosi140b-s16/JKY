The food here is freaking fantastic. Is it trad Mexican? Not especially -- but the additions and adjustments are truly fine. It gets crowded (and good for them!) so call ahead if you want to go for dinner.

I love the food, but the true showstopper is their tequila selection. If I remember, there are close to 200 kinds available, on a five-tiered, wall-high shelf. Yes, please! The bar staff are really knowledgeable, and rather than a print menu, they'll offer you an iPad to investigate the spirits selection. You can also join a tequila club, where you can track all the kinds you've tried. Let me put it this way: for this dude, 2013 will be an anejo-soaked year. Grab some chips and their lip-smacking green tomatillo salsa, and try a flight or two. You won't be steered wrong.

Also, be sure to try the beet margarita -- it's your standard margarita, gussied up with scrumptious beet-infused simply syrup. I'll bet you won't find it anywhere else.
