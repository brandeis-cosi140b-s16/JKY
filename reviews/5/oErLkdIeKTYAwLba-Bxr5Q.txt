It's the only Mexican food I'd drive across town for, and randomly get cravings for.  And the salsa...awesome, but also ask for their "special hot" if you're up for it.

The two top picks are the garlic pork and the adovado ribs, although I have yet to have anything short of amazing here.

Add in a full bar, a decent margarita, good service, and lots of space.
