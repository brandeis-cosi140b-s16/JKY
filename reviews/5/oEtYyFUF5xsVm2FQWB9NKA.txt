Kimberly is seriously the best cashier I have EVER had the opportunity to have take an order from me. Always smiling cheerful and happy to do her job. Keep an eye on her I see her going places. The food is always perfect and the rest of the staff is on top of their game too. Keeping up with our tables needs like clock work. I am seriously surprised at the couple of less then 5 star reviews because this place deserves every one of them and more from my MANY MANY visits to this location. Thanks and keep up the great work! Customer for life :)
