Absolutely one of my favorite lunch spots and the super friendly staff makes the experience even better. 

My favorite thing to get is a steak burrito with seaweed rice, lettuce, cheese, chile verde salsa, fresh bean sprouts, sour cream, guacamole, and then lime juice drizzled all over it. This burrito is so ginormous that it stands on its own. 

I never feel guilty when I eat here because nothing is fried. Okay, I do feel a little guilty when I have their amazing Coconut Bark, but its just so good!
