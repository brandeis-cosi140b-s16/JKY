Love this place. I don't often go to the north side, but when I do, I make a point of stopping over at El Burro (or Nicky's Thai, if that's what I'm in the mood for). Simple but excellent burritos that are better than the ones they serve at Round Corner Cantina (same owners). No frills, but delicious.

I'm a big fan of the shrimp burritos, but really, you can't go wrong with any of them. And very reasonably priced! Definitely get the chips... they aren't necessarily freshly fried right there and then, but they are definitely fried on premises, and are addictive.
