Camarones aguachile are aweeeeeeeeeeeeeesome!!!

I love this place if you like seafood and Mexican food then look no further this place is the bomb.  The service is good, they have great drinks alcoholic and non, and the food is amazing.  Plus the ceviche tostada for free at the beginning along with chips and salsa just tops off how wonderful this place is.  

I admit it is pricey but the ingredients are fresh and we are in the desert so you gotta pay for good stuff and this place is for sure worth it.
