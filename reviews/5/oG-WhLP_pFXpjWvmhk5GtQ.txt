We went to Gordas last week and wow... we were really happy with our meal.  We wanted to try lots of different things, so we shared the Chile Verde Sopes (Amazing), the Crispy Beef taco, the Carnitas taco, the Adobada taco, the Carne Asada taco, the Carne Asada Fries, and a Quesadilla!  Without exception, everything we tried was fantastic.  They also have these little spicy carrots at the salsa bar.  Yum.

Highly recommended.
