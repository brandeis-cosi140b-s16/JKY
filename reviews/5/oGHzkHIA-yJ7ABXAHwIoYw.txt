I love this place! too bad its closed on Sundays!

Everything I have tried is delicious! Burritos, Nachos (OMG), street tacos, regular tacos, salads, shrimp cocktail, the corn is AMAZING! you ask for the corn to be shaved in a bowl, which reduces messiness. My office catered it in one day and everyone loved it! its way better than chipotle food, however i don't think its as healthy.

they also have a different variety of drinks/waters. The lemon chia is my favorite. Def try it!
