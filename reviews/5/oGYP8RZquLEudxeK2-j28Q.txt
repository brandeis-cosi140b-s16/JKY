I was shopping at the Biltmore when I spotted this place. I love the fact they have a pickup window. I ordered the 2 for $6 deal on the street tacos; one chicken, one carnitas. Wow. Soooo good, bursting with flavor. I couldn't decide which taco I loved more. I'm a sucker for a good street taco and they delivered. I'll be tempted to stop here every time I hit the Biltmore. Super yummy.
