I had to have Tex-Mex food during my trip to Arizona. Los Sombreros was so much more than that. It's actually more gourmet and fancy Mexican food served with delicious sauces and in a variety of non traditional ways. My family and I were pleasantly surprised that they offered a tasting menu because we were able to taste many of their inventive foods. Also, their margaritas are very refreshing.
