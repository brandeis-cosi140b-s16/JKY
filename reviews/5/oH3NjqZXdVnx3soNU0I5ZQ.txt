I live in Massachusetts, but come to Vegas almost yearly for a minimum of one week at a time.  I've eaten at many of the pricey restaurants both on and off of the strip throughout the city because I always get a rental car to make sure I can get around to where I want to go.  I was in the mood for some Mexican food so decided to yelp it to see what was around.   Roberto's had the best reviews and it's no wonder why.  This was the best meal I've ever eaten in Vegas and definitely the best Mexican food I have ever eaten anywhere, with decent sit down restaurants costing 3 times as much for the same items included!!  I got a carne asada burrito and my wife got a chicken quesadilla and both items were unbelievably tasty!!  My wife is not a huge fan of Mexican food and she also normally judges a place by the appearance.  If it weren't for the reviews she never would've agreed to get out of the car and eat here but she's glad she did.  She told me she would go back to Roberto's in a heart beat.  If you are visiting Vegas, or live here but have never been to Roberto's, you owe it to yourself to give this place a try!!!
