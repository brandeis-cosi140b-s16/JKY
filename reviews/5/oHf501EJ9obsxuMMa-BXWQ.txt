Delicious tacos and nachos! Stopped here for lunch with my dad and siblings after getting tired of Mercy Hospital Cafeteria food and it was a great choice. Definitely worth a trip. Fast, fresh and decently priced food. Public parking lot directly across the street. The two guys behind the counter were friendly and I was happy there were vegetarian options!
