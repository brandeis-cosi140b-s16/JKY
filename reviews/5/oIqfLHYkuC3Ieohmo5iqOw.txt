Well where do I start? I live pretty much directly across the street from barbacoa...I go here quite often because of this. I would definitely recommend the Taquiza combination plate you get 4 tacos which you can choose every taco to be 4 different types of meat 
. I have loved everything I have ever tried from the tacos ( I LOVE THE carne asada, shrimp & al pastor as my combination), burritos very nice size always delicious,  enchiladas and of course the shrimp cocktail.  I'm a regular so they know my face and the love they put into the food only makes it better. I have never left disappointed ever!  The fresh homemade tortillas are so great I might add to. See you again next week :)
