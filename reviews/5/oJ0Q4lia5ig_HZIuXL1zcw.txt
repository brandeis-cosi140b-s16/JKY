Ambience is good, free chips & salsa for dine in customers. We ordered chimichanga, nachos & burritos. All items was served in 10min. Food tastes good, but they don't have fajitas/ grill veggies which are my favorites. 

I like to visit this place as it's close to my place. Otherwise if I want to eat excellent Mexican food. I prefer Carlos O Briens
