A friend recommended that we (two food bloggers) hit up this restaurant while driving through on our way to Santa Fe, New Mexico. What a wonderful surprise and discovery -- Barrio Urbano in Phoenix. Immediately from the brightly colored decor to the warm greeting from the staff, I knew this was going to be a good eating experience. I was not disappointed. We had a sample of tacos, chili verde and pork, al pastor, carne asada, chorizo and all of the meats were well-seasoned and tender. Nothing special about the corn tortillas, but the fillings were up to par. Definitely going to hit this spot when we are back in town.
