Great food at a great price!

We were immediately welcomed the moment we walked in. Grab a menu and you seat yourself. 

Small location but had such a great chill vibe. Waitress came by and took our drinks. Soon after our food orders and within moments the food came out hot and ready. 

Fajitas and the taco salad were absolutely delicious. If nothing else give those a shot. 

If you're looking for good food at a reasonable price you'll find it here.
