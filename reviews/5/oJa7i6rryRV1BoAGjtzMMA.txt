I'm so so happy to have places within 5 minutes of my house where I can get a tasty, cheap lunch! 
I've been wanting to try this place for ages, but every time I went by they were closed. Sad face!
I finally figured out when they were going to be open and zipped on down to try out the "controversial" tacos myself.
Contrary to some of the reviews, these tacos were DELICIOUS. I tried both the chicken and the pork taco, along with the fries.
The chicken taco was the spicier of the two, but that pork taco was no slouch either! The fries were perfectly crispy and  slightly spicy. Two tacos and fries came up to 8 bucks, which is slightly (by a few quarters) higher than what's listed on the site, so if you tend to not carry too much cash on you, remember that. 2 tacos were $5, and the fries were $2. All in all pretty cheap. 
Currently they're open 10-2, but the guy in the truck (sorry, don't remember your name) told me they would be expanding the hours once it got cooler. 
In short, tasty food + cheap + friendly service = Happy Heather.
