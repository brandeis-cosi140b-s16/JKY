Heard about The Revival from a bartender at the Mellow Mushroom.   I travel to Phoenix regularly for business and happened to be in town on a Saturday night.  Since I was alone, I sat at the bar.   The bartender, Cara, was excellent and the wine manager David, offered excellent suggestions.  

I had the shrimp and chorizo appetizer, the salmon entree and finished with the Chef's bread pudding.   The quality level was well above the price for each course.  In a foodie city like New York, Chicago, San Fran or Philly, you would pay more for the same quality.

As someone who dines alone fairly often, I tend to return to restaurants where I receive excellent service and some nice conversation along with food that meets or exceeds expectations.  I will be returning to The Revival.
