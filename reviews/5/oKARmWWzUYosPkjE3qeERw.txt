Oh my! How have I NOT reviewed this place yet?! It is amazing. This is in the top 2 of my favorite restaurants in North Phx. (the other one is Bamboo Grill) If the man is there, he is the best. Always happy to see you, and ready to chat while he cooks! I have gone in here with my mom and sister, with just me and Hubs, and with my 2 little ones. Every time the food is fantastic. If it's just the girls working, the service pales in comparison to when the guy is there.. but the food makes up for that! Try the tortilla soup! Made right there in front of you and ohhhh... sooo good! Hubby and I always share the fajitas classica.. mmm... I think that is the best way to go. And they are more than willing to give you extra of whatever you ask for. And if you throw in a dollar for them, they ring the bell and yell "AYYYY" lol Also, good prices, especially if you split something, which is totally doable since their servings are huge!
