There is no shortage of Mexican restaurants in Vegas and each one boasts that they are the best.  El Dorado Cantina clearly stands head and shoulders above the rest.  Why?  Well for starters everything on the menu is organic and made with no GMO's.   Best table side guacamole hands down.  Don't let the fact that it's connected to a strip club dissuade you from coming here.  Try the jalapeno margarita.  There's a little kick to it but not too spicy at all.  I don't normally like jalapenos but somehow when tequila is added I'm all about it lol  El Dorado Cantina is located next to the Sapphire.  There is clearly a separate entrance into the restaurant.  El Dorado is open 24 hours and has a full menu day or night.  Locals get 25% off the entire bill on Monday's too!
