I've heard from plenty of people that this place has the best hispanic food in Charlotte. Thus far, I haven't found better.

Its always crowded, which is a testament to their good food. Its a bit loud, but with all the people they have crammed in that restaurant, its to be expected.

Table side Guac was very delicious, and I LOVE their salsa (Free chips and salsa of course). I had a chimichanga and it was very delicious and very filling.

I'd love to come back, but its just so hard with the crowds that are always there. I wish they'd open another location. If you can find a time to dine there, know that its well worth it.
