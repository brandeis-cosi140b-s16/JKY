I cannot  xpress how much I love this new place!  This place rocks over Chipotle‼
They treat their Employees as Well as Animals this Great Respect‼

The Caring Homie Atmosphere is Such a Pleasant Reminder What it is to be a Whole Human--

Their Kalua Pig and Huli Huli chicken, Seaweed Soaked butter Rice,  Mango Roasted Corn, Tomato and Maui Onion, Purple Cabbage, charred Pineapple Verde, Bean Sprouts, Guacamole Bowl was the Best Bowl EVER in Las VEGAS

PS The Coconut Bark was EPIC
