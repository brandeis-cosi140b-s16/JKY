Mi Patio is a clean and casual family-owned restaurant in central Phoenix. Mi Patio is unique to any other Mexican restaurant in the Phoenix metropolitan area as the cuisine is Mexican with a Greek influence to some of their dishes. 

Mi Patio is also distinguished from other Mexican restaurants in the Phoenix area because it FEELS like it's family owned. More often than not one of either of owners will personally inquire about your dining experience.

I've never had anything but great food at Mi Patio and although most Mexican restaurants are generous with their portions Mi Patio is extremely generous. You won't leave Mi Patio hungry.

It's hard for me to pick the best item on the menu but I'm fond of the Mexican pizza and the Greek-Mex salads.

And although this is a very clean family atmosphere it also has a great bar. The bar is short and in the front of the restaurant but it feels like the neighborhood bar where you know the names of everyone sitting there before you finish your first drink. Like many of their customers you may have first heard about the business from word-of-mouth. They serve great margaritas for $2.00. :-)

Mi Patio is one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix and I stop in whenever I can. And a lot of times when I don't have the time to eat there I get food to go (their to-go menu is really inexpensive - something like $4.95 for a two taco plate with rice and beans.)  Check it out!
