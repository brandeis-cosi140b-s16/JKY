I can die happy now. I'm so happy that I found this unique place. Sushi burritos are the future. It's like they make a giant roll but didn't cut it into slices. I went two days in a row and didn't even feel guilty (and the staff didn't seem judgmental about it either lol). They're set up like a chipotle or a subway, in that you pick exactly what goes inside and watch them roll it shut at the end. And the prices are totally fair, cheaper than chipotle for sure. I'm in love with their raw salmon~! And their customer service was on point, friendly, and incredibly welcoming. I've been telling everyone I know to go there asap. Go go go!!!
