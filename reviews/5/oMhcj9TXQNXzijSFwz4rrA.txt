Out here for work from WA state and thought I'd come check the place out. This place is legit. Had the carne asada and carnitas plate. Great authentic taste. Family run business( literally) they have mom and aunts cooking up your food In the back. This is the real deal. Stop in and see Tesa. She'll take care of you. Definitely be coming back
