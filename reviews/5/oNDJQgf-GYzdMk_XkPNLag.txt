I have been going to the other location on Indian School for years as my sister used to work there. I was driving home one day from the Arrowhead Mall and noticed the same name and got super excited. I took my fiancee and two kids here and they loved it as much as I did and the food taste the same as the other location and the restaurant is so beautiful. My favorite part was when your waiting they have a fire going outside to keep you warm in the cold months! The staff is super awesome and very friendly.
