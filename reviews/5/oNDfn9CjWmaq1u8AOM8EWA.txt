Breakfast burritos in the morning. Chips Carne Asada for lunch and dinner. This place is awesome, even though it has changed names like 3,000 times. It has always been good. I grew up with this place and would take it over Filiberto's any day. Its worth a stab wound to get one off their breakfast burritos.
