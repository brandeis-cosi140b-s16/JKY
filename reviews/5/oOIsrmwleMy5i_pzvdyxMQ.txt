Every single time we have been to Eribertos, its been delicious, in fact, as i sit here writing you, i am craving it! We have been to many "bertos" but this is the best!.  I like the #2, two shredded beef tacos with rice and beans, love it.
My Alex likes the Chorizo, Egg, Potato and Cheese Breakfast Burrito. 
Not sure what is up with some of the other reviews, but we really love their food here at this location. With the other 4/5 star reviews, you have great taste. You get it.  They have made many changes by adding a nice outdoors patio to eat at and two drive-thru windows. That's how busy they are. We will be back and i strongly suggest you try it, i think you will like it.
