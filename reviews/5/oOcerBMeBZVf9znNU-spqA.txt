I have been to this Macayo's too many times to count and unlike other restaurants that change over time I can always count on Macayo's to have the best service and food possible. Plus the food is cheap and you get plenty of it. My food choices have varied and I have always been impressed with my choices, although my favorites are still Spinach Con Queso for an appetizer and a Baja Chimi with Beef! Just talking about it now makes me want to go again!
