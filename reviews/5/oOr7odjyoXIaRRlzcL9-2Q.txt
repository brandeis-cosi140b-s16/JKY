I really liked this place. The atmosphere is quaint and  cute. The Margs are amazing. A little pricey but worth it. Delicious. The Food was good. The meat was perfect, and the red sauce was flavorful and had a small hint of heat. The salsa was perfection. I would recommend this place for date night or small group gatherings.
