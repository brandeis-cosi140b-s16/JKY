This place is great, if you want healthy mexican food and great service, you need to stop in here!

Ive had the Big Blue, which is huge, great if you dont have to do anything in the afternoon. I usally eat the Twice Grilled Chicken Salad, healthy portion of food.

They also have a self serve salsa bar, with hot and mild sauce and plenty of chips.

Also have a drive up curb side service, kind of like Sonic, where they bring the food out to you after a phone order. 

Make sure you use the punch card, 6 punches and you get $5 off your next entree. Double punches on Monday all day and Tues nights.
