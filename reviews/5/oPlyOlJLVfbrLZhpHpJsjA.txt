The dinner is very good, don't get me wrong, but it's right on the edge of "I think I'm paying too much for this". The brunch, though? Oh lordy lordy, the brunch...I will attempt to describe it in my mere mortal words. 

Bottomless mimosas for $5. I could probably end the review right there.

Endless small plates for $30. The plates are so amazingly delicious. My mortal words fail me! And don't forget to ask for the Chef's Special plate. He's always got something new you can try that isn't on the menu, and you can follow him on Twitter to find out what it is or just ask for it when you get there. I haven't had a brunch plate yet that I'm not a fan of. 

Border Grill also takes pride in having their ingredients be fresh and as locally-sourced as possible. The only thing I can fault them on is that the beef isn't grass-fed, and for the price it definitely could be but I'm not going to complain too much. 

The chips and salsa are optional for brunch, if you tell them you're there for it they won't bring it out unless you ask for it specifically. The habanero salsa is definitely spicy, but has a GREAT flavor. I encourage you to mix and match the four salsas as well. They all go very well with each other and you can't go wrong with any combination. 

The guacamole is also stellar, although the portion is a bit small. It seems to me that the plate is a small pile of guac and a majority of veggies dressing up the plate. Well, maybe it's the unlimited chips that make it seem small, or the fact that everybody at the table is in a race to eat as much of it as they can before it's all gone.

I go here least once a month for brunch and try to make it every chance I get. Friends that have come with me to dinner here and were only okay with the place have also jumped on board with the brunch and make a semi-regular pilgrimage as well. Seriously. Go here for brunch right now. Weekends, 11:00-15:00. Do it.
