We started with Pancho's about 1970 when we lived in the Northeast part of Phoenix.  We went to the one at Metrocenter (now closed).  The one in Mesa is our "go to" Poncho's now because our daughter and son-in-law live in Mesa.

We raised four kids with visits to Pancho's.  And this is its genius.  It's designed for families.  Get it?  The food is good, service fast, servers friendly and you can take a party of 12 without scaring them or you to death.  I did so last January and we all had a ball.  Went in July too, when we were there for a visit.

Our kids always fought over who's gonna raise the flag.  They absolutely adored the sopapillas.  If you don't get honey on your elbow, you're not doin' it right.

If we want real Mexican food, we go to a mom and pop somewhere near.  If we want the Pancho's experience and price tag, we go to Pancho's!
