This is exactly what I needed. Nothing fancy, just a menu full of tortillas with cheese meat and vegetables. 

Delicious queso, delicious Mexican restaurant chips (my favorite), delicious typical American-Mexican food. Fairytale. 

The prices are a little higher than I'd like, and the margarita pitcher was a little weak. But I know we will be coming back!
