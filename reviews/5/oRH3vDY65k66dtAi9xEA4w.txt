Dan is the man!

Looking for a great street-style taco, this is the place to go. Their Fish Taco's are to die for!

Also, you want Fresh Homemade Horchata? This is the place to be! I thought I enjoyed the fake, fountain bought Horchata, well that was the way of the past! Ever since I had the Horchata at Tacos Atoyac, I haven't gone back to the other stuff. 

All their food is great, rolled tacos, burros, fish, pork, etc, it's all great. 

Everything is Al La Carte, so expect to order a few tacos if you want a meal.
