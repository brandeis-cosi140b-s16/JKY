Do yourself a favor and go get some tacos from the day time taco stand at this place!! Best tacos I have had in Pittsburgh!! A great quick bite to have when you're shopping Sat/Sun morning or afternoon in the Strip District! The grocery store is also great, with many varieties of South American food products!!
