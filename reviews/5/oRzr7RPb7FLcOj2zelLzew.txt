Tonight  my boyfriend  and I  decided to give this  place a try. We were  a bit  concerned  after  reading  the  reviews from our  fellow  Maricopans who warned of hot plates, bad food, bad service, no corn dogs  and gross diarrhea.  To our surprise we had a spectacular  experience!  Note: our waiter didn't  speak English  but I  found  it authentic  and charming and I think  it's  only fair  to say  my boyfriend  speaks Spanish. The chips were hot and crisp with  a spicy salsa which was delish. Spicy foods upset my stomach too and Diarrhea is a definite  possibility,  but I  will gladly embrace it should  it happen! I ordered  the seafood chimichanga which came with light and fluffy rice and refried beans. Very good dish. The show stopper was the shrimp fajitas my boyfriend ordered. The shrimp was tail on, split and grilled and seasoned to perfection! His fajitas  came with homemade beans, rice and all the fixins. I stole tastes from his plate  and can say honestly it was nothing  short of orgasmic, seriously,  I wanted  to roll around  naked in his fajitas but I digress.... I will, i MUST, go back...SOON! If you are basing your  decision to go to this restaurant on the reviews  of your fellow townsfolk,  I remind you that most Maricopans are well.....I'm  too zen from my dinner to finish  that sentence. Tonight  I will dream of you, Plaza Bonita xoxox
