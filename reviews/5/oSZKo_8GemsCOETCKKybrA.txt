I live in LA.  But I used to live in Las Vegas.  The red salsa here is THE BEST IN THE WORLD,   My wife and I visit Vegas JUST TO TAKE THE SALSA HOME!  The food is simple, clean and PERFECT!  The atmosphere hasn't changed in 40 years. It is the perfect hole-in-the-wall restaurant.  Theresa is the timeless hostess. And Juan is the kink of Mexican cooking.  They have never sought to expand or commercialize...and they are AUTHENTIC!
