I have been searching far and wide for a good menudo. Turns out it was right under my nose! It bucks the trend of red menudo by serving the white. It has the perfect balance of hominy and tripe. Great flavor and not a lot of bones. 
Their signature tacos are some of the best I've had. Great flavor in the meat!
