The food is phenomenal and the sauces are magic. Words can't describe. Just go and eat. 

I've eaten here more than any other restaurant. This place carries with it more memories then I can count. My bros and I have spent hours upon hours sitting in this restaurant talking about futures, relationships, and lives. This place is more than a restaurant. It's a place where relationships are built. 

Just go and eat.
