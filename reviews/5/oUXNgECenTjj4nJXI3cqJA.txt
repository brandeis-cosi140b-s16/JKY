I'he eaten here twice during the last 45 days - both Sunday nights. The food ROCKS!!! The ambiance is "feels good" and the service given by the waiter known as, "Luis" was complete. From recommending popular dishes to checking in to ensure satisfaction - Luis is the man! I had "Pollo Especial" which was outta sight! My date had vegetarian fajitas and she was pleased with the vegetable selection; noting they were different than other vegetarian fajitas she's had in the area.

Each entree was flavorful, filing and fun. 5 stars - Solid!!!
