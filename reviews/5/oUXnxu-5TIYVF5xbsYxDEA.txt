This place has the best food around. The people here are kind the service is quick and well the tacos are awesome especially the shredded beef ones. Oh the rice and beans are out if this world. I highly recommend. Oh and Friday nights are the best. There is free mariachis on Friday nights and the atmosphere is fun and more fun without the pressure of "pick-up" night at the other establishments. Oh, did I mention the food is great? And the people are fantastic, kudos to the cooks, the servers and the owner are all great--I highly recommend this place to anyone with a heart and a sense of fun.
