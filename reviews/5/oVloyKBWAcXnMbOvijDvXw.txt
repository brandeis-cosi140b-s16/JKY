I first went to Richardson's 15 years ago when in Phoenix on business, and after that first fantastic meal, went there multiple times over the next few years. 

Fast forward to this past Saturday night when I took my family there. I'd heard mixed reviews but wanted to see for myself if they could still pull off the kind of meal I remembered. I was not disappointed!  I had the sea bass in an orange salsa that was prepared perfectly, along with their famous green chili potato. The other three in my party had fish - the fish trio, the salmon and the swordfish. All were cooked to perfection.  Add an appetizer of chips with fresh guacamole, pico, and two green sauces, one to set your hair on fire and you have the total package. Finally topped it off with the house made flan - absolutely delicious. 

Richardson's definitely passed the test of time. I'll definitely be going back.
