I've been following the process of their creation on Facebook. Stopped in tonight to see how things are going. Not everything is done yet but they were accommodating and provided some great items.

I recommend the fresh lemonade for a drink, strawberries were the theme tonight. I love spicy food, and I was surprised that the balance was perfect. I suggest the nachos to split as well. 

Definitely going back, and bringing all my friends.
