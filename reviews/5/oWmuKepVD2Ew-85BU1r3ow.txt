Visiting Scottsdale for the first time in years and was rather clueless. Called and talked the manager Jeff, he was genuine and inviting, unlike the other places we called about our small party of 3. VIP hostess was great, service staff was pleasant and attentive. Bouncers were friendly. Bartenders know how to pour a cocktail!! Great mellow day by the pool. Wish I was staying an extra day, I'd go back.
