Excellent service, great food. Get out here and don't be afraid of the location! We had the tableside guacamole, a few tacos, posole, and we took the "Chapulines Challege." You gotta do it. All the food was absolutely delicious and the margaritas were tart and yummy. Super attentive staff and Kai was fantastic; he guided us through the menu and surprised us with a few recommendations. The ambience is modern, chic and inviting. Chef Paco treats you like his own child. Will return on our next trip to Vegas.
