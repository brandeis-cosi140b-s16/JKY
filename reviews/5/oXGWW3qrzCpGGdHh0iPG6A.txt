Well it's Taco Bell so I wasn't really expecting much. I actually went inside since I had some time to kill and it was surprisingly clean on the inside. The employees were all extremely friendly. They must be doing an overhaul on their customer service because the last few times I've been to Taco Bell they have been extremely friendly. Food wasn't anything impressive but it's fast food that I paid $5 for sooo you get what you pay for there. Anyway I was very impressed with the cleanliness and the the employees.
