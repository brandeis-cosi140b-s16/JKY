I can only imagine this goodness gets better when drunk, but for my hungover boyfriend and I, it cured all wounds.

We ordered a smorgasbord--more food than either of us should consume on a single day, probably. I with the cheese enchilada plate, and he with the carne asada wet burrito, and the both of us with carne asada street tacos and chips and cheese with guac. The guacamole was probably the least good part of the meal--the dreaded watery avocado paste--but the rest of the meal was delish.

I had never been to any Roberto's--funny living in Vegas for a while and having lived in Southern California as well, but I enjoyed myself. It's interesting how accustomed I get to places like Chipotle and Cafe Rio and then once I get to a place like this, it's at once awesome and disappointing. I want queso! I want chunky avocados! But then I'm like, wait, this is better, actually, and probably with less terrifying ingredients. 

Open 24 hours for all those drunken late night cravings!
