This place is why family owned businesses should rule all. Nice seating, salsa bar, cheap breakfast before 10:30 including coffee. 
 Very friendly and quick or at least a reasonable wait time since it is cooked to order. Fresh and delicious, nothing that's been waiting under a heat lamp. 
No One here eats guacamole so I can't review that, but everything we tried we liked a lot. And I am not that big on Mexican , I like it but it falls down to the bottom of my favorties list - so that is saying a lot.
 Huge Burritos, cheap eats and you will be full. The one steak burrito we got had more meat in it than a large Capriotti's sub. 
 And if you are entertaining and end up ordering a lot they have the common sense to mark the sandwiches and let you know what is in what packet. That was great when handing things out instead of having a bag full of items you had to open to figure out what was what...
 This is the go to place for Mexican in the area. It is clean and friendly and easy to park.
 Trying the soup next.
