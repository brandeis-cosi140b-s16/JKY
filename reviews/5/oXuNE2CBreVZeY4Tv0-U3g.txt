Best Arizona Style Mexican Food in town. I love the red chile pork plate with flour tortilla. It's seriously off the hook ridiculously good. The rice and beans are great.  It appears to be run with the family's secret recipes. The tortas are also incredible here, I get the carne asada, but the key here is all the homemade sauces and fresh quality food. It's a small place and kind of a secret.  Super friendly staff and always clean. My only disappointment is realizing I cleaned my plate and have to leave.   All the customers seem to have that look on their face like they struck gold. Not the fanciest location, so put on your work boots and don't miss out. 'HIGHLY' recommended!
