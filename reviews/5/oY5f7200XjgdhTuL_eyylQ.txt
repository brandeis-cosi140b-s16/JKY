I'm a fan!!  I went there this afternoon with a friend.  I've noticed it before and it's always smelled wonderful everytime I've walked by there.  The service was friendly and I ordered the vegetarian tacos.  Yummy!!  My friend ordered the chicken enchilada which was also a winner.  I definitely will be coming back.
