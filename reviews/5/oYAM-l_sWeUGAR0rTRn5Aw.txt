It doesn't even seem right that I have never reviewed this place, as I've been coming to and raving about "The Parilla" for going on 7 years now.  It is my de facto "friends in town and want some good Mexican" stop.  In fact, I'm freakin' shocked by the low ratings this place is getting!!

As with anyone Mexican place, they start you out with chips and awesome salsa.  There's a spicy smooth red sauce, a pico-type salsa, and the piece de resistance....the avocado tomatillo salsa.  They do, however, charge for extra chips/salsa after the first freebie refill.

I recommend anyone try the Tortilla Soup (note: NOT a chicken tortilla soup).  You can get with or without toppings of sour cream and avocado for an additional cost, but I find it perfect as is.  It's mostly broth with cheese and tortilla strips (of course), but it is just such a delish soup. For my entree, I always get #25, which is a vegetarian combo of a tamale and cheese enchilada, which I have them use mole sauce instead of traditional enchilada sauce.  It comes with refried beans (the pinto beans are cooked with pork) and rice.  The soup and this plate are MORE than enough for dinner and breakfast/lunch the next day.

They have several other locations in the Valley, a few in Tucson, one in Guadalajara, and one in Mexico City.
