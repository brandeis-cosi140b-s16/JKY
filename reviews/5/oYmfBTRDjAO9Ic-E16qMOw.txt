My first experience with Los Tacos was definitley a good one. So good that I will definitely be back.  
Not only do they have the best burritos, but the salsa is the best in city. One bite, and i was sold!
A step up from Roberto's would be an understatement, so just do yourself a favor, get down and support Los Tacos.....you'll be happy you did.
