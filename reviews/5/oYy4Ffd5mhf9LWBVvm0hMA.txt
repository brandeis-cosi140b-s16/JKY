Great first experience with a quick lunch today. I grabbed a Asada and Fish taco, a side of beans, and a horchata. Lunch was served fast less than 5 minutes and the sides of grilled onion and fried pepper along with the two salsas were spot on. 

The horchata included smal pieces if cantaloupe and pecans. nice version.

I'm not sure what I would change. I guess this is a case where I can just enjoy. I'll be back.
