Best Mexican food I've had in Phoenix. Hands down the best upscale Mexican food establishment here. It's a little pricey for Mexican food, but it is upscale. To be honest I used to think that all Mexican food was some combination of the same ingredients over and over again, but Barrio proves that there are other good quality Mexican dishes. Keep doing what your doing Barrio, I will return.
