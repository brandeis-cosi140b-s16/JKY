You might have to wait here because they don't take reservations but it's worth the wait!!!  Authentic Mexican food, many types of margaritas and other cocktails to try, and a fun atmosphere. I loved the pork tacos. Shredded pork that was tender and perfect and pico de gallo. I can't wait to go back and try other dishes!
