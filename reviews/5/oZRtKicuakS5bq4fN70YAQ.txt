Mas Amigos, I owe you an apology for not upgrading your rating sooner.  I've been back several times since my first review, and you are now one of my favorite restaurants in C-U.

I have to reiterate that the chips and salsa are INCREDIBLE.  And that green sauce (a mixture of avocados, tomatillos, and jalape√±os) should really just be poured straight into my mouth from now on.  I want it on everything.  Their lunch specials are cheap and delicious, and for God's sake, order their tacos with onion and cilantro.  Soooo good.

Dos is dead.  Viva Mas Amigos!
