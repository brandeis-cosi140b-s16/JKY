I live a few minutes away and am horrified I only just found out about this place!!! The food is outstanding, my usual has been a Carne Asada Burrito with all the usual inside (pinto beans, rice, sour cream, cheese) the meat is flavorful!! Yesterday I tried the Pork in Green Chile Burrito...hold me down it was fantastic!!! The prices are super reasonable, the place is incredibly clean and I am greeted like family, really....the coolest people I have come across!!! I love this place and make it there for take-out more than once a week.
