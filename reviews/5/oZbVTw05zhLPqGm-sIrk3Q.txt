Love this place! Our waiter was very nice and service was quick. The food was also delicious. Usually when I go to a Mexican food place I am disappointed, but not here. I ordered a chicken chimichanga enchilada style and it was amazing!!!The salsa was very spicy and yummy! I love it here. Will definitely be coming back since I live so close and the service is great.
