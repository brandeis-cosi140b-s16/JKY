I've been coming here for years with my family. Tried almost everything on the menu. The chili rellenos are almost as good as my own! 1/ 3 good places in the valley with chilli rellenos that good. Beef stew tastes like my Tatas own broth, the quality of the food definitely doesn't go without notice and don't even get me started on the salsas.... PHENOMENAL!  It's a little hole in the wall,definitely... but it's my neighborhood hidden gem. My whole family loves this place! :)
