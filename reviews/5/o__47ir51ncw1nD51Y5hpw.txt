My dad's a regular here, the owner knows him and everything, and some weeks I join him for lunch (he's a professor at the u of I and I'm a student). Honestly I really enjoy the food here. I'm not very picky but I'm not a Neanderthal. By my judgment the food is great, it's fast if you just drive there and get your order to go, and the staff is amazingly friendly. I like not supporting an overpriced corporate chain. And you get a lot of food for your money.
