This is by far one of the best places to eat if you like good quality Mexican food!
The overall quality of the food here is amazing! The ingredients that they use (Beef, Chicken, Produce) are all very fresh and of above average quality. Their Chorizo is very, very good! Top notch!

As for Tequila, there is a vast selection to choose from
They have a true passion for Tequila and are willing to share that with you if you have the interest. It is a really great place to learn more about this special spirit.

The staff has always been very friendly and helpful! And the price is amazingly affordable!

I have been to many types of Mexican restaurants across the country. From "fast food" type to full blown to "Empty your wallet" style.  The Gran Agave is as good as any I have ever tried! Don't take my word for it, give it a try yourself.
*hint* ask for a taste of "901"
