I love Wahoo's! I've been a fan of Wahoo's since I tried it in Huntington Beach and it really is amazing. Finding out they were opening this location was an exciting moment indeed, and the food, staff, and restaurant are all pretty fantastic.

Heather and Mailman are incredible bartenders, get to know them!
