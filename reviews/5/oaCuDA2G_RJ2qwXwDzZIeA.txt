Taco Bells all serve the same food in the US. However the employees, location, and cleanliness all vary. This is one of the cleanest TBs I've been in! One HUGE difference is Carl, a 3-year employee, who knows what customer service is.  Even with the transient type person was greeted and handled professionally. He offered him a water cup when he said he had no money. Carl picked up everyone's trash, greeted everyone that came in and left.  That's an employee that's hard to find in any fast food business and in most customer service businesses. Not too sure of the location as we are from out of town. Clean outside and in, Carl is the best!
