Stopped by for lunch. This was my very first visit to Rubio's. Found out what I was missing. First off, the manager was very helpful. Said she was with the company for 3 years here and in Tucson. I stuck with the Shrimp Burrito...wasn't disappointed. Staff was helpful, restaurant was clean and presentable, food was delicious, and everything seemed healthy.
