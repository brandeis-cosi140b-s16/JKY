We were so amazed to actually find some New Mexican food in our area, but what was even more amazing is how authentic the food tastes. Tastes like food you would have at your abuelas house. Fresh ingredients, awesome salsa, the green/red hatch chili sauce is crazy good. Service was fast, place is clean with a nice environment. My family and I will def be frequent customers. 5 stars and I would for sure recommend a visit
