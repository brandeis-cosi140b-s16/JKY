I cannot get enough of this restaurant. Don Lencho's is family owned and operated and serving up some amazingly delicious mariscos (seafood) and mexican food.
Some of my favorite dishes include: menudo, chilaquiles with carne asada, and the vulve la vida (seafood cocktail with octopus, oysters, shrimp and clams). I always leave completely satisfied and find myself craving this food practically every day!
Happy hour is also available every day which offers a wide variety of affordable drinks. Try the Mango Margarita, yum.
