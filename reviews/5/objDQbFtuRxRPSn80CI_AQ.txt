From beginning to end this restaurant surpassed my expectations. Started with the queso fundido which was so rich and sweet yet spicy enough to capture the heart of your tastebuds. Then moved on to the shrimp cocktail with the perfect balance of ingredients inside. Moving on to my entree was the mojarra Frita just like my mom used to make and I couldn't have asked for anything different. Just to finish the meal fried ice cream to cleanse the tastebuds so delicious I can't wait to return!
