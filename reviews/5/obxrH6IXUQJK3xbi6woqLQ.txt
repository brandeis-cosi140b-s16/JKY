Let's cut to the chase... this is the best Mexican in Charlotte!
I started eating here about '92, and back then it was frequent I was the only English-speaking person in the place, and the wait-staff were Spanish-speaking only.  The Decor was terrible, but the food terrific.
They've changed it all immensely, and now there's always a good mix of American and Hispanic customers.  The food quality is always, 100% fresh and exceptional, and while the Wait-staff is seldom overly friendly, they're always polite.
Back in '98 I had the chance to eat at Tacqueria Mexico for dinner one night, got on a plane the next day to Arizona, and late that day was eating on the top of a mountain in Puerta Penasco, Mexico.  I can say with authority the food tasted exactly the same!
So, if you're interested in truly authentic Mexican in Charlotte, you owe it to yourself to try this place! As mentioned by other reviewers, it's nothing special to look at, but it's what's inside that counts!
