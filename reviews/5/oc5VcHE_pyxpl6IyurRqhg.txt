I always enjoy to read others bad reviews and what some people said of the service, I would have to agree on a certain level, but when going to a restaurant I only want the waiter to come by for our order and notice when our drinks are low.  That was accomplished on this visit and the food was amazing along with some good portions.  I had the chicken enchiladas and am definitely looking forward to coming back to visit.
