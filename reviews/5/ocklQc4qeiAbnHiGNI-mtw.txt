Went here in hopes of having a good pozole rojo, but it was a Tuesday and they only make pozole during the weekend. Instead I was torn between the flauta dinner and the enchiladas verdes. I asked the server which she preferred and she actually offered to serve me a plate with one flauta and one enchailada just so that I could enjoy both! Super attentive and really knew how to please the customer. She also refilled my chips and salsa which were great for snacking. I really enjoyed the chile verde on the enchilada and overall the dish was very good. I also ordered their champurrado which was delicious and perfect for a cold winter day. Can't wait to go back!
