One of the most inspiring Mexicanesque meal journeys of my lifetime. The "cheesy gordita crunch" is an exquisite meal masterpiece. Incorporating the softness of a delicate flatbread, crunchiness of a handmade tortilla shell, and freshness of the "carne," "lechuga", and "queso" call for two thumbs up and then some. Bravo Taco Bell, bravo. Authenticity has never been truer. Enrich your senses and appease your appetite in an expeditious manner while experiencing a meal of a lifetime. 5 stars. Period.
