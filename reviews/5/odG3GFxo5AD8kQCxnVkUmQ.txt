Food is great. Drinks are great. I usually go to take advantage of half off margaritas and mojitos. My favorite appetizer is the chorizo con queso and dish would be the chori pollo. I stay away from the pick 2, 3, or 4 meal deal as I don't feel it comes with the same quality as a regular dish. The staff is great and energetic, well at least the staff members I always run into!
