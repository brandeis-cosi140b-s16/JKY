I don't know if I was extremely hungry or what but my burrito was bomb dot com. I went during lunch and of course the line was long but it moved quickly.  The customer service was great.  The chicken was fresh and hot, the portions were perfect because some other Chipotle's put more rice than meat which makes it less appetizing. Good job
