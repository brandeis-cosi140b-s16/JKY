Restaurants have 3 things they need to ensure in order to be successful: 

First is good food.  That's the most important obviously.  Even if you hate everything else about a place you may come back if the food is good.  The food at Joyride is good.  Everything that came our way was presented well, tasted great, and was ample in portions.

Second is to make sure you have a good time and are taken care of.  Primarily, this requires good servers and providing value for your money.  The service here was a delight.  We actually got forgotten about and not served for 10 minutes but the waitress was so friendly and enjoyable that it was easy to forgive.  Regarding the value, the daily happy hour until 5 on drinks makes it hard to complain about.  

The last thing you need, to me, to be successful as a restaurant is "it."  You know "it" when you see it.  Joyride has "it."  The atmosphere is enjoyable, the layout of the tables is comfortable, the patio is delightful, the colors are fun...everything just works.  

This was my first time at Joyride and I'm itching to go back already.  A great place.
