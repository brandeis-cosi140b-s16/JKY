Quirky... a little secluded and definately worth the hunt. Located in the bottom floor of building A of the World Market Furniture market, we definatley could have used a larger sign. Your best bet is to enter in the back of the buildings on the north side of the property and its right there.

If you remember LaMadonna then you know Mundo. Same great (SNOOTY MEXICAN) food in a relaxing elegant environment. If you are downtown and are looking for an interesting place for a meeting or intimate lunch date Mundo is it. Don't forget to check in on Yelp. I did and a 15% off coupon popped up on my phone.

The weekend brunch menu was delicious. We sampled four plates and they were each perfect.
