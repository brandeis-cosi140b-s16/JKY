This is my favorite restaurant in Chambana!!! And it's pretty plain to see that this is a nearly unanimous consensus. 

I've been there dozens of time and have had just about every item on the menu -- everything is absolutely delicious! My all-time favorite items are the al pastor torta ahogada and al pastor/carne asada buritto.

Growing up in Colorado I've had plenty of delicious Mexican food and I have to say that this is some of the best Mexican food I've ever had!
