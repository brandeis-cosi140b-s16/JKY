This place is great! We stopped in on the way to the airport and I'm so glad we did. The server was very friendly, helpful, and attentive. We tried the pork enchiladas, the tamales de elote (off the Salvadoran portion of the menu), and fried yucca with pork (also Salvadoran). Everything was delectable! My boyfriend often leaves the sides of beans and rice unfinished at Mexican restaurants but he polished off every bite this time because even the sides were so good! Much of the menu is naturally gluten-free too, so that was a bonus for me. We don't live in Las Vegas, but if we're ever back, I hope to return to Andale Fresh!
