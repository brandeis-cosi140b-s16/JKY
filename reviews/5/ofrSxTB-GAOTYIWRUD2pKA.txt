This was the first place I ate when I moved to Vegas about ten years ago. I fell in love and have been back hundreds of time since.

Where to start...

The chips and salsa are the best I have ever had. The flavors are amazing. I have considered on more than one occasion paying one of the line cooks to make a bucket for me. The guacamole is amazing as well. Fresh, chunky, and creamy with great flavor.

I have to say I haven't explored the menu too much. I have ordered the same dish every visit with maybe a half-dozen exceptions. Their carnitas are second to none. Cooked perfectly, their version of preparing this meat is unparalleled by anyone I have seen anywhere.

I order a slightly different version:
3 item combo of all carnitas tacos
: crispy corn tortilla instead of flour
: only lettuce, cheese, and red sauce as topping.

I believe I have perfected this order and if you are fortunate enough to give it a try I challenge you not pass out in ecstasy (ok, maybe you won't pass out, but it' pretty damn good).

My death row meal would probably be this place. Go east here now!
