Wow this place is amazing!!!!

My man and I were looking for a place to eat lunch when we kind of stumbled upon this place. Originally, we were just hungry and craving some Mexican food. 

I can't for the life of me remember our waiter's name, but he was amazing and had awesome recommendations.

We had the carne asada. OMG. So delicious!!!!! Very authentic, juicy and tender. Wow I can't say enough about it!

My mouth is literally watering thinking about it! We have been back 3-4 times since then and we make it a must-have every time we come to Vegas.

Trust me, you won't regret that you chose Canonita!

OH! And make sure to get the fresh guacamole!!!
