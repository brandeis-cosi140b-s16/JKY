Best tacos I've ever had.  Mmm.  Me and a friend stopped in for lunch and we had ordered and received our food in about 5 minutes.  We split nachos (I didn't get meat on them, looking back I wish I would have) and we each got 3 tacos.  You get to choose corn or flour tortillas and they have beef, pork, chicken, and veggie options.  Tacos were $3 each.  

Service was friendly and the small store is my kinda vibe.  I will certainly be back!
