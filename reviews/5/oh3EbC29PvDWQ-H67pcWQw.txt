I had to post a review because this place was wonderful!  When I ordered the Barbacoa tacos the lady who waited on us mentioned another type of taco they had (I don't remember the name of it but it sounded like they don't always have it-it) so we ordered that too.  Both tacos were perfect but the one that was suggested ended up being our favorite.  The El Paso taquitos are amazing! It's best to order tacos or something else to eat while the taquitos cool down and the cheese melts.  I can't wait to go back!
