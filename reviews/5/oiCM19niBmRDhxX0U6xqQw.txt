I was visiting vegas two weeks ago when my friend that lives in LV suggested that we eat here. Ilove her for suggesting this place, because I can't wait to go back to try their other goodies.

We started with the guacamole and chips, and I was pleasantly surprised that they made it in front of you. Not just that, the music entertainer played a song, while our waiter made it. I thought that was a nice touch.

I ordered the huevos con chorizo and two steak tacos. They were both excellent especially the steak. Everything was fresh, and the food presentation was excellent. I had the chance to try my friend's meals, and they were very good as well. They ordered the steak with green sauce and the steak with cilantro. The prices weren't that bad, and you really get what you pay for (probably $25 dollars a person).

The service was excellent. It seemed like we had more than one waiter, and that was fine by me. They catered to our needs and made sure that we were satisfied. The music entertainment was quite nice as well. He was singing, playing the guitar, and keyboards. 

I really wish we had places like these in Chicago. Yet another reason for me to go back to Vegas.
