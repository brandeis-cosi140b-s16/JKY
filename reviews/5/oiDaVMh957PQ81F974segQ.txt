OMG this is the best Taco Bell ever. I have been coming here for a few months. The drive thru is awesome.  Kelsy is the best. She is always bubbly and friendly.  I have never went to this location and had a bad experience. I even get happy faces on my receipt.  I feel so special when going there. .
I have been to other Taco bells and they don't even come close to the service you get here. I have went out of my way many times just to go to this Taco bell. I am definitely hooked.
