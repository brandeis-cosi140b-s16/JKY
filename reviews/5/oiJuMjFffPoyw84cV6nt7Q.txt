JJ's is the best! Took us awhile to discover but worth it. 
Their food is great, especially for the price, and the service is awesome. 
Neighborhood type of place. Great atmosphere. 

The Enchalida Stlye Buritto is the best. Get it with red aside, but be careful, HOT. 

We go back often, because the food is so consistent.
