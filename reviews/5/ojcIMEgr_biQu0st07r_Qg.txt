Ah ah ah AH AMAZINGGG! Service was great. The Server was very knowledgeable. Had the kobe beef tacos...ummm *droool*. they were amazing. The flavor of the meat alone was exceptional. The Queso Fundido which is mexican cheeses * chorizo * roasted peppers was soooo good. I could of just ate that for my meal and been satisfied. The alcoholic drinks were a little light on the alcohol but still had great flavor. I recommend the skinny pink lemonade cocktail. (comes in tall glass). Come again ? why yes ..yes I will .
