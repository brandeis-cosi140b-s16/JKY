Decided to hit this spot up after seeing it on yelp and it was probably the best decision of my life. I've been hooked on Rivas ever since. Everything is good here. The steak fries are fire! Best I've ever had. The chicken is sooo good. If you want mexican that's great tasting then I recommend Rivas,  you won't regret it. Better than those jabronis Robertos for sure. 

Ps: try the Green sauce it's amazing!!!!
