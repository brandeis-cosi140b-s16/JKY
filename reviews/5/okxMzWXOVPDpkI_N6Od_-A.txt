Absolutely LOVE this place.  Everything is SO FRESH and homemade! It's wonderful that I can get the tacos in jicama instead of the tortilla. Prime Rib tacos are beyond delicious! The carne asada loaded nachos are sinfully good!  Ever since the first time I've eaten here I have been back at least once a week and I always bring someone new and they always LOVE it too! Do yourself a favor try this !!!
