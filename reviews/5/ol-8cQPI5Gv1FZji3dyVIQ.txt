Growing up Mexican, I have pretty high standards for Mexican food, and this place delivers. 

Food: Absolutely delicious. I recommend the al pastor burrito. It's so good that within the first bite, I instantly wished that I had fifty more. You could taste the pineapple in the meat, which is so tender and not lacking in flavor at all. The burritos are a good size, big enough to leave you full but not Chipotle-sized. Both the red and green salsas are incredible. The horchata is delicious; I usually find that a lot of horchatas have the problem of being super sweet, but this one has just the right amount of sweetness and cinnamon flavor.

Service: Many people are complaining about the wait time, but every time that I have come, I have never waited for longer than a few minutes. I've never thought that the employees were particularly rude, just as polite as they needed to be. 

Decor/Cleanliness: They have recently remodeled and I must say that it's a nice upgrade. Before, the place was tiny, a very hole-in-the-wall establishment with not much room for seating. However, now they expanded into the business next door and it looks a lot more open and airy. They also upgraded their signs and menu board to look a lot more sleek and refined. The only thing is that in their old place, they used to have a huge mural that I really loved, but with the remodel, they had to tear down that wall. There are still murals of La Catrina and such, but I really loved the last one. Very clean, never once questioned how hygienic the place was.
