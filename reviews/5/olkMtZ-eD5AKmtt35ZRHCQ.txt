Okay... Panchero's Mexican Grill is my new obsession. Truth be told, I avoided it for the longest time because I didn't think any burrito place could compete with Chipotle. Boy was I wrong!

Panchero's wins hands down in the showdown with Chipotle mostly because of their freshly pressed tortillas. They are so scrumptious that my mouth starts to water as soon as they pull the dough ball off of the tray. The tortillas is complemented by always fresh ingredients and completed with a swirl with the bob tool. Love the bob tool! Chipotle burritos always have layers but a Panchero's burrito insides are mixed so every bite has all the flavors. 

I will admit to going to Chipotle once after discovering Panchero's but I only went after much kicking and screaming. If only the had an iPhone app similar to Chipotle's. They have an app now but it only allows you to play a burrito making game rather than place an order.
