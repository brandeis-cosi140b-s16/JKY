Ok, I have been around the block when it comes to Mexican street food, with most of my favorites coming from Juarez in the 70's. 

But the carne asada street tacos with freshly roasted green chiles and cilantro--the best ever.  

These ladies know what they are doing. I was so sad to have wasted my stomach and time on Wadaa in Scottsdale which somehow is supposed to be the best????  Nay nay. Drive a bit further. Go here.
