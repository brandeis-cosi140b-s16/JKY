Really good tacos! The salsa was my favorite. The carne was cooked to perfection. The service was very friendly and welcoming. The menu only consists of 3 delicious items but why making anything else when those three items are so good. The price was awesome too for such good tacos. Location kinda sucks because there is hardly any parking but well worth it. I'm for sure going to be coming back for more!
