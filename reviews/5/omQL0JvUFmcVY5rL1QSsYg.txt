I have indulged in my fair share of Mexican food. My expanding waistline is proof of that. I can honestly say, without a doubt, Fausto's has the best carne asada burrito I have tasted in the Vegas area. With tender carne asada serving as the headliner, the fresh supporting ingredients come together for a flavorful masterpiece matched by no other. The staff was friendly and fast, keeping up with the lunch hour rush. The salsa bar features fresh carrots and the best red sauce this side of the border. Fausto's is by no account conveniently located for me, but well worth the few extra minutes it takes to get there.
