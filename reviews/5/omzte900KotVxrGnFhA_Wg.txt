Roberto's can be found pretty much throughout LV. The food is excellent and well priced. What makes this place even more awesome is the fact that it's open 24hrs. We need this in California.
During this specific visit I ordered a chicken chimichanga which came with R&B. The portions were so huge that I couldn't even finish it. More importantly the taste was really good and I tried to finish but just did not have the room. I ended up finishing the rest of the chimi R&B later and it held up well despite being in the fridge for 6 hours.
