Finally reviewing this place that I love so much. I am definitely a regular here and I come for palets, groceries, produce, prepared salsa and guacamole,  and the tasty and oh so tasty, authentic Mexican food. But this is not just a grocery store, but also a butcher, ice cream shop, paleta factory, fresh juice bar, and small eatery. 

I mean come on, if the place you are eating at doesn't have the freshest ingredients while being attached to a grocery something is terribly wrong. They have the small kitchen pumping out deliciosity and never a long wait, even while getting very busy. The clientele ranges from Latino blue collared folks, high schools students, shoppers that are looking to snack, office lunchers looking for a quick eat, and families sharing a meal. 

On the weekends they have prepared soups and meat specialties, fiery habanero salsa, and tamales available. 

BEST BURRITO IN MADISON! And for $5.80 it is a steal. 

Highly recommended.
