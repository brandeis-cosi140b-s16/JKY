Went on a Saturday night. The place is clean and well kept. Has a serious family restaurant feel which is EXACTLY what you want when you're looking for good Mexican food. The salsa was ON POINT!! Our food did take a while to come out so I don't recommend it if your in a hurry. HOWEVER the food came out piping hot and was INCREDIBLE. The rice and beans were surprisingly good as well. Most bigger chains focus on the entree and leave the rice and beans in the dust. This place seriously gets 5 stars all around. If you want amazing home cooked Mexican food and aren't in a hurry, this is the place to be!!
