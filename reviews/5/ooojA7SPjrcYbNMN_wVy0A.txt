FIVE STARS?  Until I find a better Carne Asada it has to be five stars.  I have not ventured away from the Carne Asada Tacos becasue they have been RIGHT ON.  Have had several times and only once would say they were not stellar.  (a little greasy)  Ive kissed many frogs errrrr tried many carne asada tacos and this is the best one.  Have also had chorizo and eggs.  Decent but the potatoes were cut up French fries.  Also have had steak egg and potato  breakfast burrito.  Do yourself a favor and add cheese (which should already be part of it but is not)
