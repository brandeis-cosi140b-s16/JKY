I freaking love this place. So much that Timmy Tom and I came here every Sunday for about 2 months. We thought it was becoming such a serious addiction that now we try to limit ourselves to bi-weekly visits. 

Let's see, the place itself is very cool. I like the decor, the picnic tables, the huge bar, the johnny cash music, and the old west movies. Right away, it feels very homey. 

Next, the food. TT has tried every taco, tostada, and torta, and is always happy with whatever he gets. As for me, two milanesa tortas just inst enough - I love them!! The milanesa chicken is always cooked perfectly and the avocado lemon mayo is so refreshing and tasty. They are the perfect size and I am basically ALWAYS craving them. When it comes to the tacos, short rib all the way. This has to be everyones favorite - its so juicy and tender - ugh, heaven! I have a little secret - I ask for the short rib torta as a tostada. Extra meat, crunchy taco, and a little lettuce - it's the perfect compliment to my two milanesa sandwiches!! 

I think their margaritas are quite tasty and a bang for your buck. In fact, the whole menu is very well priced, in my opinion. I feel like we eat very well and don't walk out poor. I thought their limited menu would get boring quick but I was wrong. I am so happy this placed opened up and that its so close to me because if any place is going to become my 'Cheers,' it's Bakersfield.
