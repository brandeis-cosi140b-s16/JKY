Man I love Roberto's! Been eating here since I was a kid! Quick, cheap good food! This location is right by my house but I'm glad there are so many so no matter what side of town I'm on I can get my fix! I love their chicken Tacos Wednesdays when they are only $1. I haven't had anything I didn't like!
