This place is great! They have so much inexpensive (and GREAT tasting) food that this is now a regular place for us to come get food. We've tried many of their different kinds of meat and we keep coming back for more!

Also, every weekend (providing there's no blizzard) they are out cooking EXCELLENT tacos on the sidewalk. I mean, GOOD stuff. We always get a few tacos and head down the street to get some coffee and enjoy!
