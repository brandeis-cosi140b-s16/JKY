Finally found the spot for street tacos. Been here twice in two days. The chicharon tacos are amazing the carnitas burrito is loaded with meat and beans. Barbacoa tacos are so juicy and full of flavor. Feels like I'm in Cali eating at tacos trucks in East La or Santa Ana. Great place for some late night munchies and you can pick up some boot leg DVDs
