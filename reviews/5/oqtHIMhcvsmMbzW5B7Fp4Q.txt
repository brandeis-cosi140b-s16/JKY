We found the Corn Flower when we needed catering on short notice. The owner took all the time we needed to taste and select our choices. We've gone back for the amazing burritos and empanadas. The homemade salsa choices are amazing, and don't leave without trying the chili soup!  Awesome food and even better service. Skip the fast food Mexican because this is cheaper and much better!
