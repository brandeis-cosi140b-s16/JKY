1st of all, best bean dip ever. You can get endless bowles of bead dip and salsa w/chips for just ordering a margarita. 
After ordering the fajitas a few times, I switched to the pollo special on the specials menu. It comes with tortillas and happens to be a better flavor recipe than the fajitas. 
The fried ice cream is delicious too. 
Its a great place for groups and parties.
