This is my fav Mex restaurant outside of Mexico. Maria and Mark are wonderful hosts who always remember my friend and me. Mark's margaritas are the best. Maria is truly a gourmet cook. IMHO, her mole sauce is the best ever (Mexico included). Chicken mole enchiladas are my HG. Don't know how she gets the chicken so tender. 

This is not a chain restaurant. No one is rushing you or pushing you to rack up your tab. It's tucked away on the SW corner next to the closed down AJs, so a little out of the way. But if you're looking for an authentic experience, give them a try.
