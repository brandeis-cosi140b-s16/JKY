This is one of my favorite restaurants that I crave if I have not been in over a week. The staff is always friendly. I love that they have a punch card. The food is fresh and delicious. I usually attend with my bestie who also loves this place. I have the chicken burrito and it comes with fresh chips and salsa that is so yummy. The price is just right. It can get busy during lunch but that is to be expected with a good place. The environment is open but they also have a nice patio area. Now I am craving it so I will have to go tomorrow. :)
