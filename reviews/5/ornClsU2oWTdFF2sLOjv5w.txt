5 star on taste, flavor and authenticity. Generous portions

4 star on staff-friendly but lacking something
 Can't quiet put my finger on it

3 star on the location. The restaurant needs a face lift 

Aguachiles  Verde's de camaron y pulpo (shrimp/octopus) -are very spicy be prepared to dunk your tongue in a big glass of Horchata . I supposed you can ask for them less spicy but then how are you living on the edge? 

Shrimp Ceviche - are very fresh. Good flavor

Oysters- meaty. were fresh and very clean But needed some chilling. Make sure to ask for them extra cold. Ask them to  serve it over ice cubes

Pacifico Mucheladas are a MUST. One of the very few places that I can say that they know what they are doing. Perrrrrfection


Horchata- is good. Not too sweet.
