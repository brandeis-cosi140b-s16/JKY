As soon I walked up the service was so friendly and the place was so colorful. We sat down and Dana was our waitress she had so much energy and was friendly helpful right off the bat. The drinks were tasty and the food was pretty amazing . I had the chicken fajitas . The hand made corn tortillas were so warm and dele icon the chicken was lean and soft. I think the highlight was desert , ordered the churros! Amazing cream filled churros served with warm rich chocolate and caramel! Amazing place it's a must visit every time I come to Vegas
