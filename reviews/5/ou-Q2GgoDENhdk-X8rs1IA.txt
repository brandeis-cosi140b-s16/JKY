I have only occasionally bought groceries here, but oh my god, the taco stand outside is AMAZING. Yeah, the guy doesn't wear gloves and he handles money and food with the same glove-less hands, but frankly, who cares? I haven't been adventurous enough to try the lengua, but I really enjoy the chicken, mostly because it doesn't compete with the awesome flavors of the seasoning (never underestimate the power of salt, pepper, and lime juice) and the cilantro and the salsa and the cheese and ahhhhh;lsiuoietkhdfkljhdlkfhlk. I am starving just thinking about it. Go. You won't regret it.
