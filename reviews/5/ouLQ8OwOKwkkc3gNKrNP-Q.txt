I have eaten here twice, well actually I ate inside once and took an order to go once. Both times the food was equally delicious, the first time getting a burrito and the second getting the nachos; one person I dined with had enchiladas, another had tacos, and the other had a taco salad - every person only had great things to say about the food. Beyond that, the service was perfect, we sat in the cantina area to watch MNF and the staff was attentive without being annoying, every request was met quickly with a smile.  If you have a chance to sit and eat here or to take it to go, do it!
