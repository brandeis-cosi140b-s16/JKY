I went to Old Town Scottsdale during my very first break from medical school.  I'd heard Scottsdale was a cool place, and not being a native of the area, I desperately wanted to explore somewhere outside Glendale.  I'm so glad we happened to find this place!

The building itself is unobtrusive.  Quietly sitting a block off the main drag.  It really belies the beauty of the interior.  I was really impressed by the dimly lit interior.  Even if the place was full (it wasn't when we were there) I still think the sense of intimacy at each table would be pretty well preserved.  It's kind of like how people are just automatically quieter in churches.

Then, the really impressive part began: the food!  Mexican-ish.  Fusion, it might be called.  Our incredibly friendly server, Nick, came over and regaled us about the place.  My gf and I each ordered a glass of wine from their nicely stocked wine list and some guacamole.  Turned out, we were in for a real treat.  It's made fresh.  At your table.  And it was divine.  Our entrees were equally impressive.  My pork shoulder and chorizo with white truffle potatoes was easily the best pork dish I've yet had.  When the meal was done and we finally left, it was with the throughout sense of satisfaction you get from a truly impressive dining experience.
