LOVE this place. Don't let its small size or hole-in-the-wall style intimidate you. Their steak burritos are the best in town (in my opinion). Great value (burrito and chips are under $6) when weighting portions, price, and quality. And you get fresh, warm, homemade chips and their own unique salsa free with every burrito order. Their service is quick and their staff is friendly. 

Townies know to call ahead and order your food if you are going to do takeout. Then when you get there you can just walk right in, pay, and leave! If your in Chambana and havent tried this place you are missing out!
