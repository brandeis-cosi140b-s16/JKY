I love Qdoba I go here every weekend have a Member card etc. Many people think of this as the same thing as Chipotle they are very similar except I here they have a bit more choices I believe. I used to go to Chipotle a lot but once I found this place this is all I ever go to. Best thing about this place is the Queso Burrito. Best thing on the menu.

 Also when I ask for a side of rice they give me a nice cup of rice on the side for like .80 cents unlike Chipotle when I asked for a side of rice they give me this little "shot glass" sized plastic cup of rice and expect me to pay 1.35 or something like that. 

Now I won't say that this place is authentic mexican food but hey it's good food. I'm sure you can find some authentic mexican place if you want that but this place has its own menu and its own flavor. Definately a place you should try out and see for yourself.

I am a regular at the Rural Rd location and love the people there. They are nice and friendly and since I always have a hard time deciding they give me some pushes in the right direction to get me to decide. ;P The place is always clean and have never had a problem here.
