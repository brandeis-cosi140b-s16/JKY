I was born and raised in Colorado and El Burrito Loco comes as close to good Mexican west of the Platte as you can get. My wife and I have been three times now with three different dishes each and thoroughly enjoyed it every time.

El Burrito started out as a State Street family owned food wagon and progress to its current Middleton location. The folks running the place are delightful, funny and friendly. All the sauces are homemade and delicious. Tonight I had their Friday night fish tacos and loved them.

Being in the restaurant business is tough and particularly so in the Madison area. Give this place a try. They deserve the chance to become even more successful.
