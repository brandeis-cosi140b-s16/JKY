The only way I can describe my experience is its as if your Nana or your friend's Nana cooked a homemade meal and you were lucky enough to be over that day.

-Homemade, perfectly salted, good textures, deep and spicy flavors, and HOMEMADE!

-I had the bowl of Chimaya Red Chile (PICTURED), in which you choose whether you want ground beef, chicken, or carne asada meat a lil different to have the option than the red chile with beef we are all used to.  I chose carne asada and it was greatness.  It came out with an extra large flour tortilla in a tortilla warmer just like at yo Nana's, good homemade pinto beans (not refried), thicker tomatoey tasty spanish rice, and the bowl of chile was bigger than my face and filled to the brim.  I swear it had to have had more than 2 cups in there.  

-The best part was that the chile was perfectly seasoned, slightly smokey, slightly spicy and had the most meat I have ever seen in a red chile.  Aside from having such a great quantity of meat, the meat was so moist it tasted as if it had actually been in the chile for some time when we all know it hadn't been since they make the bowl to order.

-The man had the 2 taco combo.  You also have the choice of meat with this dish.  He also chose Carne Asada.  He said it was very tasty, moist carne asada in perfectly hand-fried shells.  He enjoyed the beans and rice as well so we have no idea wtf the previous reviewers were talking about the rice and beans being bland.  It was obvious the recipes used to concoct the rice/beans were Gil's own and again delicious at that.

-Chips are the thick, just-cut corn tortillas then fried to a perfect crispness and salted generously.

-Green salsa was okay but red salsa was thick and hotsaucy and had a very good spicy.

-Sopaipillas were perfect.  Light, airy, crisp outside, pillowy soft inside.  Served with a bowl of honey and YES a honey dipper (PICTURED) just like your Nana had in her kitchen for all those sopaipillas she made you.

I know 5 stars for one visit is a bit extreme but seriously every thing there is so homey tasting I am completely ignoring the fact that the atmosphere is lacking (think you are eating at Nana's and she's watching TV and only you and your friend are the only ones eating in the kitchen at 8pm haha), and the fact that they serve the 12oz bottles of Coke products for drinks..but you CAN BYOB I saw a couple walk in with their brown bags consisting of a Corona tall bottle and a premixed Margarita bottle.  

ANYWAYs ignore what I just said in the last paragraph and only remember what I said about the food.  

Please go here ONLY for the food and for the fact that I don't want this gem to close down from the lack of knowledge about this place's goodness before I have a chance to get back there!  GO here for the FOODS!
