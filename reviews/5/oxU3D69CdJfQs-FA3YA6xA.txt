This place is amazing! My Husband used to get burritos from here all the time but I never wanted to try it. I am not big on authentic mexican food. I gave in one day and ordered 3 rolled tacos with cheese and sour cream....OMG! They are absolutely delicious! I actually became addicted to them and I have them as often as I can. This is really the best mexican food I have ever had.
