I absolutely love this place!!! The food is authentic not to mention it taste outstanding!!!

The staff is somewhat bilingual but speak enough English to get your order, lol which I love practicing Spanish with them. 

Sometimes the service is slow but it's well worth it because the prices are more than reasonable for the amount of food that you receive and the margaritas are very good.
