Mi Pueblo is a great mexican restaurant - it has the traditional dishes but also new innovative dishes that are great!

My boyfriend and I came and ate at the bar. The service was great and the Maestro margaritas was well-crafted and reasonably priced. 

We had the new Dos Equis fish tacos and the guaca chicken. The fish tacos are made with haddock instead of tilapia which makes for a flaky tender taco that has a burst of flavor thanks to the Chipotle sauce. The guaca chicken is tender and full of flavor which we loved.

Overall Mi Pueblo is a great place to eat for a reasonable price and good food.
