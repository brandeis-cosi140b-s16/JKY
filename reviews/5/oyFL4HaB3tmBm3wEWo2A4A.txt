Visiting from CO and was on the hunt for locally owned and good food.  This place did not disappoint!  The Cadillac Margarita was excellent as well as the food!  The waitress was cheerful and patient with us and our ability to order in Spanish.  Very clean establishment!  We will definitely return again!
