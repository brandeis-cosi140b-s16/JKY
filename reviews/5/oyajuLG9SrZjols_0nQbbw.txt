Jordan's is a central Phoenix classic. Owned by the same family for generations and serving local families that have been coming for generations, as well. The service is quick and friendly. They have the best cheese crisp in town and they serve a butter crisp that is totally addictive! (Not sure if it is listed on the menu though) My kids love the sour cream enchiladas!! I love the red chili and I won't even order it anywhere else because it never compares. 
It has an old school comfortable feel w the big booths and dim light. The dress is totally casual but you'll def see cute older couples w/ their "fancy shirts" on for their night out.  I totally recommend going ;)
