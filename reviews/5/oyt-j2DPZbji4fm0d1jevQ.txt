Read all the other reviews and decided since it was close to home we would try it. Walking in and seeing it packed was certainly a good sign.  We were seated shortly after arriving and frankly it was a great place to have dinner.  We had two of the ceviches which were both delicious.  I had the carne asada  and the shrimp tacos which were also delicious.    My wife had the kale salad which was different than any other kale salad she had ever ordered.  The good news is that it tasted great and she was quite pleased.   The food was prepared quickly, the server was lovely and quite helpful with suggestions.   We will be back soon.
