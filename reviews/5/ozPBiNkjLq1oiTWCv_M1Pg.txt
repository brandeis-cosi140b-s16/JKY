Restaurant review:
Simply delicious. Yelp was spot on that this location has likely the freshest high quality mexican food that may top the best in the US. It was so busy 30 minutes into opening that we had to take our food to go. There is a wide selection of authentic mexican dishes. I ended up with a selection of tacos (steak, pork, and carnitas). Although they were soggy by the time I got home, the ingredients were so fresh and the flavor was perfect. Not too salty and rich in flavor. The prices are perfect a lot cheaper than Rick Bayless Xoco. I just wish it was easier to find parking or even space to eat in. You get chips and 2 types of salsa for free as well even if you are getting carry out. I was surprised I only got 1 bag even with four entrees. I will have to make sure I ask for more next time. Overall this is probably the best mexican restaurant I have ever been to

Pro: delicious mexican authentic and fresh 

Cons: very small parking lot and equally small dining area

Hidden gem:
Free salsa and chips
