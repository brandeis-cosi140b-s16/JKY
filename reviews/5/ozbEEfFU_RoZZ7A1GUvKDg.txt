Went there last weekend with the family it was awesome !not only is the food amazing the staff was great in making sure we were comfortable   We wanted to sit outside so we choose the couches and after the food came  we decided it would be more comfortable  on a table with the five of us so our waiter cleaned and set up a table for us  in seconds and then moved everything over . they gave the kids these wiki sticks  along with there crayons and coloring pages which was amazing because it kept my little ones busy .  I will defiantly be back there again
