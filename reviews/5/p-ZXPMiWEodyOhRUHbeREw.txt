Not sure why I have not reviewed Manuel's. We have been eating with them for the past  maybe10 or more years. We eat there at least once or twice a month. Why do we keep returning?
1. They are always very nice and make you feel they are glad you are there.
2. The food is good and you always get more than you should eat at one sitting.( We always take food home with us. 
3. The food is priced reasonably. 
4. They are a neighbor hood family owned business and I always try to support this type of business. 
5. There is something on the menu for all tastes. (Some people that go with us like hamburgers.)
When we go there is usually at least 6 people in our group. No one has ever complained about the quality of food. It has always been good. 
They have always treat us as a valued customer. I often recommend Manuel's to other people.
