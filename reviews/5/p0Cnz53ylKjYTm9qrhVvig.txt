Been there several times and the food is authentic Mexican.  It is family owned/run restaurant. Soups are exceptional.  Owner will make tortilla fresh if you ask. Everything we've eaten have great homemade favor, portions are large, and they will make your meal hot or middle, just. Oh, prices are very reasonable.   Can't beat that! We'll be back many times.
