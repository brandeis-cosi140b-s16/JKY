Excellent shrimp tacos!  However the gentleman behind the counter who is the Gringo who speaks Spanish to the staff. Your customer service is flawless but your tone and delivery to your staff is condescending and rude in Spanish, and believe me they notice it!  Be warned, there are other Gringos who are bilingual like myself (interpreter/translator).  Use of the reflexive command form in Spanish is dangerous!  It can make you sound like you are yelling or treating people like dogs if you are not careful
