As many times as I catch myself coming here, I must be honorable and upgrade to five stars. Plus, I sort of want to go Esther Williams in their menudo. YUM!!!!! 

This is a good neighborhood spot, and it's location is perfect for those dizzy-days-takeout-required kind of suppers. I ordered the beef tacos, and they were respectable and good! This is a clean, no-frills store front, and the service is efficient, which is perfect for that witching hour right after a frenzied work day when I am craving crispy, savory, tacos like a baby to a pacifier. There isn't anything to distinguish this place from competitors, and that's probably my only complaint. It's just not distinct to stand out.
