Pretty awesome set up they have over here. They only have chicken or steak tacos and that is a good thing. They are great and the tortillas are like nothing I've had [I had corn]. The tortillas did not fall apart or dry or any of the negatives that go with corn. 

This place is great for a quick bite or take it back to the office for lunch. Fast and they were very nice. Most authentic place for this area, too.

Hope you try it!
