Probably one of the best places I've tried guac in the downtown area. 
I already like the vibe after the hostel take over from the previous tenets. I am sure they didn't even change the alcohol from the shelves after The Local left.

One of my favorite places downtown is now this place. I hope for a long and healthy stay for Paz.

NOte: Don't get rid of Connie Hottie. ;)
