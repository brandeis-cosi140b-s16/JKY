Okay, if you like Mexican food, chances are you have at least tried Chipotle.  If you like Mexican food and need it to be gluten-free, it is almost a sure thing.  All Chipotle restaurants are very similar and I must admit I have never had a bad experience in all the many stores in three states that I have visited.  But, I wanted to yelp about this location in particular.

As one of the other reviewers points out, it is open when a lot of other places downtown are closed.  That alone earns it a star.  But, what really sets this location apart are the people.  The manager, Paul, and his Apprentice, Adriana, are as nice as can be and everyone else follows their example.  They always greet customers with a hello and a smile.  The place is well-run and everyone is friendly and polite.  I like Chipotle, but I also really like these people.

Granted, I mostly see the store during the middle of the day and I usually avoid the rush hour.  I notice that some of the reviews were given not too long after the location opened up.  I think that those reviewers would have a different experience were they to go back today.

So, three stars for the food and one big star for the people.
