Ok so ive been craving Mexican tacos for some time now. So while out running to the neighborhood store  I smell some awesome food. I didn't know what it was and asked the cashier. He said it's probably that Mexican restaurant a few blocks up. What???? I pull in and instantly know that, yes this is what I've been smelling. I order 3 shredded pork tacos with avocado. After dressing my tacos with alittle salt, jalape√±o sauce, a squeeze of lime and add my radishes. I took my first bite and started singing.....Sir Mix a Lot/ Nikki Manji  remix OH MY GOD....Becky  Lmao I'm through lol #authenictacos #whyhaventibeenherebefore
