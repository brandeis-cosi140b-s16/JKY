The food was so delicious...I couldn't stop eating it. There was no table conversation because everyone was so busy eating. We had a family style meal...the asada was so good, probably my favorite, but the pastor went the fastest at our table. All the salsas you could choose from made each taco different and exciting. The next time I'm in Arizona I will come back!!!
