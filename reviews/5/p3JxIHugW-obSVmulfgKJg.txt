Best street tacos in Vegas. Possibly the best I have ever had and I buy them on the streets of Mexico. The asada, buche, cabeza, & spicy pork were great. They are small and cost about $2 each. Sopes, tostadas, mules, quesadillas, french fries disguised as nachos are also available.  

The lines are inefficient. Each type of meat has its own line. Not great if you go alone. A group that splits up works best. 

This place is EXTREMELY loud. It's in Vegas on the strip so most patrons will be intoxicated. 

The flavor was great. I recommend it.
