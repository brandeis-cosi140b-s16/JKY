Came here for Taco Tuesday and went through the drive thru here, area not too great but the lady with the ombre hair who took my order was very polite. I order 3 rolled tacos with guacamole and she even asked if  I wanted to add cheese for no extra cost. Got home and ate and the food was absolutely amazing. My Taco Tuesday was completely satisfied will definitely be going back!!
