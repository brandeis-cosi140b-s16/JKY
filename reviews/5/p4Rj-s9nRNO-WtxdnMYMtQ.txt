First of all, it takes a LOT to impress my wife and i when it comes to "Mexican"
cuisine. Several of our friends own and run world class Mexican restaurants in Aspen,CO as well as Los Angeles; However... we were BLOWN AWAY by El Dorado!!

When we first arrived at the address we thought we were lost as the address for
the restaurant is identical with SAPHIRE MEN'S CLUB?.. Go figure. Well we realized the restaurant is hidden at the Saphire entrance, and so, here we where.

As we approached the front doors for El Dorado,  we where met with the warm
smile of Arianna --- who turned out to be the restaurant GM.  Her warmth and
sincerity were genuine as i commented to my wife - "She loves her job";

The food -- I had the Fajitas with shrimp and beef and it was exquisite.  The only place i ever had shrimp this fresh was in the Gulf of Mexico. The sauces where
exactly what you would encounter at a world class restaurant in Mexico City, yet
very home cooking style and unpretentious.The refried beans,  hot sauces (watch out for the HABENERO!!!) and garnishes all appropriate and  not your usual same old same.

My wife had the conchinita pibil and it was the best either of us ever had.
Also, the drinks were like you would pore at home -- not some watered down
tourist trap ripoff.

Two other mentions --  Chef Paco came over and introduced himself -- total class act.  He had us try the flan  -- the recipe has been in his family 80 years.  No BS --
ive had lots of flan in my time, but this was thick and creamy beyond compare.

And lastly, James -- bartender , took us around the bar and showed us some rare
tequilas in display cases.  Our advice -- dont waste your time elsewhere -- the price is way worth it!
