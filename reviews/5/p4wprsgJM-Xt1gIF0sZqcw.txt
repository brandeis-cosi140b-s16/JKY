Living in Arizona You would think that there be more places like this.   Unfortunately NOT.  So when you stumble into a place like this you feel as if you found heaven. 

Well maybe wrestling and taco heaven.  First thing you see  is the decor.  I loved it, as a kid I was a big wrestling fan. My grandma used to take me to all these matches and right away that brought me back in time.  But enough with the time machine.  How were the tacos??

OMG. Delicious.  They gave us samples of every meat, and they were off the chain. I'm not a spicy guy but even their spicy stuff had flavor. A lot of times is a contest to how hot you can eat. These meats use spice as a flavor kick.  I was very Impressed. One of the owners that served us was really helpful and friendly.  

Take the time machine back to RC cola. That was a nice thing as well. Rare find.  

I will certainly be coming back even though is 40 minutes away from my house.  It's a great day in the neighborhood.
