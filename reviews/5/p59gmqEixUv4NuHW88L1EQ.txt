My husband and I tried out La Fiesta Grande last night for dinner, and we weren't disappointed!  We were greeted and seated immediately, and the service was very timely.  Our waitress was very nice and friendly.  We got a pitcher of margaritas, which were delicious--not too sweet/syrupy!  He got enchiladas and I got a taco--both were fresh and scrumptous.  I really appreciated being able to order just one taco (plus rice and beans), since most restaurants require you to get 3 or more per meal.  (NOTE: you can order three tacos as well!)

Basically: the food was fresh and tasty, the service was friendly and tasteful, the restaurant itself is clean and beautifully decorated.  We will be back!
