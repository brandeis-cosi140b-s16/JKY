Don Jose's was in business for over 41 years.  A young man had a dream to open a restruant with good, consistent and affordable mexican food where families could come and enjoy a delicious meal with-out breaking their bank.  And that is just what Joe Elias did.  Yes, the food was always excellent.  The service was good, because you were dealing with the owner himself, or one of his daughter's or son.  The decor, was well, second in his mind.  Don Jose knew you came for the food, and not the frills of fake flowers etc.  Don Jose did what he could to keep the costs down, so that you could keep eating great food--several times a week if you wanted.
Today, Don Jose is well into a retirement age.  He vacations in cooler places when he can.  He relaxes more, and worries less, but he still thinks of you, and he wants you to know how very grateful he is that you appreciated what he did, and why he did it.  You were all his family.  I know how to get that great enchilada sauce. If you are interested, Drop a note under the now closed door, and someone will contact you.
