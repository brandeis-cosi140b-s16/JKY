My fiance and I started going to Amado's after our favorite Filiberto's went down hill. 
This location has amazing food, good prices, and very courteous staff. We are lucky that this place exists, it is a far greater representation of Mexican food than any Filiberto's could hope to be. 
What once was Fili-Friday for us is now Amado's Friday!
