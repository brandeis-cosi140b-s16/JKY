There is a very good reason that there is always a wait and the parking lot is always full! My husband and I went and starting with the chips and salsa, the chips are great and salsa is very tasty! We each ordered a fundido, one pollo, one steak. Both amazing!!! Service was great, they notice empty glasses and are not stingy with the chips. I definitely recommend this location!!! :)
