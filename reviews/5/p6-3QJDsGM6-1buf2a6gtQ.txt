Skip Filibertos and all other -"bertos" for that matter. Next time you are in the mood for good, authentic mexican tacos go there! Their meat is tender and tasty. There is a small salsa bar that in my opinion could use some beans to complete the meal. But maybe thats just me. The salsas are good and the restaurant is clean. Only one restroom for both males and females. The staff is friendly, short wait time, the menu is affordable and they have indoors/outdoor seating. There is no Koala-care station for babies. But the food is amazing, I promise.
