What can I say that hasn't already been said?  
They weren't lying when they named it a hideaway.  I never would have known about it had an old roommate not taken me for lunch one day.  And now, it's my boyfriend's and my go-to spot.  My favorite is the chile rellenos (duck and pork with green sauce), although my boyfriend gets something different every time and is never disappointed.  The chiles are always spicy which I LOVE because nothing is ever spicy to me and this is one of the few places that has been able to make me reach for a glass of water.  
It's a cozy place that almost reminds me of the inside of a hunting cabin that's been decorated up for fine dining.  They have a decent selection of wines and other bar items.  As far as seating goes, expect to wait for a bit unless you get lucky because it's a tiny "dining room".  
All I can say is, "Go eat there!"  It's really amazing food and a really unique atmosphere.  Definitely worth the hunt.
