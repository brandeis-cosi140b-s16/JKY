**First of all, this restaurant is not traditional Mexican cuisine.  They offer a combination of Mayan and Aztec flavors and dishes, which I have to say, makes for some delicious offerings.**

I am a native Texan (meaning I hold Mexican food near and dear to my heart), and since moving to the Scottsdale area 5 months ago, I have been searching far and wide for a "Mexican" restaurant that I can claim as my go to spot.  Now granted, Caldero may not be "Mexican" cuisine by traditional standards, but no matter, because my boyfriend and I have claimed this restaurant as "our place", meaning we are planning on becoming regulars at Caldero.  

We have been there twice within the last week, sitting at the bar both times because the owners, Ricardo and Julia, are both inviting and fun to talk to.  Both times we have indulged in the Calderita cocktail, a margarita made from tropical fruit juices with just a hint of habanero.  It's sweet and spicy and oh, so good!  We have also been unable to resist their Toritos, wax peppers that have been stuffed with shrimp and cheese, wrapped in bacon, fried and served in a pool of a spicy chipotle sauce and a heavenly beurre blanc.  These are seriously one of the best things I have ever tasted in my life!  No exaggeration.  My boyfriend and I have both woke up thinking about them almost on a daily basis since first trying them.  They will definitely be a staple every time we return to this new, surprisingly superb restaurant.   I want to urge everyone to give it a try because it is definitely worth it!
