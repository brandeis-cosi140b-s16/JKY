There are SO many restaurants to chose from on or near the Las Vegas strip, but none will give you as much ethnic dining authenticity- especially at a good value- as Tacos El Gordo!  Just like Abuelita used to make!  The only problem with this place is that they don't serve beer.  Anywhere else in the world, this would cost a taco shop a star in my book, but in Vegas, it's almost a welcome break!  
No need to repeat what others have said in detail: it's clean, it's friendly, it's fast, it's relatively inexpensive, and it's delicious!
