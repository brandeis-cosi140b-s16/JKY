What a gem!  The Chupale Pichon is $6 for a grilled footlong hotdog topped with grilled onions and red peppers, bacon, chili, and cheese, plus a side of fries and jalapenos.  Washed it down with alfalfa agua fresca.  Have you ever had Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans and wished there were real "grass" flavored candy in the world?  TA-DA!  :-D

The staff was super friendly and patient explaining what the menu items contain.  I'm a pretty worldly eater, but there were colorful treats I had never heard of - and I can't wait to go back and try them all.

My friends had the Tostilocos and loved it, but I'm not a fan of pickled pork.  I tried another friend's Cemita sandwich filled with carne asada, avocado, and melty cheese in a toasted sesame bun.  Their son had the $2 nachos and a Mexican Coke and was happy.

There were easily 50 people who came through while I sat in the corner with my laptop for a couple hours - mostly Mexican families getting ice cream and shaved ice.  It's out of the way for me, but I'll swing by any time I'm in the Northeast.
