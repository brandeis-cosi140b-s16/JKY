I had been to Fuego Bistro before and really enjoyed it.  So I was really looking forward to trying Fuego Cityscape with a Groupon I had bought.  The food is absolutely delicious! I had the Pernil Torta with the Sweet Potato fries, the meet was soo amazing, completely melt in your mouth and paired with the cabbage it was to die for.  My friend had the quesadilla with Carne Asada, he said it was very good.  We also had the Key Lime Pie for dessert and it was awesome, I love key lime anything and this did not dissapoint, definitely one of the best key lime things I've had. I also had the Prickly Pear Mojito which was a beautiful pinkish/purplish color.  I enjoyed it very much.

Sam was our waiter and he was fantastic.  He was getting ready for a table of 9 and he still managed to keep us and everyone else extremely happy.  I was very impressed with his friendliness and expediting to make sure everyone had drinks and there food when it came out.  I can't wait to go back again!
