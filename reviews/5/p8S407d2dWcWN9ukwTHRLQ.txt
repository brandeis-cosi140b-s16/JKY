This is my favorite Mexican restaurant in the Madison area. Everything we ordered was so wonderful and flavorful.  The appetizer Quesadillas de Rajas y Queso were real eye openers and delicious, unlike anything I'd had before. My stuffed pepper was so full of flavor and nicely presented. My wife's carne asada was  tender and spiced perfectly. The dessert, platanos con cajetas, made our eyes roll back in our heads: exotic and like a revelation. Our waitress knew the menu so well and was eager to tell us all about each item we were interested in.  The staff are welcoming and the ambiance is cheery. Try it!
