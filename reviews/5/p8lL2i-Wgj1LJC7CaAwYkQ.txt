I was very reluctant to come to this place due to the almost all horrible reviews. We got a $10 coupon in the mail so figured ok what the heck let's try it. Surprisingly the atmosphere was fantastic the food was great and the service was incredible. My fianc√© and I both ordered the chicken fajita quesadilla and cheese dip that's was very delicious. Our server was Lucia and she truly gave good customer service. I have worked in hospitality for 7 years so I know what it takes.
