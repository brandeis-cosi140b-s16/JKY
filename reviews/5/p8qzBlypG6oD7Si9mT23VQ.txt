Really great food for an even greater price! Food came out quick and was delicious!! Cute restaurant that's as authentic as it gets :) manager was super friendly as well! He had a ghost chili/Trinidad scorpion pepper extract that was a sort of challenge, and one toothpick tip dipped in it had me in intense pain but I won a bet with my friends! Was pretty neat and do the challenge at your own discretion :) definitely gonna come back again! Would recommend!
