Authentic!!!! Its the real deal! The chips and salsa...ORDER IT - a MUST HAVE! The only thing I wished for was a Corona beer to drink with it...but I was happy with the fresh cold jamaica.Great flavor...great service... VERY good local food...not fancy..but definitely worth the stop! The breakfast burritos are great as were the carnitas...! Will definitely be back!
