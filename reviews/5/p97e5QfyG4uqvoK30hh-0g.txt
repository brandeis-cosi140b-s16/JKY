Im here on a business trip from California and default to Yelp as hunger savior. I found Mariscos Playa Hermosa based off my location and yelp reviews. 

I walked in and there were only 4 other people eating,  then again it was only 6pm. I was greeted by a friendly gal.

I picked my own seat and immediately was offered a drink.  I got agua de  Jamaica which was perfect not too sweet. I was brought chips and salsa a few minutes later. There were 2 salsas, an avocado salsa and a red salsa. The avocado one was perfect,  the red was great but OH EM GEE my mouth was on fire. I love hot sauce, but this for sure was blazing! 


I really wanted shrimp and asked for recommendations.  I was recommended the bacon wrapped shrimp but decided not too because I'd feel guilty of it being too fatty. I then was recommended the A ala diabla shrimp. I usually love spicy shrimp, but at this point my mouth was on fire from the salsa.....sooo i got it anyway. Why not? 


 My plate arrived with about 6 shrimp and tons of sauce with rice beans and sode salad.  The beans and rice were great, but holy moly the shrimp were BLAZING SPICY holy moly. They were still good.

Overall, the service and food was great. I will def come back on my next visit.
