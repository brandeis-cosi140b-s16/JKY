My favorite breakfast burrito in town...  Fausto's is good, but when you want green chili sauce, Carlito's is your place!  For cheap$$, they will smother anything you order in the green chili if you want, and I always want!  It seemed extra spicy this morning which was perfect, but I could only eat half.  The other half will be in the toaster oven later and will still be delicious.  Sunday is 2 for 1 breakfast burrito's all day. Too early for the $1 beer special, but I have taken advantage of that before as well.   If not a breakfast burrito, then the carne adovada with the calabacitas is my go to burrito... smothered of course.   And when I want to go low carb, they do it in a bowl and it is fantastic.  They usually have a line  but it moves fairly quick and is worth the wait.
