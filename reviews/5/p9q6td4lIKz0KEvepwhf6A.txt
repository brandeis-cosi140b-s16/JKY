I was realllllly craving horchata and was phyched to be in the area, so I did a quick run in to go order at lunch time on a week day.  I was impressed with how they handled the crowd, they had a flow.  I also ordered some al pastor tacos, while waiting I filled some to go cup from their salsa bar, then waited at the bar. They gave me water and were very friendly even while busy as can be.  When I left and dug in to my al pastor I was sooooo impressed.  It was tied with the best I have ever had.  So amazing! Street tacos are the way to go!  I won't wait so long to come back next time!
