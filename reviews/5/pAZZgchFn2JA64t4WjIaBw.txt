I just spent a month overseas travelling in the middle east where, to my dismay, Mexican food is not popular. I turned over every rock and stone, in hunt for carne asada, fajitas, even a mere pablano pepper. Unfortunately, my search was unsuccessful and I craved a delicious, authentic cantina style feast. As soon as I retuned to my home in Vegas, my friends told me about this place and we made reservations. Upon ordering, Amber was there to answer any inquiries of the large menu. She quickly brought chips and three tasty salsas. We were extremely impressed with her impeccable service and kindness. She made us fresh guacamole at our table, the best in Las Vegas. I ordered carne asada tacos with black beans and cilantro rice. It was robust in flavor, and the steak cooked perfectly. My craving for authentic cantina style food was quenched. Then, we learned of we check in to yelp, Executive Chef Paco will serve us flan. He shared with us that it's his grandmother's recipe. Chef Paco, thank you for working so hard to bring Las Vegas the BEST gourmet Mexican food. Your dedication and warm hearted greeting left us with the best impression and first recommendation of El Dorado Cantina.
