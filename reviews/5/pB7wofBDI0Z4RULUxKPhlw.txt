We love this place!  Every time  we come here we have to stop.  The brunch is the best I have ever had.  We were probably here for 2 hrs and never once felt pressured to leave.  Our waitresses was fantastic.   She helped with the selection of dishes and I felt she was on the mark for all her suggestions.  We had bottomless mimosas.   I am behind on writing this review.   We were in vegas at the 1st of the month.   I asked our waitresses to write her name down and then I washed my jeans with the paper in them. :(  I believe it was Camber.   I also spoke with the manager on duty when I left and told them what a great time we had and how awesome she was.  Get the shrimp and grits, corn tamale, oysters Rockefeller, & the French Toast! I loved the chicken more than the waffle.  We will be back!
