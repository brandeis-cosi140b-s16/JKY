OMG!!! BEST TACOS IN TOWN!!!  Located in the barrio, where all good Mexican food is made, this place knows how to make tacos!!!  Everything is made fresh and so delicious. Joytaco and America Tacos don't know tacos like Kiss Pollos.  Prices are right, food is made fresh and I'm sure glad I found this place. Will be here a lot more and can't wait to bring the family.
