You want a fantastic breakfast with a southwestern twist?  You found it.

My favorites are the enchiladas and eggs with pork green chili. Or the green chili meatloaf and eggs.  Or the tenderloin benedict with jalapeno hollandaise!  It's really just hard to go wrong here.

A bit tricky to find as there is no sign but take the time and hunt it down I promise you'll love it!
