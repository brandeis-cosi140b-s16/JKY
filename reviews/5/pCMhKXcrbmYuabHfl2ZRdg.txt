Very good food and you could not ask for a more fun environment. We have a lot of Mexican food in Mesa and this is by far the best!  Try the salmon enchiladas or the seafood tacos...WOW! You also can't go wrong with their mole sauce! They also have a killer vanilla bean ice cream with actual vanilla beans! So good..I'm getting hungry just writing about it. GO THERE! :)
