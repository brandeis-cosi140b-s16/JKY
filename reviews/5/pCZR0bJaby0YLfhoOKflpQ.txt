One of the most authentic Mexican food I've tasted in Champaign. This place is not a fancy restaurant, it's just a place to eat and chill. Dips and tortilla chips were just lovely. I love how they come in such huge "bottles" and you can pour yourselves as much as you need. Food was delicious. I had a burrito with mole sauce. Honestly, the mole sauce was not enough. I'd love to have more of it flooding my burrito and not just trickles of it. It could be a little sweeter but I believe that's just my preference. As price and portion go, I would say they are average. Not too expensive, just the right amount with an average price ($$). But quality and taste were on point for Champaign.
