Oh wow!  Drove by and circled back to try it out. Don't drive by. GO!  The tacos are unique in creation and packed with flavor. I tried the shrimp, pork belly, carne asada and barbacoa tacos. I could eat them all night. Brea behind the bar makes the best Sangria I've ever had, anywhere. The place is decorated nicely and has both indoor/outdoor seating. The bar is large and has TVs to watch. Private booths and tables for ample seating.
