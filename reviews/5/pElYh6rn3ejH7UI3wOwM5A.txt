Went today for my third time for lunch. I have to say each time better than the previous visit. Shrimp dishes are so good as well as beans salsa and rice.  Has made my lunch rotation for Mexican  downtown which is a big deal as I have been doing lunch for 10 years downtown.  Try it will not disappoint.
