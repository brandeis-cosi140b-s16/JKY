I must say, this gem of a restaurant is hidden away in a strip mall, but don't let that deter you.  Upon entering we were greeted by the sweetest young man.  Within a minute our drink order was taken and were quickly brought out.  Our waitress was helpful with telling us about the special and her favorite dishes.  My husband ordered a combo plate with a taco and an enchilada. He said the ground beef taco was okay but the enchilada was out of this world. I myself enjoyed the enchilada de Mole.  Well I have had mole a sauce before this was delicious. It was advertised as spicy but I did not find it was overly spicy just extremely tasty.
They also serve authentic Mexican breakfast if anyone is interested it looks delicious. I will be trying that very soon.
Can't say it enough for the service and the environment. The restaurant is absolutely adorable inside
