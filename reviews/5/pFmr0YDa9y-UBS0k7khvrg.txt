I've been tracking Braddah's since the opening of their first restaurant and am delighted to have visited their 3rd location today with a 4th on the horizon. The service line is easy to follow, the dining room warm and inviting - a little bit of Hawaii in the desert is a fun thing! Most importantly...the food. It was FANTASTIC and my only complaint is I don't live locally to be able to come here every time a craving strikes, which is often. The Kalua Pig and grilled fish are family favorites, but everything is fresh and delicious. I love crispy tacos and to have an option that includes hand fried shells...it is indeed a moment of perfection in my day. Don't forget to take home a 1-lb box of Coconut Bark with you and make it last, because you will miss it when it is gone. Finally, be prepared to be embraced like ohana - family - as the team here genuinely cares that you have a great meal and enjoy your food. Clearly, I can't say enough wonderful things about Braddah's, so get down here and fall in love for yourself...mahalo!
