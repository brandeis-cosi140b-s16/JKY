A lifetime search for amazing Mexican food and I have finally found it. I found this place by accident when I needed to have my car window tinted and I was reluctant to try another Mexican store front but decided to give it a shot. 

I ordered the number 4 which includes a Gordita and Taco. Everything from the rice, beans, salsa, Tortillas, meat and even the jalape√±o was to die for. The best of the best. 

The only thing I would change is the chips. They looked like they came out of a bag but other than that...Everything is O-amazing. Will be back to visit again.
