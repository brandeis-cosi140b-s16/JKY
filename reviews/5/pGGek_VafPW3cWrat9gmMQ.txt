Walked in during the Tempa Arts Festival. The restaurant was crowded so went to the bar to sit down and eat, the bartender was very helpful. I noticed a flight of margaritas to try and told the bartender to pick, she did and great job and they really packed a wallop(they don't short change you on the amount of tequila). She brought over a pan of corn bread that was absolutely delicious with juices pieces of corn mixed in. We shared a the Chicken Enchilada and the steak tacos, both were flavorful and delicious and nicely proportioned. Love to go back and try more food. What a great find and the prices were very reasonable. The decor was warm and friendly and the staff was very helpful also.
