Always enjoy Baja Fresh. Good menu and the food is freshly prepared. I usually always get the Baja Steak Burrito but the tacos, salads and rest of the menu are equally good.
The salsa bar is great, they have a nice choice of freshly prepared salsa for topping off your meal. I like that you get a small side of chips to go with your burrito. Would much rather go to Baja Fresh than a fast food burger joint.
