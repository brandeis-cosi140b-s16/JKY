This is a hometown favorite. The food is always great, the service is excellent and it is family owned. One of the coolest things is that the waiters and waitresses never leave. In most places this would mean that they are crabby and way to comfortable, that is not the case here. They are friendly, upbeat, thoughtful and always remember their customers. The owner is one of the most amazing members of this community. When he is there he is hands on, greeting customers like old friends, ensuring everything is great with your meal, and creating an overall sense of family. I would recommend the guacamole cheese crisp and the fajita taco salad, although you can't go wrong with anything you order. The iced tea is the best in the whole country!!! Ask for a to go cup :)
