Aw, man. I just love this place.

I can think of about a million different places to have a marg, but the gigantron ones they make here are good. The funny thing about 'em is that, yes, they're pre-mixed, and yes, they're made with el cheapo brand tequila, but hot diggety... can you refuse THAT many ounces of deliciousness for 4.95 on a Friday? Not me. The bean dip is awesome, the food is so so, but as far as I'm concerned, there is no other way to avoid Camelback rush hour than by stopping at Arriba for a marg or five (and then calling a taxi home... right?).
