What a spectacular and unexpected meal and experience. 

Food ingredients are all top quality. The preparation and presentation was fantastic. 

Flavors out of this world. Three great salsas with fantastic chips. 

We got a ten taco sampler. Each one better than the next. We got the mole sampler which was also amazing. 

Service was attentive, helpful and friendly. (Enrique). 

Best Mexican in Vegas. Even got a flan for check in in on yelp. Smart. 

Can't wait to explore the menu further.
