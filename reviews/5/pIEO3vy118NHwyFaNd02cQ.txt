My dad, my brother, and I enjoyed a late lunch here last weekend while visiting with my dad in AZ.  I was very impressed in all areas.

The restaurant has a nice look and feel to it.  The waitress was friendly and polite.  The salsa they give you with the chips was outstanding.  The prices were very reasonable.  All the food I ate was delicious.  The bathrooms were nice and clean.

What more could I ask for?  Oh, I know.. I need to see if they have Serrano's in Northern California.

Loved it!
