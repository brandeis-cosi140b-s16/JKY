Seriously how have I not left a review for Don rubens before?! We have been coming here for about 5 years and absolutely love it. Always clean! The food is fresh and always taste great. I can't understand why someone would leave a bad review. And the complaint on the bad review was stupid so stfu. The staff here is amazing. They are always welcoming, attentive and consistent. Our salsa and chips are never empty and the food comes out fast. Also, our drinks are always filled. And they have great tea! Being from new mexico I am super picky about my Mexican food and this is the only Mexican food I will eat in arizona. It's just so damn good. I am most fond of the Mexican shrimp burrito but have tried about a dozen other things and everything has been 100%. The gf always gets something different so she can try the whole menu so we have tried a lot of different things and are constantly impressed. I'd like to give DR 10 stars. Try it, you will Not be disappointed.
