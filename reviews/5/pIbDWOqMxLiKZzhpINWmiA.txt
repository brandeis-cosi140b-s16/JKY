Awesome food at this place. A little bit greasy but they definitely stand out with their flavors and originality. They almost always make sure the staff is made up of friendly people that make you feel comfortable enough to enjoy the time spent there. It also helps a lot if you have trouble getting your mind off of work because of built up stress. Keep in mind a lot of the food is oily, but like I said, very tasty. Also, they have a drive-through which is super convenient for me. 

They are right next to the McDonald's on Rainbow and Sahara.
