Hands down the best Mexican food I've had in forever! Service is awesome. Food is phenomenal! Salsa is perfectly hot like I love it. Chips and tortillas are homemade. And because we LOVE this place so much and are here at least twice a week, we are greeted like long lost friends every time we visit. 

ps) we were told the liquor license was awarded and they are in the final steps of carrying delish Mexican alcoholic beverages in addition to the awesome authentic Coke in the fridge by the counter.
