I've been going to Chino Bandidos since the 90s when I lived in Phoenix as a wee little child. After moving away, I relished the rare chance of visiting and eating their delicious food and walking away with a snicker doodle cookie to wash it all down. They have too many good choices of food, though I generally get a jerk-chicken quesadilla and trade between the gringo chicken in a burrito, or the emerald chicken, or the jade red chicken. The jerk fried rice is phenomenal. Their black beans have a twist to them. Spend $10 on a meal and you've got more flavor than most Mexican food and Chinese food can match. Highly recommended. 

I always send friends here and they are never disappointed either.
