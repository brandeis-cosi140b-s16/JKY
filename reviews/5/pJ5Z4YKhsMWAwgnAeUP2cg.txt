Don't let the exterior stop you from trying this place.  As other reviewers have said,  the place is clean inside,  the food is delicious and the folks running it are very welcoming and friendly. We had a group of five people. The interior is pretty small but they immediately moved a couple of tables together to accommodate us. We also saw several people come in for take out which might not be a bad idea in the summer months since there is little to no air conditioning. The service was quick and we were asked several times if we needed anything and if the food was ok. Oh it was. Nearly everything we tried was incredibly good. The highlight for me was the tacos (especially the carnitas), but I really want to try the carne asada burrito next time. A friend had the lengua burrito and said it was really tender and flavorful.
