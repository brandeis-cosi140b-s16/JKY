My boyfriend and I are regulars here and by regulars I mean we come usually twice a week. The service is always amazing (we love Bill and his super sweet wife who bartends.)   

We like to sit in the bar so we can see games on the tvs and we have never had to wait. 

The food is amazing. Best chips and salsa and guacamole. I always get the shrimp tacos (something about the sauce they give you for the tacos is like crack - so good) and my boyfriend usually gets something different each time and has never been disappointed. 

Their margaritas are great (get a pitcher to share) and prices are awesome as well. 

We love Julio G's and will keep coming... All the time lol. Definitely recommend!
