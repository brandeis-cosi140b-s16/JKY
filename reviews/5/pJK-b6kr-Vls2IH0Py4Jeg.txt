I was in Las Vegas the evening of 8/1 and had a restaurant.com coupon for Sabor for dinner.  I read a few reviews about this place and I love Mexican food so I figured I'd give it a shot.  

Having family in Mexico City and spending weeks traveling around Mexico, I felt I was prepared to properly review this place.   The restaurant is located in a shopping plaza, in a location you'd expect to see an Applebees.  We came on a Sunday evening around 6pm and the restaurant had only 1 other couple in it.  I was somewhat apprehensive about this.  

We sat down quickly and were served a complimentary chips, salsa, and more appetizer.  It came with breads, and toasted spices to dip the bread in.  It was fantastic!!  We ordered the guacamole, made tableside, which also was fabulous and for the first time we were asked how sour we'd like it and we said very!!!  It was incredible.  We followed that with the Sliced Sirloin and mashed potatoes which while I ordered medium, came rare which was fine and delicious.  This came with a roasted Jalopeno which I love.  My fiance ordered the Mahi Mahi which too was delicious.  We ended the evening with the Flan which was out of this world.  

If this restaurant were open on the Vegas strip in a hotel it would do fantastic!  It's out of the way from tourists and seems out of place in it's current location.  I'm saying it's too good that it may go missed.  I go to Vegas often and will make sure to visit every time.  AMAZING FOOD!
