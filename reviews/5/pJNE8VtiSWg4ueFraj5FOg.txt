Been coming here for a few years now, I've always had a great experience with this restaurant. The service is always great and the food is amazing ! I usually get the Mini Platter (feeds two!) or the Santa Fe Salad they are delicious ! The happy hour is great ! And they do margarita specials on Tuesdays and Saturdays ! I recommend Popo's Fiesta Del Sol to all my friends when they are craving Mexican food !
