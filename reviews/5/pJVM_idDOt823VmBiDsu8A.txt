I love this place. They have decent food and drinks at very affordable prices. This is a great place to come with friends and have some drinks. I myself usually have an IPA, and they always have a few good ones. I am told their margaritas are pretty good too. 

I have always have the enchiladas, which I really enjoy, but watch out for those crazy spicy tomato things! I've never had any of their nachos ironically, but their food has always been great. Their staff is always friendly and on point, and I honestly cannot ever remember having a bad experience at Nacho Daddy. Really great spot.
