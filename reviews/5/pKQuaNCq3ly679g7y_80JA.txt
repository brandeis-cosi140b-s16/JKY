I love this place and have been going here for almost 6 years. As noted by other reviews don't expect a fancy experience this is simple, clean, non-greasy food without the gobs of cheese littering most Arizona Mexican food. This is not Tex Mex with Tina of sour cream, guacamole, sauce and extras. It's good old fashion Mexican that your family would make. It's fast, the service is great and I personally love their salsa. I'll be there again as soon as possible!
