This review is for the restaurant only, not the grocery store or the taco stand

If you want authentic Mexican food this is the place to get it in Pittsburgh.  Many people in pittsburgh think, Chiptole or Emilianos are Mexican... they are not those are TEX-MEX places... this is the same food you will find in Mexico and its delicious.  I have had many things here and i have always left happy. The waitstaff is very nice and attentive, from the person who greets you at the door to the waitstaff everyone is always smiling. 

The food comes out extremely fast and they have great lunch specials.  

They have an outdoor patio, but i always go downstairs, its nice and cozy and doesn't feel like ur in a basement... even though it essentially is.

If you have never been you are missing out, so give it a try.
