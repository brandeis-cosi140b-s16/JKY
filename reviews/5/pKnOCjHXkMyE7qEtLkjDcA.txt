I always get the calabacitas tacos in a lettuce wrap and love it every time. I've tried a few other tacos before and they were also great but I love the calabacitas the best. They used to have a two taco dinner on the menu that comes with a side of rice and beans but now everything is sold separately. The price still equals about the same. I recommend getting the side of rice and beans because they are both delicious. The service is not the best but they do really care about your experience and if your food is not how you like it they will redo it for you. My mom had to send back her food twice due to ingredients in her dish she specifically said she was allergic to and the manager ended up giving us a free dessert and appetizer coupon for our next visit.
