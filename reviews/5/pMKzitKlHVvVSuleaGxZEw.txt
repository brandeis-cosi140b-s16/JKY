My husband and I visited for the first time on Sunday evening. As we were walking to our table, my husband passed out. The establishment immediately called 911 and while waiting for their arrival the family and entire staff were extremely attentive. They continued to do so for our entire stay once the paramedics left. Both my husband and I were impressed and very
touched by their care.
By the way, once all was ok we stayed and had a delicious dinner. No doubt, Las Tarascas will be our favorite place...yummy food, good prices and GREAT HUMANS!!!!!
