This place is by far my favorite Mexican restaurant in Scottsdale. They have a great wait staff, great food, and great drinks. You cant go wrong here. My favorite are the Tinga Chicken Tacos, and I like to wash it down with a Cadillac Margarita! If I'm with my girlfriend, we like to share the "Gigante" with is a 56 ounce margarita for $20! I take all my friends here who come to visit!
