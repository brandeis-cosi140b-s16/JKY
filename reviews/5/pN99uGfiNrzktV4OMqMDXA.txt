Looked on Yelp before choosing the place for dinner -- and we're delighted that we did.  I can't imagine a more perfect Tex-Mex dining experience.  We had no reservations and walked in 7p on Thursday evening.  The Hostess welcomed us, asked how many.  When we indicated two, we were instantly whisked away to a two-top in the bar area.  Cozy and nice.  Less than a minute after we were seated, our server appeared to take our drink and appetizer order.  A minute after that the guacamole cart came by.  If you like, they make it at your table; pretty impressive.  We declined and a minute later the (generously sized) frozen strawberry Margaritas arrived.  We gave him our order for cheese dip.  A minute later it arrived and was a very generous-sized bowl of white queso w/jalapenos.  We gave him our dinner order and asked him to please wait a few minutes before entering it!  

The queso and salsa and chips were all excellent.  My best first measure of a TexMex restaurant: chips warm and fresh.

Five minutes later I caught his eye and gave him the thumbs-up to enter our dinner order.  Gael had the quesadilla appetizer (huge) and I had my standard two beef enchiladas.  Honestly, five minutes later we were eating.  Both our meals (and the Margaritas) were excellent.

I've never experienced quicker service or friendlier staff than here at Azteca in Matthews NC.

I asked to see the manager and passed on our compliments.  We always do that when the experience is exceptional.

When in the Charlotte area, we'll enthusiastically come here again!
