Muy Bueno!!!  This is not typical Mexican fare.  Fresh with an emphasis on presentation ~ Mahi tacos and chicken lettuce wraps. So many good choices available -  Chef Paco created a thoughtful menu respecting gluten free, vegan and vegetarian diners.  Oh and Save room for the flan - a family recipe that is worth the caloric splurge.
