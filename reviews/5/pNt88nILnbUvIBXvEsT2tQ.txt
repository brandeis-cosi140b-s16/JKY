I discovered this little place about two weeks or so ago, and have already been back a few times.  And I'll tell you why:

Kalua Pork Nachos.

I discovered this tasty meat in Kauai some years back, and I've not found comparable since, except for hear.  And they are generous with the meat.  I was very pleased with the flavor, their cheese, and the guacamole.  It's all very flavorful.

The place is nice and clean, and the people are very friendly.  They let me try a few samples, and they are very much about taking care of the customer.  What surprises me is that whenever I go, the place is empty.  Maybe I'm coming at an off time, so who knows?  But I do think the food and service is worth visiting for.  I'm already become mildly addicted to the nachos.

Like I said, I'm new to Braddah's, but I'm sold on the nice service and food.  If you haven't been, they are worth hunting down to try out.
