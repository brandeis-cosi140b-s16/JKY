One of the best places to eat in the country! From the ambiance to the cuisine and service, this restaurant has a special place in my heart and stomach. The Cowboy Meatloaf was the first dish I had and it was perfect! In the sea of chain restaurants and upscale fast food, it's very relieving to find a restaurant such as this! Great food, great atmosphere and great staff!
