Oh my goodness. A delightful experience to eat legitimate Mexican food. Lengua, carnitas, and chorizo tacos were great. The owners are friendly and humble and great cooks.

We were talking about legit Mexican food in Northern Virginia and I said that I've never had good tripa (tripe)

They brought me a little complimentary taco to try. It was fantastic and tender beyond belief.

Do yourself a huge favor and stop in.
