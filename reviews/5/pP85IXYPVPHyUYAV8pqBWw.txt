Excellent food. Intimate sized restaurant, seems as though the gentleman who took our drink order may need a little more training but with the right tools would be just fine.  There were three of us and we ate lunch specials, enchiladas, mahi tacos, and chiles rellenos.  I got the chiles rellenos- I was worried about the spice level but it was so great, a clean taste and just the right amount of heat.  I am SO glad I decided not to take the negative reviews seriously, because everything was great.  We even forgot to ask to have our checks split in the beginning, we apologized and asked at the end... even the chips and guacamole was split between three checks and we only got one order of them.  We really didnt wait long at all for the food, the server girl was very nice.  I will be going back again and again, that's for sure!
