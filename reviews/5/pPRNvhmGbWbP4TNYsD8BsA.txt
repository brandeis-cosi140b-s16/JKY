Got back to the Valley of the Sun after being away all summer to find that Los Dos Molinos is now open 7 days a week, including Sunday brunch starting at 11:00. We had the Huevos Rancheros and they were great. Headed back with friends next Sunday to sample more of the menu. Oh--and BTW--the Bloody Mary's are great too!
