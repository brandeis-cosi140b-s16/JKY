Great vibe. Nice people. Perfect place for drinks on the patio! Ambiance is extremely relaxing yet elegant decor. The staff is hands down the friendliest. Very attentive when I was at the bar. Their helpfulness with the drinks and menu was great. Very courteous. I would come back just for the service. If your at the bar Danielle was extremely friendly and helpful. Top class hospitality from her. And Conrad the bartender was awesome. Very knowledgeable of all the drinks and polite. They were easy to engage in conversations with. Drinks were great had the Don Margarita and the Office speciality cocktails. A bit pricey but can be expected on the strip. 

Food was great just had tapas ribeye taco. Great flavor. Will definitely come back and try other menu options. Overall the service was better than I expected due to the friendly staff. Location is great over at the Linq. I highly recommend to check this place out!!
