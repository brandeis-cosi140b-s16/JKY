As soon as I arrived the staff welcomed me and I felt as if I just walked into my Nana's house. There is literally a traditional residential front door that when closes makes you feel like you are in someone's awesome smelling home. Granted the area is right in the middle of Phoenix and there are people around that someone might consider this restaurant "dirty" or "unsafe" but that is not the case. This place not only raises the value of the community it is in, I believe they are making a difference by providing an excellence service. This is coming from a guy that is born and raised in East Mesa that hates the Phoenix and downtown area. This place is great! 

Now with the food. 
10 stars. 
Get everything on the menu because it's so dang cheap! A taco for 2 bucks?! What?! The meat is something of a miracle, it is so tender and tasteful. My wife and I got the beef Barbacoa, and carne Asada tacos. They are BOMB. All you business professionals need to come to this place for lunch and make it your place for lunch.
