I have been going to El Charro since a young child and it is fantastic. We eat there at least once a week. These are my top favorites:

Bean Tostada
Mexican Cheese Tortilla
Bean and Cheese Burrito
Green Mix Burro

If you sit in the bar they serve a bean dip at night that is fabulous, get there early though as they only make one pot for the night, once its gone, its gone. 

Stop in and give them a try, you wont be disappointed!
