Great tacos!  I mean GREAT tacos!  Been here many times through the years and have never been disappointed.  Whenever I am in the Las Vegas area I always make an effort to come.  They do a great job with the Bol-go-gi tacos and rice.  Their burritos are a good size and you always get free chips and salsa/guacamole.  Service is always quick and attentive!
