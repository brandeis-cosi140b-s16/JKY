Absolutely loved this little gem! So cute inside...Our server Jose made the visit so enjoyable. Food was gooooood! Loved the chips sprinkled with chili and the guac was fabulous. We had the El Patron for two. Filet and ribeye grilled and served with fresh tortillas and 3 amazing sauces..and the most amazing potatoes. We will definately be back. Soon.
