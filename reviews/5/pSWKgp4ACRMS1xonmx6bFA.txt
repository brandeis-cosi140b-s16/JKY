their taco al pastor of choice is abodaba, if you want good authentic tacos in vegas, this is probably your only way to go, it's not bad, it's amazing, it's the best thing ever, it over shadows that lengua (tongue) taco that i got by miles...i can see why they need two separate lines for it and i still had to wait over 20mins cuz some ppl in front of me just ordered like 20tacos 

they have horchata soft drink machine ;d
