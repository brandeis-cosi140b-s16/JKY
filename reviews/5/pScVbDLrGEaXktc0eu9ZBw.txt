Holy guacamole the customer service at this tbell is awesome! This is my neighborhood Taco Bell, and by far the friendliest one I've ever been too. (And I'm a Taco Bell addict so that says something). Well my man and I decided on another Thursday night grubbing at our favorite place, and we hit up the drive-thru as per usual. I decided to go for a boss wrap, a first time for me. The wait was pretty long, but not unreasonable and the staff was really apologetic. They even gave us a 50% coupon for our next visit--SCORE!! We also discovered they gave us a few free bags of chips too. So we get home to discover those weren't actually free chips, but an order that entirely was not ours and yes, that means that also the boss wrap was nowhere to be found! So we headed back and opted for the inside option to explain what happened. Not only did they once again become truly apologetic, but they made our correct order right away and refunded me! That's right, free food! It was honestly so sweet, and totally unexpected to be honest. I just really wanted my boss wrap and they went above and beyond. So when you're deciding where to grub, I highly recommend this establishment. In my opinion, the greatest Taco Bell in all the land! (PS the boss wrap was amazing!)
