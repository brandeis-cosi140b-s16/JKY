Love chipotle and this location. Didn't realize how much I loved it until I moved and there was no chipotle around. It's always fast and friendly service even though the volume of the store is very high. Every time I come in, it's packed and I'm usually in and out 9 out of 10 times. Tables are pretty clean and well kept.
