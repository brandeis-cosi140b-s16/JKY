First off, let me say that I just enjoyed 6 nights at the Flamingo. Many times I frequented this establishment and not once was I ever disappointed. In fact, I actually looked forward to going!
I had the enchiladas, rice and beans. Everything was extremely flavorful and in good portions. To be honest I wished there had a BIT more red sauce, but that's a minor thing.
The nachos looked great as well. As did the cheese dip. There is Happy Hour everyday from 2-6 and anytime football is on the screen. That is really the time to come. I enjoyed sitting outside and chatting with other guests around the bar. Everyone was friendly.
TIP: When you come here and there is any issue whatsoever with your food, drinks or service, ask immediately to speak with Amy. I had the pleasure of getting to know Amy and beyond any doubt, she is extremely capable of handling any situation. And she will do it with a smile and a pleasant demeanor. If owned a restaurant, I would want her working for me. I promise you that Amy will make it right.
