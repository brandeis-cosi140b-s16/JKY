This place is AWESOME!!!  The food is excellent and costs less than eating fast food, plus it's healthier.  The 2 ladies running CC's Mesquite Brolier have done a great job with the staff, remodeling upgrades, menus, and service!!!  Great drink prices, friendly staff, & great atmosphere for adults and kids.  It's refreshing to see these 2 local women running this place and working as hard as they do.  I've seen how they make everyone feel at home and treat everyone like famliy.  I love it here.  Give CC's a try.  Great for breakfast, lunch & dinner.
