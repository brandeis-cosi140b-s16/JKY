Outstanding!

Great food! Great service!

The grilled fish and grilled shrimp tacos were amazing! As were the the breakfast chorizo tacos!

Customize it however you want. (Think Subway style) Fresh lime. Spicy jalape√±os. Shredded cilantro. Great pico de gallo. Ghost pepper sauce that I'm going to have to buy some to take home.

Best food I've had while in Vegas and the fact that it is served so fast is a bonus.
