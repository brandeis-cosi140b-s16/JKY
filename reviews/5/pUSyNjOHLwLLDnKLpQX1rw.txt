The place was slow for 3 pm which I figured .. But usually Chipotle is always fast and im out the door in 3 min even with 20 people in line ...

 This time we had 1 couple in front of us and me and my girlfriend amd we were there for like 12 min!!!! 

Besides the slow service which is probably due to short staff , the food was excellent and fresh!!!
