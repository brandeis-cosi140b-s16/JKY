It's all about the Carne Asada. So juicy and tasty and the cheese these guys are using is very authentic and yummy. I also really loved the touch of Ranchero sauce on top.
I have been one other time and gotten three tacos a la carte. The Jerk Chicken was my favorite of the three but I will definitely be back to try them all (chorizo, carnitas, all the great flavors are represented and done very well!) Did I mention homemade Churros? I've never had them so crispy on the outside and soft in the middle. Here's to great Mexican done right in downtown Madison!
