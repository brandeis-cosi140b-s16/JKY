Excellent fish tacos (including a mahi-mahi variety if you're into that).  I really like the salsa bar, not too overwhelming, just the right amount of condiments to choose from.  This place was a godsend when looking for a quick bite in downtown Phoenix.  Every other place I walked by looked really beat.
