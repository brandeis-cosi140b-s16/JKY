If you enjoy Macayos, Manuels and all of the other typical generic Mexican restaurants that slather their plates with sloppy beans, rice and taco/enchilada then Mejico is not the place for you.

Obed, Pam and crew are aiming for something a little more upscale than combination B - and they are successful.

The margaritas are fresh and delicious.  

I love their guacamole

Their shrimp ceviche (Mexican shrimp cocktail)is the best I have ever had in a restaurant in Arizona.

The Chili Verde is delicious!

They have recently added a happy hour MONDAY - FRIDAY from 3 - 6pm with reduced drinks and food and there is an outside patio planned.

Stop by, relax and enjoy a great experience.
