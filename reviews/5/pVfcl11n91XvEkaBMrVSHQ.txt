im on this chile relleno kick. they are so dang good, people. 

first of all, this place is a little difficult to find. they are next to Natalia's.  I drove right past them the first time and almost gave up until I called to figure out their location. there's no signage with their business name listed at the shopping center's entrance and there's also no signage above their front door.  just look for natalia's. 

the meals are huge! it's like $8. it comes with amazing rice, beans, and your spectacular cheese stuffed green chile smothered in red or green sauce. you get a fantastic tortilla on the side (which i save to make a burro out of the leftovers the next day). 

you get warm chips and salsa with your meal as well. 

it's an order at the entrance, sit down and get your own salsa type of environment. very casual. very delicious. very affordable.
