It has been about a year since I last visited this place, but I subscribe to their Facebook page and always see their updated posts and photos.  I used to be a taxi driver in Phoenix, and I would go here after working nights to take a break, either to have breakfast or brunch.

First off, let me say that they have the best menudo in Phoenix, either red or white, and it is available every day, whereas most Mexican places will only have it available on weekends.  The menudo actually tastes homemade, not like it was just poured out of a can and reheated.  As far as the rest of their dishes, they also have a variety of tasty platters, such as different kinds of tacos, enchiladas, and "burros" (not burritos.... but the actual correct term of a big Mexican wrap; the term "giant" or "big" burrito is actually a contradiction or an oxymoron, but anyway I digress... back to the review!).  They also have chips and salsa, both the red and green variety.

The food is actually tasty and flavorful, unlike many of the other "-berto's" fast food Mexican places all around town, which for the most part, is bland and all tastes the same. Sure, it might be a bit unfair for me to make that comparison, since Rosita's is a restaurant and not a fast food joint.  And I'm not saying Filiberto's or Julioberto's or any of those other place are bad.  But what I'm saying is that I am willing to drive far just to eat out here at Rosita's, which is what the difference is.

This place can get crowded on a Sunday, so as usual, plan accordingly.
