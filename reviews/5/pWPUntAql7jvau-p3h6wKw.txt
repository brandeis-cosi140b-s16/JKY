This Roberto's is a very clean location, but is not very busy.  They also don't have a drive-thru.  They don't have a lot of tables to eat at either.  They are very nice at this location and have a good understanding of English.  Another plus is that they offer the shrimp burrito, but a lot different than other locations.  They offer it with a lot of cheese sauce inside.  After your meal, you can shop in the Sahara Pavilion, which has a lot of nice shopping in it, including a very nice Borders that is the largest in town in way of books.
