I stumbled upon this Mexican food place on accident one evening a year or so ago. Starving on my way home from work, I thought Mexican food would hit the "comfort food" nook in my stomach whose needs I definitely had to accommodate. I was pleasantly surprised when my drive-thru order was ready lickety-split, and yet the food tasted fresh out of the oven upon return to my house 20 minutes later. My favorite part of this restaurant besides the insanely delicious authentic selection and fantastic prices? The "God Bless America" sign on the drive-thru window.
