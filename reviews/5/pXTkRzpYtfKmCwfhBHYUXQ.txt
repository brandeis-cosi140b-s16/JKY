I love this place. The chips melt in your mouth as you eat them. This particular location is amazing, becuase they often are very slow and I guess this makes the service so wonderful. Half of the stars are from the outstanding service I receive EVERY time. Sodas are ALWAYS bubbly, and cheese crisp tastes like eating candy. The other food is all 'good' but nothing to shout over. I am addicted to the cheese crisp, though, if ever you go here, TRY IT. Their cheese is amazing, usually always perfectly crisped tortilla. I have also tried taquitos, which were ok, fajitas which were pretty good, etc. Most is all "Ok" or "Good" but the cheese crisp is "Phenomenal".
Cant wait to go back! Wonderful servers. Always get treated like a VIP.
