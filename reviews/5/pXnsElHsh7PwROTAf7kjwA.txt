Drunk food doesn't get better than this. Carne, salsa, lime, $3, it's perfect. Plus the people watching here at 2 AM is great. Loads of terrible people with impaired judgement. The last time I was here I saw a girl knock another girl's cell phone out of her hand, breaking it and subsequently refusing to pay for it after repeated drunken demands. Proceed to escalation: name calling, stumbling around in high heels, aggressive posturing, male friends stepping in trying to defuse the situation. No such luck, as girl A hops into a golf cart, girl B runs over to her, grabs her phone and spikes it on the concrete. More escalation, followed by the storming off of Girl B with her broken cell phone after threats of police intervention.

Where else in the Phoenix metro area do you get to see live-action Jersey Shore while eating a delicious $5 taco?

Entertainment, price, product, Wadaa has it all.
