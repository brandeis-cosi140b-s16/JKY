Perfect place for late night eating, price matches portions, food is great. I've had everything on the menu, including the amigo's grande burrito (three times actually), my favorite is the california burrito, not traditional, but delicious. However I advise you to not try the chicken burrito, unless you're into beans, chicken, and jalapenos.
