This place is awesome. I've been going to Don Jos√© for forty-one years and when they closed a few years ago I was heartbroken. Since I no longer live in the Phoenix area it was always my first and last visit of each trip. My son moved here in May and discovered it had reopened. Woohoo! The tradition continues. A number four and a Jose crisp are my absolute favorite. We've been unable to locate anything that even comes close to their sauce. Welcome back.
