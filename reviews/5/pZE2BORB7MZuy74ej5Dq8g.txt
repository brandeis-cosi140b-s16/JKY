Awesome place a Hawaiian version of chipotle but 10x better.  The meat actually had some flavor to it the salsas tasted like they weren't out of a bottle not spicy at all unfortunately but the have jalapenos.  We got a fish burrito and 2 pig burritos the fish is not the best but went well with the burrito.  The pig is tender still has flavor very well done.  They also have a pineapple green sauce that well Id eat on anything.  The meat is a little light so get the second portion.

Going back soon got more things to try from this place and the kids portions are 3 and change and I am eating my boys leftovers right now.
