Hands down..THE BEST PAPUSAS IN LAS VEGAS AND HENDERSON..the great thing about Las Pupusas is that no matter which location you go to around town, the food is consistent and so tasty. I get queso and chicharron con queso with extra cabbage. The pupusas are made fresh to oder so it takes some time to get your order, well worth it. The fried yuca is good, as well as the platanos con sour cream.
