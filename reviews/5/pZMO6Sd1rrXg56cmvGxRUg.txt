BUFFET MEXICANO. In bright green poster paper? Trust me, I was skeptical too. 

My stomach sank when our waitress asked if we wanted the buffet option. It was 9pm on a Thursday. Mexican food being dear to my heart, I wasn't interested in being disappointed. We asked for the a la carte menu instead, and our waitress said, "Are you sure you don't want the buffet? The food is fresh." Still wary of eating the day's leftovers I went with her to peruse the lineup. I spied fresh, buttery shrimp cooked with onions, still steaming. Also, were there two types of steak? Stir-fried green beans Chinese-buffet style?? I was intrigued, and sold.

The buffet option comes with your choice of corn or flour tortillas, and deliriously tasty chips and salsa. There was a wide variety of dishes, each cooked in small batches and respectfully seasoned. What looked like dried chunks of meat in a stew ended up being tender, savory pork marinated in a cilantro verde sauce. I will never consider ordering a la carte here again. 

They do have a bit of competition from other Mexican restaurants in town, but I'd wager they put everything towards quality ingredients, making great tasting food, and charging a competitive price. While they might cut corners on other aspects, like the decor and plaza strip locale, they certainly don't skimp on the food. 

Did you know all-you-can-eat Mexican food can be $8.99 on weekdays and $9.99 on the weekends? If you don't know, now you know.
