We have had good experiences at this location, unlike many other El Pollo Loco locations. The prices have gone up, however. Today the gal's shirt (cashier) said something about free-range chicken, so maybe that is why the prices went up. They upgraded their pop machine.  Not like Firehouse Subs and BK, but still more flavors than the norm. Oh, and drinks are pricey and not included with their meal/family pack deals at any of the locations.
