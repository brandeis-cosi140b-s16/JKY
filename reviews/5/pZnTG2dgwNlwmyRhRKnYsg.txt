Our waitress was very friendly! I ordered los tacos de carne asada and they were fantastic. Steak on corn tortillas served with a side of cilantro, onion, lime, and traditional salsa so I could put as much as I wanted on my tacos, which was great! Everyone enjoyed their food choices, Nachos Tropicales were a hit! The cheese dip appetizer is a must. I'm always very iffy about ordering meat at a place I haven't been before, but all the meats here were perfectly seasoned and well cooked, served hot. Absolutely delicious will definitely come back.
