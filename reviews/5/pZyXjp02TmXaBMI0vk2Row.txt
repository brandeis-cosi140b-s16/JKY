This place is awesome. I am from Texas and of Hispanic decent so, I am very familiar with good quality Mexican food, I am not an expert but I can tell good from ehhh not so good. When I decided to give this taqueria a try I wasn't expecting much but after meeting the staff and deciding what to order (Chicken tacos) man was I impressed the flavor, quality and presentation is top notch. This place is very inviting and staff are friendly willing to help and offer some tips on what to order. This place kinda reminds me of the small grab n go style of restaurants you would typically find in downtown districts in many cities across Mexico. Long story short is that I Highly Recommend this place five stars from me. FYI I am not from Pittsburgh but when I am town I make it a point of my stay to visit this place. Pittsburgh you have great place to grab some awesome tacos, go out and support this establishment they are serving great food.
