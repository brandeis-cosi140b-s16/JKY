Real authentic Mexican dishes, right in the middle of C/U.  Been here a few times now and everything tried was spectacular.

Got spoiled in CA with taco trucks serving scrumptious goodness everywhere.  For being in Illinois, nothing else outside of Chicago can compare. 

Don't be put off by the looks, or worry too much about the floors/tables.  The grocery store and food counter are unassuming and homey (homely?).  Everything is super cheap for the quality and quantity.  

It's a non-corporate family venture, the same folks are always working.

If it looks good, and smells tasty,
just eat!

Alejandro is really friendly, and he's kinda super hot as well.  He'll help you figure out something to try if you are unsure.
