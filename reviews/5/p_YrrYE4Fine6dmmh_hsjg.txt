As always delicious and nutritious!  Not as busy as expected for a Saturday night with a Panthers Game. Server was very comedic, and attentive. Big as yo face burrito with oven roasted chicken, creamy jalape√±o sauce on top...MUST have. Only dislike my lime wedge was cut too big to fit into my corona. I wouldn't  recommend the bar area tables for 3+ people, either. The Sangria my girlfriend had was tasty. I don't know why other tex-mex restuarants in Charlotte even try to compete.
