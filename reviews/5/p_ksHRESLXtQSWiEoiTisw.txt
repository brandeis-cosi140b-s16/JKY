The food here is so good.  I just had the chili relleno, taco, and tamale platter.  All items were mouth watering delicious.  I will come here more often.  Complimentary chips and salsa were decent good. :)

Update:

I came back and tried the red burro, mushroom enchilada plate.  While the red sauce on top was very good on the burro, the steak/beef inside was pretty crappy meat.  As for the mushroom enchilada, I didn't like the taste and it was difficult to eat.  I normally love mushrooms but not the way it was prepared here.  The refried beans that came with the plate was the same you get at any low end restaurant.

I know they have good selections, so I will come back and try something different.
