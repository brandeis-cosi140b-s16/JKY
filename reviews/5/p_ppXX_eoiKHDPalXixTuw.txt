An outside taco stand in Arizona? This must be madness you say.

Well no this is just delicious street tacos done right. I stood outside on line at Wadaa's stand in 100+ degree weather for 15 minutes just for the chance to get a few of these amazing street taco's.

Yes street taco purists will frown at the addition of cheese or maybe the lack of radish slices but not this hombre. The options are limited: chicken or steak. No matter which you select you will be satisfied.

This place is also open till 3AM and 4AM on Friday/Saturday.
