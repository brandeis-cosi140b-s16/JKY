I need a regular dose of Mendoza Express in my life. It helps that I work less than a mile away from the restaurant. I don't know what authentic Mexican food is, but this food here is dee-lee-shus! I love the tacos here and love how simple they are. Their veggie dishes are very flavorful, I do not miss meat in my veggie meals here at all. There is no fake this and that in them, just plain ole vegetables. My fave is the eggs and chorizo dish. I think you can also get that in a burrito, but I like the version that resembles scrambled eggs. The service is quick and friendly. The man at the counter is super nice and helpful. If you are ever in the Greentree-Crafton-Carnegie area, stop by!
