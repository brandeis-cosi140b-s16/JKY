Carne asada tacos at $1.00 a pop. Yes!!! Steak, cabbage, hot sauce, sour cream if you ask for it. Best street tacos around. 

The line is (usually) long but it's so worth it. On any given weekend night you will find bar goers, families, people just getting off work, all lined up for some taco truck amazing-ness. The burritos are huge, the nachos look amazing, the quesadillas are always a good stand by, but the tacos....oh the tacos. 

Take my advice...don't be put off by the line but be prepared to wait. You can thank me later.
