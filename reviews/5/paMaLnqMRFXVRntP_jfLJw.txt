Needed a quick dinner near Nellis, so we took the family to Zapatas.  How amazing!  I've lived and traveled throughout the southwest, and this was fantastic Mexican cuisine.  I had the Carne asada plate at the waiter's recommendation.   It was perfect.  The Pico and guacamole served with it were also spot on.  If only I could have finished it after the fresh chips, salsa, and  bean dip which was served complimentary.    The kids meals were also great and the adults enjoyed yummy frozen margaritas.  We will definitely be returning often.  While totally worth the wait, make sure you allow plenty of time at dinner as it took awhile for all our fresh food to be prepared. Service was excellent and very attentive.
