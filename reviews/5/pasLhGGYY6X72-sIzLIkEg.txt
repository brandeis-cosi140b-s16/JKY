My significant other and I heard that this restaurant had amazing seafood so we decided to try it out. The oysters were phenomenal, we also ordered the "campin" bacon wrapped shrimp...to die for!! Our waitress, Benyanita was exceptional. She was so attentive and polite, we have never had such good service. We will definitely be going back!
