Always  expect a crowd,  especially  on a Friday night,  tonight being a Friday  is no exception.  The dining  area is to capacity and lines are waiting for about 20-30 minutes. Tacos are always good and good portions are always expected  especially  if you are a person that  appreciates good service and knows how to TIP adequately. Please  Tip these hardworking people  which are all probably  working for minimum wage. 

When I come to tacos el gordo I always like to  order the carne asada  which come with  home made tortillas,  or any other variations  which come with processed  ones.  I had never tried TRIPA  tacos I thought  the idea of trying tripe tacos  was nasty,  my wife being a loving caring wife said try them and shoved one in my mouth and I won't lie to you  ever since that day  I order one or two  of those.  I've also tried the carne asada fries which are OK I suppose  but not for me I'd rather have a taco. 

With all of this being  said,  I miss the location  on Vegas Blvd,  because it  is closer to  home and much  more convenient  that is the reason  I don't come as often as I'd like to. Mexican food always brings back childhood memories, as a child I loved going to the taco  truck with the family I guess this type of atmosphere  is what I like  sometimes (less the rudeness and loudness of some  macho acting Mexicans that  want to fight over a table.). 
I guess you can't always  have everything  in this life. Well about to eat me some food food and enjoy good times with great friends,  til next time yelpers.
