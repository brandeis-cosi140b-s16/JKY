I read the reviews for this place here on Yelp and took my husband there who is VERY picky when it comes to Mexican food.  He told me that we pass the place all the time and there are no cars.  Sure enough, The lot was empty but the food was amazing.  We both loved it.  And me being vegetarian, they had a section of the menu for me.  I have not had fajitas in SO long and these were to die for.  The mushrooms were cooked to perfection.  Slightly sweet.  And the corn was perfect.  Grilled but still had a slight crunch.  And how can i leave without having Sopapillas.  Again.  Great stuff.  I give it 5 stars and have decided to make it our Sunday treat.  Thanx all for recommending this amazing restaurant.
