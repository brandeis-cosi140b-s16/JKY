We decided to stop for a bite to eat my husband and my 17 year old son, it happened to be Happy hour, we don't drink, but we sat out on the patio, really nice outside. We ordered appetizers as they were $3 off. All the food we order was just as good as always, the waitress was really nice and helpful. We will be going back again.
