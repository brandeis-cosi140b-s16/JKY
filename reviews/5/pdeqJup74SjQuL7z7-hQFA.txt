I am addicted to their breakfast burros (no little burritos here). Trying their in-house made Egg, Potato, & Chorizo with Cheese burro was a revelation and I look for excuses to buy breakfast at Carolina's as often as possible. Their hand-made daily tortillas are 16" of light, pliable, wheaty greatness. So Mexican that cheese & chicken are still advertised as new additions. No American ham, sausage, or bacon and you won't miss them at all.
When I visit during breakfast or lunch the parking lot is filled with pickup trucks carrying construction workers to the tastiest & most affordable Mexican in the Valley.
