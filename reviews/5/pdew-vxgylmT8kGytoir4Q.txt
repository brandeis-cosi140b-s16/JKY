You know finding great Mexican food is really hard to find.  Being from California, AZ southwest style if Mexican food is different.  I do have to say though this carne asada burrito is freaking delicious!  Great flavor!  Most places want to impress you with the portion size,not here.  I don't know about you but I'll take quality over quantity any day.  Next time I'm around these parts I'm definitely going back!
