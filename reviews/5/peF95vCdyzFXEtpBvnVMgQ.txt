When you stew meet in its own juices and your food is fresh it's hard to complain. But Not a huge fan of the name change but the good news is the food didn't change & no cherry coke seriously! Well with that being the only drawback this place is amazing. Up there with mucho macho and paqueme as some of the best local Mexican food I've had in the AZ. A must visit but be warned it will become a frequent craving
