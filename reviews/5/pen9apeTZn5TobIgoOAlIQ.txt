Se√±or Taco is delicious!!  I love love love their red chile carne asada burrito. It might be a little on the spicy side for some, but it's amazing...beans, red chile, and carne...yum!!!  My kiddos always get some type of breakfast burrito and my husband switches between their carnitas and regular carne asada. So far everything's been amazing!!!
