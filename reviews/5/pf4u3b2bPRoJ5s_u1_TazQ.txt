I must say that I am super stoked that this place finally pulled down the boards covering up the windows and unleashed their tortilla-awesomeness upon us all. 

I ate here for dinner the other night and was very impressed. I had the Green Chile Pork, which was soft, tender and spicy - all the things I look for in my Mexican dining experience. The real temptation that lies within this place is it's amazing, homemade tortillas. Right now, they primarily make flour, but don't fret, I have it on good authority that they are expanding to make corn tortillas as well. Literally, and I will try to be as unoffensive as possible, but you could fill that tortilla with solid waste and I would still eat it. Those tortillas are that good. If they were able to made into a blanket, I would consider buying sheets of them to adorn my house and then, obviously, my stomach.

If you go here, make sure you take the time to watch them make a few fresh tortillas. And a little bird told me that the most amazing thing on the menu thus far is the Oregano Lime Chicken. Beware - it is apt to induce restlessness because it is so good you will crave it fortnightly. 

Consider yourself warned.
