Just ate at Aunt Chilada's and it was very tasty. Some people commented that they didn't like the noodles (fideo) with the beans but that was my favorite part! I didn't really care for them alone, but mixed in with the beans it was delicious! 

I ordered number 7 (cheese enchilada + green corn tamale) which was good, albeit pretty standard and my mom got the chicken tortilla soup which she said she would definitely get again. And I'd have to agree with the other yelpers- the chips and salsa are FANTASTIC!
