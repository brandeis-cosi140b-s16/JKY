One of the few places I will go on the west side and, of course, I'm about to tell you why.
First off, it's not at Westgate.  People have been shot and kill partying at Westgate.  Who wants to go there?  Not me.  I love my life!!  
If you're headed to a Cardinals game and don't want to pay a ridiculous amount of money for a parking pass nor tailgate at Westgate where people die, you should go to the Sandbar.  There's free parking at the fancy Park West shopping center AAAAAAAND the fine folks at Sandbar will escort you in their bus over to stadium when you've had your fill of build your own bloody Marys and tacos.  Don't worry, they'll pick you up from the game and bring you safely back to your car.
Speaking of the bus, if you live nearby, you can call and have them pick you up and take you home.  Now that's a classy bar.  They're concerned about your good time and safety.
Depending on the night, or day, you go, you can totally get a different vibe.  Up for a crazy night of dancing?  Go on a Friday or Saturday night.  Feel like chillaxing on a patio?  Go during happy hour.  Feel like some karaoke?  There's a night for that too.  There's even great live music during Friday happy hour. 
It's safe, friendly, the margaritas are strong, the vodka is well priced, the tacos are yummy... It's a good thing I don't live closer or else I'd probably never leave.
