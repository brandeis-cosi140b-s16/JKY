I can't get enough of this place. I consider myself a bit of a taco fan and this place keeps me happy! Also the salsa bar is pretty creative. Only complaints are if you order their amazing horchata, it only comes in one size which is a bucket and the other complaint is they only provide 1 small basket of chips per table, any more will cost ya like $2!?! Forget the chips and spend that on another taco!!
