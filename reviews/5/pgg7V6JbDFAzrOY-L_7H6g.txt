Woohoo!  Haven't wrote a review in awhile but I needed to after eating at Chile Addiction!  Everything I ate was packed with lots of flavor. My favorite dish is the chile relleno topped w/ hatch green chile!  The sopaipillas were fluffy & had a nice crispness to it.  They also had excellent customer service!  I love supporting locally own family businesses and will definitely be back again!

support your locals!  Eat Local!
