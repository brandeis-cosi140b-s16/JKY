The kids loved their burritos, and I loved the torta cubana. Lots of flavor and lots of meat.  The waitress was really nice and let us dine in, even though they were closing in 15 minutes. More than that, she didn't rush us and stopped by just to chat with us and the kids. I hope this place gets more business, as they're kind of hidden behind a vacant diner.
