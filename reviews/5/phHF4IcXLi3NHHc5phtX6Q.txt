This place was a little out of the way but not far from my hotel.  I arrived late on a Wednesday, and was the only one there.  But the place was clean and colorful, and I was cheerfully greeted.  Throughout, I was not rushed, even when they were closing at 8PM.

Based on some of the reviews on Yelp, I wanted to try it out.  The chips and salsa were very good, although I didn't care for a somewhat smoky flavor of the salsa roja.  The verde was much better!  I went with the camarones salad to start.  Really tasty, LOADS of shrimp (maybe they had to get rid of them), but for me a bit too many onions.  However, the mixture, topped with cilantro was very tasty. In addition to the chips, a big basket of crackers accompanied the dish.

The entree I selected was the camarones culichi.  It was very tasty, with the sauce light, but delicious.  The flour tortillas were fresh and warm.  The meal was accompanied but a Negra Modelo (in the bottle, but they had it on tap as well.)

All in all, it was a great experience.  I don't think I will be able to make it back on this trip (and don't really know if I will ever - it's a long way from Alaska) but highly recommend stopping by.  Don't let the neighborhood or outside appearances deceive...
