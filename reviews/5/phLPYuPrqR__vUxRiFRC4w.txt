Scotty had great margarita recommendations, worthy of a refill. Don't miss the shooters app, best fried jalape√±os. My wife had their special Mac & Cheese. I had pork tenderloin with M&C. A fabulous experience! It was a rare, cold night and we they wanted us to wait 30 min. I walked out, but was convinced it would take that long to go to another place.  Am glad we went back in and waited for a table.
