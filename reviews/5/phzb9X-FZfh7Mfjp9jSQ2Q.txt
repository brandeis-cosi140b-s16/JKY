The word "authentic" is so overused when talking about Mexican places. I'm guilty of using it on more than one occasion. But, for lack of a better term that is exactly what this place is. It's a small, locally owned restaurant with authentic Mexican food. All the usual stuff (tacos, burritos, tamales, tortas, soups) at great prices. Tacos are 90 cents! I got 3 tacos and a soda for under 4 bucks. That's a great deal for any lunch.

Tacos are two soft  4-inch tortillas piled with your choice of meat, onions and cilantro. The pastor was good, but not great. The carnitas on the other hand were amazing. Soft and tender and full of flavor. The best carnitas tacos I've had in a long time. They were so good I stopped by a second time a couple days later to order 2 more. I wanted to try their tamales but they were out so I ordered 2 asada tacos, which were amazing. Some of the best authentic (there, I said it again) Mexican food around.
