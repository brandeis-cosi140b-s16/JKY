Great ambience, margaritas and food. Same menu as Newport & Irvine. Tried the jalapeño  marg and enjoyed. Not too spicy. Recommend the cucumber, jalapeño or house which is a Cadillac. I had the carne tampiquena and loved it, always do. Tons of food and you get a little bit of everything. Can't ever go wrong with Javs in Vegas or the OC!
