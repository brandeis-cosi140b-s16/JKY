One of the best places for mexican food.  Usually get the machaca soft tacos and a 3-way burrito.  Anything covered in red enchilada sauce is also delicious.  Their tortillas are the best, get a dozen for the road.  I can eat them warm and plain right out of the bag and be perfectly happy.

This location doesn't have the ambiance of the OG laundry mat location, but it has it's unique features (old chinese buffet?).
