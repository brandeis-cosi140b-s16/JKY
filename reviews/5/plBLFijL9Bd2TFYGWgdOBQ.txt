Who would think they would have good Mexican food in Scottsdale, but they sure do.  I have never tried this place, and it was across the street from where the wife and I were staying so we decided why not.  It was cheap, around 25$ for both of us, and was good.  I ordered the chimichanga and it was really good and was pretty big.  The chips and salsa were tasty, as were the rice and beans.  Our server was great and checked in on us quite a few times.  Overall, it's a great place that's nice in the Scottsdale area.
