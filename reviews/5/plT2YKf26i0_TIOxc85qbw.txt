Federico's may look like David, but their food is more like the size of Goliath!

They produce some absolutely mouth-watering, authentic Mexican food that will fill your tummy to the brim without emptying your pockets.  Per the picture that I posted, they have $1.99 burritos and .99-cent tacos on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.

The burritos are enough to fill you for an entire meal.  So, if you are operating on a budget, you can spend $12 here and have enough to eat for three full days.  Or, on another note, if you need to feed six people for $12, that can be accomplished as well.

The burritos come with your choice of beans & cheese, red chicken (i.e. chicken in red salsa), green chili pork, or shredded beef.  The tacos can include all those and ground beef, but not the green chili pork.  I don't eat pork, but I can say that the red chicken and shredded beef burritos are off the hook in taste and are about 6 inches long and 3 inches wide.  So, move over Subway, there is a new 6-inch delight in town!  The carne asada and fajita burritos are also good.

The service is also cordial and quick.  Along with only a 2-5 minute wait, the girl at the cashier gives great recommendations.  They also have a drive-thru and some outdoor seating.

So, next time you pass this place on Camelback, make a u-turn and get yourself some of the best Mexican food in the area!
