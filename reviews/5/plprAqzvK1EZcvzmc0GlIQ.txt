Pepe's Taco Villa is truly authentic Mexican food, my parents are from Mexico so I grew up eating Mexican food, we moved to central Phoenix almost two years ago and always noticed the place next door to it with all the Mexican furniture but never noticed Pepe's..One Saturday night my boyfriend and I were thinking what should we eat? he's white and loves Mexican food, but I don't usually like what he likes because he likes kind of bland Mexican food, well we saw Pepe's and stopped there...oh my god their food is AMAZING!! and their services is really great, we have been there many times now in the past two months and recommend it to everybody, their enchiladas, tacos, mole, and menudo are very very tasty....I'm so glad we found a spot that we both like a lot.
