Not gonna lie I've drove past this place a few times and haven't scene a soul. Said screw it I'm gonna try it and I'm glad there's a taco shop with flavor since the other last taco shops. Filabertos is so bland. And this one has great burritos and tortillas. Breakfast burrito, bean and cheese burrito, carne asada burrito were really good. Staff was very nice and friendly. Will be back again. Hope the word gets out on this place.
