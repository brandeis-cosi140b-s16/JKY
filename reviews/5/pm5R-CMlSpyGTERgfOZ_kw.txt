We live so close by, but because of the horrible review we almost didn't come. All I can assume,  is somebody was a real grump and hit the place during opening week. What a pleasant surprise, the wait staff was friendly and fun, the food exceeded our expectations, best guacamole and Chili Relleno (and we've lived and traveled to many cities). The house Margarita was really good. Overall a great and needed addition to east Mesa. We will be back weekly!
