Great Mexican food!  We will drive from N. Scottsdale just to eat here!  Lunch time is packed with many Police Officers, they know where to get the good food!  

This is also where Richard of Richard's LaCanasta is located and usually there until lunch time, so even though they closed his store at 19Ave & Dunlap - Richard is alive and well and still has the best LaCanasta!
