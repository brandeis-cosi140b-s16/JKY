Starting off the meal with Chones is not always great. But when Chones is a drink is a blend of horchata and chambord then things will be good! We ate food that made our head explode because of the fusion of flavor. We started with elote. It was a street elote in a cup. A good step towards the main course. Our plates arrived with  Cochinito Pibil and chiles en nogada. The flavor was over the top. My Chiles had an fun combination of chicken, pomegranate, crema, pecans and chile that was a welcomed distraction from a normal stuffed chiles. Desert was the churros and ice cream combination.

Everything tasted amazing, homemade and made just for you. There was a great little cubano duo playing. 

This place is a hit!
