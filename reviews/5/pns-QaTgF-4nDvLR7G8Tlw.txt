I went to this place for the first time a few weeks after it opened, and have continued going without disappointment since.  Its like Chipotle or Qdoba, but more authentic.  Plus, I would much rather support a locally owned business than some huge chain anyway.
The only downside to this restaurant is that it lacks atmosphere, but if you're looking for a meal to take away, who really cares?  The staff is pleasant, the food is delicious, and its pretty inexpensive.
