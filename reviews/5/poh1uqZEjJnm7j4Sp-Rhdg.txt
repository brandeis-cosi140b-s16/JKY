For the price, the flavor and the serving size a delight!  On or way to full the rental car tank near Sky Harbor Airport,  we found this treasure. Crispy corn tortillas, thin flour tortillas and savory carne asada were topped with fresh ingredients of our choice. THIS was the meal I'd been waiting for on a trip to Arizona from the Twin Cities!
