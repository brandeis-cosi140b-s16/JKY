This place is super fun!  Had a great experience here a few months ago looking for a low-key hangout in Downtown Phoenix.  I was pleasantly surprised with the live latin jazz and the food options were great too!  

I recommend if you're looking for a smaller place free of heavily intoxicated people, this is the place to go.
