Awesome tamales, this place is legit.  I tried the cheese and jalepeno one, it was awesome.  I also had the cheese enchilada with rice and beans, also awesome.  The enchilada sauce is noteworthy.

The free chips and salsa come with green salsa and beans.  Beans!  They know the key to my heart.

Vegetarians have the normal options - cheese enchiladas, cheese tamales, vegetarian burrito, tostadas.

Prices are normal for a Mexican restaurant, my two-item combo was $12.99, but the tamale combos are more expensive.  Two enchilada combos were $9.99.

Service was fast and friendly, I will definitely go here again if I am in Vegas and craving Mexican food.
