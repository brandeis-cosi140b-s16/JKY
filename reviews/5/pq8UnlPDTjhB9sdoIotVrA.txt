Under new management. FRED from Chicago and his apprentice Sam have made some favorable changes to this fast food dine in delicacy.  I have always been a fan of Mexican food. My metabolism is constantly making me crave a massive amount of food.  If you are in the mood for a huge burrito, bowl, or tacos... this is your one stop shop.  Always consistent, fast and inexpensive.  Walking into the restaurant today, something was noticeably different.  Ah, yes it was the positive attitude from the gentleman behind the counter. Friendly, outgoing, smiling and pleasant would best describe his demeanor.  FRED a fellow Midwestern took over this bad boy 1 month ago and certainly has enhanced its flavor.  Have you been to a fast food restaurant before where the gm comes over to your table to see if everything is okay or you need a refill on your drink?  Welcome again back to chipotle.  what a positive experience today and had to yelp about it because this guy has gone the extra mile.  For a massive 2 pound burrito for under 10 bucks and quick..... this is your go to. enjoy.
