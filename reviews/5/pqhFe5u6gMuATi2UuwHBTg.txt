The CC Sizzle Sopapilla is like an Indian fry bread taco I had many years ago in Oklahoma. Meat is seasoned well and the Sopapilla was nice and fluffy. I also ordered the Bunuelos which my kids devoured in seconds, too bad this place closes so early, I could see this place being the go to munchy spot for all the "tobacco" smokers who frequent the smoke shop next door.
