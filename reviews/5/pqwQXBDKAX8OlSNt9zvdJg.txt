We came in Tuesday night and the food was amazing.  We were a group of four and my hubby had the chimichanga, I had a combination plate with enchilada, taco, and tamal, my daughter had the fiesta nachos and my son had the kids chicken quesadilla. We all loved our food with one exception, the tamal was mainly dough, not enough meat, but overall tasted real good.  I'm still giving them a 5 because overall everything was amazing and if you get a chance try the corona rita, awesome.
