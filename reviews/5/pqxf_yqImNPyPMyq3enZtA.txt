Ok, This is a follow up visit. We were here about a week ago, came back today for lunch, you know to see if first visit was a fluke........and it was no fluke. I had the same delicious Cod tacos, my wife had the fish and chips and we also had the crab cakes. I don't really care for anything but fish, so I tried the crab cakes, and boy, these were GREAT! My wife loved them too. She loved her fish, and I loved her fish as well, we share, and our server, she was so nice to us, we sat outside in the heat and it was very nice!. We are now going to be regular customers. I Give this place a big "Woo Hoo"
