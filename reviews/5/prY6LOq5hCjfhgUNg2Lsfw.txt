Many visits later, I'm still loving this place.  Food is consistently good, service is always quick, portions are large, and prices you can't beat.  The queso and veggie fajitas as still my favorites but I've branched out a little to try the taco salad (enormous, fresh, delicious) and they have a layered dip that's served hot and is off the hook.  

Sad that someone can navigate to Yelp to give this poor little place a bad review but is too lazy to do their own research in advance to eliminate surprises (pictures inside and out, list of what is included with meals and prices of items are all available on their website).  This place is pretty far from our office but we love it so it's worth the trip.
