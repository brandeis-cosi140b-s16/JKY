I'm from LA and happen to live in centennial hills now so j haven't had some good authentic Mexican food in a while.....maybe that's why but this place blew my mind...I ordered a bean and cheese and was annoyed it cost me $6 but when I got my burrito I realized why... HUGE. Typical Decor and wasn't the cleanest but well worth it. Whole menu is in Spanish employees are very nice but not so helpful. I will definitely be stopping here every time I'm on this side of town
