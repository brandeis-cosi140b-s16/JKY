Found these guys on yelp and stopped in for lunch. Its a little divey (in a positive way) place. It was clean, busy. I'm pretty sure the owners were working behind the counter. They were friendly and accommodating.

I was with a friend and we decided to split a plate of 4 tacos which came with 1 side of house beans, we also ordered a side of refried beans and two drinks.  The cost was about $12 for everything.  Chips were complimentary. There was a serve yourself salsa bar with vegetables, salsas, lemons and limes. Everything looked fresh and it was cleanBobbi

The tacos were served in a plastic basket,  wrapped in foil, the beans in  styrofoam cups. The house beans were soup like and they were excellent. The tacos were came with only one  thin shell which which made it difficult to hold the filling in. Two shells each would have been perfect, but still they were very good.

Overall I liked this place and would, for sure, stop in again if in the neighborhood.
