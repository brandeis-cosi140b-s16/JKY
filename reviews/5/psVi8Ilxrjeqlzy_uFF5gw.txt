Se√±or Tequila is nestled in the small shopping center of Piper Glen. Nothing too fancy. A few outside tables, a decent three-sided bar, tables on the inside, free chips and salsa....the works. 

They've got your standard choices of lunch specials ranging from tacos, burritos, chimichangas, and rice and beans. The one menu item that makes this place shine forth is the chile relleno. Holy eff...a flavorful creation that makes anything else I've ever had named "chile relleno" pale in comparison. It's not even fair. The breading they fry this thing in is perfectly soft, sweet, and mellow. So subtle, but the texture takes the lead. The chile itself is very mild. Stuffed with cheese and topped with a few different styles of salsas. I can't event begin to tell how magical the flavors are. It's one of their signature dishes and is easily the best thing on the menu. I'm pretty sure you can eat 4 of them. They are medium size and come with rice and beans. 

The service is always friendly, the margs are great (and huge, and the prices are very fair. You can't go wrong with a sturdy Mexican restaurant like this one! One of my favorites in town!
