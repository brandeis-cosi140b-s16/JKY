I've been lunching at this location for a little over a year since it is so close to my work and I cannot applaud this business enough.  The chicken tacos are amazing, the carne asada burrito is delicious and the quesadillas are amazing.  You cannot go wrong with anything on the menu.  Even the fish tacos and the ground beef tacos are amazing.  I cannot stop thinking about the chicken tacos and because of this I have them at least once a week.  I've even visited another Los Favs in Chandler and it couldn't hold a candle to this one.  Best Mexican food I've eaten in Arizona, period.
