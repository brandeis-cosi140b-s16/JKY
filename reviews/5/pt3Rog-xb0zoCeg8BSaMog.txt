We have been going to this Manuels since they opened and it is our "go-to" place in the west valley for mexican food. We absolutely love the food and always have great service. The salsa is amazing (plenty of green chile and cilantro, yum!), as are the margaritas and sopapillas. Our favorite meal is the pollo especial. Plenty of options for mild mexican food lovers like me!
