I moved to the Charlotte area about a year ago, and in that time frame, have eaten at Cabo Fish Taco approximately 5 times.  I originally wanted to eat here because of watching it on Triple D, and it has certainly proven to be worth the hype.  I am quite shocked at the number of mediocre to negative reviews on YELP for this restaurant (by my count it currently stands at 40% of reviews being 3 star or below).

This is, by far, one of the best restaurants I have ever been to in my life.  The BBQ Mahi and Tavura Tuna Tacos are incredible and delicious.  The Baha Shrimp dip appetizer is amazing as well.  As far as sides go, they are all good, but the Avocado Pasta Salad is the best.  I've also had the Steak-n-Cheese taco and one of the special fish tacos.  They were good also, but the real stars of this restaurant are the two tacos I mentioned above.

The wait can be bad on weekends but they use an app called NoWait that will allow you to track your wait status on your phone.  This is great compared to the normal method of buzzers because you can go wherever you want during the wait period and just track the updates on your phone.  You will get a text message when your table is ready.  Since NoDA is full of great restaurants and bars, you are able to go have a drink somewhere else while you wait for your table, then quickly walk back once you get the text that your table is ready.

The atmosphere is very chill with a Latin vibe, usually there is some reggae music in the background.  The ONLY thing this place is missing is live music, which I have not seen in my trips thus far.  I think that would really put this place into the upper echelen of chill/hang out places, but still, this is definitely a 5 star place to me.  Don't really get all the negative reviews but as they say "haters gonna hate."
