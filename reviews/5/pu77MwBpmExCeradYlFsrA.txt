Great place! Love the sports, music variety, and most of all the bean dip with onions and peppers with the delicious chips and salsa! The food is standard good Mexican what separates this place is price and quality, along with the bean dip and onions and peppers! And oh did I mention the bean dip, onions and peppers!? We'll be coming back!
