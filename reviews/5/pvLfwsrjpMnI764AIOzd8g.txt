Amazing food, don't be fooled by the outside lack of ambiance. Looks like a hole in the wall but the moment you walk in the door, you are greeted by happy staff who go out of their way to please. Chicken was the most delicious I've ever had on a chimichanga, all white meat and so moist, perfect. Great beans and rice, lots of food for the money. Even the iced tea was terrific. Go try it, you'll be glad you did.  Rudy's Rocks!!!
