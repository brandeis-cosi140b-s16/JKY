Found out about this place from Groupon and used a $10 for $15. It was great! Tried 6 different types of empanadas, chips and salsa, and tres leches cake - all soooo delicious! Then the chef brought us out horchata to try - not quite as good as La Condesa's, but still really yummy. The service was also above and beyond. I'll definately be back!
