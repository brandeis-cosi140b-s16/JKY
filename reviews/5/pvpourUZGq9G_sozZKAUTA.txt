Very nice brunch surprise this morning. The restaurant was opened for brunch for the first  time and it was awesome, with live mariachi, good mimosas for $3 amazing coffee and amazing chilaquiles verdes with chicken and eggs. Saul our waiter was really nice and helpful!
Editing my review, to top it off Kevin the manager came to our table and offered us a round of free drinks!
