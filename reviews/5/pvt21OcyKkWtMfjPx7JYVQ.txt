BEST Shrimp Tacos anywhere.  Great portion sizes.  Takes a little time to get the orders since they make it FRESH, but worth the wait.  Prices rose after remodel, but quality has remained. (Shrimp taco that is loaded is now about $3.  Fish Taco when on special is still under $2).
It's open 24 hours and is busy most times of the day.  Go inside if you want to help yourself to the salsa bar with numerous salsas and veggie options.
