So I finally checked out Taco a Guild after reading an article that it was voted one of top 10 taco restaurants In America. Couldn't believe that I was holding out so long. Plus I heard that it was at an old restored church. Super cool!

Came on a Sunday night and sat down at the bar. It was happy hour all night so I ordered a local beer and my wife had the house Margarita. Both very good. I love local breweries and was happy to see that Taco Guild carried all local taps. Went with Historic's Pie Hole Porter. See my review 
View of Historic Brewery in Flagstaff for more on that brewery!

We shared the 3 taco plate. Went with the cherry steak, shrimp, and pastor. All three were amazing with the cherry steak being my favorite. Wife liked the shrimp the best but you can't go wrong with any of them. If you order 3 tacos you get a free side which we chose the rice. Also when we sat at the bar we were served chips and salsa which was really good. All the salsa's were tasty and the chips were quality. 

What I really liked best with Taco Guild was the building. You can read all the reviews on here but it's really cool that it's in an old church. The bar was the alter and they kept the stained glass windows. I took a few photos of the inside and share them on Yelp. 

I was really impressed with Taco Guild. I can't wait to show my out if town friends and family that Phoenix does in fact have some quirky and unique restaurants. I can't wait till I come back for the food and the ambience.
