It seems there's a big rush to be the next big "build a burrito" restaurant, like Chipotle, Qdoba, etc. They can keep their trendy B.S. because I've found the best of the best and it's just down the street from my work.

Kokopelli Mexican Grill does everything fresh and healthy with plenty of options. They have tacos, taco salads, nachos, quesadillas, and of course burritos. Their meat, salsa, and carb choices are just as varied.

8 out of 10 times I get my old standby which is the chicken burrito with a whole-wheat tortilla, black beans, rice, corn salsa, and a little cheese. This thing is huge too, folks. I often can only eat about half and will take the other half back to work with me for round two. They do however have a grande version of their burritos just in case your appetite needs to be conquered brutally.

The other times I visit get split either by having a chicken quesadilla or a shrimp burrito. When I'm watching my spending I get the lunch special which is a chicken quesadilla, chips and a drink, but it is definitely a great point of variety, too, don't get me wrong.

When money is a little more available, I'll treat myself to a shrimp burrito which I'll also add their tasty guacamole to. This thing is really fantastic and still healthy my friends!

If I have one complaint it is their chips. They aren't bad mind you just boring. Even their great salsas and guacamole have a difficult time bringing joy to them. Because of this, I have not yet had their nachos. Maybe someday, but with all of the other choices, I'll happily abstain for now.
