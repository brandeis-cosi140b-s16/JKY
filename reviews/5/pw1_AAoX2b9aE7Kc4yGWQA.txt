My son introduced me to this amazing authentic Mexican place.  The owner is a great guy who understands the value of customer service.  The food is all made fresh and everything that I've eaten there has been delicious.  Everytime someone visits from out of town, I take them to Los Alamos Mexican Food to get the "Real" Mexican food experience.
