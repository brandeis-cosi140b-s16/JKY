Absolutely fantastic in every way. Friendly staff, fresh high quality food, and a nice atmosphere (as long as you're cool with Spanish music). I would highly recommend this place. I had the huevos rancheros and it is the best I've ever had. Free chips, bean dip & salsa with your meal! I will be coming back soon.
