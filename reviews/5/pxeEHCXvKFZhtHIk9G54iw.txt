We ate there last Tuesday. Its in the old spot where Chuy's used to be. We were greeted by the friendliest staff members. I wasn't sure what I wanted to order, there were so many good choices. I got the Al pastor tacos, and my boyfriend got some combo for one, that had steak, chicken and shrimp. He said it was delicious. My tacos were very tasty! Everything we had was delicious. We will definitely be coming back! Food was authentic and delicious, staff was friendly and checked on us frequently.
