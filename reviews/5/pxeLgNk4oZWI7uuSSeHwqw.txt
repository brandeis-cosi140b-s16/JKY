My wife and I absolutely love their salsa bar.  We always dine in and request an extra bowl of tortilla chips and load up on the pico de gallo.  No contest against the other salsa it is hands down the best option there.  We always order two orders of chicken enchiladas with red chile sauce on top (not NM red chile, but it still tastes good).  We don't bother with their green sauce which doesn't taste like green chile.  This is plenty of food for both of us.  After loading up on the salsa, my wife usually ends up with some leftovers while I have none.  We share a fountain drink or bring in our own bottle of water sometimes.  There is never a wait and the food is consistently good.  If we need a box, we usually help ourselves to one slightly behind the counter if they are super busy or ask for one ourselves.  Mexican food can make my wife sleepy so we can only go here when she doesn't have to study/do homework/work on a college project.  When her mom visited from India (who is a vegetarian), she ordered the vegetarian burrito and that was also good.  So now that is a backup for us when we don't feel like having chicken.  I grew up in New Mexico eating the best green chile new mexican food in the world.  It takes a lot to impress me when it comes to mexican food.  Most places here in the valley are either more expensive for ambiance (but the food isn't much better or is not as good) or don't measure up.  Or too far of a drive for us for a very small step up.  I keep holding out hope someone will open a new mexican restaurant in the valley with green chile that will make your eyes water and forehead sweat (as an option, not the default for others who can't take it).

We make excuses to come to this location when we're shopping at Walmart or just for the heck of it.  It's only one exit away since we're in North Glendale.
