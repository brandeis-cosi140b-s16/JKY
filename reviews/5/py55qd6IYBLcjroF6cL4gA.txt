Very good food! Their salsa is extremely fresh! Anita's is one of our favorite places to eat. They had moved since we last visited Charlotte into a smaller place. I would now consider it a hybrid mix of "fast food" &"traditional". You order at a counter and take it on a tray to a seat (but infinitely better than places such as Taco Bell), but they fix it to order and you will have to wait a few minutes while they prepare it.
The staff is super friendly and helpful if you have no clue what to order. And you cannot beat their prices! 
I will admit, I liked it even better when it was a traditional Mexican restaurant where the salsa keeps coming as long as you keep emptying the bowl, but we will definitely be returning here to eat every time we are in the area!
