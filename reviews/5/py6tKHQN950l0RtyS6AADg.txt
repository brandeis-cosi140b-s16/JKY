If I ever had to choose a Prisoner's Last Meal (probably not, this is just a thought experiment), it would have to be the amazing mole' enchilada at CornFlower! Minced chicken, folded tortilla, and slathers of the yummiest mole'. Oh, and the peach cake, which could hold its head up at the priciest restaurant in town. Super friendly and accommodating staff. Kitchen gods, please shine on this cozy little place and keep it going . . . and going . . .
