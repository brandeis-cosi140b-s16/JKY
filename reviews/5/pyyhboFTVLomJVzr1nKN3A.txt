Evette our server was awesome!

quick service. all the employees were really nice.

sat at bar table. Had the guacamole and chips. Really tasty and a little bit of spice. did a variety of tacos. Their taco menu resembles a sushi menu in that there are probably like 20 or so and you check off how many you want. Pulled pork, the cameron or shrimp tacos in beer battered victoria were awesome. Even have a pork taco that has cactus grilled in it. Salsas were great. 

tacos are nice size but not too big. Get a bunch of them and enjoy. They have all the mexican beers in bottles and draft plus looked like a ton of tequilas.


Quick Tip!!!!

If you go in during the busy winter season, if they say they are completely booked ask if you can grab a table that needs to be cleared before the next reservation. Quite a number of people arrived at 5:40pm for example and were told if you can be done by 7pm then you can have a table right now as opposed to waiting 2 hours. 

Not sure why some people claim the service here is bad or give it poor reviews because servers suggest drinks or apps. Thats what they are supposed to do!.
