The waitress, Katey was awesome!! She was very knowledgeable about the menu and was able to provide suggestions about everything. I ordered the guacamole with crab and goat cheese and it was awesome. My partner ordered the short ribs with mashed potatoes and beans. He's still raving about the taste but wanted more vegetables. One of the best Mexican restaurant in Charlotte hands down !
