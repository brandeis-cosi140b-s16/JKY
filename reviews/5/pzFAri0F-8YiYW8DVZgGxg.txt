Taxi Tuesday is the bomb.  I'm here almost every Tuesday for lunch.   Their carnita with pineapple in it is amazing.   I put pico, cilantro,  guac, jalape√±o and their habenero sauce is very flavorful and had a great kick. 
They are quick with the lines out to the door.   They are friendly and know what the regulars order.
