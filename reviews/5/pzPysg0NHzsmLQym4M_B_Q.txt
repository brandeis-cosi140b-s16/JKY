It really happened!  It was amazing!

Okay, the review I recently left was not positive. No doubt about that. But the response to the review was amazing.  The GM contacted me and apologized and asked if we would return and see the changes they have made as a result of the reviews here on Facebook.  That is amazing! Our reviews make a difference.  

Well, of course I would go back. I love everything about the food at Taco Guild.  So back we went. We sat at the bar...and within minutes we were welcomed and invited to review Happy Hour pricing. We talked about various drinks and met "Michael" - the bartender.  PERFECT!  Honestly.  I barely got my order in with Michael and the chips and salsa - warm and oh so yummy - were placed in front of us. Waters delivered promptly and dishes, napkins and utensils arrived immediately...it was magical.

Did we want to eat?  Yes, yes we do! We ordered tacos and a salad and then more chips arrived and drinks were filled and we were just settling in and our food arrive.  IMMEDIATELY.  Or well, my hubby's food arrived...my steak took longer than the expected so my salad was a tad longer to arrive.  Still unsure how that happened but...it eventually arrived and I had more time to monopolize the warm and tasty chips.

The salad was new to me. I liked it a lot. I would have liked a tad more cheese and nuts, but the fruit and streak was perfect.  The Kale was substantial and very crunchy.  I even took some home for lunch :-).  Kale is the best!

I wasn't offered dessert so I don't know if they have any.  I was offered another drink, and I gladly ordered one and left with quite a warm and happy feeling. For the record, that was three drinks and I was not driving :-).  

I highly recommend Michael at the bar. He's delightful and very engaging.  He is thoughtful and attentive.  He works most evenings.  I observed him with the other patrons and he was equally efficient with everyone. Thank you Michael.
