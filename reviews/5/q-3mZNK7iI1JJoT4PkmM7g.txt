A place with tons of character amidst the jungle of strip malls.

If you have not ventured to the Rokerij, it is time to do so quickly. I highly recommend going there for happy hour in the wine cellar like bar. Caution: be careful when you are trotting down the stairs, they are steep. Totally worth the risk though.

Once downstairs you are immediately greeted by the lovely fireplace as well as the lovely music and delightful smell that fills the air. During happy hour, all small plates are $5, which gives you the perfect opportunity to eat your way through various dishes.

The drinks are also lovely, and the wine list is superb. I highly recommend the brie toasts and  chile relleno. All dishes are full of flavor with a nice little kick to awaken the senses. Aside from happy hour, the brunch menu coupled with mimosas or bloody marys is the perfect hangover cure.
