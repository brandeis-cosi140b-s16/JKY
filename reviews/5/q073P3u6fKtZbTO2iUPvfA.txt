I have been going here since 2009. The place is amazing, I can however only vouch for their steak, potato, cheese burrito and their breakfast burrito. Their steak, potato cheese is 5 stars! The breakfast one is only about a 3.5. But their green sauce is where it's at. It makes the burrito so much more delicious than it already is. I use to go twice a week if not more lol.
