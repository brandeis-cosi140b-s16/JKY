My sister and I stopped for lunch yesterday after we got pedicures (try LK Hand and Foot Spa!). 

Both of us are fans of Mexican food, and this spot was right around the corner from, her house.  When we arrived, at about 1pm, there was only a single table available, but we were seated immediately, and our server was quite pleasant.  We decided to split a couple of appetizers and opted for a cheese crisp with green chile and a platter of other sides.  The 
platter was good, but the star for me was the crisp.  It was perfectly crisp, flaky and delicious. 

Their service was quick and pleasant, their prices quite reasonable, and the atmosphere comfortable. I will come back next time I am in town!

PS They only have a single stall in their bathroom, so plan accordingly. :)
