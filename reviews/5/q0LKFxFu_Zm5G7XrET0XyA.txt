Amazing service, food & atmosphere. Every time! The staff managers; Matt & Nancy are wonderful. They are pleasant & very accommodating! Rayna & Patrick are cashiers--super helpful, friendly & always see them doing "busy work" when all customers have been served. Love this location & their wonderful staff! Fish tacos are on point!
