This place has awesome tacos. Tacos is one of those foods where it is on, or off.
For example, in Los Angeles, King Taco is a taco chain that is popular, but I must say i am not much of a fan of King Taco, buy definitely a Fan of Yayo.
Besides the basic flavors, their specialty tacos are really good. The Shanghai is an excellent fusion of Asian and Latin spices. The crispiness of the Pescado (fish) was to absolute perfection!
