Great atmosphere, fantastic tasting food with great flavor and spice. The free chips and salsa are delightful. The waitstaff was also very nice and allowed you to pick where you sit. It was my first time here and I got the shredded chicken burrito plate. I would definitely return to try something else. I cleared my whole plate and was greatly satisfied. Just the right amount of food if your craving a big sized meal for a good price. 

You can't go wrong with eating at this place!
