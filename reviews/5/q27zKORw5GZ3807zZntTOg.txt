Went for dinner again tonight.  We ordered the Crab Legs Las Islas Del Mar style.  (I posted a pic).  
OMG!!  Absolutely freaking FABULOUS!!  That giant platter of crab legs was $35!!  They are not served with drawn butter, but the shells are coated in some kind of awesome spice blend.  You do NOT need butter!  Finger licking good!  Almost every cluster had a claw on it too, which is absolutely unheard of.  
We will SO be ordering that again!
