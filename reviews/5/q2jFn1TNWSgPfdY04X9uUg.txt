We stopped here after the Pirates game the other night. We were exhausted, but the drinks here were so good that we were right back in it. We ordered a couple apps, they were alright, your typical chain texmex . But they were warm and came out fast, so they were still perfect.

The best part of this restaurant is by far the staff. So friendly and totally at your service. The manager, Jake, stopped by multiple times and was so funny. The bartenders knew what we needed before we did, and we ended up staying all night. Definitely check it out if you're in the area.
