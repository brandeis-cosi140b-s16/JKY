I know 5 stars for taco bell. What am I thinking right? Seriously though, this taco bell makes me smile every time I go through their drive through. 

Who would have thought that I would take the time to review a Taco Bell, but this place I had to. It's just that good. 

What's so good about it? The service, the service and the service. Yes 3 times. It's just that good. 

The food is what you'd expect, but the service is just out of this world. Did I mention their service? Yes. That good. So good that I had to take some time and write about it and tell everyone. 

You'll get a friendly person taking your order and a smile when you receive your food with a warm friendly good bye. Wow. I was not expecting this from a fast food joint. Let alone Taco Bell. Kudos to the management and the training. You guys are doing a stellar job. Don't stop. 

Thumbs up for their friendly service and their crunch wrap supreme. You guys are awesome.
