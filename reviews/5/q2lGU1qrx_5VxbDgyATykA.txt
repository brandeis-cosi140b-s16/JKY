I'm sitting here eating a reheated bean and cheese burrito (enchilada style) from Saturday. I usually eat  healthier lunches, but when it comes to Los Compadres my morals are easily compromised.

This location will always hold a special place in my heart. I love that they have not updated the dining rooms, and the 70's charm remains. This is a 5 star joint for me. 

Really good Mexican food should have certain characteristics and Los has mastered all of them:
The salsa is amazing, spicy, chunky and full of flavor. 
They make killer guacamole, no tomatoes! 
The cheese crisp are always well done.
The carne asada marinade they use is fantastic. It has the perfect blend of spice, tang and citrus.  
Just like Paula Dean they know everything but my waistline is better with butter. 

No it is not healthy, but they don't claim to be. It is just pure, greasy, cheap Mexican goodness.
