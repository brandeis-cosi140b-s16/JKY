We had originally went to Cafe Rio however they were about to close and didn't want to be their last clients of the night. We went to Chipotle instead. Chiptole's corporate responsibility is their biggest strength. their food is fresh and more Americanized Mexican food which is good unless you really want authentic Mexican food. I had their burrito bowl without rice or meat. It was delicious and the portion was big enough to feed me and I normally eat large portions despite my small frame. I will definitely go back. The service is great and they always make sure to wish you a good day/night when you are leaving. The restaurant is very clean and their decor is interesting. 

What made this meal memorable was the speed, portion, and overall service experience.
