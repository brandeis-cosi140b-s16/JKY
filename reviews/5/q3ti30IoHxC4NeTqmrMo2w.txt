I went here a couple of weeks ago with two friends. It was a Thursday night and not busy at all. We sat in the bar area and I really enjoyed the atmosphere - very open, big, and TVs on but not playing loudly. Our waiter was super friendly. My friend ordered enchiladas with all the sauce on the side, which is an unusual request, but he was very accommodating and had it done no problem. I had a mojito which was really good, and three different kinds of enchiladas, all of which were amazing. Overall a great experience and I'll definitely go back.
