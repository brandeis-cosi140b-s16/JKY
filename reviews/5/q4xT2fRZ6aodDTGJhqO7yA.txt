Excellent fish tacos (used to come here every Tuesday for $1.25 tacos) now that I can't eat those I've been exploring the GF menu. The other night I had a grilled Mahi taco and gourmet steak taco (be careful those come with bacon) Both were really good. I also really like the Pinto beans.. I usually put some salsa and cabbage from my tacos in it. Yum! 

My favorite salsa is a mix the two red ones. I get the bigger salsa cups from behind the counter and do one scoop of each. Try it! 

Service st this location has always been friendly and quick. 

Also they have an easy to use online and in store allergen (dairy & gluten free) menu. 

One of my favorite taco places.
