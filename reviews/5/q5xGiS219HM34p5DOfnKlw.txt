Been to many typical Mexican restaurants around the Charlotte area over the years. Stumbled upon Veracruz and wow! Very good lunch specials, including the Cheesesteak burrito. Very tasty steak and black beans wrapped in a burrito covered in cheese sauce dip. Side of lettuce, tomato, sour cream rice and beans. Muy Bueno!
