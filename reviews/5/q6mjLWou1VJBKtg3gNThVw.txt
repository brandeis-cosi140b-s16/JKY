was sorry to see bub's go, but had I known this great place would pop up soon after I might not have been so sad. they've got a great food and a variety of stuff. I've been going there quite a bit and get something different every time. the enchiladas are really good, although different than the ones from burrito drive. i always take the food to go, but the service is great. i can always count on a recommendation if i'm feeling indecisive. the new lunch and dinner specials have some great choices. regarding the portions sizes and price, i think it's fair. the food is great compared to something that's $2-3 cheaper. sometimes i eat a whole meal in one sitting, but usually not as they can be somewhat large. most (all?) of the meals come with rice and beans. try the horchata instead of soda!
