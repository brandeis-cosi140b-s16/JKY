This is place is awesome.


So they revamped this place this past year and definitely for the better. So i got a taco, 3 rolled tacos w/ guacamole, and a tostado for 5 bucks! 10% discount to midwestern students. Everything was delicious! (but maybe not the healthiest). Also a bag to tortilla chips alittle over a dollar for a huge bag.

Only problem is that this place isnt open 24 hours.
