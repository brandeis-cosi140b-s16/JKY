Headed up Hwy 93, Phoenix to Las Vegas, time for lunch, googled "best place to eat in Wickenberg, Az." Yelp and other reviewers led us to El Rancho. This group of travelers thoroughly enjoyed our various meals. Colorful, creative environment, friendly staff, excellent food. Definitely recommended. Soy encantado!
