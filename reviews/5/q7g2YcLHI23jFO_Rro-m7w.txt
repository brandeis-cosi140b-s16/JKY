Have visited here for several months and I am finally getting around to reviewing. The staff is fast and friendly. Over the last year I have seen the food and service get tremendously better. The manager noticed I became a regular and has introduced himself and always asks how my experience is. Its great for a quick bite or to have a cocktail after a long day at their bar. The atmosphere is great if you like to sit at the bar, at a table inside, and they have outdoor, covered seating with televisions so it is great for summer as well!I love Mexican food, but the staff are what keep me coming back!!
