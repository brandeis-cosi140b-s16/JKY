I agree with the other yelpers who have reviewed this place - yay for another taco shop in Pittsburgh. This place is great.  Affordable and FAST.  We have recently visited some of the other new taco shops in Pittsburgh and waited 45 minutes for lunch. Casa Rasta was speedy.  We tried 3 tacos and a torta. I am not normally a fan of vegetarian sausage but the soyrizo here was amazing.  Definitely worth a stop.
