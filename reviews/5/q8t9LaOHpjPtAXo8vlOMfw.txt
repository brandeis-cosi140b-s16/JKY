This is the absolute best burger joint I've ever been to in my entire life. The burgers aren't big like the burgers at fancy restaurants, but they're better this way. The buns are crispy on the inside. The patties are tender and crunchy on the outside. The ingredients are tasty and fresh. The chencho fries, my god, those chencho fries are immaculate. Just go already, you won't regret it.
