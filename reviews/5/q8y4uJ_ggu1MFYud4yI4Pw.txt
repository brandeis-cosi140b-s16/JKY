I will admit the tacos are pretty good .. The salsas are delicious .. All in all great food.. The price is a bit high since they are so good you can't eat just three.. And the portions can sometimes be small as they do limit the amount of meat and toppings on them .. But no matter what they are worth every penny! The staff is super friendly... Will definitely return for more!
