I was torn between giving this restaurant a 4 or a 5 because the carnitas tacos are to die for but the sauce on the chile rellenos was average. We came by La Mexicana Bakery about half an hour before they were closing and not a single customer was inside which I immediately feared to be an indication of bad food.

We were greeted by a pleasant woman who took our order and we told her that we had come here just because of reviews from other people. She smiled graciously and said that indeed, they did have the best tacos in Las Vegas. I was brimming with excitement to try these hyped up tacos and I was greatly rewarded. The tacos were in fact so-so delicious and authentic, just like the ones my fiance and I had in Manzanillo. We ordered 10 tacos and the chili rellenos (which were good but the sauce needed more flavor) We got home and gobbled the food up, stuffed, but wishing we had ordered more because it was so good.

---After further thought, I decided to give La Mexicana 5 stars just because their tacos are so amazingly delicious.
