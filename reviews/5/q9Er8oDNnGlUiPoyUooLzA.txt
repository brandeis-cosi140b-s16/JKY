Was here on Thursday, 12/11/2013, to see French Horn Rebellion.  Very nice beer selection, and VERY impressed with the barbacoa tacos with the guacamole that I had.  Delicious!  Staff was very nice and engaging, and the crowd was very pleasant and courteous (people complimented me on my dancing :) ), like people have already said.  I'm definitely coming back here again.
