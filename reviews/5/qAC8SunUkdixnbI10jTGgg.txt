I can't believe I found this place a month before I move to the other side of the world. Lame. I'll have to visit again before I get on the plane. The cochinitas sandwich... it is the pork to end all pork, my friends. So sweet and succulent with little crunchy bits.... mmmmm! And the chocolate pudding thing... mwah *kissy fingers* 

P.S. I hate eating in the dark, but this was worth it.
