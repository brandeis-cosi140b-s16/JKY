This place has a very low key feel to it.  The bar is outside (which I loved) and the food is indoors. The only complaint I have is that we sat outside with menus in our hands for 15 minutes waiting for someone to take our order only to learn that you order inside and they will deliver the food to your bar stool. It would have been nice to get those instructions when we were handed the menus. Either way the atmosphere was excellent and the food was good.
