Amazing, unique food, and great service!

Nothing else like it in Las Vegas, if you're looking for something different to wake up your taste buds this is the place!  Chicken, beef, pork, tofu & egg tacos and then the hot dogs ('Nate'/Korean dog) my fave... you've got a lot to choose from!

For the reviews that talk about an hour wait, you happen to be there on the rare day they were doing a food truck contest, what do you expect with that large a group of people?!  Yes, it takes a few minutes for them to cook the food, as they are cooking it fresh, (this is not a fast food joint!) but I've never waited more than maybe 5 minutes on any other day.

Highly recommended to anyone wanting unique, quality food with a smile.
