I absolutely love this place! We've been going here for years now. The food is so delicious and the employees are always friendly and nice.

We especially love the beef chimichangas, fish tacos, enchiladas, and taquitos. But from experience you can't go wrong with anything you order. We usually call ahead and pick up our food. 

Don't forget to ask about their specials...great deals with those.
