I live in San Diego, but my best friend lives in Goodyear. I LIVE for this place...I literally count the days until I can go back and have another burrito. 

My husband and I talk about this place all year round. Breakfast burritos every day while we are in AZ. At least once before we leave a surf & turf burrito. 

Headed back to AZ tomorrow...you will see me here....a LOT in the next few days! 

The chipotle sauce. OMG. I could pour it over everything I ever eat for the rest of my life. 

****HIGHLY RECOMMEND***
