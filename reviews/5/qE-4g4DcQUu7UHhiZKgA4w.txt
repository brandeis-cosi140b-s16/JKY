Richardson's was a staple for me when I lived in Phoenix plus it was walking distance for me. Beware if you plan on going after 6pm any night of the week you will be waiting for a table, but don't forget to check dick's hideaway right around the corner, same menu, different spot. All the drinks are great, the prickly pear marg is a must. The food is delicious. I have had everything on the menu and I swear for the garlic platter, the crusted Chilean sea bass (when they have it), The trio plate( pork tenderloin, fillet, and rack of lamb, the relleno platter, the rack of lamb. The burger is great, the chimayo chicken, in all reality you can order anything on the menu and it will be great. The only thing I have had that I wouldn't order again was the tamales but I make my own so I am biased. The atmosphere is dark and sexy. It is a nice comfy place, very small and packed but nice. The service is always good. They have great deals on wine before 4pm. And let us not forget they serve the best breakfast in town on the weekends!
