Yum Yum Yum Yum...........   I am from southern California and lived in San Francisco before Las Vegas and I have be fortunate enough to have eaten lots of amazing street food.   Since I moved  here 1 1/2 years ago I have been searching for great street tacos and I have finally found them.  The Al Pastor is not like any I have had before and all 3 salsa's were so delicious that I had to keep alternating to try each one with my tacos.  This was a fantastic you will never be disappointed Al Pastor.  I can't wait to pass on this hot spot to all my foodie friends.  I will for sure be back!
