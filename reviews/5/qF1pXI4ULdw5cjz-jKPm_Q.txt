Came here for dinner today, (Tuesday) 
The service was GREAT, very attentive, and quick!
The tacos were delicious. The handmade tortillas really add to the taste.
We tried just about every taco on the menu.
The ones that really stood out were the Puerco Verde Taco, Adobada Taco, Al Pastor and Crunchy Taco. These were absolutely amazing. We did not enjoy the Carne Asada taco or shrimp taco as much as the others, but they were okay.

The chips and salsa were fresh.
All around great food, keep it up!
