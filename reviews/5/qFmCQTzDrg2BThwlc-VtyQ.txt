Had a horrible pedi experience next door and it was lunch time. I heard it was good food, but it is fantastic! I love true Mexican food and this joint hits the jackpot. The Tamarind juice is awesome. 
  It looked like you could order but they take your order at the table. Free chips and medium heat salsa while you wait. Actual silverware which is a nice touch, very clean decor and bathrooms. Music is old school Salsa, took me back a few years. Overall a great meal,  the only minus is that they were out of flan. Not to be missed if you love home cooking.
