Loved this place! I stopped at Tacos El Compita for lunch driving from the strip to red rock and I'm so glad I did. I had the torta de carnitas and it was delicious- tasty, well-seasoned meat and with lettuce, tomato and avocado stuffed in toasty bread. Great flavor! If you're looking for quick, authentic mexican comfort food, definitely give this place a try.
