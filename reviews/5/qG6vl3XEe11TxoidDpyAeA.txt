The BEST Mexican food I have had in Arizona and the service is even better.  It took maybe 2 min for the food to come out which normally would leave me to believe that it was not freshly cooked, but luckily I was wrong.

My taco and chicken enchilada plate with Christmas sauce was bomb!  Only problem was that my boyfriend's chimichanga came out as a burrito...which was not a problem at all because unprompted the manager came over and asked to exchange it for the chimichanga ordered. Poof like magic maybe a minute later there it was!

La Ristra is a great dining experience backed by even better service and staffing.  This is a new house favorite and we will be returning many many times!
