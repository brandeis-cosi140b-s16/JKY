The duck brisket is phenomenal and one of the best dishes I've had.  Husband and I loved the ceviche and corn dish as well.  We also did get good service but went for the start of the dinner service so not sure if that's what made a difference.  Hope this restaurant does well because as someone who grew up in Phoenix but now lives elsewhere and visits often, I think Phoenix needs a lot of help with the number of innovative restaurants.   This does that.
