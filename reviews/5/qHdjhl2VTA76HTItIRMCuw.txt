Oh I've missed this Mexican restaurant so much!  I was in town and had to make this our first stop.  

Garcias has a few locations around Arizona.  I used to frequent the Chandler location, which I loved!  Since we were driving right past this location off of Peoria we were definitely going to show them some love.

We were seated immediately with our waiter getting our drink order quickly.  Another lady brought our salsa, chips and bean dip while we were waiting for the meal.  Their bean dip is still my favorite.  It has a bit of a kick to it which i love.  Since they keep bringing more for the table, I just can't resist.

I ordered my favorite dish - Seafood Fundido.  I can find this anywhere else.  A tortilla filled with shrimp and crab, then fried, then topped with jalape√±o cream cheese with melted monterey cheese on top.  Some other places have a similar dish but it doesn't come close to this.  My husband always orders the Pollo Fundido which is as equally amazing.  

Service was great and the food was just as fantastic as I remembered.  Thanks Garcias!
