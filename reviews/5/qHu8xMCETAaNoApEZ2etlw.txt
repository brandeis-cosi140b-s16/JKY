Had a party of 22 in last night for a work party.  We were sat in a part of the restaurant that was quieter that the main area but still in the mix of other customers. The wait staff was very attentive and took care of our every need.  Food and drinks were great especially the shrimp tostata bites and margaritas. Will definitely be back.
