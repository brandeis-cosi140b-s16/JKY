This is a local establishment that serves hot fast delicious food. I tried the special of the day a chicken burrito and got the chipotle style chicken. It was awesome! The cilantro rice was tasty and the saut√© peppers and onions gave it a good balance. If you haven't checked this place out, you really should.
