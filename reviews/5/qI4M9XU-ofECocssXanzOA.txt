Great place to grab dinner for the family.  My son had chicken hard shell tacos and he loved them!  I had the Ava and it was unbelievably delicious.  It was definitely worth the trip for this alone! We called our order in and it was hot and ready when we pulled up to the drive thru.  Huge portions and reasonable prices.  We will be making this a regular stop for dining out nights.
