Enjoyed eating here on Sunday with a group of 8. We were seated promptly when we showed up without making any reservations. The waiter was extremely helpful and was attentive. He came back every time someone was running low on drinks. We always order  the guacamole that they come around and make fresh and its some of the best guac I have tasted. The location itself is wonderful and the space is quite big and they utilize it well. 

The food itself is some of the best Mexican food I've had in the Carolinas. I constantly ask my friends "is it as good as Azteca?" I usually order the chicken carnitas or arroz con pollo and I have never been disappointed. When I used to live in Charlotte I would frequent here for lunch and their specials are excellent with many starting at around $7. 

Overall great place with excellent affordable food.
