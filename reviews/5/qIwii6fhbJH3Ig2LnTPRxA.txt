This place was great. Being from Chicago I was skeptical of Mexican food in Wisconsin, but this place delivered. The flavors were spot on. The only thing missing was the heat. I had the enchiladas verdes and the little chile on the menu meant that the meal was spicy, but it wasn't. Maybe it was Wisconsin whitey spicy, but not authentic Mexican spicy.
Overall, very pleased
