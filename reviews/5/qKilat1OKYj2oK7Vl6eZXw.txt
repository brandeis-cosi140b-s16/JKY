Second time here already in a week! We absolutely love this place! The food is phenomenal and the drinks are fantastic. We love Lenny Rosenbergs restaurants and this does not disappoint! We loved Revo but this is great upgrade. It's a must try and one of our new favorite places. I highly recommend the smoked brisket taco and the smoked pork!
