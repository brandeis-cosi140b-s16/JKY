I live close to this Taco Bell location, and have been here several times in the past year.  Every time I go the staff is super polite, and the order is always correct.  My husband and I have been impressed by them, because for a fast food joint, everything is normally subpar in that regard.  I go through the drive thru and don't eat in the dining room, so I can only speak on the drive thru aspect.
