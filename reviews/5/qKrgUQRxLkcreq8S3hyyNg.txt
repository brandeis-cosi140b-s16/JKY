I love tortas Paquime. I love the service the tortas are the best in Phoenix. I've had Los Reyes de la torta (their competitors) they don't come close. I had a torta ahogada it was delicious. This location is very clean and the employees actually seem to enjoy their job. I hope they stay in the area...
