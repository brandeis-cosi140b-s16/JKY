Mexx32 is such a fun neighborhood addition!  The bar and table seating is open, not cramped, and the whole vibe of the place is laid back and cool.  

We went for Taco Tuesday (who can beat $4 for a taco and a Tecate), and was pleasantly surprised with the food quality and service.  Our waitress was incredibly friendly, and the owner, Lenny, made sure to introduce himself and gave us some advice on what to try for the next time we visit.  One thing that stood out for us, was that the taco Tuesday special is usually a fried taco (chicken or beef), but we asked if we could have our not fried, and they were happy to accommodate. So glad they could do that for us!  Not only was the taco tasty, but the other items we had from the happy hour menu (Mon-Fri until 7pm) were also delicious!  My favorite has to be the breakfast burrito.  Trust me on this one......it's large, in charge, and worth it ;)

Looking forward to going back to enjoy more tasty Mexican treats!
