Man,that was the best Tortilla Soup I  had in my 27 years on Planet Earth.It doesn't get any better than this when it comes to Tortilla Soup.My wife had 2 drinks that knocked her off her feet and we had a ball.I actually ran into this place just walking around the mgm grand.I cant wait to go back.I wish I could have it frozen and delivered.lol
