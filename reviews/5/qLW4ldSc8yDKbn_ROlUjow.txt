Not from Vegas but was driving thru. Was just going to grab something on the strip, but decided to give this a try. Blown away. Best fish tacos I've ever had....the el fish taco was excellent. Poblano was great. I didn't try the costras but my dad did. He said "best food in Vegas". 

Do try something with the chipotle sauce. It's great. 

Service was also excellent.
