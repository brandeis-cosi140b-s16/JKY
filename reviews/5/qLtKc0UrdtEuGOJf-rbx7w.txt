I had the sausage breakfast burrito and my girlfriend had the bacon breakfast burrito. Both were fantastic! Not dry like most breakfast burritos from the chains. Also pricing was very reasonable. Service was good from start to finish on our order. Two thumbs up. This is a must try for breakfast if you are in the area. I plan to try a lunch/dinner item next. After which, I will update my review to include the latter.
