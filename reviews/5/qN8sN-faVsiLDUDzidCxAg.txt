I would highly recommend this place for some authentic hispanic food in Champaign, IL. The place is decorated in typical mexican style. They have nice and clean facility with cramped up sitting. Not much privacy for couples but who cares when the food is so good. 

Try anything on the menu and you will not be disappointed. They have sandwiches as well. All of the food is prepared from fresh ingredients and that makes it delicious. I don't know about authenticity of the taste but this definitely tingles my taste buds. I would be a regular here for a nice lunch or dinner.
