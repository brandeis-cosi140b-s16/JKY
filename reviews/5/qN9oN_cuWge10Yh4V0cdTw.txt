This is THE place I tell everyone to try in Phoenix.  I am obsessed.  I think 'trendy' is the best way to describe the hotel and this restaurant.  It's pretty much the first comment from any newcomer that I bring here.  

Food is fantastic and the price is right.  The shrimp tacos are the best i've had in Phoenix.  The ahi tuna tacos (When they have them) are fantastic.  The pork belly tacos (also limited selection) are good.  The guacamole is great.  The elote callejero is something you must order every time you go here.  Seriously. 

The woman and I can get 2 apps, 2 beers and 6 tacos for less than $40.

Just go.  Seriously.
