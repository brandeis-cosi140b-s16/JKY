This is one of my favorite restaurants period. They make everything fresh and even make their own chips. The mini tacos are super affordable at $1.20 a piece. I an a big fan of really authentic Mexican food and I have to say they excel at this. They have done of the best lengua I've ever tried and their tripas is always crispy. This is my favorite place to go when my work isn't serving something good for lunch (yes, I'm spoiled lol)

Also try the jamaica, they make their own and they do it very very well.
