AMAZING CUSTOMER SERVICE.  I came to this location at the end of the day to meet a friend for a quick bite.  I love rubios fish tacos but these had an awkward taste of funky grease.  I notified the gal behind the counter -  they were more than happy to replace the item with some chicken tacos with out question.  I'm usually not one to send food back - but when I might get sick I'll comment .  Thanks guys for making a possible bad experience an amazing one.
