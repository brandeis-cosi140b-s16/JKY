This place is our jam!  Recommended- fajitas!  We get the "For 2" option and always have leftovers!  It's also very reasonably priced- chicken for 2 for $18!

The chips and salsa are yummy...if you like spicy they have 2 hot ones, but you have to ask for them.  :)

Margaritas are weak but they always have a beer special!  Dos Equis....yum!
