The very best tacos in town. The Aztec Tinga is fantastic...but the real star of the show is the Napoleon taco. 

Also fantastic are the quesadillas...and they will forever change the way you think about them. You'll never order a quesadilla from Taco Bell ever again. You've been warned. THESE quesas are puff pastries filled with gorgeous things, and then topped with Mexican sour cream. 

Also check out their salsa bar. Too many to choose from; and there are no wrong choices to make.

Run to La Condesa. Run past every other mediocre Mexican restaurant to get here because THIS place is the real deal.
