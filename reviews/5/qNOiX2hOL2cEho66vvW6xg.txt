The little lady and I have been to Gadzooks numerous times, and we love it. It is one of central Phoenix's gems, and if nothing else, it is the best Mexican food at this particular intersection (those of you familiar with the intersection will know what I'm referring to). It's funny, every time we go it takes us a few minutes to figure out what we want. The staff is always quick to offer to explain how things work and discuss any recent changes on the menu. I want to tell then we have been before, but they are so friendly, we just let them explain it. 

The concept is pretty simple, it is Chipotle style enchiladas. They also have soup, but we haven't had it so I can't vouch.  The enchiladas are excellent. The yukon gold sounds odd (a potato enchilada?), but I crave them like a fat kid craves cake. I am also partial to the short rib, and pork. Others are good too, but I can (or at least should) only eat three per sitting so this is my typical order. We prefer the green sauce, but we usually do. The slaw is awesome too, gives the food a little crunch. Everything just depends on our mood, customize and enjoy!
