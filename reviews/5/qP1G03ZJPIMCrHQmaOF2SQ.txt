If you're like me you like the freshness and customization of chipotle, but are craving something with a little more flavor and zing to it. This place is like a Hawaiian style chipotle with TONS of flavor and even more options. The steak is cooked perfectly, has a sweet hawiian sauce and is well seasoned, they have tons of sauces, dressings, and salsas to really give a lot of different and tropical flavors to your food. They have a lot of options when it comes to toppings, cilantro, lime, tortilla crisps, guac, bean sprouts, beans, sour cream, cheese. They have seaweed rice which is also DELICIOUS. Id highly recommend this place.
