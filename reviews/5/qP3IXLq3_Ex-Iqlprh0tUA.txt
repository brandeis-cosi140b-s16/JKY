Coming from da islands it is great to find the flavors and hospitality of back home, with a twist. Josh the manager is always concerned to make sure guests have a wonderful experience. They have put a few twists on the traditional fare and salsa which keeps it lively and the food is incredible. Highly recommend those who miss home style and if in the neighborhood you can't miss. Only suggestion would be to add eggs so one can get loco moco any way you like it.
Mahalo!
