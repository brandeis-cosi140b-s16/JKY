Bam! Don't even get me started. If you are like me and literally just crave spice you need as in rt now drop everything NEED to go here. I speak un poco Spanish so I had to ask for an English menu, even then my total and utter whiteness was evident. Our server was adorable and thankfully recommended what they are known for, the Molcajetes! Do it do it do it! So delicious, so reasonable, soo wish I could swing by today!

Update: I live in Summerlin, this place is an epic drive yet I still find myself jumping on the freeway for my Ceviche fix. After a few unsuccessful local Mexican visits I've decided to just accept this place is the only place for me. When friends come in from Cali, there is where we go.

The service is 100%, the salsa and chips are delicious, the white fish in the ceviche is fresh, chunky, and seasoned absolutely perfectly. My kids love their burritos and quesadillas.

As for the vendors who walk by with a smile offering you their goods? Totally respectful, and not something at all that is annoying or inappropriate in this legit Mexican restaurant. 

If you want to pay 12 bucks for a single poorly made tostada or burrito go somewhere more glamorous. If you want real Mexican food, in a nice low key environment, that is super affordable? Head here.
