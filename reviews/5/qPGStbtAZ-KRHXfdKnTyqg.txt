This is a great place that is close to everything on the Mill Ave District!  My Girlfriend and I always make sure to stop after going swimming at the ASU campus for the Tuesday and Thursday after 9 U-Call-It's!  The U-Call-It's include EVERYTHING unlike most bars who only do call drinks.  The only exception that I could find is that for Yager Bombers the Redbull is two dollars extra (still cheaper than your average bars bombers!)
It's a beautiful active bar with friendly and fun bartenders!  I work at one of the Radisson's in Phoenix and constantly send people to this bar and have never received a complaint!  This is by far one of the best hidden secret of the Mill District!
