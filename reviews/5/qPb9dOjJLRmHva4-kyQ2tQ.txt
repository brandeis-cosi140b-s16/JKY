This place is one of the finest NEW hidden gems in the Valley. Four Months new and hidden on 19th ave/Glendale area near a pizza joint.  Two visits and I am hooked. From 1.50 fish tacos to 6.50 shrimp burros this is a NOT miss spot.  The food is fresh, flavorful and full of kick.  This will be my regular rotation spot.  It is BYOB if you want some cerveza.  The owner is originally from Pasadena, CA and was with Roy's Restaurant at the Marriott for 12 years. Check it out if you want cheap, and fantastic food.
