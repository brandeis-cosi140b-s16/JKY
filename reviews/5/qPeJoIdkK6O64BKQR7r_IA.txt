Great Mexican and American classic diner food served in a homey, spotless and unassuming storefront behind a Starbucks on Thomas. You could feel the love and pride. Families are clearly welcome here! The patroness is a handsome woman of a certain age in a crisp white shirt, apron and marcelled (go look it up) jet black hair who hugged and kissed the little kids that came in with their families. B/W pictures from the 50's show her as an attractive and confident young woman striding down city streets. The food is home cooked and delicious and served on long tables or comfortable booths. I went for breakfast. Best huevos ranchero I've ever had in 35+ years. Enchilada sauce made with fresh ingredients not that soulless stuff out of a can. Great big perfectly cooked eggs served over corn tortillas. Great re-fried beans and rice, too and good strong coffee in a bottomless cup and all for around seven bucks. What a great way to start the day and to think the mechanic at Discount Tire steered me to Sonics across the street for a "decent breakfast". We gotta support local wonders like this before they disappear and all that's left are the Bells and Sonics of the world.
