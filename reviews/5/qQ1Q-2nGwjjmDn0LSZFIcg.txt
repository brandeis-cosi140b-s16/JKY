I can say this is home made mexican food. Compared to other Mexican restaurants. this is one of my new favorites. The customer service was above expectations.
First time coming here and I will be returning!
We went for my friends birthday party.
We had a party of 15 people and I can't complain about anything. We sat down and right away they got our drinks ordered and appetizers and in less than 5 minutes we were eating! Food was full of flavor. 
Lalo was our server he was very attentive and on top of everything. I didn't even have to ask for a refill, because he was very attentive and he made us all feel welcomed. 
I really recommend this place!
