I can't believe that anyone could ever write a bad review of this restaurant.  We live in the neighborhood and this is a treasure (unfortunately a hidden treasure).  The owner is Oscar and he and the staff are always accomodating.  Their SALSA is the very best made anywhere.  Keep in mind sometimes it is hotter than other times depending on how much rain the Hatch chili's have gotten in New Mexico.  There is no way to describe how good it is.  Try it and you will agree with me, I am sure.  We always order the same meal.  My husband and self split the meat fajitas and always take some home.  Very good value for the money.  Surprised someone had to ask for a drink as 1/2 of the restaurant is a bar.  It is tastefully separate.  Please support this restaurant as they deserve to be in business.  (Closed Mondays).  On the s/e corner of Ray Road and Gilbert Road.  You will be glad you tried it!!
