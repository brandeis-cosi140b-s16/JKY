This restaurant makes me happy about mexican food, it's not fake Mexican food like the filbertos across the street. they have the best Mexican food in town and really nice customer service they are nice and the food there is unbelievably good. They make the food how u want it if u want pollo asado fries instead of Carne asada they can do that. If I were to get captured by isis and if they told me I could have one last meal and it could be what ever I wanted I would say chipotle, but amados would be a very close second.  If you want quality Mexican food go to amados
