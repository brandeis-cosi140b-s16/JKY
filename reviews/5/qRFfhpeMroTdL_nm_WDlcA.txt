I try to go at least once a week. I would say best restaurant in Tempe, but it might be one of the best in all the valley. They actually listen to the customers too...example the steak with chimichuri was a special  and myself and a bunch of buddies who frequent the revival said they need it back...last week went back to a new summer menu with the steak on it!!! Yummmm
