I travel a lot for work but whenever I'm back in Phoenix I stop here for brunch. The staff is great, the atmosphere is pleasant, and the food is even better. As the name would suggest it's a hole in the wall joint without any sign to let you know where it is. My favorite is any one of the eggs Benedict meals. It may sound weird but I love the Ham / tenderloin there. They smoke it themselves and then cook with a wood fire grill. Awesome. Busy time are kind of hit and miss but considering they have absolutely no advertising their doing pretty well.
