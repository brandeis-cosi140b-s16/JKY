Chinese and mexican together?! Yes please! This place is really great and I can't believe tonight was my first time trying it!! Location is a little hidden but once you pass Dobson, it's clearly visible (turn right after Circle K). Restaurant is really large and staff was really friendly. Since it was my first time in, they let me sample a few of their menu items. I thought that was really cool! I ended up ordering the jade chicken (similar to sweet and sour), gringo chicken in a quesadilla with chicken fried rice and refried beans. We ordered to go and waited about 10-15 minutes for our food. When we got home, I was excited to try all the food! Quesadilla was amazing...jade chicken great, beans good and rice was OK. I LOVE that they give you a warm snicker doodle too! Cookie was really good and the perfect way to end the meal. Overall, this place is great and will return soon!
