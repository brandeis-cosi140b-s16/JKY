Thank you yelpers! I was searching for mexican late at night and was really craving something authentic. I struck gold with La Condesa.  It is a true diamond in the rough part of phoenix.
I ordered the carne asada burrito which is simply meat and beans. Anywhere else that would be boring and plain, but it was seasoned perfectly and full of flavor. A perfect vessel for the salsa bar from heaven. Every bite was different depending on what spicy concoction I chose.
I also couldn't resist trying the maya conchita pibil taco, which was packed full of juicy shredded pork. So juicy in fact that I had to eat it quick because the corn tortillas were getting a bit soggy. Did I mind? Oh no. I just sopped up any juice left and sighed with pure contentment. They topped the taco with nothing else but pickled red onions that were delicious. Simple done right.  Can't wait to go back and get that horchata!
