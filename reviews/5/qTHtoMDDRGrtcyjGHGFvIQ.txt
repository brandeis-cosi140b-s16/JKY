This food snob (moi) came back for more... 

Mamita's is more like a food truck parked in some parking lot - it must be a sister truck to Mamacita's at 611 Fremont... but i have no experience there... 

My friend Julie - who is a devoted fan of the Taco Zone truck in L.A. made a beeline for this truck when we walked out of the Griffin.  

Me?
eat from a food truck?  
let me see the "salsa" station... 
Plentiful & fresh
let me see your plate...
looks good. 
Prices? 
Cheap!  

Taco Asada $2.00
Burritos $5.00

un taco asada, por favor!
got my taco with extra cilantro and no onion - and it was perfect! 
either that or i was drunk.  

but it was the best little meal i could have wanted at that moment.

"Julie, want to go for another taco?"

she bee-lined it back to the truck - apparently she didn't need convincing...

mmmm asada...
