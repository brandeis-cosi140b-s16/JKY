If you haven't been here in a while it might surprise you. The food has always been authentic Mexican and good and it had an authentic look and feel - say Juarez 1970.

I hadn't been there in several years and was surprised when I ate lunch Thursday.  Outside as the same but it was redone inside. Kind of a hipster vibe now. 

The food is still great. Maybe better than before.  The presentation is less old style mex and more nuvo cuisine.  We ordered the table guacamole.  Delicious. Then I had the beef taco and chicken enchilada special.  Great taste. Great portions. Good price.  

The parking is still as bad as ever (we did find a space). But it's free and it's walking distance from downtown.
