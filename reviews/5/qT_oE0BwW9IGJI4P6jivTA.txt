Agree with everyone - don't judge a book by it's cover.

Sure, the neighborhood is sketchy. It's one of those places where you're just there for the restaurant. It has its own lot behind the building, so there's no stress - about lack of parking (jeez, such a breath of fresh air for us visitors from L.A.) OR your car being jacked.

The food was amazing! Usually at these kinds of Tex-Mex-ish places (even though it's actually "New Mexican"), you shovel down the food and give it good reviews afterwards because you were hungry after two margaritas. Not here - everything was delicious. The bean dip was really good and hard not to fill up on. The chimichanga was so tasty, I actually ate a few bites with the sauce scraped off, just to taste it on its own.

For those of us who have had actual New Mexican food, the red and green chile sauces are the barometer. I can vouch that both are good - because they knew what to do when I asked for my main dish "Christmas-style".

Service was nice and the atmosphere was laid-back but fun. If you seek that Southwestern cuisine you can only get in AZ and NM, you need to get over here.
