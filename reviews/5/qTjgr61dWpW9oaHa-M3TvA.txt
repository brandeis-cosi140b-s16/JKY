Te amo, Fiesta Cafe!  Having grown up in C-U, I've heard my fair share of how great Dos Reales is supposed to be, but everytime I eat there, I feel like I am being rushed out the door.  Fiesta on the other hand....well, there are few places I'd rather sit on the patio and have margaritas.  That, and the staff always recognize my husband and I and remember what we like, right down to the extra sour cream (no longer in those little paper wedges) and Island Margaritas.  Oh, man.  I'm making myself want to go there right now just thinking about it.
