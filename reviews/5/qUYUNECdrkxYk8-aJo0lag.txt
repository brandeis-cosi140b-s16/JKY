Let me preface this by saying that I was born in NM, so the standard to which I judge Mexican food has always been high.  Most so-called Mexican places in the Valley are very mediocre and over-priced for what you're getting.  

A family friend (also from NM) recommended New Mexican Grill. Trusting their judgement, I had to see for myself what the fuss was about. 

Walking in, my first impression was that the place in very simple. A big menu greets you just as you walk in the door.  An ordering counter and kitchen to the left, simple table set-ups to the right, and a self-serve chips and salsa bar in the middle. Looked like the crew that was working on Sunday was pretty young, so you never know  how that will go.
 
We placed our order and helped ourselves to chips and salsa. After a few bites I knew we were in for a good meal. The salsas had that distinctive fire-roasted taste that so few other places do. Big thumbs up. The service was prompt and the food arrived at our table in no time at all. Our group had a little bit of everything, with each item more delicious than the next. The ground beef enchiladas with red sauce and a fried egg were like something straight out of my grandmas kitchen. The green pork tamales were moist and full of flavor. The carne asada tacos were overflowing with tender steak nestled in warm tortillas. 

It seriously took some will power to NOT go back and order another dinner.

If you are looking for an authentic New Mexican meal packed with mouth watering flavors at a very reasonable price, look no further than New Mexican Grill.
