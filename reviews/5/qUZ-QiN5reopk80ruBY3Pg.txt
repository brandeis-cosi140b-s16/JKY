Excellent food, excellent service CONSISTENTLY! I grew up in Casa Grande and have always loved this place. I, literally, have never had a bad experience there and I've been there countless times. I've lived in Chicago and Tucson and would match "Mi Amigo Ricardo's" up to any Mexican food there anytime!
