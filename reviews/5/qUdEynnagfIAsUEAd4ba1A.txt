My favorite amerimex taco shop in town.  The chopped salads leave you wanting more.  The handcrafted drinks with fresh ingredients are out of this world.  The decor is colorful and lively and has a true hipster feel.  Happy hour is fantastic, but the place is busy all the time.  This is one of my top 5 Gilbert restaurants.  I keep going back to work my way through the menu and have not had a bad dish yet.  Try it!
