We rolled into Las Vegas at 8 am and were basically starving by noon, so right when I was hoping a taco truck would materialize around the corner, Tacos El Gordo shows up at the cheap end of the Strip, right before you hit Circus Circus and the other sad old hotels. 

$2 tacos! I got an asada one and an adobada (spicy pork). The latter is juicy shreds of pork sliced off of one of the biggest vertical kebabs I've ever seen and then drenched in a day-glow green sauce. The aguas frescas are under $2 too, and even if it's from a soda machine, we had enough to fill our Nalgenes with a jamaica and horchata mix for a post-lunch Strip amble.

Ask for a free plate of carmelized green onions and roast white peppers!
