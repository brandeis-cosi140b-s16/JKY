Decided to go check this place out on account of a 12 for 20 Groupon they were currently offering. Glad I did. I went by myself on a Saturday evening and decided to sit at the bar. Omar was the bartender, and he was super friendly and helpful. He offered me a menu, some chips and salsa/bean dip, and a beverage, and insisted I ask any questions I may have. Salsa was good, and the beans were beans.  I inquired about the beef Birria burritos at which point he offered to let me try it and brought out a healthy sample, it was delicious! Decision made! I asked how it came and I was told I could have it however I wanted it, with an offering of all the general burrito filters (beans, rice, cilantro, etc.) The meat was cooked perfectly and the food was delicious and plentiful. I had never had birria, which is a way of cooking and seasoning the meat, but I would definitely have it again. Omar and even some of the regulars had me feeling right at home.  Bill for two beers, a shot of Jamison, and my meal came to 25 bucks (not accounting for the Groupon) which I thought was more than reasonable. I will be back.
