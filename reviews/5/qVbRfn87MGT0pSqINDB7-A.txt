My latest Cheap Eat's favorite, if it was on the show "the office" this place would get a dunder, for those who don't watch "the office"...nevermind.  Ok Chimi's...excellent, chips homemade, salsa good (some might not like it because it is a real saucy kind, not chunky), rolled tacos good, Burritos excellent, haven't tried the tacos yet, red enchilada's were excellent as well.  Thank god Fazolis went out of business so Carolina's could move in!  Well it is time to hit a fine dining adventure, because I will not find a cheap eats like this one anytime soon!

Ok tried the taco's mucho good!  The only thing I don't like is the taco salads, just not my style of taco salads.  Oh butter tortillas...yum yum yum!!!
