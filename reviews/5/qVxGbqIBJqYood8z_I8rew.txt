AMAZING!! And oh my GOSH, how soon can I go back? Everything we ordered was amazing. (And its pretty wierd at first to have Mexican and Asian on the same table, but everything was so tasty, you get over it quickly). 

Dan Dan Mian was super-wow. Please double the modest serving, ChinaPoblano! The hearts-of-palm salad was totally unique (long shreds) - yummy. All the tacos were out-of-this-world flavorful. Waiter suggested the short rib tacos - oh yeah. You'll want a lot of those (mouth is watering) [sluurp] oh, excuse me. The quality of the fresh noodles will ruin you for any other Asian noodle situation where they don't use homemade fresh noodles. Five stars, and happily so.
