Absolutely spectacular. This place has a great rating by 1100+ people for a reason.

Amazing food, warm inviting atmosphere, and top tier service. I went for the 2nd night in a row tonight with a business partner. We're from Texas and we know Mexican food and this place is totally legit. Paco, the head chef, is an expert in his craft.

Just about everything is organic and fresh. And the margaritas....holy crap the margaritas. 

One more thing. You must...you MUST have the flan. Do it. You'll thank me. And I dare you to visit just once. 

Thanks Paco!
