Ok I usually go there for the drinks and to have some down time with my friends over the weekend. I've been there multiple times and it never disappoints me. Its a great laid back place to get some good drinks and a VERY reasonable price and good looking bartenders ;) On a Saturday night, this place is usually crowded till 11:30ish and then it dies down. Thats usually when I leave and hit a club, but last weekend we were there till close and it was still fun. 

I watched the superbowl this year at loco patron and took advantage of the happy hour. We got nachos, lobster taco and shrimp tacos and they were all very delicious. The server was really nice and attentive to us. 

I love this place and so do my friends, so we end up here often.
