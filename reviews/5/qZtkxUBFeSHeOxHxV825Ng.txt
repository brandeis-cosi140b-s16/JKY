Though it may seem like a hole in the wall. I started coming to Litos when Ritos (Glendale) was not being consistent with the hours they had of operation. My family and I often get Green Chil Burritos which are flavored with enough spices. The meat is cut in just the right size so you taste it but so some little kid won't choke on it. I often come in now after getting or waiting for a haircut from the barber next door.
