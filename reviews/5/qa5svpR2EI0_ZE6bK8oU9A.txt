Excellent food and service here! Kelsey, our server was great and super helpful. The chef is very gracious and we were lucky to meet him here. The salsas, guacamole and tacos are the best ever. Also, you have to try the delicious flan here. The recipe is  80+ years old and just unbelievably good! Totally made our trip to Las Vegas complete!
