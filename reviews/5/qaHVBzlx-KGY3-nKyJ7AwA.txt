If you feel like you've done something good in life and deserve something good, you have to run here!  Although it's a bit out of the way and you have to take few extra steps through Mandalay Bay, it's worth it!!!

We've come here at least 5 times in the past year and it just keeps getting better!

Our last visit was on last Sunday.  The girls in the front were friendly and welcoming!  Our waiter, Mike was the best part of this Vegas trip!  He was friendly, helpful, professional and has the best sense of humor.  

We ordered...
Green corn tamales - Perfection!!!
Short Rib Enchiladas - Tender, Fresh and Delicious!!!
Tres Leches Cake - BEST EVER!!!

Washed it all down with my Margarita and the hubby had a Carona.  Everything was delicious but the Tres Leches has got to be the best thing ever!!!

It's great for dates, groups and families.  They have seating inside and outside.

Looking forward to our next trip to Border Grill!
