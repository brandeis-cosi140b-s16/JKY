Just tried this for lunch. Only open a week and they already have a big following. Really limited seating, definitely plan on taking it to go. The fresh homemade tortillas are soft and delicious. The Mole was decent, but the Barbacoa was fantastic. Really well seasoned and very tender. Looking forward to trying the Chile Verde, maybe for dinner!
