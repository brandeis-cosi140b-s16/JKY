I love this Taco Bell! Everyone is nice and accommodating with the mods on my food. 
They have lard free - so vegetarian friendly refried beans that I ask to be substituted instead of the beef in most of the items on the menu. Bam! Bean tacos! Bean crunch wrap supreme! 
They also have breakfast -you can never go wrong with the California AM crunch wrap! 
Rumor is that the cinnamon twists are really rotini noodles but I need to see the receipts! Either way they are too good to not order so treat yo self! 

Keep an eye on the Diamondback's score! (Must get 5 runs & even if they lose) This season alone they have given away* 3 free tacos almost every other day and they have like a million games during the season. So if you like tacos and have $2 jush go**!
