El Tlacoyo won't win any beauty pageants, which makes it my kind of place. They had a bunch of stuff on the menu that I wasn't familiar with, so I asked for some help and ended up getting the huarache con costilla. My order came out pretty quick and I promptly enjoyed the fiesta in my mouth for the next 20 minutes or so.
