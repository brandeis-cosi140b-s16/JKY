If you like typical Mexican food, I don't see how you wouldn't be able to like this place. The food is great (again, TYPICAL Mexican food, here), but what makes this place even better is that it has beautiful outdoor seating where you can eat. It really made it a nice experience. Furthermore, they have a nice bar that goes both indoor and outdoor. It's very welcoming. Supposedly, they also have live music on some weekends. The place, really, is worth going to and trying out.
