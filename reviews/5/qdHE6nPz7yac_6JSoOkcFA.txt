I am thankful to know that there are still two Macayo's left in Las Vegas. What a disppointment that the East Tropicana locale has  closed with very little info. The TCT's are amazing and a tradition for those growing up in Las Vegas. I hope folks will patronize the remaining restaurants so all can continue to enjoy this wonderful and familiar favorite.
