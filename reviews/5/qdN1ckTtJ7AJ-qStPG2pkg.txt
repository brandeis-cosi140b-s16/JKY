The best tacos I've had in Las Vegas! Right as you step in you know you're getting a good meal. I had the el pastor and shrimp tacos. The shrimp was good but the el pastor was amazing. Not to mention the decor and the bar is outstanding. I fully recommend this place. Come for happy hour and get cheap drinks and tacos :)
