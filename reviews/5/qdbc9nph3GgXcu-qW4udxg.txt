Please note that this is the El Encanto in Fountain Hills Arizona, not the one in Cave Creek. The ambiance is fantastic, artwork beautiful on the walls, only outshined by the excellent service and food. I've taken people to El Encanto from out of town, even from Santa Fe, where people think they know everything about Mexican food. Everyone agrees el Encanto is one of the best they've ever had if not the best. I usually order whatever special they are offering and have never been disappointed. My favorite is anything with Vera Cruz sauce on it, the regular house Margarita is a knockout, and the Pollo Fundido and Queso Guillermo are musts. Either on the covered and heated patio or inside the main dining room, this quaint, authentic, relaxing, true Mexican restaurant is certainly the best place in Fountain Hills for dinner.  Sometimes there is a wait, but that is usually only on weekends during the dinner hours. We get there either around 5, or after 8:30, and never have a problem getting a seat.
