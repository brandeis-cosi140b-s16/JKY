Very very tasty. I got a #17 which is a burrito your choice of meat, i got ground beef, lame choice i know but i like to start off with that, and a cheese enchilada, both were delicious. I also got a side chile relleno also very good....the beans were some of the best i've had, very good. Great value as well.
