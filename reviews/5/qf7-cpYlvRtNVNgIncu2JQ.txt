Best tortilla chips I've ever had. They are the perfect mixture of crunchy, soft, and flavorful. I never actually got a chance to try the food, because the chips are too good. I usually sit down, order my drink, begin eating the complimentary chips and salsa, and I can't stop eating them. Try them for yourself.
