This place is the best!! I don't know what hotdog place Robert M is going too but he must be mistaken. Especially because the pricing he gave is completely wrong for a Carolina dog. Every single one of my friends and family who have eaten here absolutely love it and they have the best gourmet hotdogs I've ever had. They also will work with you on what you want. They are super friendly and kind. Best salsa ever too!! They have lots of awards and have won a ton of contests for this salsa. The shop is just great from taste to their quality to their customer service. You feel like a part of the family when you've left the shop because they are so wonderful and they converse with you a lot. They are excellent in every way. I've been here a lot and will continue to come here whenever I want some delicious hot dogs!! Mmm!
