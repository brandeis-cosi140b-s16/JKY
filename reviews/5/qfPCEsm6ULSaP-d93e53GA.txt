It's really hard not to fall in love with this place. As probably the most expensive mexican restaurant I've ever been to (coming from a guy who lives in Texas), I had really high expectations going in. Lets just say, Javier's over delivered.

Lets start with the good:
- The decor of the place is absolutely stunning. Even considering that it's in Aria, Javier's look and feel of the restaurant is very modern and beautiful. 
- The margaritas are perfect. Made with only top shelf tequila, you can assure that your $15 per drink won't go to waste.

Now to the great:
- The service is on point. Filling my glass and refilling my sauce as soon as it's almost empty, and explained the overwhelming menu very well.
- The sauce is redonkulous! Has a nice kick to it and isn't the ordinary blended sauce you will find in tex-mex establishments. Has a lot of flavor and chunks of great tomatoes in there.

And finally, the awesome:
- My table did a little family style ordeal, so I was able to try a variety of dishes. Lets just say I wasn't disappointed by any of them, and each dish has it's own very authentic flavor. The seafood is very fresh, the meats are cooked perfectly, and there is some sort of latino flair in every dish that really puts it over the top.

Overall, this place is legendary. I would recommend Javier's to anyone.
