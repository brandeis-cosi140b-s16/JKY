$7 Tempranillo, simple munchies $2-$9, great sound, seating, and that's in the lounge. The ballroom wasn't open tonight, but the lounge was great. Non-pretentious,   ultra cool in a not-trying kind of way. Easy to find. Didn't need the bathrooms so can't report on that. Great wine selection and prices for a club. Outdoor patio for smokers. Wait service for the tables, only one person but it worked. Nice place, good sound.
