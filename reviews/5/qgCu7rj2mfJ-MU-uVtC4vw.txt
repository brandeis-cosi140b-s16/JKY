The food is prepared on site every morning from the freshest most responsibly raised ingredients. The staff is upbeat, lively, and create a fun environment for a delicious meal. My favorite is the bowl with white rice, pinto beans, fajitas, chicken, corn salsa, and guacamole. If your really hungry I would suggest a double steak burrito with guacamole and hot salsa. If your there for dinner try the margarita, it's amazing!
