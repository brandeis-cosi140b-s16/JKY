We had this Qdoba cater a Celebration of Life for my late Aunt.  I had never heard of Qdoba - a family member suggested them and we were so happy they did.  Carla and her staff did a great job, food was yummy and the cost very reasonable to feed 25 people.  Qdoba, came and set everything up for us - food stayed hot for several hours.  It was so much better than deli meat/cheese sandwich trays.  Everybody loved it.  We will use them again.
