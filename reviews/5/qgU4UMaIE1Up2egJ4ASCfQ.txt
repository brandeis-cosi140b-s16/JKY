ARIZONA SOUL FOOD.  Love the food and atmosphere. A great old school Mexican joint. Nothing fancy just great Mexican food. 

The chicken nachos on happy hour could feed 3-5 for $5. Serve their iced tea in big cups. Margaritas in big glasses and chips and salsa that will blow your mind. 

Try the cheese crisp with guac or anything with guacamole... It is to die for.
