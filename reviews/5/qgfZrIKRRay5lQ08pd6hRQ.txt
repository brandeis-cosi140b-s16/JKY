My Husband and I had the wonderful opportunity to dine here. Havana Grill was fantastic! We can't wait to go back. Everyone was very friendly.  The atmosphere was perfect for date night or for a family night out. The Bread was fantastically fresh and perfectly buttered.  We had the Massas De Puerco Fritas (appetizer), OMG it was sooo good! Our meals were so flavorful. 
Each plate looked as though someone took the time to make it look nice. Not just thrown on the plate. 
We can't wait to go back.
