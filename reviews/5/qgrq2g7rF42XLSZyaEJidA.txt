Deliciousness.  Stopped by on the way to the ice den and very happy we did.  Super nachos with asada,  super Carne asada burrito and a cheese quesadilla and all were super good. Red salsa was very good. Service was very friendly and a pleasant atmosphere. The burrito and super nachos was very good and would come back for more.
