I really enjoyed Chino Bandido.  I got a chili releno/veggie salad combo.  The chili releno was freshly prepared and the best one I've ever had.  The portion was way bigger than I could eat, though I tried.  It is also a nice treat that they give you a snickerdoodle cookie.  I managed to eat that!  

The staff was super friendly and helpful.  I am a vegetarian and had several very good choices to pick from.  

Happy eating!
