Every time I come to Vegas we always stop here for dinner and it never disappoints! The service was fantastic! The atmosphere was great! When we went they also had a gentlemen offering live music which enhanced our time there. The food is AMAZING! Also, I would recommend having guacamole they make right in front of you! Probably the best Mexican restaurant I have EVER been to! The margaritas are on point! The pricing is also reasonable.. You get what you pay for. I have nothing negative to say about the time I have spent here.
