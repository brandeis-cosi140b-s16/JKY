I could probably eat Qdoba everyday and be completely satisfied. Burritos are truly one of my favorite foods and Qdoba's are fantastic. I like the fact that it is made in front of you so you can see the freshness of the ingrediants and customize your burrito anyway you would like. I usually get a burrito but they also have delicious quesadillas and nachos. The chips and queso are also a great compliment to your meal. The service is also great, I have never had any issues. I would recommend trying a naked burrito and their guacamole.
