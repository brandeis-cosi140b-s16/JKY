jamaica juice is so refreshing! I ordered their papas con carne, which is pretty much carne asada fries. The carne asada meat was so soft, no chewy parts at all, compared to Roberto's. You can't compare though because each it made differently. My brother ordered Chile Releno, which was served on a fancy clay plate!

We were very happy with our meals, price, and their service.
