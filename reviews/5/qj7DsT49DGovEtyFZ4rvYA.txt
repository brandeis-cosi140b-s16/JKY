You would never expect a combination Mexican restaurant/sushi restaurant to work. I was a little hesitant at first myself. But, we found this place on Yelp, and decided to give it a try. Very nice staff and excellent food! The sushi really works the way they do it! Lots of variety all with a Mexican flair.  The flavors are great and the variety is really good. Tortillas are all handmade to order and have a lot of flavor. But the sushi really is the unique. Definitely try this when you come. I don't think you will be disappointed with anything on the menu. Cannot wait to come back again!
