I had a craving for tacos, good homemade street tacos, so we found this place and made the drive into downtown Phoenix. The atmosphere was wonderful, the service was great, the chef even came out to greet us himself. 
The Tacos. Oh the Tacos. Everything is small portion and made fresh. I had two Carne Asada and one Pork Belly. My girlfriend had two fish tacos. They were all amazing. 
The price is very reasonable as well. I absolutely recommend this place, whether it's tacos, flautas, or margaritas you're in the mood for.
