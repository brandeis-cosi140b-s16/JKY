I had the grilled chicken burrito for $4.99 and it was huge like a homemade burrito. Very authentic. The employees were very well groomed and the restaurant was up kept, I felt clean and safe eating within. The prices here are definitely affordable and well worth the purchase. I recommend everyone stop in here if you're on this side often for authentic Mexican food. Awesome food, awesome service.
