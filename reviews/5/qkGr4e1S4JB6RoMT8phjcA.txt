Fantastic!!! The portion sizes are huge so be warned!! This is fantastic food.. even standard items such as the beans; rice and tortillas were wonderful on their own. Someone really knows how to cook! Do not pass this up if you are in the area. As other reviews have noted, it is a bit hard to find, it is actually on Dwight street, which is a block north of Washington -- it is in the middle of a strip mall on the 4500 E. block of Dwight, well worth a couple of extra turns to get to.
