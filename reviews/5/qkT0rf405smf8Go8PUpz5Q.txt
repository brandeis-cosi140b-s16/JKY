There's nothing like the Gringo taco and the street corn. Everything I've tried on the menu is amazing. The Gringo taco will having you coming back for seconds and thirds. I never thought I would find street corn at russell and 215. LA has found its way to vegas and it was worth the trip. I will be back again and again
