When me and my family fly into Phoenix we always stop at Mi Pueblo. I usually get the chicken quesadilla and a salad with this amazing guacamole dressing. I've tried a number of things on the menu and loved each one. I guarantee that you'll love anything thats on the menu. Plus there's all you can eat chips and salsa!
