Very good for being reasonably priced. Its not high end Mexican cuisine but their service is great and they have a broad enough menu. I enjoyed the chicharrones, or fried pork rinds. How often do you find those on a menu? All large portions too. 

We never had to ask for refills or anything either. Waitresses were working as a team.
