This is my first time at this place and it was AMAZING. The staff here were super friendly, very down to earth. I got the burger brûlée and it was very good a decent size ! I felt the maple syrup on it was a little over powering but overall very good. I also got the French toast fries and I never thought they would make it as French toast with a side of maple syrup; I thought the fry would be made out if a potato. 

Overall amazing food! Must try!
