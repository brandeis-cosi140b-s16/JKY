We typically go to the S Gilbert location and decided to give this one a try. We went on a Friday around lunch time and the line wasn't awful and moved very quickly. The staff was pleasant and didn't skimp on the portions. This location is very clean and had a great outdoor seating area that's perfect for people watching since it's around a shopping area. Needless to say, this is our new favorite location!
