I came here a couple of weeks ago for 2nd Sundays. This is an event where instead of having one food truck there was two more! I thought  that was a really cool idea!

This time I only had one beef taco because I I had to make room to try the other trucks because I haven't ate any others before. The taco was still delicious and I'll be looking forward to the next 2nd Sunday!
