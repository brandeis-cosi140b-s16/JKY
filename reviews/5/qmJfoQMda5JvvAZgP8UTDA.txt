" Massive Menu, Great Food, Awesome View ! ""


My wife and I were invited by some friends of ours to visit the Lindo Michocan Mexican Restaurant in Henderson, Nevada for dinner. What a place!. The Menu is massive. It will take you some time to read through it, and decide what you are going to have for dinner from their gourmet Mexican cuisine. I had one of the best Chili Relleno's and Cheese Enchiladas I have ever had. My wife had the Carnitas, which were also delicious. Our friends both had the Mojarra ( Tilapia ) which was huge, and look fantastic. The view the restaurant has especially at night over looking the entire city of Las Vegas, is Fantastic ! The restaurant hand makes their own fresh tortillas, and has live entertainment playing great Mexican music while you eat. We would difenitely go back to te Lindo Michocan again !
