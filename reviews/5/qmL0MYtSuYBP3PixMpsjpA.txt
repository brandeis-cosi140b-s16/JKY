This place is fantastic.  I have tried a couple of things and they were all fantastic, but now I stick to getting a chimichanga filled with machaca because they have the best machaca I have ever had at a restaurant.  The place itself is a small hole in the wall type of place, but maintains a clean and friendly experience. 

Luckily this place is down the street from where I work, so whenever I want Mexican food, this is the only place I consider.
