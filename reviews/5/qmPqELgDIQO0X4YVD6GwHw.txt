A must eat spot. Great southwest style and a taste sensation!  Wood fired smoke deliciousness in every bite . We had the simmered pork adovado, the relleno platter with choice of two from beef, pork, cheese or smoked turkey, all with rice and beans and green and red salsa.  Muy delicioso bloody Mary's with a beer back. It's a small place with Bar seating and about four tables for 4 in the front room and three larger tables in the side room.  Very friendly service . Don't miss it.  We went twice in two days.
