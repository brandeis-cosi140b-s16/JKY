Great food!  Their chicken flautas are the best.  They have really tasty beans, unlike most places.  Their tortillas are good too.  I've also tried their mole which is really good but it's a whole piece of chicken which you have to debone so it gets messy.  The chorizo and enchiladas are good too.  Actually, I've never had one bad thing here.  A definite must go.  The building and area is off putting but they're clean inside.  You park at the entry of a trailer park.  Oh, they also have weird hours and close at 5pm most days.
