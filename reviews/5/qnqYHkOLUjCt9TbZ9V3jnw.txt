Best Mexican food I've ever had. Seriously. My friends and I can't get enough! You wouldn't guess that the food was phenomenal by the look of the restaurant, but trust me....this is a hidden gem in Charlotte.

Best chicken fajitas I've EVER had! The queso, salsa, and chips are wonderful too. I've never had anything I don't like.
