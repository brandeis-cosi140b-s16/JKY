Pollo Loco is one of my favorite fast food places.although its always busy at this location I must say the food is delicious! Yum!their chicken with two sides is a great deal,but my favorite has to be their chicken salads with the creamy cilantro dressing and for dessert a flan.Anyone craving some healthy delicious food should definitely stop by at the crazy chicken;)
