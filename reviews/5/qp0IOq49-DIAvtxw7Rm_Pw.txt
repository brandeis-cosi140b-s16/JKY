If you're a  Taco Bell lover,this isn't the Mexican food for you.
However, if you love a little (or a lot) of heat and authentic Mexican food, which is carefully prepared, this is IT!
My friend had the pork and I had machaca, and both were absolutely fabulous. You can taste the wonderful flavors in every bite, and can tell that great care was taken in preparing our lunches.
In talking with the owner, it appears that there have been some service issues since this location opened in December, but apparently, those issues have been resolved. 
The restaurant is very nicely decorated, and although they were somewhat busy, we had great service and a perfect meal. 
If only Los Dos Molinos were in Scottsdale....
