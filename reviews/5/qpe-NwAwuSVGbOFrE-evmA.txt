When I went into Restaurant Mexico, I was expecting some overrated basic mexican food, but wow was I wrong. From the very moment we walked in the employees were nothing but nice. Fast service right when we walked in. It was about 6 p.m. on a friday night, but we got a table right away. Very busy but still got great service.

As we sat down my family and I scanned the menu hoping for real authentic mexican food. The more we looked over the menu we realized that this was an authentic mexican restaurant that has been located on Mill Ave. for over 20 years. We're very picky when it comes to mexican food because we grew up eating it since we lived in California. The chips and salsa arrived instantly and was amazing. 

We got our food and it was everything we hoped for. Great flavor and great quality. The plates came with so much food, I was not expecting that. For the amount of food and flavor you get, it is beyond worth the price. Not expensive at all for the real food you get. I definitely suggest checking this restaurant out. You will love it just like I did.
