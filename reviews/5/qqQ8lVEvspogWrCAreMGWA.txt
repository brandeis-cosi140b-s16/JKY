We went for an early dinner.  It's good we got there before the dinner crowd showed up or would have had to wait.  They are off to a great start and we look forward to each time there now.  Great friendly service, clean and pleasant facility shines out in the plethora of  Casa Grande eateries.  They are more upscale and use cloth napkins which we miss in the other establishments.  
My beef tacos were great as well the her beef Chimichanga.  The chips were thin and crisp to dip in an excellent salsa.  Parking is right out side the door and patio area.  Enjoy!
