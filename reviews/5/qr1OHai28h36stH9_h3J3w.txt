It's difficult reviewing chain restaurants because they are all the same, but I will say that the staff was very happy, the food was fresh and the place was spotlessly clean.  I came in between the lunch and dinner rushes, so there was no line, but still a lot of employees working.  Everyone had things they were prepping, but they were still attentive to all of the customers' needs.
