This Rubio's is the best. The owner and staff are very personable. several of the front cash register people know my order when I come in. It is nice to feel at "home". 

I love the fresh made burritos. These are not made beforehand and sitting. You can substitute items and make it healthy with a wheat tortilla. They make their sauces fresh as well.

I highly recommend the mahi grilled fish burrito with the chipotle white sauce. It is delicious hot and fresh
