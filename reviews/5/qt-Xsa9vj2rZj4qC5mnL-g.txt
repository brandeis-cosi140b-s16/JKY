This is my absolute favorite Mexican restaurant! 

When I first moved to Charlotte, I used to work in an office building behind Azteca. My coworkers used to go there faithfully. I wasn't a fan of mexican food, or at least I thought so at the time. One day I decided to join them and I realized what it was that kept them going back.

They welcome you with a warm smile each visit. As soon as you sit down, someone is right there to take your drink order. The salsa and chips are delicious! I try not to eat alot so I'll have room for my meal. They give you a hefty portion, I can always count on having leftovers to enjoy later. Even as leftovers, the food is still GOOD. To top it off, the dessert you're given is to die for!
