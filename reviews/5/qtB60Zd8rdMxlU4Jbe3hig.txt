Well finally a place that reminds me of my country!!! Street TACOS!!!! Had a family member that lives around the corner from the place that told me and the wifey about it. 
Great place to go eat late at night, made fresh to order right in front of your FACE! We ordered a Carne asada burrito, AWESOME!! Asada Quesadilla HUGE and yummy!! And a couple of Asada and chicken tacos, great taste. 
Only thing is that i wish they had more of a meat variety. But all in all this place ROCKS!!!! 
Going there tonight again with the Wifey for some good ASS tacos!!!!

If you love Authentic Street tacos this place is for you, Go ahead and give it a try!!!
$1 tacos, cant beat that!!

By the way bring cash, dont think they have a credit card machine!, LOL
