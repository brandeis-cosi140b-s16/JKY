Love their family dinner combo with the salad but the reason I'm on here to day is to give props to Lattrell!  I went in to order 2 dinner combos for a hungry crowd at home.  It was after work & they were slammed.  After ordering, I waited for about 5 minutes (not bad).  Well, whomever packed up my food just called my number & pointed to the bags on the counter.  I went home & started unpacking & realized, they didn't give me the 2nd dinner's chicken (about 12 pieces).  I called the restaurant & spoke with Latrell, explained the mess.  He immediately asked if I could go back there & pick up the rest of my order, well of course I could, I still had hungry people at home.  On my way to the restaurant, I received a call from home that we were almost out of rice.  I immediately called Latrell (on my hands free), and explained that I needed more rice too.  When I got there, he had  packed up the chicken I was missing, an additional container of  12 pieces of chicken & 2 containers of the rice, all compensated for having to go back down.  Before I got my food, he showed me what was in each container.  Great  management move!
