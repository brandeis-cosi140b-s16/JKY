I was in town for a convention.  I came in dressed up as a sexy cop lady.  I'm a pretty big dude by the way.

Even with my weird costume on the staff was super nice to me.  There was a super nice worker who complimented my costume, I don't remember her name, but she should get a raise.  And the manager coped with my strange requests to add the weirdest stuff to my food.  They even let me buy a tortilla.  JUST A TORTILLA.  The other places don't let me do that.

That whole week I ate at this Del Taco all day, everyday.

I'll miss this place!
