FOOD: 4 stars
AMBIENCE: 4 stars
SERVICE: 5 stars
VALUE for price (taking location into account): 4.5 stars

Would give it 4.5 stars if I could, but I'm generous of heart and round up.

What we had:
Beef Brisket Taquitos: 4 stars (5 stars for plating)
Yucatan Pork: 4.5 stars (4 stars for plating)
A Tecate and a Corona

re: food - one of the nice things about Border Grill is that they clearly place an emphasis on consistency.  I've frequented their LA location, and noticed no difference in the style or quality of the food.  This shows great management.  Beef brisket taquitos were very good (but sauce was too mild for my spicy-loving tastes); Yucatan pork was the winner.  I also love that Border Grill doesn't overcook rice.

re: ambience - typical Border Grill decor, but not their best location.  Patio overlooks the "Lazy River" at Mandalay Bay - a slow-moving waterway filled with children and extremely fat adults floating along in inner tubes.  I cam to think of it as the "River of Pee," but I digress...)  It was pretty warm that day.  The gigantic fan outside is misleading; it doesn't seem to do anything to circulate air or cool the patio down.  Seems poorly designed.  It was also a little loud thanks to the packed pool.  But not awful.  Inside probably would've been the better choice, and we chose incorrectly.

re: service - Border Grill Las Vegas delivered big on service with a fabulous plus host/waiter (we thought the charming man who seated us was the host, but we later saw him waiting on another section.)  Our waiter was also attentive without being over-bearing.  Never had to wait for anything or ask twice.

re: price - cocktails looked to be about the same as LA prices.  Food had roughly a 20-25% Las Vegas premium over LA prices, but I suppose that's to be expected because 1) it's the Strip, and 2) they're probably trucking a lot of fresh ingredients into agriculturally-challenged Vegas.)
