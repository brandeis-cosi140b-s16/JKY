What a gem, place is hard to find yet right in front of your face lol! The lady and I decided to check out a new spot, this fit the bill perfectly. Hot new business, perfect ratings, and close to home. When we arrived it was clean, staff was friendly, and the menu is easy to navigate. Prices are comparable to other similar resrurants. We ordered asada, barbacoa, and pastor tacos along with pastor windy city fries, champorrado, and an horchata. I will say that the meats are outstanding, seasoned very well and cooked perfectly. My favorite was the barbacoa, I usually tend to like the pastor because it has pineapple which adds a tartness and sweetness that I like, but the Barbados was cooked so good that it was the winner for me. We had our tacos with onion, cilantro, and a squeeze of lime and a sampling of their salsas. They have three salsa, an avocado roasted jalapeno it seemed, a fruity fresh tomatillo, and a spicy red pepper salsa. They were all great but I have to admit that the fruity fresh tomatillo was my favorite. The windy city fries was crazy, everything you would expect pastor fries to be and more, pico chopped fine, gauc which had big pieces of avocado in it (yum), and grilled onions! The onions were the kicker and set these apart from everyone else. The champorrado was different and had a banana taste to me, once I tasted it I liked it and liked the fact that it wasn't like everyone else's. The horchata was delicious, smooth, sweet, and had a creamy condense milk taste that was welcomed. All in all I felt like it was a great visit, the owner is humble, makes all of the food from scratch and you can taste the love. It the food continues to stay like this then it will be here for a long time and I'm happy with that as I will be back for more. Of your in the area...or not, take a visit amd try Chicago style tacos. You will not be disappointed.
