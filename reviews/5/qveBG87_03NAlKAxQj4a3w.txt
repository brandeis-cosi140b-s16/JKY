Hands down the best green chili pork I've ever had. Had the hungry man special breakfast burrito last Friday and Cam back today to get some breakfast (all the way from Arcadia). The green chili pork is fucking amazing! Spicy and delicious in a "make the back of your head sweat" kind of way. Pork and cheese wrapped in a tortilla made while the rest of the food was cooking, the tortilla was the bonus point. Fresh-made while the pork was cooking it was delicious and perfectly done. I will be back there, and a lot!
