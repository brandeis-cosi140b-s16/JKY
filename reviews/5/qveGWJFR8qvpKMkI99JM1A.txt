AMAZING! I have been here twice and in my humble opinion, this place is pretty close to having the best tacos in Phoenix. Their flavors are really defined in each of the taco selections. The size of the piece of Ahi Tuna in my taco was impressive, I'd say at least an inch in diameter. The specialty cocktails are innovative and refreshing. The decor is fun and hip and the place just has a good vibe. This is definitely a wonderful place for date night or lunch with the office crew. I will probably visit here monthly!!
