Stopped here for dinner the other night and one of the more reasonable places price wise on the strip and it was delicious!! We did not order drinks but got the chips and 3 different salsas and they were fresh and tasty. I ordered the veggie tacos and they were wonderful!!! All the veggies were grilled and so fresh I would definitely pay for them again. My entree was $13 and would return!
