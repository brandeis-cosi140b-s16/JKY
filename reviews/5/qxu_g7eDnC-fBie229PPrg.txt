Visit #2. Just as amazing. You must start with a consultation from the tequila sommelier. She recommended two limited edition Herradurra repasado's. One a 2013 finished in scotch oak barrels the other in 2014 Cognac barrels. Both nice, but I favor the scotch edition.  For dinner I had the short rib. Mrs had the snapper. OMG good.  Just awesome! We'll be back again soon!
