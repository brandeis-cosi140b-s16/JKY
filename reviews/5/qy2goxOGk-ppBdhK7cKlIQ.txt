This place is a homerun! Honestly, I don't understand how it hasn't received 5 stars across the board. I think some people are so use to eating crappy food that they just don't understand what delicious healthy food is. I'm impressed by the high quality ingredients and I hope this never changes. Have I mentioned the creamy rice?! OMG...yum! I'm addicted. Service is decent and the decor is fun and unique. What more can you ask for...
