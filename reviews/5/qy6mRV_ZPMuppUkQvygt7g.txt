Had dinner here last night, breakfast here today. Out of the ordinary: dinner waiter was completely aware of gluten free issues and was totally accommodating. Roasted corn chopped salad was out of this world. Masa flatbread pizza-- roasted mushrooms, cheese... To die for!
Breakfast was just as good - braised pork in chili verde with perfect scrambled eggs... Huevos rancheros with asparagus and peppers. Fresh house-made corn tortillas. Wish we lived here!
