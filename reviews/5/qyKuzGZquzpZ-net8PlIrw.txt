FINALLY...an AUTHENTIC taqueria in downtown Pittsburgh!!!! 
The food is absolutely out of this world delicious!! I honestly can not say enough about the quality of the menu. All fresh ingredients, made to order selections that made me feel like I was on vacation in Mexico. This quaint little place has atmosphere and yum rolled into one. Food is better than some I've had in Mexico. The owner, Bea is personable, friendly and kind. 
Everyone needs to experience the goodness!
