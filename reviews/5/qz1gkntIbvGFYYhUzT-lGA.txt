I LOVE Chipotle! The staff is super sweet and most talk in Spanish. Its funny because they think I'm a gringa and I'm totally not, so when I speak to them in Spanish they get all giddy. 

We went there today for lunch and I had a chicken burrito (like always) and man was it super yummy!! I also had some chips and guacamole which was excellent! I love how you can taste that everything is FRESH and not frozen! I also love the salt they have there; its like a lime sea salt.... totally delish!

The hot salsa is also super yummy and I always get extra! Beware because my bf said its spicy!
