Another great Mexican place in Vegas.  This little gem is tucked away in the Commercial Center.  It doesn't occur to you just how big this place is until you walk inside.  It features a full bar that occupies one wall of the restaurant and a dance floor in front of a stage that on certain nights has a full Mariachi band.  Service is prompt and courteous and prices are about on par with the majority of the other ones I have been to around town.  If you're down for hitting up the Mexican places around Vegas, I would highly recommend this one.
