Roberto's is a Mexican fast food place that is sort of between a fast food place and a restaurant. They don't make bad food with my personal favorites being the carne asada fries, the carne asada chimichanga combination plate, the shrimp a'la diabla and their rolled taco. This place is down the street from my house so I do eat here a lot.
