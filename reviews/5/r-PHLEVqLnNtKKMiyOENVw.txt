I am a taco connoisseur, with that being said Sol in the Scottsdale quarter is amazing. Let me start with the service. Arnaldo was easily in the top 3 servers I've ever had at any restaurant... Carmen at Sol is in there as well. When I first came here I ordered a bunch of tacos easily 15 and said no cilantro at all. With my request he did it and the tacos basically came plain. He then saw the upset look on my face and told me how their sauces were made with cilantro and he wanted to make sure I wasn't allergic. Once I told him it was OK he came back with all the sauces and made them table side and explained every one perfectly and they were delicious. Kudos to Arnaldo. Carmen has always put a smile on and has recommended great apps and is just an overall great server and a pleasure. Oh and now they both recognize me when I come in. THE FOOD... To die for. From apps to specialty tacos even down to the street tacos for taco Tuesday. The dessert... LA Guera is addicting and I usually get one to go. (Also the banana chocolate bread pudding)

Thanks guys!
