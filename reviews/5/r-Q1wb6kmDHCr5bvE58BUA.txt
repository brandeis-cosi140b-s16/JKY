We ate at the restaurant this time. You can see right into the kitchen and it was very clean. 
Tried the Lengua, Carnitas and Pastor street tacos this time. 
The Lengua was my favorite. So tender! 
FYI if you need to use the restroom be prepared to have the staff give you a key attached to 10 lbs of heavy chain and walking outside...this might be the time to practice the buddy system... 
The beans here are STOOPID good! 

They serve beer too!
