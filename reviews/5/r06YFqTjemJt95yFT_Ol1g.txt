Why only 3 stars, guys?  I thought this  place was like a trip to Miami without the jet lag. Brought a Cuban food virgin along- we love it. The Bistek de Palomilla and the Old Man's Clothes (beef)- can't remember the Spanish name. Roja de Viejo or something like that. Both very tasty. The Yuca Frita was great too. Didn't have drinks at lunch, can't comment on that.
