This is our favorite Roberto's.

Food here is excellent, the place is always clean and the people who work here are great.

2 complaints, that don't amount to much - if you eat in, the music is too loud, and the bells on the door ear-splitting if someone really swings it.  If you are taking food home, no worries.
