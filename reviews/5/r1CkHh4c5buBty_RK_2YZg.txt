This place is a foodie's dream!!! Local ingredients, and I mean like really local, like next block over local, local brews, handcrafted cocktails to go with hand crafted tortillas, no pre blend mixes here! Just awesome all over. Nick is one of the realist waiters I've ever met. So good! I'm so full I can't breathe because it was all amazing. Live the concept, love the food, love the personality!
