This is my go-to place for a decent taco. I'm a simple man, so I usually go for the chicken taco on corn tortilla; with lettuce, cheese and green sauce. Delicious! Throw in a side of rice and pinto beans and 
I'm one happy Mexican. 

Can be a little pricey. I usually drop about $7 - $10 just for me, but that's because I'm fat. 

I've never had any issues with this place as of yet. I recommend this place if you're looking for a quick place to satisfy your Mexican food fix.
