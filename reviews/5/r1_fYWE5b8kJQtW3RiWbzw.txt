Although they have been around for decades, I did not learn about them until about 6 or so years ago.  Wonderful Mother/Daughter traditional and authentic (no sour cream) reliable food, in a small building with good parking.  There are sometimes more take-out customers waiting for their "fix" than people at the restaurant.  Note: to spicy-avoiders their salsa is a bit tangy for the non-heat lovers.  Everything is prepared as you order, so be patient.  I am also a huge fan of Tia Rosa's in Mesa with a totally different take on the Mexican menu, so it is not just the fact Elvira's is Mexican.
