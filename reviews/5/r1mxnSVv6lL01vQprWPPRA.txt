Every part of this place is great.  From the service to the food to the beer to the atmosphere.  There are two seating options when you get there: bar or restaurant.  The guys at the cash registers have been friendly each time offering to take our order with a smile on their faces.

We sit in the bar where the bartender is very friendly and I've met three different bartenders.  We've sat at the bar as well as in their lounge area and the waitstaff is very friendly and will joke back and forth with you.

Then add in their food, and its amazing.  Whoever is responsible for coming up with their awesome menu should get a raise!  Fish tacos, carne asada tacos, salso...all of it is amazing so get ready for your taste buds to thank you!
