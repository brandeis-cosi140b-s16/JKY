One of my favorite taco joints.  The inside is split into 4 sections in terms of what you want to order.  If you want pork, you get in the "pork" line.  If you want asada (beef), you get in the asada line, etc.  There's also a miscellaneous line for stuff like pork brains/etc.  As such, if you want multiple things you have to go to multiple lines! =(

After you collect your food, you pay at the counter.  

Beef Tongue Sopes - $4.50 - Awesome 4/5
The sopes tasted awesome.  The beef tongue is super tender and soft.  The sopes was tasty and one of my favorites.

Adobada (Spicy Pork) Tacos - $2.50 Each - Solid
Also solid.  The adobada (aka spicy pork) tacos are super good.  You won't regret it if you order it.

TIPS:
-Ordering for the first time is very confusing!
-Inside is pretty spacious/clean
