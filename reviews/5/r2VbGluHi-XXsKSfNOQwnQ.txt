One of the best Mexican restaurants I have been to. The salsa they bring out with the chips is Amazing. I could eat the whole chips and salsa on my own! I ordered the chicken enchilada , filled with great flavors. Service was great, our server came by plenty of times to make sure we were doing okay. Definitely would recommend this place if you are craving Mexican !! They do get busy so I would either call ahead or be prepared to wait a little.
