Oh. My. Damn!  I effing love this place!  I've been a lot and have always had great food and good service.  The oysters are a must have app, with a little squeeze of lime and a dash of salt...my mouth is watering now!  The little woman and I both usually get one of their cocktails (shrimp, octopus, squid, snail) served with chips and some avocado. The shrimp ceviche is another favorite, nice and limey. The last few times, however, my gal ordered fish.  I believe it was cooked in garlic and butter and came with rice and beans and it was phenomenal!  Sometimes they have live mariachi music, which just adds to the greatness!
