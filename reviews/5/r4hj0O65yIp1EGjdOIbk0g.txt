The things I like best about La Condesa (other than the decor - I love the imagery of Dia de los Muertos and Catrina):   their delicious homemade horchata, garnished authentically with bits of melon and pecans;  their many unusual varieties of homemade salsas (jicama, peanut, pecan, berry, every type of chile/tomato combination... All of them tasty); and their thick-rolled, flavorful quesas.  In the land of a thousand Mexican restaurants, they bring a fresh spin to the cuisine and the food is awesome.   Totally worth bumping elbows with one's fellow patrons a bit in the tight dining room.
