Lindo has existed in this same East Las Vegas location for decades. It's longevity is a testament to the flavor and quality of their food.  The original building was damaged in a fire in the 1990's, but was rebuilt and stands to this day. The late Pat Murita dined here often. It was one of his favorite restaurants in the world.

Always friendly and attentive service.  Evening diners will be entertained by a professional Mariachi band.  The atmosphere is festive and lively. Great for groups and families.  

The menu features a variety of authentic favorites from Mexico's Michoac√° region.  The seafood specialties are killer. The camarones (shrimp) are always plump and flavorful. Beef, chicken and pork dishes are also excellent.

Anyone who has ever eaten here will tell you that's it's some of the best Latino food you will ever have. 

They do a table-side guacamole flavored exactly to your liking.
