What a great surprise!  Simply the best steak bowl I've ever had. The guy next to me got up to tell the staff that it was the best burrito he'd ever had. A trend! 

Taste and flavor better than anything I've had in a long time. The steak is as good as it gets with amazing flavor and texture

It's laid out like Chipotle but that where the comparison stops. The flavor and taste is awesome!! What a treat. 

Service and attitude is as good as the food. Genuine and sincere - these guys love their store and are as excited about it as their customers. 

What a great find.!!!
