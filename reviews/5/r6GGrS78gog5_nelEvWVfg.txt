This Rubio's location is always clean and fast. In general, I always enjoy the food that I get at Rubio's and this place is no exception. My top recommendations would be the fish taco especial and blackened tilapia tacos. I also really like the blackened tilapia burrito. I haven't tried the non-fish options there but I've heard that they are good too!
