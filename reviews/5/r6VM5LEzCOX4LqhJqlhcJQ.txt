I grew up in San Diego where Mexican food is 2nd to none and a daily routine. I moved to Europe about 7 years ago and Mexican food became a fantasy. I went to Las Vegas this year to visit friends/family and found El Taco Feliz by accident as it was close to my hotel. I ate there everyday for breakfast and dinner until my holiday was over. 

Get the point?
