Best damn breakfast we had the entire trip!!!  Lightning fast service! Great food! And awesome atmosphere! 

I had the.......drumroll.....eggs benedict!  I also had the Cabo wabo fried taters...those were great!  That benedict was perfect. Loaded with hollandaise just like I like it.  Coffee was great.  Chocolate milk was good and cold.  My dad had the Cabo wabo style eggs benedict. It had shredded beef mixed with chorizo instead of ham.....I tried it, should've gotten it instead.  It was awesome! 

I will be making this a regular stop from now on!!!
