This place is a classic dive, with great REAL homemade Mexican food. The tacos,tostadas,tortas,tamales,pozole,enchiladas,Mexican Coca Cola, and beers are all great. I love this place. 3 tacos compenchano with cilantro, onion, and fresh lime, with a Mexican glass bottle coke. This will run you $ 10.00 bucks with an almost $2.00 tip if you eat there. Take it to go,save the tip. This is my fav meal from there, and you will not be hungry after, because the tacos are big. Im a big dude, and most normal eaters can easily get away with just 2 tacos.
