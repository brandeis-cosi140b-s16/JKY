Wow, it is amazing how everybody thinks they are a food critic and gives poor reviews cuz there plastic silverware snapped. Just a heads up people they actually put tons of great stuff inside the burrito, unlike Taco bell so you will probably need to use a knife and a fork to cut it. I have eaten at the original Tia Rosas for almost 10 years. I love it, and now I am stoked that I can get the same great food and a different location, 

The food is the exact same quality and the service is friendly. Not to mention it is really laid back and a great place to go. My fav thing is a chicken Burro that is made enchilada style with the green sauce, with guacamole and sour cream inside. It is so tasty, and just the right amount of food, Their red and green salsas are also both really good. it is so good Tia Rosa Taqueria is a must go to for everyone.
