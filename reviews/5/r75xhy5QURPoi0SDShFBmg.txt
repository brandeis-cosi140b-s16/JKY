I love Robertos. I live in Austin and Robertos doesn't exist! So this is a must stop.

Rolled tacos and fried beef tacos. Never fail. Excellent guacamole, open during Christmas, cheesy and filled with beef. 

The restaurant was clean, the salsa bar was filled and the d√©cor was updated since I last visited.
