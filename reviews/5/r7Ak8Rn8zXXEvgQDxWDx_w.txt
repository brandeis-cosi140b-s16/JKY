Zabas....your my best friend.  When anyone says they are from Vegas I always ask them "oh, do you know Zabas?".  There are hundreds of random dining places to choose from, but every time I ask about the random burrito joint 10 miles from the strip.
Why? Probably because it's Home of my favorite burrito in the world...Steak, with beans, fajita, potatoes, cheese, lettuce and plenty of hot snaauce.  It is basically a Chipotle, for lack of a better reference, on steroids.  Picture good ol' Chipotle but with bigger burritos (or bowls or tacos or quesadillas) with more options for meats, fillers and sauces.  Did i mention the potatoes yet?  Sweet or fried.  Great quality all around.  

Tip:  F r i e d  P o t a t o e s.  Yum. Stop reading. Go.
