Great fun place to come visit. So many things to see if I can very historical. The drive is not good for trailers or motorhomes very windy  narrow roads. If you've never been there it's a must, if you have people coming into town it's a great place to take them .you won't regret it. The foods not bad and it's not great really all about atmosphere. I really takes you back on time.
