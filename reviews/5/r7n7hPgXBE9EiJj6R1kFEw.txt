This is A family owned and operated restaurant that has been around forever in Chandler. Their food is absolutely awesome as is the service. If you aren't in the mood to eat out or you need somewhere to just pick up some appetizers for a party definitely go here and get takeout bean dip salsa and chips. Every time we visit Arizona we make it a point to come to this restaurant. I really can't say more about this place other than it is one of our absolute favorites.
