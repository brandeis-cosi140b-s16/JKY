I had Taquitos Jalisco cater for a company lunch and the food and preparation of all the sides including tortillas, salsa, onions and cilantro were perfect. The food was delicious. We had carne asada and al pastor and the flavor was on point. The beans tasted amazing and worked well on the side. I highly recommend visiting this place and the staff makes the experience just that much better. Thank you!
