My new favorite burrito joint in Phoenix. The tortillas are addictive. My 2 go-to burritos are the bacon breakfast burrito and the green chile pork burrito. This place is a great alternative to the overly greasy gut-bombs you get at the omnipresent ****berto's restaurants that dominate the landscape.
