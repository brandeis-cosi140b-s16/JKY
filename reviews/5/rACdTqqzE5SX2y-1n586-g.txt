Just a friendly suggestion from a guy who loves RM's food and appreciates the attentive servers:  those radio advertisements that come in bunches of 7 or 8 every 20 minutes or so over the speakers (bouncing on the brick walls and hard floors)----they do not contribute to an otherwise nice dining experience.  Maybe find music without commercials?  Or go without music like I think RM used to do?  Someone trying to sell me car insurance while I'm eating is not an optimal ambience...
