Husband and I were in Tempe and hungry. Yelped and this little gem popped up. I had the chile relleno burrito. OMG! The cheese was melted and running all over the plate, and flavorful!  I KNOW my chile rellenos and this was a good one, slightly charred the way I like it. The husband had the 3 taco plate, chicken adobo, chorizo & barbecued chicken. He said they were all good. I tasted only the barbecued chicken taco and had to agree with him.   Their salsa bar is awesome, and they keep it on ice so it stays really fresh. I also had a sampling of their smoked chicken and it was really good tasting. Apparently they make smoked chicken tacos.  Will definitely go back when next I'm in town.
