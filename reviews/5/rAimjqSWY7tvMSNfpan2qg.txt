Wow! We had the blue corn enchilada and the new Mexico burrito. Both were excellent. Found our new favorite place in east phoenix for some good mexican food. Also had the banana reno (which was basically ice cream with deep fried tortillas and banana) not an everyday thing but was a nice treat for us. The reviewers were correct in this place. In 4 months, we will be trying the tequila but for now... only one of us would be drinking lol
