Chipotle should be my first name, not my nickname or middle name, but my first name. Maybe one day I'll change it to Chip. /end randomness

I was overjoyed when I heard there was a Chipotle closer to me. Driving to Robinson was fine, but it got old after a while.

I thought it was odd that right next to Chipotle was a Moe's Southwest Grill. (I always thought that if Chipotle served cheese sauce similar to Moe's, it'd be absolute perfection.) I'm not too sure how that will impact each eatery but hey, best of luck to Moe's.

Anyway, the staff was super friendly. I'm not too sure if they were genuinely happy or were forced to be because of the new location. Still, I was a fan of their kindness and prompt service. Also, I actually had someone come by my table and ask if everything was ok - twice. My steak burrito bowl with a tortilla on the side and bag of chips couldn't have been better. I made sure to let the guy know - twice.
