I dream about this place since the last time I went. 

Who knew one of the best Mexican restaurants in the states was next to a strip joint? I remember driving there in the cab and the taxi driver kept going oh you mean sapphire? No... I mean the restaurant next to it. I think he waited outside just to confirm I wasn't shy about it. 

That day I stuffed my self. I had tacos guacamole and sopes and I was instantly transported to my moms kitchen. 

I know a chef prides in his food when he comes out his kitchen and asks how the food is and what could go better. Nothing it was all amazing!  He suggested I check in and get a free flan. Hell yes! I'm a sucker for dessert and once again I asked if my mom was in the back cooking. 

Vegas has amazing places to eat and this is one I would definitely fly into Vegas just to have dinner. I can't wait to be back!
