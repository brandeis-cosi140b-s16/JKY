BEST TACO'S YOU WILL EVER EAT:

Call us Taco connoisseurs, if you will. We know how to find the best tacos anywhere and have had them everywhere form the boarder to the middle of Nebraska but if they have them, we will find them. At Tacos El Gordo we found them indeed!

This place has two dollar tacos which is a price hard to beat anywhere on the strip. They are expanding their store so you MIGHT not have to stand outside, but with as busy as this place is, you probably will have to for a short time. They serve ALL kinds of delicious tacos ranging from if you are brave or just want the amazing NOT average taco. By that I mean you can have the cow brain or carne asada (beef) and anything in between. They add a slice of pineapple to it which seriously makes the tacos out of this world and your meal would not be complete without horchata served perfectly cold to you. On the side is fried onions and peppers and add their avocado sauce to anything and everything! Also, many times the best Mexican food must be found in, forgive me, more ghetto looking areas so you know it is legit or out of a taco truck. Here, it is so clean and they serve things so well! 

I don't care what kind of food you love or where you generally like to eat, this is a MUST for you to try. Get your radishes, limes and napkins and get in line!
