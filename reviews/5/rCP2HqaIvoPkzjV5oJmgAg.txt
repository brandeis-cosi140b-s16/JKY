I've driven past this amazing restaurant dozens of times and never paid it any attention.  From the outside it looks like every run of the mill taco shop with nothing special to offer.

But that is part of the charm - It's in COGNITO!

As a Texas Transplant I yearn for home.  Stepping into El Encanto is like stepping back in time in San Antonio, Texas.  It is reminiscent of the River Walk and has all of the charm of the restaurants and cantinas along that stretch of water.

This is a family run establishment that cares about its customers.  Atmosphere is a sophisticated casual built around a central bio-pond with birds and ducks and turtles and fish.  The outside is so gorgeous that even in the heat you have to wait for a seat here (cooled by misters and fans).  Inside is just as quaint decorated with an eclectic nature that can best be described as recycling out of necessity.

Lets not forget the FOOD!  Food here is great and in ample portions.  It isn't Tex-Mex like I'm use to, but it was a spicy and flavorful version of Sonoran that my pallet found welcoming.  The price is right too.  You won't have to finance a meal, and I guarantee you will walk out stuffed and with leftovers.

We only had the frozen house margarita so I can't comment on the whole bar (one day I will ;-p  ) but I can say that as far as House-Ritas go, theirs is one of the better ones in the valley.  It is a good balance of all of the flavors that make a quality Margarita.

This is a place to be savored with friends.  GO AND ENJOY!
