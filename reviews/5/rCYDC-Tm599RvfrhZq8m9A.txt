My husband and I love Chipotle, but decided to try somewhere new and local. el Rancho was a pleasant surprise! They were super fast, everything was fresh and it was delicious! The owner was there and was so friendly! He double checked to see how we were doing, asked if it was our first time there and gave us a punch card for the next visit! 

We will be back for sure!
