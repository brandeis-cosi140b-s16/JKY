Happy that I did alot of searching and found this place in the north. Terrific from the start... Frank helped us out with a Dos Equis draft and Margarita, chips and salsa were outstanding also. Frank gave us this creamy jalape√±o dip with free Yelp queso , awesome. Entrees were large and extremely tasty. Definitely recommend!
