Excellence all the way around! Our sever, Amber, was tremendous, friendly and professional. She explained the menu, made suggestions and checked on us regularly. The table side guacamole was the best I've ever had! Margaritas, chicken street tacos, pork shoulder tacos and white bean pur√©e were perfectly prepared and served. Loved the atmosphere too! We'll be back!
