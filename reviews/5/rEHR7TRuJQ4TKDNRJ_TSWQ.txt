If you don't know what tapas is or don't like tapas.. don't come here and then write a one star review because the portions are "teeny, tiny"... IT'S TAPAS! It's not Golden Corral.

The food here is sublime. Get the grilled shrimp pupusa. The conchita pibil belly taco and bok bok chicken chicken are also very good. Street corn rocks and my wife says the brussel sprouts were fantastic.
