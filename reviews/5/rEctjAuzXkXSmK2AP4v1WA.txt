SO happy we found this little hole in the wall right near our house. The prices can't be beat and the food is amazing!! Management was SO polite and helpful to my family. Every time we have come in we feel like we are treated like family! 

The chorizo breakfast burrito is one of my favorites. We used to go to The Coffee Shop for burritos but we just found food that is 10x better for 1/2 the price! 

This is definitely a spot we have added to our regular digs.
