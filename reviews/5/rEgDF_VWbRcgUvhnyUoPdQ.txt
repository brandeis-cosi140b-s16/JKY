Went here with my fiance this past weekend, was a little difficult to find at first, but definitely worth doing so.

Had the fry bread with Machaca (and red hatch chili sauce) and the combination of flavors was absolutely amazing. The frybread was perfectly crisp on the outside, and very pillowy inside, and actually remained so as it cooled down.

All of the ingredients were very fresh, and everything was very wonderfully flavored. The machaca was just perfectly spicy and their red chili sauce added a perfect bit of kick to the whole dish.

I'm definitely excited to go back and try some of their other offerings, especially the green chili and pork. All food was very reasonably priced, and nothing seemed small enough to make you feel lacking (and if that were a problem, unlike most other places of a similar scale, they do have chips and salsa while you wait) Plus, any place that serves breakfast all day is already streets ahead to me.
