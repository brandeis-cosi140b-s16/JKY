I enjoy going to Chipotle, now open on Decatur and 215. I finally have one close by. I went there with my son the other day and everything was good. Same kind of burrito as the one in Centennial Hills. The staff are friendly. Food was good as usual. It's a little small in there compared to other ones, but there are still room to sit and eat. I would definitely be back.
