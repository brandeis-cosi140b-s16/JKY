I was afraid of Filiberto's for a lot of years.  They had only a handful of free-standing (that I knew about) 24-hour walk-up type places, and the stories I heard of people coming out of there indicated a gastrointestinal revenge of some type.  No bueno!

However -- since they've opened up the Pavilions store, my heart has opened up to Filibertos!  Their portions are HUGE, their food doesn't taste plasticized or like it was just previously in a freeze-dried state.  I love their bean burritos with sour cream added.  Dreamy!

The staff are a little tough to navigate.  They sound very irritated a lot of the time, and I'm not sure if they're a little sick of inhaling the fumes of nearby McDonald's or what.  Inconsequential.  Mmm Filibertos!
