Ordered the chicken flauta, potato/manchego flauta,  tortilla soup, queso dip, veggie taco, pollo mole taco, adada taco, carnitas taco, alpastor taco... LOVED IT ALL. Super fun decor and great vibe. And I can't believe the reasonable prices for great quality of food. Every single employee was warm and welcoming
