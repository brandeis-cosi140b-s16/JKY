Gils' Taste of Taos is truly a diamond in the rough.
 The staff is friendly and attentive, while providing a comfortable and home like atmosphere. The food to say the least is just like "mama" use to make growing up. To start they brought over chips and homemade salsa, the chips were not bag chips but homemade, which went perfect with the salsa made from real New Mexico Chile. I had the Chorizo and Eggs with papas, and was more then pleased with the generous portion size and quality.  The sopapia's brought to the table were fresh and piping hot, I drizzled them with fresh honey kept on the table, and boy was it an experience short of heaven. 
 I can't wait for my next visit. I had the opportunity to meet Gil and what a nice guy. He took the time to greet us and shake our hands, as he welcomed us into his "home" what a great place to sit and chat with the locals.
