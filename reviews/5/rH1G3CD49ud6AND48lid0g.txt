MY FAVORITE HAPPY HOUR!!! This is where you find me when I need a drink and some tacos. Not even just tacos. All the food here is AMAZING, but I mean come on. We're talking about tacos here. And beer!! $2 draft bud light and $3 takillya (tequila)  shots?? Um, yes!! Service is always excellent when me and my happy hour buddy show up. I can never remember her name but the bartender with that adorable face and red hair is the best we've ever had at that bar. Always tentative and keeping that bar in tip top shape. Once I find her name I'll give it the recognition it deserves here on yelp. See you soon El Segundo!
