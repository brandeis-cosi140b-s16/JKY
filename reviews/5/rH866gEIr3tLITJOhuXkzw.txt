Everything I've ever had here has been great. We especially visit (at least once a week) for the breakfast burritos. You can order them just how you like, which is nice, but let me personally recommend Bacon Potato Egg and Cheese. Whether it's rolled tacos, regular tacos, enchiladas or just chips and guacamole you can't go wrong. All their ingredients seem very fresh and everything is made to order and piping hot when you get it. Good job Rivas and a personal thanks from my husband for being one of the few places who has Mt. Dew!
