When I came on here and saw the rating for La Fonda, I was appalled.  Since I am an Arizona native, I consider myself a Mexican Food connoisseur, and La Fonda is great Mexican food!!  Chips, Salsa annnnnd hot sauce, all delicious.  Options for a skinny margarita, check.  Rice and beans, yum.  Green chile, carne & enchiladas all bueno.  But I think my favorite part is the flour tortillas.  I am not sure if they make them in house or not, but they are legit!  I do wish they had a grilled fish option, or offered free range/anti-biotic free chicken, so I could eat here more often.  Long and short, fantastic Mexican food restaurant, with a really nice atmosphere!
