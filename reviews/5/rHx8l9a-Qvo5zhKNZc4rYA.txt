I'm disappointed by the low rating this Macayo's has! It's the closest one to where we live, and we've had nothing but great service and delicious, quickly served food.

The last time we went (around 2 pm on a Friday-- admittedly not rush time, but still), we were seated promptly, greeted, asked about our drink order, and served. Our server was attentive and answered all our questions without any snark or exasperation.

Our food came out hot and was delicious-- I forgot exactly what my boyfriend had, but it was something with garlic cream sauce, which was out of this world. I had the California Burrito (or at least that's what I call it... it's the veggie burrito) and it was so good I couldn't wait to take it home for leftovers! (I was the tool who left it there though... booo!)

The meal was reasonably priced, our check came out correctly, and we were given excellent service. No complaints, and we'll be going again!
