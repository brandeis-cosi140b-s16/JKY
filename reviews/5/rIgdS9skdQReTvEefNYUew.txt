I'm from Miami and I moved here and thought they wouldn't have a lot of good Spanish restaurants like they did back home, but once me and my gf came in it was amazing, the food is great, the music is all Latin, and the place has great service here. This will definitely be the place where all my friends will go to for good latin food 




Neta es el lugar mas chido que e encontrado
