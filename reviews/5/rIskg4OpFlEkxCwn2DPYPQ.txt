5 stars across the board! Every visit has been a positive experience...always friendly service...fresh authentic mexican food prepared by long time employees...they offer options when placing an order and each dish is served made to order...best tamales in town, among other yummy menu items! Cute traditional decor and casual atmosphere make this spot a local favorite for lunch or dinner. If you crave real deal Mexican...you will crave El Molino!
