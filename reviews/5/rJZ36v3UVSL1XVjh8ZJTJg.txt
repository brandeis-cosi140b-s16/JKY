Another review of Barrio?
Yea, why not.

5 of us went tonight.
They had a special Margarita with a great tequila, simple with only lime juice and triple sec or something.  Very dry and yummy ($11).

Tableside Guac is fantastic with the pomegranite seeds and also the Queso Fundido (sp?).  The Queso Fundido is a little bit of work to eat as the cheese tends to be a bit stringy.  You have to just go right for it and show no fear.  It is quite good.

I ordered the Conchinita Pibil Tacos (roasted pork) which were great.  They come with a starter salad or french fries.  I had the salad and loved it, great dried cranberries in it.  Hard to explain to people why they are having a salad or french fries at an upscale white table cloth "mexican" restaurant.  But it works.

My tacos do conchinita pibil (pork) were great, with a little Casera cheese (a treat).   There are 4 small tacos so I got to trade with my brother who had the fish tacos which I thought were even better than the pork.  

My partner had the Enchiladas Mole (a favorite).  But in truth, I may be bored with this dish.  I thought it was a bit dry, and lacked flair.  Not sure what it is, but it just seemed flat.  Was like that the last time I went also.  I love the Mole sauce, but the enchilada itself was boring.

Oh, and the second margarita was even better than the first.

Service is cocky, maybe even strict at times, and very pleasing overall.  They know what they are doing and you can trust them.  Was a bit noisy tonight, as there isn't much sound deadening.  

I honestly can't stand it when they have live music - ditch that.

If you haven't been, it is a must.

Parking:  Sucks.  Bring your friends car, park out back and don't worry about it.
