LOVE THIS PLACE!

Had fantastic service (went during lunch and at their "Friends and Family" opening). I hate that folks a week ago got the service they did-but this place had literally JUST OPENED and their staff was still training. Guys, give them another chance!

The atmosphere is awesome-from the spray painted rock-icon murals in the dining room to the BEAUTIFUL distressed American flag (done by a friend of mine) to the wacky art in the bar.

And, since my favorite spice blend happens to be cilantro/lime/chipotle-their menu makes me one happy girl! Try the wings-and don't diss the special ranch-it is AMAZING! Also fantastic-their cilantro-chile fries. YUM!

And if you like tequila, they have plenty for you to sample.

I'll be back again and again!
