I've now eaten at the Gilbert Barrio Queen twice and both times were fantastic! From the table side quacalome to the skinny margaritas...the first course was delish! I love The Queen enchiladas. They are super cheesy and the white sauce that they are smothered in is to die for. But I have to say their chips and salsa may be my ultimate fav. Their salsa is just the right spice and so flavorful! The kids meals are huge and easily shareable!! Love me some Barrio Queen!!
