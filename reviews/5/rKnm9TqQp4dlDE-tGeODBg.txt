I've eaten at a lot of small cafe/mexican food places like this including Chipotle, Qdoba, Baja Fresh and other small hole-in-the-wall places.  This is one of my favorites because they have some of the most tender meats that they pull/shred there in front of you.  I love the location there on corner of 59th & Union Hills.  Very convenient!
