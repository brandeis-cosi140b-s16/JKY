This place always hits the spot! Nothing better than a delicious steak salad.  
I had my dog with me and they allowed me to bring her to the patio area. even one of the employees offered me more water for her! it's very nice to find a place that is dog friendly with delicious food. if you're a health freak Chipotle is definitely a place for you!!!
