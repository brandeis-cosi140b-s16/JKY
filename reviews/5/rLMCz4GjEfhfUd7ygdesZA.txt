I have been dining at Serrano's for years!  I rarely change my order, which is chicken burro enchilada style (red), rice only.  They offer complimentary chips, salasa, and hot BEAN DIP!  Its worth it alone to have the bean dip, never had it better anywhere else.  Luckily Serrano's is all over the valley, and if you're in a neighborhood for a period of time, you can count on Serrano's offering you their amazing dishes.
