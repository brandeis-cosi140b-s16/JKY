I use to frequent this restaurant when I lived in Orlando Fl.  It was always one of my favorites.  When it opened up here I was excited to see not much has changed.  The service is fantastic and everyone is overly polite. The Hot Sauce Bar makes every visit an adventure and the chimichanga (wet on all sides) is amazing.  I have to go back asap.
