A co-worker and I drove by and said we have to try it, some of the best tacos and burritos are found at places similar to this, so we did and it did not disappoint. First off the Rosarito Hot Dog my co-worker ordered looked great and he said it was amazing (he ended up getting another after the first) I ordered the carne burro and a pastor taco....delicious!!!! The carne on the burro was fresh and tender, and the pico and crumbled cheese made for a simple delicious burro. The people giving somewhat lower reviews are entitled to their opinion but I personally would have to strongly disagree. Keep up the good work!! We will be going back!
