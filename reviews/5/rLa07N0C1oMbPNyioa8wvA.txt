UPDATE:

Management contacted me and offered a free meal based on my first experience.  A friend and I went during lunch time, on a Friday.

We ordered our food. I got the enchiladas and he got the chicken chimichonga.  They both arrived very quickly and were absolutely delicious! 

As I said before, the service was amazing and this experience didn't disappoint!  

I'm very glad they read the post and offered me a 2nd chance! They have a beautiful restaurant and its easy to see why they are so popular!
