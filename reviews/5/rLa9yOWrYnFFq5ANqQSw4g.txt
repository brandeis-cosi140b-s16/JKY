I ordered the Parmesan crusted wild cod with shrimp. It definitely exceeded my expectations! The cod was perfectly cooked and the shrimp were seasoned beautifully. I could tell that the food was fresh and only of the highest quality. David the chef was very friendly and it shows that he aims to please the costumer. I definitely recommend this hidden gem!!
