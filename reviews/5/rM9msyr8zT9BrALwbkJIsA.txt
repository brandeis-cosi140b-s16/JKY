We were visiting Las Vegas and got tickets to the Blue Man Group, stopped here to get a little appetizer before the show.  Excellent atmosphere, very friendly staff.  Ordered the Combo Nacho's and they are AMAZING!  Stacked with stuff and it was quite prompt, especially considering how busy it was while we were there.

A+
