Amazing. Went to Scottsdale location on a roadtrip to mejico. It was disappointing literally disappointing. I then was driving back to LA, and thought why not try to make up for it? And stopped at this location. Dear god service is better food was better faster best service ive ever had, chips were fresh and hot this time. Huge difference!!! I love macayos. Enchiladas, red corn Taquitos, Baja sauce, beans n cheese! Jordan was the best service ever. She is amazing!!!!

Further: If you do not like this, it's because you are choosing very poorly for entrees.
What can one TRULY never go wrong with at Macayos?

- Red Corn Chicken Taquitos
- Cheese Crisp (dont ask - just eat it!)
- They used to have Chicken Maximillion but they removed it from the menu so I'm going to just say mostly anything with the baja sauce. 

I was disappointed by:
- Baja Chicken Chimichanga 
- Macayos Burgers
- Green Corn Tamale- way too much jalepeno.

If you go for the classics, your mind will explode every time. If you don't.. sorry.. you will give it 1-2 stars, as it is GRINGO Mexican. It has a few spectacular dishes which I drive 5.5 hours just to consume, but it's not authentico by any flip of the coin. There's nothing wrong with that, but just don't expect it.
