The original restaurant we were planning to go to was closed on Sundays. Reviews of this one encouraged is to go. We had the pollo fundido which was out is this world. There is so much chicken in it and lots of flavor. My husband had the caramba quesadilla and we were stuffed !  Great white sangria too
