Let me start by Saying Ive always been a fan of Robertos Taco Shop because I avoid Taco Bell at all cost. To me Taco bell isnt mexican food. Well On a friends advice on my visit to vegas with my little one we stop in at Rubalcabas. Ive always drove by it even when i lived in Vegas but never went in. WTF was i thinking. I should of gone in here sooner. Saying this as i kick myself. I had the Carne Asada Burrito Plate and my Benefactor had Chicken Tacos. 

The prices i think are better priced than Robertos. And The burrito actually had moist meat inside. While Robertos tortillas are kinda crispy. This tortilla was soft and chewy and packed full of goodness. I was having second thoughts about ordering the plate because im not a fan of rice or beans. But I ate them both which is something i never do. Even my daughter ate her rice and beans as my jaw dropped. I had to swipe a taco and holy moly it was moist and delicious, while at other establishments the chicken is dry and needs to be heavily sauced to get it down the throat. I now have a Number 1 besides Robertos. They even have Flan inside a case for your gluttony desire. 
Thanks for the advice Richard.
