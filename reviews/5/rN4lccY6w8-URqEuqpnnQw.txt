I have nothing bad to say about my lunch visit here. Service, food, and ambiance were amaze! I loved it!
Let's start with the menu: At lunch time they have this express deal where you get to pick one primero (1st course) and one secundo (2nd course) and a beverage ALL for only $15 ! My sister did this special and went for the nachos libre which were HUGE and delicious! The best nachos I have ever had, soaked in cheese and black beans topped with tomatoes, radishes, and micro greens. Super gourmet and tasty and HUGE! for her secundo she ordered the carne asada which came with mole and plantains. This dish may be too small if it's all you were gonna order. But it was excellent.
I didn't go for the lunch special. I just ordered from the "secundo" menu. The pollo sandwhich was GIGANTIC I kid you not. It was about 6 inches tall. Avocado, fried chicken, cheese, tomato, refried beans. It was tasty but not the most delicious thing I had that day. Will probably go for something different next time I go. But if you are hungry, go for this sandwich..it's big!
My mom went for the carnitas tacos. It came with three small tacos that you could finish off in 9 bites total. But they were delicious! Not enough for lunch, but perfect to order if you are doing their lunch express deal. 
THE CHIPS AND GUACAMOLE ARE A MUST! SUPER TASTY! a must order!
service: was excellent. Pete was our server and he was very friendly

A MUST GO FOR LUNCH! dish prices range from $9-$16 (the lunch express deal is perfect cuz you get two dishes and a drink for $15)
