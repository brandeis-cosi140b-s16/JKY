I have visited this location of Chipotle on a few occasions recently and each time I go there I am really impressed and enjoy my food.I have had the chicken burrito and also the steak burrito which are both excellent.The prices are also really good and I feel it is very good value for your dollars,I will continue to visit this Chipotle for sure in the future! Highly recommend..
