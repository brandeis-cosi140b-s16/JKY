Oh Caf√© Rio, please come to NJ.  I did email you to ask, but like letting down the "not-so-cool" kid when he asks you to the prom, you said no!
My wife and I stop here every trip to Vegas. Recently it was our first stop after getting off the plane at 8pm.  Fresh tortillas, sweet pork burrito (enchilada style), a cold drink, and a seat outside....what more can you ask for. The service is a 10+, the employees are super nice and helpful. The price seems a bit high but I will not complain; it is well worth it.  Just one more stamp for the freebie!! I got to get to Vegas again soon!

Please come to NJ!!!!
