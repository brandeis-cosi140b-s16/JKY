Haven't been here in 4 months and the food is still great. Potato and machaca burrito was perhaps better than the machaco and egg? I'll have to eat more of each to determine which is the winner. Always have the burritos enchilada style as Maria's enchilada sauce is great. I like that they have vegetarian options, chips are fried in vegetable oil, never lard. 

Open now M-Fr, still great personal service, still a clean neat place. The food is the absolute best Mexican around.
