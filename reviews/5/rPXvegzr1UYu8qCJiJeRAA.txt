This place is a gem. 

After a severely disappointing experience at an upscale restaurant in LA, my boyfriend wanted to salvage my taste for oysters so he brought me here. 

The oysters pacifico, covered in red sauce, avocado, and shrimp, is what all oysters should want to be when they grow up. We also got the mixed seafood cocktail served in a coconut, with the coconut water served in glass! The service was great - we came here for a late lunch and were the only customers. She brought us two cups of seafood soup to get our meal started. 

The building has a large mural on one side, so it's hard to miss, and there are a few parking spots right next to the building.
