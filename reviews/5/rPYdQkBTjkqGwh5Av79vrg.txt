We were looking for a place to eat and stumbled across this small taco shop not far from our home. It's a small and quant place next to a gas station. I would not call this place a hole in the wall or dive but just like most hole in the wall family owned restaurants this one rocks! The food is authentic, you can tell immediately that you are in for a real authentic meal. We have been here many times and I have to say my favorite is their fish tacos and their homemade chips. Yes they actually make each bag of tortilla chips from scratch by slicing up tortillas and frying them. Most Mexican food in general bloats my stomach and gives me indigestion, but not Apache Taco! It must be because they use only fresh ingredients and no crap or fillers. We will definitely be ordering from them again in the future, in fact perhaps we will order in and have them deliver this evening. If you are looking for a quick meal try apache taco instead of Taco Bell or Dell Taco for a healthier option.
