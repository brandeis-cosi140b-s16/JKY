After much anticipation for the new location to open. Yesterday was the 1st day open. Typically a lot of things go south with new openings, Nacho Daddy was an exception. Our server Johnny was excellent. attentive, friendly and fast. The food was very good and the selection of Tequila is extensive.  It was also Taco Tuesday which gets 2 for 1 Tequila. Woo Hoo.  My only negative comment is the staff is not well versed in Tequilas. ND should train/educate all employees about Tequila. 
With that being said we look forward to returning soon to the New Nacho Daddy's in Summerlin for another fun evening
