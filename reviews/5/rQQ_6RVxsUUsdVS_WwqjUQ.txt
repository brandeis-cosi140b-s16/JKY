I can't believe I'm reviewing this place again just 6 days later. I had dinner here last night with 7 friends, and everyone loved it. The Queso Fundido with 3 or 4 cheeses was just excellent, and every one of us loved it. The Guacamole was excellent. My short ribs were excellent. The enchiladas were excellent. It's all good!
