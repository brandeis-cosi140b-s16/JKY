You can't beat this place in food or clientele late at night.  The adobado tacos were awesome.  We fed the entire family of 5 for under $40, and in Vegas that can't be beat.  Amazing food!  This place was entirely packed.  An ambulance pulled up and parked there to eat too, a sure sign that this is good food...  medics don't wait for food that might be bad.  Because there's a good chance we will get a call while we are waiting for food, and why would you wait in line for bad food???  There's a very good tip for everyone...
