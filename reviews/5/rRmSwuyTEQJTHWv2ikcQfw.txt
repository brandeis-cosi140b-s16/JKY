The food is fine. Wished it was still open 24 hours. Have had several of the items and really nothing to complain about. They were able to answer our questions about the ingredients in the items. I just wished that they had green onions...most others have them.  The staff has alway been very friendly towards us.. Nice to have choices in this area.
