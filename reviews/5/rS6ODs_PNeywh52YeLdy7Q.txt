OK, yes it is a greasy spoon. So what? When we landed in Phoenix a couple of years ago, this is the first place I headed for based on memories of living here decades ago. I ate a chimichanga the size of my calf. Yum. Nowhere else I have lived has a chimi that is anything like this. (Or like one anywhere in Phoenix, for that matter.) If you are anywhere near here, try it.
