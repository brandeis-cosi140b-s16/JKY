Omg best Mexican food I've had in a while. I wish I could go here more often! The quality of food is phenomenal, and the quantity is huge. People are friendlyish, but it makes my heart happy hearing them try to hide their singing with the music. I would recommend this place to anyone and everyone that's looking for good Mexican food!!!
