I love this place. For a girl who loves Chipotle- I love this place more. 
I am not from Phoenix but if I was I would eat here at least once a week. I had the burrito which was massive and more than I could have expected. 
They offered to have us taste the food before we ordered our food seeing as we had never been there before. 
The decor is tacky but the owner/staff are amazing and more than willing to help you with what ever you want. 
If they served alcohol this place would have it all- that being said they easily earned five stars. 
I love this place and recommend it to anyone and everyone.
