Yes is is not on the strip but it is definitely with the drive. My two friends and I spent the day hiking and were ravenous after a long day. We started with the chips and salsa then ordered guac to start which could have been spicier but was fresh as could be. For dinner, the three of us split chicken fajitas for 2.the chicken was done perfectly. Stuffed and satiated does not even begin to describe our food coma. Unfortunately, we were too stuffed to partake in dessert. The churros and fried ice cream looked phenomenal!
