I love this place....and all divey mexican joints for that matter!  I was in the area today, and was unfortuantely still full from lunch, so I didn't stop.  I used to drive by every morning on my way to work and would go through the drive thru at least 2-3 times a week to pick up breakfast AND lunch.  I don't care how dirty their kitchen is....I have never gotten sick, EVER.  When I was on a low-carb diet, I would order a burrito, eat the insides and I was still full!!!  Now, I fully indulge in the greasy, lard-filled, carb-filled goodness.  How can you go wrong with a breakfast combo of scrambled eggs w/ ham, refried beans and fresh tortillas...YUMM!!!  I agree that their "hot sauce" is very watery, but it still works.  Carne asada, carnitas, pollo asado, it's all good ")
