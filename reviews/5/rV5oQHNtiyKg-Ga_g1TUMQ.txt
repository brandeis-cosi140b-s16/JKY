Pleasantly surprised with the food and service.  Talked with Ben and Manny and the service was probably something you would expect at a nice steakhouse.  They greet you like your family and small talk with you while the food is being prepared.  The service was fantastic and couldn't say anything negative it really caught me off guard as I was expecting something similar to Robertos.  The food was amazing I ordered the pork fries.  The pork was packed with flavor and the size is out of this world.  Overall 5/5 for service and 5/5 for food.  Next time you are thinking of getting some food in the area definitely give this place a try!
