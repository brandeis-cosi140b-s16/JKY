I didn't realize that Zaba's was more of a fast food place than a full sit-down restaurant.  Zaba's is what Chipotle and Qdoba strive to be.  Excellent Mexican food, fast service, and a nice atmosphere.  Thankfully, they have plenty of vegetarian options.  The guacamole was delicious and nicely balanced the fajita vegetables.  My only complaint is that you can't see the restaurant from Flamingo, and I drove right past it.  They need a sign facing the street.
