Our favorite Mexican restaurant!
New convenient location. We are long time customers who have followed them to new locations. Love the chicken fajaitas with onions and peppers served on a cast iron griddle,  piping hot! Salsa and tortillas are very good. Enjoy all the dishes we've tried. Our go-to restaurant where we are always satisfied!
