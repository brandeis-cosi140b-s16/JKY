Best Beans and Hand-made Tortillas in Phoenix! I think the best way to judge a Mexican restaurant is by their beans. Even if they have the best salsa or the crispiest taco, if there beans taste like the inside of a can or like they have been re-fried one to many times, I NEVER return. The art of the bean is creamy, soft, silky, and well.....dreamy. The beans, the regular old beans that come on the side of their chili flecked machaca beef or the the eggs ala mexicana are the best I have ever had! The tortillas are freshly hand-made and are to die for. I wont even get started on the garlicky salsa, but I highly recommend a bowl of creamy beans with 2 flour tortillas.
