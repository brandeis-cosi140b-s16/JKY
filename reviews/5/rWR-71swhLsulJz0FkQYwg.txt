Well I happened to stumble a pond this place after seeing some wonderful views here on yelp,and i must admit I was very impressed,I had a wonderful convo with the cashier who was very kind,i had the 3 mini carnita tacos just to try and my stupid self got the food to go so when I got home I ate the tacos,and I  honestly can say they we're the best carnita tacos I've had in vegas,I wish I would've got more food..lol
