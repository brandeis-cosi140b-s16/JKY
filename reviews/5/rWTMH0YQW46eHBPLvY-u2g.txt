You look at this place from the outside and you wouldn't think much of it, much at all.  Actually, your subconsciousness would probably just have you look past it and not notice it at all.  But like my buddy's friend told him one day, look for the place that looks sort of run down with a lot of cars in front, they typically have the best food.  Following that advice, looking for food, we pulled a U-turn, went back and parked.

We were going to get take out until we heard the chips and salsa were free.  Budgeting and maximizing caloric intake, you know how that goes.  Place was hotter than all can be (the 2 a/c window units couldn't keep up), but we shrugged it off like the manly men we were and parked our arse.  

The waitress was really friendly and helpful in explaining all the stuff they make, and the best part about it is that it's made fresh - chips, salsa, guac, etc.  This place is the real deal when it comes to mexican food.  It just goes to show you how most all places bend and give in, abandoning their tradition, just to meet the "needs" of the American people.  Or shall I call it ignorance?
