I am basing this review strictly on their "CARNE ASADA BURRITO". 

I've been frequenting this place for years. I've tried the other Tacos Mexico chains around town, but for some reason the one on the EASTCYDE tastes better to me. I'm probably just trippin.

Located on Maryland Parkway and Charleston blvd.  Grimy. You gotta love it. 

These folks are open 24/7. Late night grinds are great here, but use the buddy system.

Now back to said subject...

Oh their CARNE ASADA BURRITO... I remember when this beast was less than $5.00.  This burrito to me has stolen my heart. I've tried other burritos at other joints.  They were all very good, but I find myself comparing them to the Tacos Mexico CARNE ASADA BURRITO on Charleston and Maryland.  A perfect combination of beans, Spanish rice, onions, and asada. Always comes out solid and greaseless. I always opt for Chile for that extra kick, and then I dump their red hot sauce all over that thing. The girth of this burrito will make you blush!!!

Till this day, I will always support Tacos Mexico's carne asada burrito. 

EYE LIKA CHU PEOPLES!!!
