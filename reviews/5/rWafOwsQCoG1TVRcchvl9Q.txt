Woah, this place was truly amazing.  Prior to visiting here, I never realized Korean and Mexican could fusion so well.  I actually did set my GPS to here driving down from Salt Lake City, and they are just located a bit northwest from the Strip.  The interior felt just like a Korean restaurant.  The place seems packed all the time even though we arrived during late lunch hours.

The chips with guacamole shredded off the Korean feel immediately.  We decided on Kimchi Beef Fried Rice and Spicy Pork Chimichanga per other yelpers recommendations.  The rice was absolutely delicious, all the ingredients worked very well together, and even my wife who is a picky rice eater could not stop eating it.  The chimichanga probably bridged the Pacific very well with dega bulgogi inside a fried burrito.  Their mango passion fruit ice tea was decent.

KoMex was truly amazing, it is definitely high on my must visit places when I am in Vegas.  We really wanted to order more things, but our stomachs reached its limited.  It seems like they are opening another location in Spring Valley area.
