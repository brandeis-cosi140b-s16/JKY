Came here twice on my vacation for New Years. We have Del Taco in Utah but this is by far the BEST and I mean BEST location I have ever been too!!!

The drive up guy was hilarious! Super friendly was patient.... We may have taken a minute or five to order everything lol. 

I got the hard shell tacos and seriously I don't care who you are those are the best darn tacos ever! Their food is so yummy especially at midnight!  love love love this location will for sure be coming back here when we come back to Henderson.
