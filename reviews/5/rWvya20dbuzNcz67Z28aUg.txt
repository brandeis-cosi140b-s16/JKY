I'm so glad I checked Yelp today! I was browsing around Yelp for something to eat in the neighborhood to see what I was feeling. Well if you know me, I am always down for Mexican and when I saw this new name I had to check it out! Very glad I did. The girl was sweet and asked me if I was interested in becoming a regular. All they needed was my name. I gave her my name and she right away started addressing me accordingly (no impersonal ma'am or miss, but by my first name). She asked how I found out about their place and let me know that they are all about customer service - which I could absolutely tell. The food was super on point too!!

I ordered adobada fries which comes in two sizes super size =$9 and their bigger one = $12. It was flavorful, the meat was delicious, and it had A LOT of it as well as fries! Not too much beans too which I liked. 

Anyways, definitely recommend anyone to try it! It's located inside the Sinclair gas station, so it might be easy to miss.
