This was our first time and it was DELICIOUS!! It shattered my expectations. I had the combination plate, shredded beef flautas. They were perfect. My nana has competition. They have a full bar and a board with specials. We'll be back for Thirsty Thursday's all day happy hour. The service was great. The chef was amazing. We will be back over and over again.
