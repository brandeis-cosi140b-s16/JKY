This is a rich mans Taco Bell, great food, family owned I think and since you gotta wait a couple minutes I'm pretty sure at least some of the food is made to order. They have a fantastic carne asada steak burrito but I mostly get the carne asada nachos with all the melted cheese, guacamole, meat and chips. It's not fast food cheap for one person (I never pay under $7) but that's why I go to the Taco Bell down the steak when I want to be cheap, but these guys...'looks right and left'...they got the good stuff man.
