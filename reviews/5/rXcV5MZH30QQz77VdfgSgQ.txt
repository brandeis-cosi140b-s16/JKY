This is true NM food. Although I am an AZ native, I lived for many years in Albuquerque and Gil's food competes with the best in that city. Their red chile enchiladas are excellent and the sopapillas are hot, fresh and puffy. The place is small, with a few outdoor tables. Bring your own beer and you will have an authentic, tasty and inexpensive meal.
