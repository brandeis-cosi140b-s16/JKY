FILLY-B's!!!!!  only 8 reviews?? NINE now!!!

wow do i miss THIS place:

- 24hrs
- drive-thru or walk up only
- ridiculously cheap
- ridiculously tasty

of course the arizona burritos are good, everything is good. i used to LOVE one of the combos... you get a beef burrito, taco, rice and beans... for UNDER $6.  wow.  color me silly and call me sally. they have bomb horchata too.

really good and fresh flautas/rolled tacos and breakfast burritos. damn, everything here is good, whether drunk or sober.
