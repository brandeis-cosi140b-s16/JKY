In town building a data center for the next few months and have finally found decent Mexican food. Food in general was flavorful and the tortilla soup was great. Nothing too fancy, just good food. The general staff were very attentive with great attitudes and Jessica was absolutely wonderful. I will be back if not this week then in the weeks to follow!
