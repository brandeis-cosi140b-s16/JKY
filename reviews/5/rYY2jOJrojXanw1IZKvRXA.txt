Oh Pancho's, how I miss you.

Authentic or high-quality Mexican food, this certainly is not. I've taken others who have vowed to never return. This place is not for the weak of stomach. If you are brave enough to try Pancho's Mexican Buffet and can appreciate it for what it is, you will love it as much as I do.

It might not appear to be a typical all-you-can-eat buffet, but just remember these three words: RAISE THE FLAG. Yeah, it's the ultimate American dream: an-all-you-can-eat buffet that doesn't even require getting off of your ass for seconds! Want more taquitos? RAISE THE FLAG! Tortillas, or chips, perhaps? RAISE THE FLAG.

You have to appreciate the absurdity of it all. And to top it off, the food's kinda delicious too, in a you-know-this-is-so-bad-but-it's-so-good sort of way.
