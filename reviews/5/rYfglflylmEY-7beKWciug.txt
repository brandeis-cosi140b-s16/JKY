Just an overall great place to grab drinks and dinner with friends...  Not as high priced as advertised, so don't let the $$$ scare you off if you are just looking for a great restaurant.  Amazing cocktails, the Filet and Enchiladas are to die for and you can't go wrong with their dessert.

Maybe my new favorite in Scottsdale...
