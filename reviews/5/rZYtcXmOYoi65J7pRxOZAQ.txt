Del Taco? Get the fuck outta here.
Taco Bell? No way in hell.

Hands down the best fast food Mexican restaurant on the face of the planet.

The stuffed quesadillas are out of this world delicious.

The Chicken Tacos al Carbon: quite the tasty street taco.

I can only assume the other stuff they sell is excellent too. Red salsa is ok, but the green salsa is where its at.

Happy feasting.
