This is old school mexican food at its best.  Love the traditional decor and the older wait staff who seem to have been there for years.  Best of all is their hot sauce.  Nothing like it any where.  Best taco and enchilada in town.

If you want a trendy, fancy place this is not for you, but if you want the best traditional mexican food served by the same family for generations, Jordans is just the place.
