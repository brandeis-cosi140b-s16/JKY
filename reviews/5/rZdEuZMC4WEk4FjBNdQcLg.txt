When I first came to Vegas, I was almost thrown in the stockade and burned at the steak for asking, "Whaa?" when someone mentioned Roberto's (affectionately Americanized into Robert's by my friends and I).  "HERETIC!" they cried.  Luckily, I pulled out my sugary sweet tea smile and explained in the thickest Southern accent I could muster that I was just a girl from lil' ol' North Care-liiina, and I was forgiven.

NOW I know that Robert's is the ultimate hangover food.  One friend always gets the rolled taco meal with guac, the guy likes the carne asada super nachos with sour cream, beans, and cheese only.  Another friend with an empty leg clears a california burrito with all the fixin's, super carne asada nachos, AND a quesadilla.  I love the chili rellenos and tortillas.  

And who needs to worry about drunk driving to this place at 4 am when I can easily stumble a block down the street to get here!  And if you don't live a block away from THIS location, I'm sure you're a block away from SOME location--they are about as prolific as rabbits in springtime.

So, go get yourself a pollo asado burrito with sour cream and cheese, and wash it down with a tall glass of horchata.  You'll thank me in the morning.

**That's the general plaza address...I tried looking it up but it's not on Google or anything and I didn't feel like walking down there JUST for Yelp...but maybe I will later today**
