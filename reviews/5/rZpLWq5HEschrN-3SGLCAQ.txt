I have been eating at the Chevys @1335 S. Alma School Rd for years and last night I had yet another great experience. The classic chicken fajitas are always perfect and the handmade tortillas are doughy and always fresh.  If you have ever been to Chevys and seen the yellow mass of joy on every plate, that is a sweetly perfect contrast to every savory bite, called Corn Tomalito. I always put a thin coating of Tomalito on each tortilla and the combination of flavors works perfectly. Our server was Cece and she was a delight and made sure we had everything we needed.
