This is probably the best fusion restaurant I've been to. Even though it says fusion, you can get some really authentic Mexican and Japenese dishes. There are some awesome fusion dishes as well (sushi roll w/ guacamole). The service is amazing as well as the atmosphere. I've never been a fan of eggplant, but the Japanese eggplant is phenomenal. After moving to AZ 4 months ago, I've to this restaurant the most and have enjoyed it every single time. If you go, you have to try the BACON WRAPPED MEDJOOL DATES aka orgasm on a plate. The dates are stuffed with chorizo and queso chihuahua, and served over a bed of foie gras sauce. It's probably the only restaurant I've been eating and wondered if a DJ was playing the music in the background...and I was correct. Probably the only time I've enjoyed a sushi roll while bouncing to BBD "Poison".
