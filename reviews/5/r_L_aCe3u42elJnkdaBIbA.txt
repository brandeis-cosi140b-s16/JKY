Wow! 

I was pleasantly surprised when I stepped into this joint. The decor was fun, the restaurant was super clean and the food was so great! I am so excited that this is within walking distance of my home. 

YOU MUST TRY THE HORCHATA! It tastes like my mom's except better. Wait? Is that even possible? Yes! I swear to little baby Jesus that this is the best horchata in the universe. 

The Cochinita Pibil taco was great, the mole chicken taco was great and the salsa bar was killer. I tried 5 or 6 and they were fresh and uniquely flavored. 

The best part? Three people ate for 20 bucks! I could have eaten cheaper if I had not gotten the plate. I took half of the food home, if that is any sign of the healthy (but not overly large) portions here. One taco would have done it for me. 

I will be a regular at this place!  You should try it too! :)
