This is the first time we've eaten at the Blue Adobe Grill in Mesa, AZ!  Both of our dishes were great!  If you want a light meal, try the lettuce wrap with blackened salmon, so so good!  And the salsa, I don't know how it's made, but one of the best I've ever tasted besides my husband's!  Compliments to the chef & also, to our server, Shawn!  Great Service & Wonderful Tasty food!  We'll definitely be back.
