To those expecting chow mein, fried rice and burritos, please read the restaurant description again.  This is a latino-asian FUSION restaurant.  

Upgrading my original 4 start review to 5 because of the new menu items!  AdoboDragon has been featuring weekly specials and has recently added Tapas to their menu.  Tapas are available starting at 4pm daily.  I love all the vegetarian/vegan friendly options they offer as well as the fish/seafood ones.  I am a vegetarian who eats the occasional fish/seafood so I haven't tasted their meat dishes.  However, the carnivore friends I brought to this place enjoyed the meat dishes.   

Traditionally, baos are steamed buns with meat fillings.  The baos at adobo dragon are served like sandwiches with a choice of chicken, pork, beef, fish or vegetarian.  Each filling is indeed a marriage between asian and latino flavors.
