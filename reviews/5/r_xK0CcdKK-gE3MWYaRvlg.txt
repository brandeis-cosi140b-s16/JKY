This place was sooo good. I came here a couple of months ago with my boyfriend and his cousin. And omg, so glad we did. It was busy, fun, and exciting. They also had like a live band playing right next to us; we sat outside. Our server was super nice and super attentive. I saw that he was busy and going back and forth with his drinks and orders but whenever we needed anything, he was right on it. It's been a while since I've been here, but I will definitely be back and hopefully be satisfied just like this first time. :)
