My family and I found this place when we were looking for an authentic place to take a friend from out of town. Boy did we hit the jackpot! I lived in Tucson for 7 years and I have always struggled to find a good Mexican restaurant in the valley. Everything from the salsa, to the cheese crisp, to the enchilada style chicken burrito, to the raw seafood something or other my husband ordered was absolutely perfect. The service was decent too on a Friday night at 7 pm. We will definitely drive here from chandler again! Highly recommended!!
