Only days after opening and Desnudo is already serving up better Mexican eats than others that have been around forever. I love me some carnitas ($6). Ever since an old favorite remodeled, cut back on quality and raised their prices, I've been left to make it at home. The tacos here are great. I prefer them with guacamole to avocado so I ordered the guacamole and chips ($5) to start. This is some damn good guacamole. Tastes like it was made tableside, just without the fuss. It was great to top the carnitas, it makes them really special. The pork has great flavor and the pulled pieces are tender and the fat is crisp. My only nitpick is some pieces were a bit larger so they fell out between bites. My brother joined me for lunch and he tried the California burrito ($6.50). It's a monster. He was unable to finish it, but really enjoyed it. Fortunately, Desnudo is near work, I see it becoming a favorite lunch spot.
