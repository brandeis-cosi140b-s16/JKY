Would have never gone here but it was recommended to me and I was very impressed.  It is always quiet in the morning and the food is very authentic.  I have ordered early lunch there too and it was all great.  I had the chili relleno for breakfast and a taco, enchilada, and tamale for lunch...all was great.  The chips and salsa are good and the service is okay.  It is in a tiny strip mall next to Circle K at the NE corner of 19ave & Peoria.  Stop by sometime and grab a bite!
