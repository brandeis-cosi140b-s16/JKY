Jahh...

Casta Rasta hooked me up with an awesome pulled pork burrito. The spicy pork was definitely spliced up with onions and red peppers.

If you're eating in you'll receive two types of salsa. One is a green salsa delight that  when mixed with some Cholula is a perfect 1 - 2 punch to begin every bite of any burrito. I polished off my meal with an old style glass bottle of Fanta. 

I will come back to listen to reggae and gobble down some of Casta Rasta's fine grub for sure.
