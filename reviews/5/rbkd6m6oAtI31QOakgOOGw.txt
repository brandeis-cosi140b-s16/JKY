Where do old rock stars go to just play great music?  Manuels near 90th and Mountain View, that's where.  The three owners used to play for 3 Dog Night, the Stones and a few other renown bands and now they own Manuels.  Evenings in the Cantina can be a great time to kick back and listen to old cover songs or get up and dance.  We also like the Senior Menu - it's just enough food for us and not expensive at all.  You will enjoy this!
