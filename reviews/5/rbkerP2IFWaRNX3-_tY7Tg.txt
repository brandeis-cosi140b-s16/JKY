El Norteno is my shit!!! I was in the Navy and everytime Id come home on leave my best friend would take me here.. Needless to say I live close enough now to where I can make a pretty convenient stop whenever I get the cravings.. Cash only.. I always go with the Green Chilli Burro enchilada style with Red sauce, rice and beans.. the meat is so tender and shredds apart in your mouth.. you will not be disappointed.. Ive been eating Ritos since I was a kid and this place definitely rivals them.. but with their shitty hrs and horrible conditions this spot is a no brainer!! Im going right now
