I love the lunch buffet here. It's always fresh. You can make your own tacos or tostadas with diced chicken or beef, or ground beef. There are tangy fajitas, chicken and beef, and rice and beans. The enchiladas are my favorite though they can sometimes be a bit salty. There are a variety of toppings--sour cream, lettuce, black olives, onions, salsa, and a tasty guacomole. And they give you chips with three dips.The weekday buffet is a bit less expensive at $12.99(beverage included) than the weekend buffet at $14.99(with beverage).
