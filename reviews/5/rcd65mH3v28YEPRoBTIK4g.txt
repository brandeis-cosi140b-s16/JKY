No complaints here! Staff was awesome and the food was great. 

They barely just opened about 4 days ago and said that they don't have their juices available yet because they're still getting things set up but that wasn't a huge problem.

I ordered the mission and baja sushi burritos and they didn't disappoint. The yuzu guacamole was my favorite on the mission and gives the burrito a nice zing!
