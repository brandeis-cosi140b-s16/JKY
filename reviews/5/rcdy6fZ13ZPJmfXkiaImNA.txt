I gave Border Grill in Vegas another try and I have to say.. GO FOR BRUNCH!

Corazon mimosas (blood orange, passion fruit and orange juice) were yummy and bottomless. Only $10 for bottomless and you can switch up the fresh juice mixers too, DO IT!

Unlimited Mexican breakfast tapas-- my favorite were the shrimp & grits and oysters rockerfeller. It's a nice alternative if you're sick of buffets or want to avoid long lines elsewhere.

Jennifer & Marcus are who you want to ask for, they are wonderful!
