You know what, giving this restaurant 5 stars says a lot coming from me (like I'm some sort of food critic). But seriously, everything from the restaurant atmosphere to the prepared-in-front-of-you guacamole, I was in love. 

Oh and did I mention when we first sat down we were told there were $4 Margaritas & Mojitos....and our very attentive waiter kept em coming....SOLD!

Did I mention that they make the guacamole fresh at your table and they'll add more/less spice as you prefer...SOLD!

Did I mention that the salsas (both the regular tomato and the lime salsa, OMG) and the chips were fresh and I couldn't get enough....SOLD!

All I have left to say is Shrimp Tacos....I need a damn cigarette now I don't even smoke...EXHALE!

And I'm no local, so don't worry about me "juicing up" these Charlotte restaurants...as you'll see in another review ;-)
