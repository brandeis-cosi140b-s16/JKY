AWESOME! AWESOME! AWESOME! Came here while I waited for my car to be serviced and I was there for 1 hr. I came in just in time for Happy Hour and I got chips and salsa at the bar. I ordered 2 Bud Lights, and the Carne Asada Tacos Tijuana. My check was $7 something. The tacos were delicious and full of meat. They are not cheap when it comes to serving you meat. The tacos came with a side of rice and beans which were also delicious. Their salsa for the chips was superb as well. No complaints on my end at all! The bartender Allen was great and I will definitely be back for more!
