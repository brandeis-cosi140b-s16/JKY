Blue Burrito is the perfect combination of non-greasy mexican food, chearful staff, bottomless chips, salsa and drinks and no push to turn the tables.  The food is very tasty and healthy and the "impact" is not the same as with traditional mexican food.  The full bar, local sports on the screens only adds more reasons I make a weekly stop for a salsa fix.  The outdoor patio is also a nice touch for those evenings when the sunset is a thing of beauty.  I have yet to find a menu item that was not tasty.
