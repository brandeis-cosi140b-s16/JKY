Sure, this place may be off the strip. when I say Off its goes into locals area.  

My mom lived here for years and we visited the restaurant ever since my first time I go back every time I am in Vegas.  

I have taken co worker from convention center to this locals heaven. 

The burgers are ridiculous!  Griled and fresh and only made once you order.
