This place is as good as it gets for Mexican food in Arizona! I love the traditional feel of the restaurant (although not in the best neighborhood but not to worry they always have security on site to watch your cars while you eat lol) The food here is amazing, the past two times I have been there I have ordered the ground beef and potato tacos and the green chile stew, both are delicious. I have also tried the enchiladas and the albondigas soup which were also very tasty...If you enjoy Mexican food and are willing to drive to the area its definitely worth checking out!
