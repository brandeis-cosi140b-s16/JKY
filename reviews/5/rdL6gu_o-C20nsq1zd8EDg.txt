If you like authentic Mexican Food, give this place a try.  Nestled in Ahwatukee, this place is casual, quick, reasonably priced and has excellent food.  My favorite is the carme asado burrito plate.  Retried beans are the real deal..no canned beans here.  Everything I have eaten here has been good.
