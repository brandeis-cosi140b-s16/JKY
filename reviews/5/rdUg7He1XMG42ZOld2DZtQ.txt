Had my oil change done this morning at Choice gas station, and decided to have breakfast while my oil change was getting done. The place is call Chile verde, OMG!!
There chicken burrito is soooooo freaken good, way better than most taco shops. The place is very clean and the service was quick. By the time I was done with my food my oil change was done, Now that's service!! Before I took off I ordered another burrito to go since I enjoyed it so much.  I will definitely be back before my next oil change is due.
