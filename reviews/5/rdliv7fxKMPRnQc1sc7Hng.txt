As a family we love this restaurant. Food is excellent with large portions. The salsa's fit each level of the family. The staff is friendly and is very attentive. Plaza Bonita gets what entertainment is, they have a ton of TV's, a musician, and a balloon twister.  We went on a Saturday night around 6:30  and had a visit from a young man who is twisting balloons.  He made our night. The restaurant was busy and his entertainment delighted our kids. He is working to raise money for scout camp to earn his Eagle Scout. What dedication and drive to approach strangers and work his craft. Well done young man. We have made this a place we will visit regularly
