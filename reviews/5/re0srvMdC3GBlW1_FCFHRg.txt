Korean food -Yes! Mexican food- Good!  KoMex combines them both --Are you freakin' kidding me? Although this is not in the best of neighborhoods, you need to go now! No really -- GO NOW! 

The bulgogi nachos are fantastic! Piled high with Mozzarella cheese and tasty beef, these nachos are big enough for two to share. The nachos come with a hot sauce that is absolutely amazing. At first, it looked like it might be too spicy, but then out of nowhere it hits you upside the head with a sweet kick. I also tried Jim's bulgogi fried rice- WOW! Could be the best thing I ever ate -- at least top 3. Strangely addicting, this fried rice doesn't come with the previously mentioned hot sauce-but go ahead and add some. 

For a party of 5, we spent about 40 dollars and had leftovers to take home. I seriously wonder how they could charge so little for food this good. I have told at least 10 people about this restaurant in the last week-I can't stop!
