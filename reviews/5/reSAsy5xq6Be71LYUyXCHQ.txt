Two words: Phuck yeah!! 
Phrank himself took our order which consisted of a carne asada tostada for me and the chile verde nachos for my husband. A lady, who I'm assuming was Mrs. Phrank, cooked and then delivered our phood to our table, which was a nice touch. My tostada was double-layered with the refried beans being between the two tostada shells and the rest of the toppings on top. The carne asada was tender and tasty, and the serving was just enough to make a meal of. My husband's nachos were piled high with chile verde which tasted like it had been marinating and cooking for hours - like something they would serve at their own table at home. Phrank came out a little while later to see how we were doing and to deliver samples of the beef barbacoa, which was also top-notch. Phrank (who is a bit of a jokester) asked our names and shook our hands as we were leaving. Excellent phood, great prices and REALLY nice people. I phoresee becoming a regular in my phuture!!
