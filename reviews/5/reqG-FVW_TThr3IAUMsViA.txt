I lived across the street from La Hacienda for two years. I cannot count how many times I ate there. The staff knew me all too well. Great chicken mole enchiladas. Great carne burritos. Great enchiladas rojas de queso. Great sangria. I highly believe this to be the most authentic Mexican spot in Madison...and yes, I have been to Mexico.
