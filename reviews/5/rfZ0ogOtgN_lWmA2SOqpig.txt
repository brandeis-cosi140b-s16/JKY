I think things have changed!  I took a group of friends there for my birthday this past Thursday because Le Thai was booked.  Service was amazing, the food was good, hot, and fast (I told my waiter that we had a bar reservation to meet in about 45 minutes-we left on time!).  
The chips and salsa came just before we ordered.  Very good & warm.  We added the trio of salsas.  
I think La Comida has one of the best michiladas I've ever had!
I had one each of the fish tacos, which came with rice and beans; they were both ridiculously good ($13).  My husband had the queso, which he said was just okay.  Our friends ordered an enchilada (with fantastic reviews), two people ordered the pork shoulder (with fantastic reviews).  
Unfortunately, it sounds like the restaurant got off on the wrong foot; however, I would say that this is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants!
