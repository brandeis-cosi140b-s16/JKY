One of my all time favorites in Phoenix! Not particularly "authentic" as far as Mexican food is concerned but they use high quality ingredients and have lots of options. It's similar in ordering style to Chipotle but the food is more closely related to a place like Rubio's. My favorite is the Chicken Quesadilla with green chiles. Friendly staff, clean place, VERY fair prices.
