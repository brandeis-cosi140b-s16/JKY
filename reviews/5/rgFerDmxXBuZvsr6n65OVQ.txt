Many people may find it strange to go to Chipotle while on a trip in Las Vegas, but man, I do love my Chipotle and it was closed when I was driving through the one in Barstow - so this craving was long over due.

I was out in the UNLV area, about to visit some friends that go there, when I drove by this particular Chipotle. My first instinct - flip a ish and grub. (Okay, it didn't help that I was hungry.) Not wanting to go against instinct, especially in Vegas, I went for it!

The first thing I noticed when walking in was booze. Wow. Chipotle with a liquor license? Only in Las Vegas! As tempted as I was, I still had to drive, so I decided against it...but maybe next time.  What can be better than an imported beer with your Chipotle? Oh, the thought makes me want to head back... anyways... I got the normal: Chicken bowl with fajitas, all the salsas, extra rice, lots of lettuce. 

The chicken was GREAT - cooked just right so it wasn't too chewy/hard.  Basically, it was the quality I have expected and enjoyed from Chipotle.  I must note that the mild salsa had a bit more kick in it than usual. ;] Non-spicy goers beware!

Overall, in my top five of Chipotles...oh wait, I think I've only been to five... okay, my number one of all Chipotles. Why? The booze, duh. Plus, clean with friendly staff. :]
