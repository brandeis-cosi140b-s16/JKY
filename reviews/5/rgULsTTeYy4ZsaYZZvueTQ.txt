Have been here several times and everything each time has been great. The bartenders do a nice job keeping up. Was there last night, a Friday, and we got there just before the rush--about 615. They do a great job making fresh margaritas and definitely recommend a pitcher if we a groups of 3-4. They have a nice tequila selection (would love it even more if you would stock Ocho Tequila) and appear to have a good bourbon selection. 
The guacamole is really good along with the sauces. I have now tried all of the tacos--favs are the braised beef and the mole tacos. The others are great too--full of flavor!  Typically very fast but I think they lost our order last night as it took a while and the manager came to apologize. Not a big deal as they were slammed. 
Not sure if they have improved the parking situation or not, we parked at the Teeter. Valet was full when we walked by.
