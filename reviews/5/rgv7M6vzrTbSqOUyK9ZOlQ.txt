I don't care much for breaded fish, ie. Rubio's original fish tacos. However the new grilled sea bass taco with coleslaw, cilantro, lime, chipotle sauce rivals any of my fav fish taco places in California. It's super fresh, zesty, smells delicious, and hits all the right taste buds! It's everything a proper fish taco should be, highly recommended. Everything you read about their shrimp is also true. The grilled shrimp gourmet taco is to die for. I've been meaning to try it in a burrito, yes a grilled shrimp burrito! Besides the sea food, the grilled chicken quesadilla combo is one of my favorites with all the right ingredients, and the sides of guacamole, sour cream, pico, beans, and chips, yum!
