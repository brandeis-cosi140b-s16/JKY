Came in to Urbano having eaten at Barrio Cafe at the airport and on 16th St. many times. I was not disappointed at all! Now I have been here twice so this is the cumulative review of my visits.

First off the decor was understated but still has a street vibe. I'd say inside has 24-30 seats and outside on the patio has that doubled up. You have your choice of being in either area and depending on the weather, they're both terrific. 

The bar has nice choices of some great unique tequilas and even though I didn't have any drinks on my visits, I will definitely be back to partake here shortly.

We had a family style meal so I had the chance to try and share many different appetizers and entrees. We had the guacamole and chips, steak tacos, fish tacos, arizona burrito, and a bowl of fruit that was done very uniquely but very awesome!

The burrito was absolutely delicious. Moist, plentiful, and value oriented. The steak tacos were on point which were close to a street taco style. Steak was perfectly done and had a ton of meat on each taco. The guacamole and chips can be eaten just as a meal its that delicious. Pomegranate seeds mixed in, big chunks of avocado which is different than what you would get in most restaurants which is over whipped and bland. This was chunky but most of all fresh. The fruit cup was delicious as well. Various fruit and abundant but coated with some type of light agave or honey but it's to die for.

Service was spectacular while the manager touched our table multiple times each trip. We felt like we were appreciated and wanted which is something not every restaurant delivers. 

I'll be back. Thanks Barrio Urbano.
