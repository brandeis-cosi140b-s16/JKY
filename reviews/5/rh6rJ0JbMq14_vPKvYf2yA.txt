As soon as you walk in this particular Del Taco, you notice how well maintained it is. Since this location is new, so is the interior design. Fun lighting and seating arrangements. The most exciting thing you'll notice are the very large sauce dispenser bottles. They are internally lit and have bright colors. I had to immediately take a photo. Service was nice and I even got a smile, which is rare in fast food restaurants. I know I'll be coming back for sure!
