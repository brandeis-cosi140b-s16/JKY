Yes, there are heaps of Roberto's in Vegas... and California, for that matter.

I'm just adding this location because I wasn't aware of it until I drove past it after selling my kidney filling up my car with fuel at the Chevron.  

Great hard shell tacos, and rolled tacos (taquitos)... the rice is just as flavorful as the locations in San Diego.  

... and I thought Roberto's only tasted good after a surf session!

Give em a try!


Mahalozzzz!
