The Stand Burger is one of my top 5 burgers of all time.  The caramelized onions are too die for.  I love caramelized onions and I had no idea they could taste this good.  The beef and onions are so good that I order my burger with just lettuce, cheese, & onions so as to let those flavors dominate.  Their shakes alone would bring me back.  Dulce de leche and banana are my 2 favorites.  The fries tend to be a on the short side and a bit soggy but I'm not big on fries so I can easily overlook that.
