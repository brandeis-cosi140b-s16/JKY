I generally keep my positive reviews in the four-star range, mostly because I hate setting people's expectations too high. It's a defensive mechanism I truly really believe in.
Unfortunately, I can't give Vitamin T anything less than a five-star review. My lunch experience today was so over-the-top wonderful and the food was so freaking perfect not even cynical (and possibly silly) personal philosophies can make scale down my praise. 
I mowed 3 carne asada tacos and walked away very full and beyond happy. The beef and vegetables were freshly prepared and the flour tortillas were big enough to act as sufficient vessels without overpowering my meat with their carbiness (it's a real word, look it up). The salsa bar (including sour cream) was stocked and kept clean. Special props for the pickled red peppers. So freaking great.
Great job by Aaron May and Co. in capturing the spirit of street food without making the customer feel like they are eating food off the street.
