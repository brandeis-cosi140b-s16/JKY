Well, it dissapoints me to see all these negative reviews about Qdoba on here - however, many seem to have to do with coupons, which I have never used here so I have no input on that.

I love Qdoba, I think it is so much better than Chipotle and will always choose Qdoba over it.
Chipotle has a bit more flavor in their meat, especially the Grilled Steak which is what I always get - but I still prefer Qdoba.

I always get the 3 soft tacos with grilled steak and just cheese and sour cream.  I am not a fan of rice and beans, so their burrito's are pretty useless to me.
Last night my boyfriend got the Ancho Chile BBQ Burrito and I only had a bite because he added peppers and other nasties to it - but the meat part was DELICIOUS. The mole sauce was sweet, spicy and smokey - everything you want in a mole sauce.
Since I am boring, it was a bit too spicy for me, but it was still very good. 

My favorite part of Qdoba?  Their chips and queso dip. The chips are thin like I like them and no one else has gotten the lime salt as perfected as they do, the queso is spicy and cheesy without tasting like plastic.  I love it on my tacos too!

The staff is always super nice and seem to actually like their job, which is always a huge plus to me. We generally get it to go, but will eat in every so often when we have somewhere to go afterwards. 

Now I want chips and queso again!
