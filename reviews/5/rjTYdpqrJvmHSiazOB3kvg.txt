I came to this restaurant a couple of weeks ago. Being from New Mexico myself, I had to verify that this was indeed "authentic". It was pretty damn close! First of all, the waiter (Brad), was very attentive and answered every question we had about the menu. He then brought out the chips and salsa. The red chili used was spicy and had a great smoky taste. Not at all bland, like red chili can be. I ordered the combination plate and got a taco, tamale and enchilada. In great New Mexican fashion, the tamale had amazing flavor. As did the taco and enchilada. My only critique would be that, instead of straight green chili being used as salsa, it would be nice to have actual hot chunky salsa. Definitely going back for more.
