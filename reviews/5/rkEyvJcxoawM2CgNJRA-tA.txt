When I think of authentic, amazing Mexican food I think of Caramba (and then drool a little). I moved to the east coast 5 years ago but still dream about this place. Everytime I fly back to Phoenix to visit my parents I make a stop at this place. I don't even go home to drop off my bags. There's just no time.

I've been going to the Bell road location for years and have always been a loyal customer. I was very happy to find out they had opened a nicer location even closer to my parent's house.

Everything on the menu is delicious, but I always end up ordering the beef taco combo. The shredded beef, cripsy taco shell, topped with the cheese/ lettuce/ tomato combo is the most heavenly thing I have ever tasted. 

If anything this restaurant has jaded me forever. No mexican food on the east coast will ever measure up! I miss you every day Carambas.
