I've had nothing but good experiences with the food at La Santisima, and minor frustrations with a particular attendant can be easily overlooked when the cuisine was that good. 

My real love for this venue is from their simple, lovely drinks--including the best horchata I've had in Phoenix.  Chopped fruit and walnuts? Are you kidding me? Delicious.
