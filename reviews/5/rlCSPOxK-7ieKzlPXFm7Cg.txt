Girlfriend and I REALLY enjoyed our meal last night (the shrimp tacos are amazing) and plenty to be enjoyed for a VERY reasonable price. Carnitas plate was delicious and the sides and salsas were very good. 

Will definitely be going back! 

P. S. Good selection of beers and on Fridays they're only $1.50 which is hard to beat anywhere!
