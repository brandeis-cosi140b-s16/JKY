Awesome and cheap bakery! I usually stop by on my way to work to pick up a egg-potato bacon bean and cheese breakfast taco, and it's always superb!

I've tried the barbacoa on the weekend, and I had some of their tamales at a party. Both Awesome.

If you want local Mexican food, this is the place to go!

They aren't open late, but I'd rather wait till the next morning then spend $$$$ at Burrito Drive.
