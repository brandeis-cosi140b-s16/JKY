Qdoba Rewards (free membership) http://www.qdoba.com/rewards

- Chipotle and Qdoba seem identical except for Chipotle using organic/non-GMO ingredients and Qdoba providing free guacamole (Chipotle charges about $2), so I'll say it's a toss up on which I prefer.
- I received a B1G1 Free (buy 1, get 1 free) entree coupon in the mail so gave this place a shot.
- Having signed up for Qdoba Rewards, about once a month I receive a B1G1 Free coupon via e-mail.
- The times I've been to this location, about 10:30 am, lines were short, service was quick, food tasty.
