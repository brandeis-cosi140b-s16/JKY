I've been driving past this place every single morning for over a year and I finally stopped a few weeks ago in the early morning and purchased some breakfast burrito's..OMG..they are so good! I watched the cook make up one while I was trying to decide from the menu, and come to find out it was bacon, egg, potato, and cheese, Oh' My. and the fresh salsa is the best I've ever had. Everyone is always so friendly, and helpful with any questions you may have. I shared my breakfast burrito with a co-worker this morning and he wanted me to text him the address, he thinks the salsa is the best he's ever had also..yummy..and the burrito's are huge so make sure you're hungry, or have someone to share it with.
