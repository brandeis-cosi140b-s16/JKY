I have been a customer of this location for some time and the food has always been great. The thing I want to mention here is how they handle things when something is wrong. Recently I went through the drive through and ordered two steak
Tostada salads, my mom's favorite,  when I got home I discovered that they had been made as chicken tostada salads, I called back and spoke with the Manager,Francisco, and he was very apologetic and took my name and told me to stop in whenever I wanted and he would buy my mother and I replacement salads at no charge.  A week went by and I went in and could not get over how pleasant The manager was and how he really cared that a mistake had been made and that he wanted to correct it.  this place is great and they really do care that their customers are Happy, something i think is valuable in this modern world.  I will continue to go here knowing that if a mistake is made i will be taken care of by a staff that makes me feel like I matter.
