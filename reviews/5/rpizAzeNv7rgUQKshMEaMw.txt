The reasons I choose this place over Chipotle: Wheat Tortilla, Brown Rice option, pesto cilantro sauce, no charge for guacamole on items. I go here probably 2 times a week lately because it is a good option for a healthy meal. I usually get the salad with brown rice, black beans, chicken, pesto sauce and salsa. I also like the option for a wheat tortilla. Guacamole is fresh and has always been good. Great food, great healthy options, good service.
