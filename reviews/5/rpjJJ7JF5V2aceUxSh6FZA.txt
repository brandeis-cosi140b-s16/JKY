Mexico City is one of the best Mexican restaurants I've tried in my life...the freshly made guacamole is tremendous, the food is outstanding and the chips are certainly some of the best I've ever tried!  Service is very fast and courteous.  Definitely take advantage before this place becomes overly popular and crowded.  It's too bad I am just visiting Pittsburgh, I will definitely come here again the next time I'm in town.
