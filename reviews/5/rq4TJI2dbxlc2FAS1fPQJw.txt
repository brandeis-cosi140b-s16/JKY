This place is the super goods. I just moved in down the street and its open 24 hours. It takes forever but they dont fire up the carne until you order it. The tacos are a buck each and the burritos are big. Everything is good. The red salsa is super hot and the green sauce is tasty. Mix them together. The carnitas are BOMB with lime and green sauce. Real street tacos they even throw some pinto beans in.
