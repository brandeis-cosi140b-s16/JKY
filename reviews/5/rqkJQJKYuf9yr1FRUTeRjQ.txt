Absolutely delicious.

I can't believe this place is sitting at 3 stars.  Makes me realize the rating system is not a perfect science.  

I am told that this is "New Mexico" cuisine, meaning they use Hatch chiles in most of their dishes.  Whatever they do, it works.  The two house salsa were spicy and flavorful.  This was followed with a carnitas dip and pork tamales that were fantastic.  Tamales are typically 80% corn and 20% meat.  These were 80% meat.  And the pork was slow roasted, tender and delicious.

I had the Carne Adovada burrito, which was chunks of pork marinated in red chili.  I was completely stuffed but the food was so good I powered through like I was in a competition.  Everything was homemade.  The sour cream was fresh and had spices in it.  I also had a fresh fruit margarita that was perfect.

To top this off, they were playing oldies on the radio (ex. The Four Tops) that were jamming.  Much better than the typically mariachi band crap.

I live in LA so I feel like I know Mexican food.  But this blew me away.  It's a hidden gem.
