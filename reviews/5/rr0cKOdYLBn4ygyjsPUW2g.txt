I love Chipotle and this location is the best. I'm a regular at lunchtime and I'm never disappointed. The staff is well trained and the location is well managed. The line staff goes out of their way to recognize me and is always friendly. The parking lot and construction on Thomas make it a little less convenient, but the staff more than makes up for the traffic complaints.
