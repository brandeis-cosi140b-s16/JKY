I wish I were more hungry when I came to China Poblano. My boyfriend and I on a whim decided to eat here while in Vegas and we were not disappointed. We tried a handful of things: ceviche, queso con chorizo, and tacos. If you're a cheese lover, please get the queso con chorizo. It was easily the best cheese appetizer I've ever had in my life! 

Atmosphere is really great and a fun, casual dining experience. The staff is spot on and paced perfectly. My only recommendation is that this isn't a quick in and out food experience. If you go, make sure you plan on staying to enjoy!
