OMG when I found out LV had a location I dropped to my knees! I've had this place in San Diego! My friends were all raving about the spicy pork. I was thinking.. come on how good can it really be. I drove to SD and had to try it for myself. Heavenly tacos being sliced up right in front of you. The pork is similiar to the vietnamese bbq pork that I eat at home. It's made with this awesome green sauce that's to die for. The corn tortillas are thrown on the grill and lightly cooked. You will not get tacos like this anywhere else. I recommend this place to everyone!

Recommendation: Spicy pork tacos.
