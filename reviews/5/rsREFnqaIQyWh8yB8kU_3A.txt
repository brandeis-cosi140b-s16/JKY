After living in Las Vegas for over twenty years, this Del Taco location has only disappointed me one time in over a hundred visits. For Las Vegas, that is an excellent track record. Taco Bell has made me ill time and again, and I won't eat at Taco Bell in Las Vegas anymore.
Del Taco, has been great for being a fast food place and the food is always great for a really cheap price.
I have gone to this location at four in the morning many, many times and I hesitate to go anywhere else. I feel safe to eat there, whereas even McDonalds has made me ill over and over. Just last week, I ate at McD's and got violently ill for three days and I was still feeling nauseous it a week later.
Del Taco at this location has been awesome, and I thank all of the people who work there for providing me great meal at an inexpensive price.
Thank you!!!
