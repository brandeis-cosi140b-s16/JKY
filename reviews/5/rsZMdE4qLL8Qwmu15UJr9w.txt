Nice people, excellent prices, great selection, just right with spices, seems all freshly prepared! just right on the cheese with chicken enchiladas (powerfully delicious chicken enchiladas, should be in "New Times best of "). Sushi rolls of various types are what they are advertising as of late, can't wait to try it.

Very clean and pleasant atmosphere. I love this place, proximity in downtown is hop skip leap.

Extremely understated review, you really have to go there if you like Mexican food - it's a lighter and not heavy in the stomach filling meal (yet, absolutely  filling meal), a very rare occurance for me. I'd  hate to compare it to the more expensive Mexican food restaurants, but it sits higher - much higher than most Mexican food  restaurants in central Phoenix. If this  place was in Scottsdale or smack dab in a college retail location it would've made headlines or morning show reviews already. So, it literally is a diamond in the  rough. It deserves culinary attention, and it's a pity that you have to know people  (tribalist mentality schmoozers) in order to receive well deserved representation in a metropolis overly saturated with the look and feel of Y.U.P.'y -ism.
