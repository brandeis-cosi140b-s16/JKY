Super impressed with the customer service tonight. 

I ordered takeout and when I arrived the hostess was on the phone taking an order. After hanging up, she immediately apologized for the wait and went to the kitchen to grab my order. It took her a few minutes before returning. When she returned she apologized again for the wait and explained that, "Your spinach queso wasn't quite right and we remade it for you." I really appreciated the courtesy and attention to detail. Even the plating within the styrofoam box was thoughtful and pretty! While it was a quick experience, it was a memorable one. Well done, hostess with the mostest. :) I only wish I would've caught her name so that I could give her full credit. I'll definitely return for takeout when I'm feeling lazy about cooking.
