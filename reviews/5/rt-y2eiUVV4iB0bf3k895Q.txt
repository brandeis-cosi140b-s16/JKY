We just left this location and I'm so happy with the whole experience that I believe it worth writing a review. The person who took our order was really friendly and the place was really clean and well organized. Considering it's almost 4am I wasn't expecting a good service or a clean place, that's how all my previous Robertos experience were. Strongly recommend this location
