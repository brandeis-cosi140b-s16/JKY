I don't know about all those negative reviews but we stopped at Mi Amigo's on the way to Tucson coming from Ca. We were greeted by Ricardo at the front door. He led us to our table and proceeded to tell us the history of "MiAmigo" and introduced us to our waitress, Ricardo's sister.(Barbara ) She was very attentive and made several suggestions to order. Ricardo had told that everything is made fresh from his mothers recipe's. The restaurant had just celebrated their 30th anniversary. Barbara brought several of their salsa's and chilies to taste along with chips. Cutting to the quick I ordered the Chimichanga Burrito with enchilada sauce. I ordered because you can order it with the ingredients that you want in it. Best I ever had! I was with 3 other family members and they enjoyed what they had ordered. Service was excellent. After we ate Ricardo came back with a plethora of tourist attractions to do in Tucson. Enjoy your meal at "Mi Amigo Ricardo .I would definately recommend this fine restaurant and plan to stop by again when we are in the area.
