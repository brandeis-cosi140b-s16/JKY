I am so glad I found this place. Close to my work and also my home. So far I have tried the Carne Asada Nachos and the Carne Asada Tacos both were very delicious and very fresh. I also enjoyed their fresh juices they make. They also make a delicious chicken quesadilla. Everyone in my office is very pleased we found this place, we have started going there every Friday. It's such a treat. It's also great to show support to the family owned restaurants in Vegas. 

Everything at Frijoles is fresh and you can taste it. They make there beans fresh everyday along with all their juices. 

I will continue to go here and spread the word about them to more and more people.
