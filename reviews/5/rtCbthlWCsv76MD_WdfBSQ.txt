I swear I drive past this little Mexican restaurant multiple times a week and have never noticed it. One night, we were craving some quality Mexican food and started exploring Yelp to find a nearby Mexican spot that we had never tried and had good reviews. We called to see what time they were closing, because it had conflicting results when we tried to figure it out online. The staff answered and stated that they were closing in 5 minutes, but very kindly said that we could order and pick up if we could make it there within 10 minutes. We don't live too far so it was doable, and we gratefully made our way there while still on the phone ordering. I didn't have too much time to ponder on what I would order so I skimmed through the menu and decided on the shredded beef (machaca) burrito-enchilada style (I'm a fatkid). My man got the combo #1, which included 2 enchiladas, a taco and beans. Both orders smelled amazing, it was hard not to pounce into it in the car. When we got home and started grubbin' it was scrumptious!!! I had to give this place 5 stars based on their awesome customer service and delicious food. I am definitely going to have a hard time ordering something different next time because the burrito was so satisfying. We plan to come back and actually sit and eat for a meal, some happy hour and looking forward to their taco Tuesday! The new menu is a little bit different than the one posted on the Yelp page and they gave us one with our pickup order. I'll post it when I get a chance :). They only take CASH so be prepared!! Definitely a good find, THANKS YELP!
