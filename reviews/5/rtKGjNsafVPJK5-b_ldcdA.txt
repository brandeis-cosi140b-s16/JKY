Menudo is sweet and a little spicy. Comes with corn or flour tortillas and the fixings, lemon wedges, oregano and chopped onion. Not stingy with the scoops and I got a lot of everything. Have myself a bowl maybe once a month. Sometimes experiment and order something different. It is good and hits the spot.
