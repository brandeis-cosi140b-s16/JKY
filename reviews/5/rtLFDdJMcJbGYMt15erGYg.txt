I am absolutely impressed with this place. I came here several years ago and didn't love it, but after coming back tonight with my family I will be back again!  

Our server Jeremy was very professional and knowledgable. I am a vegetarian so eating Mexican can be pretty tricky, but Jeremy was super helpful and patient with me! He also laughed along at my dad's jokes and was very quick witted. Cool guy! 

The food was delicious. The fajitas were served piping hot and my parents said they were amazing. I was so full from the appetizer guacamole and jalepe√±o fritters that I could barely finish my food. 

The one and only downside was that there is no fried ice cream (sad face). That's not enough to deter us from coming back and hanging with Jeremy though!
