Review by a Restaurant Consultant

When Guy Fieri highlights your restaurant on Diners, Drive-In's and Dives, you know that it's got to be an interesting place.  I've tried several restaurants in Southern California and Las Vegas that he's reviewed.  When Guy went to Yayo's near UNLV, I knew we had to try it.

Yayo's location is in a small shopping center directly across from the university.  Usually, with in-line restaurants, you don't expect too much.  I was pleasantly surprised when we visited the restaurant.  The ambiance is really interesting, with almost "Old Mexico" themed tables and lighting.  This theme is carried on outside on the patio as well.  

With restaurants, the food must impress.  Boy, Yayo's really hit a home run with their food.  Their portions are more than sufficient, especially when you realize what a value their food really is.  They have the best soft tacos in town!  If you get their student special, you probably won't be able to finish the plate.

The other aspect of Yayo's that's impressive is their service.  Jonathan greets you nicely as you enter, assisting you with your menu selections.  His laid-back attitude is perfect for Yayo's.  Their menu is quite large, so the extra help with items is always appreciated.

Yayo's is our go-to Mexican quick service restaurant in Las Vegas.  As long as you understand that it's not fine dining, you'll be fine.  The next time you're in town, drop by Yayo's and you will be pleasantly surprised.
