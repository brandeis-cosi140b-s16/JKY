BEST Fish Taco EVER. I really like fish taco's so I get them a lot. Pretty much most fish taco's are very similar. Cabo's were not and they are the best of the best. It was very busy when I was there on Saturday afternoon. We got there in the late afternoon and there was a line. I got a pre-salivation going. We got in pretty fast and the waitress was fantastic. She took her time going over the menu and giving us tips about the food. We had a few questions and ordered. I had the Tavaroo Tuna Taco's and my GF had the BBQ Mahi Taco's. It did take some time for the taco's to get there and that would be my only complaint but they kept bringing those delicious corn taco chips and the corn salsa so that kept me happy. They had a nice beer list also. Always a big plus for me! Then we saw the taco's and got very happy. These things are huge. My GF and I split ours so I got to have BBQ Mahi also. Wow is all i could say. The sauces and the delicious fish were amazing. I would go back in a heartbeat but since I don't live anywhere near, I am just plain sad :( . There is nothing like this where i live but if I am in Charlotte again in the near future, I will certainly be going back. Hail to the Fish Taco at Cabo's!!!!
