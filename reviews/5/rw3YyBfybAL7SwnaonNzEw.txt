Fantastic new eatery near Naked City Pizza / Moon Doggies. It's a bit like "gastro pub" style authentic Mexican. I had the chivo- goat taco as well as the mushroom and al carbon - steak tacos and all 3 were fantastic. The goat was tender, well braised, juicy yet still tasted like goat! The tacos were large, about twice the size of street tacos. Came with rice and beans, which I normally don't eat but these were amazing. The rice in particular was garlic seasoned which was excellent. The owner was very accommodating (it was slow - 3pm on a weekday). We had a free sample of their elote (corn relish) and could have eaten a whole bowl of that as well ;) 

This is not your run of the mill taquiera nor is it gringo tacos - it's a happy place inbewtween and a little sideways.
