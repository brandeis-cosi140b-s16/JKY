My husband and I are very picky when it comes to Mexican food and we decided to try out this place based on the reviews on Yelp as we just moved to Las Vegas. The service here is great and the food is fantastic! We eat here pretty much once a week. The fajita combo is awesome and I love the grilled onions. The salsa is very fresh and has a nice heat to it. Our toddler loves to eat here too and will eat the soup they bring out until the bowl is dry....which says a lot since he is a very picky eater!! You won't be disappointed.
