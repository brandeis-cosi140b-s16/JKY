I work down the street from Chicago style Taco shop and it's seriously a little hole in the wall !  I almost passed it by when I was driving , but I'm definitely glad that I didn't  .  Their tacos are great , and they have nice big portions . Their meat is always tasty, and everything is very fresh . It's very authentic . I've been there about 9 time (in like 2 weeks) , and I don't have a single complaint . Must try !
