So we went to kabuki and the wait was an hour and a half no way we're we waiting that long for okay sushi so I told the fellas let's try this new spot next to the outlets and omg thank goodness we did we each ordered a roll and asked the waiter what she might recommend and her recommendations were on point also ordered a small chicken fried rice and there was nothing small about it this place is awesome I can't find anything wrong with it very clean and the our waiter was on top of things she was very helpfull
