I agree with some of the reviews, it is a trendy place but the food is exceptionally good and service is as well. I ordered the pulled pork (I forget the name of the meal) 
and the food was plenty, I was satisfied and content with my meal. The drinks are good to. Nice place to go if you want to try something different
