I have tried a lot of taco shops and this shop is by far...top of the list!  Not only are they good, but definitely the best in Vegas!  Don't let the name throw you off...it is authentic as it comes!  
And ooooweeee!  Stop in on the weekends for the specialty soups to sooth that hangover!  HAHAHAHA  Food is great, but the friendly smiles and hospitality is even better!  Go and eat at this place!  well worth the trip!
