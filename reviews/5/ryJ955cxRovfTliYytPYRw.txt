Granted this place is new so cleanliness is not an issue but the staff here is so friendly and the food always tastes fresh and the salsa bar is always clean.

I know a review of this Roberto's may be premature because it's so new but because it's across the street from work and in comparison to it's sister stores it gets 5 stars from me.
