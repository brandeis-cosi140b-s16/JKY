Being from San Diego, I definitely have a good eye for taco shops. I've been hitting up another taco shop near this location at lunch and was just OK with their food. After coming to Don Tortaco, i doubt I will ever go back to the other spot. Their California burrito is a proper Cali burrito (although i recommend adding guacamole and removing pico), their tortillas are bomb and their spicy carrots are actually spicy and tender. Hot sauce is good. Overall, this place is exactly what I'm looking for in a local taco shop who can make carne and other items just like home.
