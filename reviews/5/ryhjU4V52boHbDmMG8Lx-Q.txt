This place is the BEST and we will be back any time we fly to Vegas.  It was a little far from where we were staying and we drove there on the one day of the week they're closed so we had to come back the next day.  It was totally worth the drive! 

We ordered the shrimp ($14 for three tacos and a salad) and fish tacos ($13 for three and a salad) and they were DELISH!  We also ordered four fish tostadas (I think it was about $12 but it came with a lot) and those were so yummy too, especially with the house sauce and salsa.  But our very favorite thing about the place was the fresh oysters.  They were AMAZING!  AMAZING!!!  We ordered one dozen of the Vallarta oysters ($20) and they were yummy (too spicy for my kids but I really enjoyed it), along with one dozen of the plain fresh oysters ($14 served with lots of fresh lime and the house salsa) and that was the winner!!!  I was surprised that even my five year old couldn't get enough.  We kept ordering an additional dozen and ended up ordering a total of SIX DOZEN oysters.  Totally wish we could've gone back again before we left Vegas.  It was that good!

We went early and the service was impeccable.  Clean place.  Attentive waitress.  Can't say enough good things about it.  We kind of revolve our travels around good places to eat and we will most definitely go back there again.
