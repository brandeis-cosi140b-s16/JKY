Casa Rasta is a great addition to the neighborhood!  And how sad that one earlier reviewer noted he went because there was a line out the door from Chipotle in the shopping center across the street.  Those poor souls are lining up at the wrong place if they are seeking high quality Mexican (and Mexican inspired, Caribbean) food at highly affordable prices.  As a native Californian who has lived in Mexico and tasted lots of Mexican, Tex Mex, Cal Mex food over the years, this is one of those restaurants to cherish because it dares to depart from the tired formulas of so many Mexican restaurants in the US.

My wife, our adult son, and I shared a marvelous meal at Casa Rasta last night.  We tasted several of the tacos--Beef Birria, (braised in chocolate/chili sauce), Cochinita Pibil, Chorizo, Jerk Chicken.   All were excellent, flavorful and tender,  but the Jerk Chicken was our collective favorite.   Be forewarned, the servings of meat atop the tortillas are quite generous--two of these $4 tacos are plenty for a very satisfying meal.  There are no other included accompaniments as earlier reviewers noted, but you can order rice and black beans, guacamole, chips and tasty red or green salsa, as well as mango,and avocado cream--all for $3 or less.

Our son ordered the curried goat (with Caribbean jerk seasonings) with coconut rice which we all tasted and agreed was marvelous.  I am eager now to try some of the other Caribbean entrees.

The restaurant is BYOB, and again, where else can you find a corkage fee of $4 for three people sharing a bottle of wine?

Service is casual and friendly, perhaps not the polish you would seek in a more formal restaurant, but this is an oasis of the relaxed Caribbean in 25 degree East Liberty!  As a new resident of rapidly changing, newly upscale East Liberty, I hope that gems like Casa Rasta receive the patronage they deserve.
