The best food I've had in Mesa by FAR!!! Great service. You do have to wait for some really good food. Trust me, after trying their food, I deserved to wait even longer. The chips and salsa are very delicious. This is a great place to eat at if you love spicy food. I ordered the Carne Adovada Burro (Burrito) Enchillada Style. It was the so delicious! I highly recommend this place!
