This is a place I heard about from many locals and I finally got a chance to check out one. I'm not really a fan of Mexican food, but their chicken taco was something else! I wish there were Roberto's in Seattle...but then it would probably taste like Taco Bell. In any case, the next time I'm in Vegas I'll be eating here more often.

Service was polite and quick, bathrooms were clean. It's all I ask.
