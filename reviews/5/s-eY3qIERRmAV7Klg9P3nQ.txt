When I want Mexican, I come here. I've been here at least 15 times and have never had a bad dish. Their menu has both traditional Mexican dishes and more modern ones. The portions are large and the food is delicious. I would say the entrees hover around the $14 point, making this more expensive than your average neighborhood Mexican restaurant, but the quality is far superior.
