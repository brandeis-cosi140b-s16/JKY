This place is super cool..out of the way, hidden and great eats!! I won't say its the best brisket sandwich I've ever had...... But it's the BEST I can't remember ever having! Wow.  Add their homemade Coleslaw to your sandwich... You will be very glad that you did.
My friend had the green chili pork and bean burrito...outstanding!! He loved it and I tried it....now I don't know what to order next visit.   Must try!!
