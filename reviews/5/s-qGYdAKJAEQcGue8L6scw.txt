Hands down my favorite Mexican joint in Vegas. Being from California I'm used to the real authentic flavors that places all over back home have & Roberto's provides that here. My favorite is the Asada Burrito, the meat is super flavorful & the burrito is the size of 2 at other joints. This is perfect for anytime of the day or night & with most open 24 hours Roberto's is always an option
