Stumbled on this small taco joint while walking down the strip. Needed a quick bite to hold me over until dinner so I  decided to stop in for a taco or two. I ended up ordering one barbacoa taco with salsa, guac, cheese, and lettuce. Surprisingly the taco was super good so I ordered a second. 

The price point was good as well. 2 tacos was $6. Would definitely recommend! Next time in Vegas I will be stopping by.
