Went here for the first time and loved it!! Their chili verde is as good as in California! Love this place and will be back. Very clean, professional and great service. I have my eye on there breakfast burrito next! This is a must try! Also the drive throughout idea is genius, but food is as good as a sit down Mexican restaurant :) great menu, wonderful food!
