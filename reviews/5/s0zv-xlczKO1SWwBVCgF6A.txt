Mexican food at its best. The restaurant atmosphere is family friendly. Great place to dine before or after badger games. The staff is friendly and attentive. However, when the restaurant is full of badger faithfull, you can bet you will need to be patient. It gets loud with excited fans ready  to munch on some delicious mexican food. I love the enchilada verdes with a side of mole. All the burritos re great and they cater to vegetarians and vegans alike.
