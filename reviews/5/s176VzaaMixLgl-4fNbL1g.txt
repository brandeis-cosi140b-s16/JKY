My fiance and I came here on our day trip to Fountain Hills after reading reviews on Yelp. I am rating this place a 5 because of their extraordinary guacamole, pollo fundido, and green corn tamale. We ordered the sampler plate.  It was the perfect size for a couple to split for lunch and gives you a taste of everything.

Their chips were really good - no grease or stale taste. The salsa came with three types: spicy, regular, and green. The green one tasted really fresh. The regular reminded me of a half italian/half mexican sauce - it was very addicting and unique. The spicy was fun because it wasn't too spicy and had texture to it. 

The food is great portion. The fundido is packed full of chicken with an amazing sauce. The tamales were moist and packed full. The guacamole was fresh and had great flavor. My fiance really liked the black beans. The one thing we didn't really eat were the fried jalapenos. 

We plan on coming back and bringing friends. I know I will have cravings for that green corn tamale.
