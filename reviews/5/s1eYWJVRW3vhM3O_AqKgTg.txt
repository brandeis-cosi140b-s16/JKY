This is my absolute favorite place to eat in Phoenix.
Their brunch cannot be beat. The service is always spot on, friendly and they never leave you without a beverage. I order the bloody mary, which is only $5 during brunch and is served not only in a very big glass but comes with a beer chaser. My meal of choice is the Enchiladas and Eggs : you get your choice of enchilada, choice of red or green sauce and eggs any style. They are served with potatoes and beans.It may be the most perfect breakfast ever. It is served piping hot on a metal plate, straight from an oven. The cheese is bubbly, the potatoes perfectly soft on the inside and slightly crisp on the outside, the pinto beans are silky and the eggs and red sauce just pull the dish together. You really can't go wrong with this place, it is a gem. It is a must for brunch!
