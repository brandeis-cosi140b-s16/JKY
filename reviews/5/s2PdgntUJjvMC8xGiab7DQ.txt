My husband and I came here for the $25 all you can eat brunch and $5 bottomless mimosas. We sat outside on the patio on a beautiful day. Service was EXCELLENT- our server was so friendly but sadly I can't remember her name. We literally had everything on the menu and about 3 mimosas each. Super stuffed after but a great way to start a Sunday, if you ask me. We wil be back!!!
