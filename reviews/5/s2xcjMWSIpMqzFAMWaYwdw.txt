I found this place with my dad and can't believe how good it was. I thought they only had one in Henderson so I would only eat here when I was in the area.

I love that they have daily specials. Those are really good deals. But once I tried that Chicken Tostada Salad it was over for me. I never order anything else. It is the perfect amount of chicken, cheese and beans of your choice. They pile high the fresh lettuce and top it with Pico and Sour Cream and a few Tortilla Chip Strips. The creamy dressing is my favorite.

This location is so busy. I could not believe how long the wait was. The staff was really friendly to everyone and they kept that line moving. The restaurant was also very clean and they had someone out there washing tables as soon as the guest would leave. Great location, great food!
