I've been going to Azteca since I was a little chica. My dad would order "Mucho Margartia and Little Rockas." That meant daddy had a rough week. The servers have always been super personable and helpful especially if it's your birthday. They make the most commotion of any restaurant I've been to. Out comes the drums, guitars, triangles, a cow bell, a wooden flute, and this one that sounds like your going up Thunder Road (wooden roller coaster, for you non-Carowindseres).  So much is going on... Can be fairly terrifying at first. 

And then they bring you food :) My fav, which is not on the menu anymore, are the three steak carnitas with cilantro and onions served on corn tortillas dipped in salsa with a side of frijoles. What great prices too! They now have a fresh salsa/guac cart AND a woman making fresh tortillas. Looks like a pretty hot job, but she is so cool under the pressure. I never finish all of my food, so then!.. I get to reminisce the following day. 

Deeelightful.
