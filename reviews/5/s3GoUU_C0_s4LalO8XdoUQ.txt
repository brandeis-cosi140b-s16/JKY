I have been wanting to go try the burrito factory for a while, but never had a chance,. Today 6-14-14 I finally made it, and I'm glad I did. I was greeted by who I believe it was the owner, I got the Wet burrito and it was the best burrito I had in years. The burrito was huge and it was filled with yummy goodness(beans,rice,meat,french fries,cilantro, etc) I also got chips inside my bag. The burrito was really good and so were the chips. 

They have a Salsa bar, don't be afraid to try a few of them. Next time I will try the Fish Tacos , 

PS. Chipotle has nothing on them. Chipotle's burritos might be a little bigger but are bland, no flavor at all.  

Give them a try, you wont regret it.
