I know it seems ridiculous to not only take the time to review a chain corporately-owned restaurant as popular as Chipotle, but also to award it five entire stars, but I felt pretty strongly that I needed to.  Chipotle has been a long-time staple of my diet, and I have ventured to it, nationwide.  However, this location is by leagues the most consistent that I visit, and I go at least once a week, since it is local to both my office and my home.  Service is always quick, even during the weekday lunch rush, and I never have to call ahead.  Also, there is one fantastically sweet and positive employee who works the cash register, and considering that we have a conversation every time I'm in, I can't believe I don't know her name.  Whatever. The point is that I am always a Chipotle fan, but I know I'm going to have a hard time adjusting to a new neighborhood Chiptole when I leave this neighborhood... and when you find yourself saying that about a fast food restaurant, you know they've made a real impression.
