ABSOLUTELY AWESOME FOOD HERE

I just finished writing a massive complaint letter about a different company and so am happy to follow it up with a review of these folks.

Everything here is absolutely perfect. Best spot North of the TJ/IB line.

Please, please, please try them I don't want them to go away! I loved it so much I ate here two nights in a row. Hand made tortillas, and unreal frijoles.
