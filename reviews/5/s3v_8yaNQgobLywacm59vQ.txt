Mmmmmm gluten free goodness. I'm completely obsess with Chipotle. If I could eat it ever day I would. Which is sad, I know, but stop judging me! You're on here to read a review about it - look in the mirror!

Anyways...I think that this Chipotle has the friendliest service. The management has been so nice to me, and the worker bees are really great. In fact, when I see some of the line cooks/chefs at other Chipotle restaurants, I smile! This is just a great location.
