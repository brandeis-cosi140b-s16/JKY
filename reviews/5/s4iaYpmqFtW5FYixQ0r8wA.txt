I too originally came from Los Angeles and it's true, Serrrano's is the real thing. The staff is so friendly and everything tastes like home made. I just had their menudo and it was absolutely amazing, so tender just like growing up. Nothing like growing up with menudo and then pan dulce every Sunday.
