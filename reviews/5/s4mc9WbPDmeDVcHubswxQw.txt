This place takes such care in their food preparation... Their entrees are always top notch. This place is much more upscale in their food and prices, but I think is well worth it for the ambiance and the food that they serve.. We shared an appetizer and an entree and it was plenty of food. We live right down the street, so I would love to see this place continue to do well. It has great servers and was a great experience...
