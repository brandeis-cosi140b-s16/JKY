Street food has arrived in Pittsburgh! 

This hearkens me back to the days of perusing San Diego streets in the infinite quest for the perfect taco: a lifelong endeavor.

I quite frequently visit Reynas to get my fix, but I must say, this is the REAL DEAL.

The stand is located in the charming, yet unassuming business corridor of Brookline. 

The Grocery itself looked packed with delcious mexican staples, which I will certainly have to return for when I am feeling more culinarily inspired.

The taco stand....does not dissapoint. They have a variety of meats to choose from, cooked and marinated on the spot similar to Reynas. The meat is good quality, soft, and tender.

what sets them apart is a cheaper price point (2 bills!!!!!! per taco), and myriad of toppings available. Go to town. Seriously delightful, still not heavily trafficked. 

I will make this drive, and often.
