We have passed this place many times and wanted to check it out so when we found a groupon for them we decided to check them out. The places is small but nicely decorated and very clean. The waitress was very friendly and provided good feedback when we had questions on what something was or how she liked it. She was very attentive and pleasant. I am guessing the guy frequenting the tables was the owner he was very nice asking everyone if they enjoyed their meal, if it was their first time, and invited them to return when they were leaving. This place oozes hospitality! The food was just as good as the service, it was served hot, fresh and in a timely manner. I really love their food it's different from most taco places they have this volcano toco that has the meat of your choice fried cheese on top and this tasty sauce on top, my husband couldn't stop raving about the Tortilla soup with shrimp in it. To finish off the meal I ordered the Nutella crepes which were yummy I just wish the Nutella taste was a little more present in the dish I tasted more chocolate with a hint of the hazelnut flavor I love so much! But it was delicious either way The guy I am assuming the owner advised when I return  to try the Carmel one which is made with Mexican Carmel. The only thing I would change about this place is to replace can soda's for a soda machine.
