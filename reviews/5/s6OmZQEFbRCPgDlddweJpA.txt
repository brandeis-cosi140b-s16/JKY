Viva just reopened off of Sahara and fort apache in the village square shopping center.  So glad it is finally back.  Love the carnitas, Chile Colorado, and can never go wrong with the cheese enchiladas.  That is of course if you don't fill up on the chips and salsa.  And the Cadillac margaritas are top notch on the rocks with salt of course.  

The new place looks great too with a good size bar, dining room that looks sleek and isn't too loud even when its packed.  Even better the Mariachi is the perfect sound level so you can enjoy the music and the conversation without yelling.  The staff was very attentive and super friendly. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for great Mexican in the las Vegas area.  I like it so much I drive all the way from Henderson.
