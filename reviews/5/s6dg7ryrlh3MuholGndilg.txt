The guys that work there are great, they cook your food to order and FAST! Always fresh food and always delicious. Their shrim burritos are the best...big, yummy shrimp and lots of them! With their special sauce inside, rice, onions...just awesome. Mexican Cokes, Mexican sodas with REAL sugar. I always call ahead when I'm driving to LA and pickup a shrimp burrito or two and a Mexican soda for the long ride. Great driving food!
