Our students love this restaurant!  When they come for Reiki, Reflexology and other classes, they love going for lunch at Las Glorias.  The salads with grilled chicken breast are delicious and a little of the bean dip completes an "out of this world" lunch...just perfect for an afternoon of energy healing.  Thank you for taking such good care of us! Marsha Craven & Mary Ellen Brown of Healing Arts Connection.
