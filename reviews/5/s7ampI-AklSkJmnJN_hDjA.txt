Being from New York, I'm used to a Chipotle on almost every corner. Recently moved to Phoenix and this one was closest to my house, and thank the burrito gods for that, as I've been here at least once a week since moving.

This is by far the best Chipotle I've ever eaten at. Not only is the staff incredibly friendly and more portion-generous than I'm used to in NYC, but the ingredients are always fresh and fantastic, the restaurant is very clean, and they're very fast; even with the line to the door, I still get my meal within a few minutes of walking in.
