OK, so I may have found the perfect combination of hole in the wall place in a super cool location. If you are looking for a quick bite and want quality food, Vitamin T is a great choice.
They open in just a couple of days but chef Aaron May had a bit of a pre-grand opening party tonight and we got to check it out. 
First, I had a Sonoran Dog which was irresistible. I saw some bacon wrapped hotdogs being cooked and then saw Aaron adding some "bean dip stuff" ( I forgot what he actually called it ) into a bun and topping it all off with jalapeno sauce and some other goodness. Pretty darn good dog. Did I say bacon? Yep, bacon is good.
I then tried three different tacos. They sell small street tacos that are even better than the ones I remember eating in front of JJ's Cantina in Mexico. . The pork was awesome as was the chorizo. The tortillas? Grand.
Other friends tried the Tamales, Caramelos and Tortas and i heard nothing but good things.
They sell beer and tequila. What's not to love about a place like this?
Located at CityScape and easily accessed by the light rail line.
Check it out, I hope you enjoy as much as I did.
