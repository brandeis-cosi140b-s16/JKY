We go at least a few times a month.  Small place with serve yourself chips and salsa.  Efficient and pleasant staff.  I love Mexican food, but do not eat meat, so this place is great because it has shrimp and fish - doesn't just limit me to beans.  And it's all good - hubby has tried a variety of dishes, but I love the shrimp tacos!!
