We have been meaning to come into this spot on our last few trips to LV; so glad we finally did it. We sat at the bar and our good fortune brought us Sergio-- the most down to earth, friendly, and talented bartender. He recommended some game changing dishes -- the shrimp mojo with a side of house made tortillas, the fish tacos, and some siu mai. Finished with the most perfect coconut rice and mango dessert. The drinks he made us are the best we've had in Vegas in years! I had a margarita served with hibiscus ice - beautifully presented. (We also tasted some delicious aguas frescas made daily in house.)

The food alone was amazing, but because of the relaxed and personal vibe Sergio created, we will be back time and time again. Truly, an authentic experience unlike anything we've encountered on the strip.
