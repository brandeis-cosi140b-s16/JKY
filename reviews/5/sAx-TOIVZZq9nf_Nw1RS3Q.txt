Checked out this place on the way through and really enjoyed it.  I love Mexican food and Sandbar did not disappoint.  The menu is extensive and very reasonably priced.  
There's plenty of opportunities to watch sports and get a drink.  All in all a great experience with good food, attentive service and a great atmosphere.
