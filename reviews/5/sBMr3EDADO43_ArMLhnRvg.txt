A co-worker and I were deciding where to go to lunch today. We saw good reviews about this place and decided to give it a try. It were SO good! Among the best I've ever had. I had a breakfast burrito and was really excited they served breakfast burritos all day! My coworker had the shredded beef, which was equally delicious. Service was great and restaurant was clean. Would return again.
