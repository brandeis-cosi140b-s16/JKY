When I lived in Arizona, Filiberto's at Ray was my favorite place to grab a cheap and delicious Burrito. Now that I'm back in Boston, only a select few understand the greatness that is Filiberto's, and that's a major unfortunate. While Boston has a lot to offer, they don't have a Filiberto's five minutes from my apartment, and that is one huge thing I miss about Chandler. 

The Arizona burrito with extra Green Chile salsa and a large Horchata was a combo for many a drunken night, and I shall forever be indebted to Filiberto's for that. 

I'm not arguing full on authenticity, nor am I advocating healthiness. But what I'm saying is Filiberto's has the cheapest and most delicious Burrito I am likely to ever have again, and I wish I could get them on the Eastern Seaboard. 

You're missed, guys.
