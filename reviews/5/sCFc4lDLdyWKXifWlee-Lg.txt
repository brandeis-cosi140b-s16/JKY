Just ate the best enchiladas of my life, with rice and beans, both red and green sauces were expertly prepared. the red sauce was rich dark just a little bit sweet. The green tangy just the right amount of tomatillio.  The thing that I can't believe as my meal which included enchiladas rice beans and a drink is $5.  My companion had a perfectly crafted Margarita, our meal also included chips and salsa. I  have never been disappointed. Homemade chips warm and crispy,  it is a hidden gem located in the target shopping center  Silverado and eastern  right next to the doc holidays.
