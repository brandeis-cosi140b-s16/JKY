Suzie's has a lot of good Mexican food, like cheese crisps, tacos, enchiladas, and more. The service is sometimes slow but it is worth the wait. The Shrimp Javier is my favorite. I am a regular here, it's that good. The cheese enchiladas are  pretty good too. It's also kid-friendly which is nice. They also have cold beer, which is nice. Its not expensive, and that's nice too. Its a nice place to go to!!!
