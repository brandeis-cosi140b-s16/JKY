The reviews were right! Place looks like a hole in the wall but the food and service is great :) .. I came with my family we got 1)enchiladas de mole 2) camarones a la diabla 3) shrimp cocktail ... Everyone loved their food.. The shrimp cocktail was perfect and the restaurant wasn't stingy with the shrimp, the mole was sweet, and they gave us homemade tortillas .. Give the place a try ,you will be glad you came!
