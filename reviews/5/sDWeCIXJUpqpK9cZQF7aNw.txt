This place looks like a dump from the outside, but don't let that fool you. I've heard several people refer to it as "the best Mexican food in Madison." I have yet to eat anything there that wasn't excellent; but the tacos and the carnitas are my favorites, along with the homemade horchata. (Mmm... just writing about the food makes me want to drop everything and go there for lunch!) The atmosphere is very casual, the service friendly, the prices reasonable. One of those hole-in-the-wall joints that more people should know about.
