OMGosh ... I found this place with one of my gal pals. We both joined the Siskey Y across the street and wanted to try this place for lunch one day after a work out. Boy am I glad we did. 

Since then, I have been back over 6 times. Once, I even brought my best gal pal from Southern California, and she gave the place two-thumbs-up as well. The food is really well priced for lunch and it is just SOOOOOooooo so good. 

If you're there for lunch, flip the menu right over and only get something from the lunch selection. You can't beat the prices on the back of the menu. There are about 30 options, and they all are very filling. I always seem to get the same thing: the chicken fajitas with refried beans and rice. YUM! 

This dish comes with two hot tortillas as well as sour cream. The refried beans are so flavorful and the rice is perfect. The veggies medley that comes with the fajitas is perfectly cooked and the chicken is all breast meat. 

The wait staff is awesomely friendly and they make you feel at home. That is one of the many reasons I keep going back for lunch. It's just a fun place to go after a workout at the Y. 

If you want to go for dinner instead, they do offer cocktails and sangrias, as well as beer and wine. And the prices are not going to break the bank - this place is a win-win all around. 

Honestly, who would of thought that such a great find could be discovered in a strip mall next to a Harris Teeter market. I'm happy I found this place - I hope you find it soon too. You won't be sorry!

Enjoy.
