Visiting family in Madison & seeing the good reviews here, we decided to give it a try. We are frequent travelers to Mexico, consider ourselves foodies & love to both cook & eat Mexican food. One member of our party said it was the best chimichanga she'd ever eaten. The tacos were delicious  - especially the tongue. Tortillas & chips were fresh & delicious. The tamales were very tender, filled with tender chicken & a nice green salsa. The  whole fried plantains that came with the Honduran carne asada were to-die-for. Portions were huge & the service excellent. A very authentic and affordable taqueria.
