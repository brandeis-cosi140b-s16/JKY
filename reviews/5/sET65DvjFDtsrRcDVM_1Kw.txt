My favorite Mexican restaurant in the Valley, and there are a bunch of good ones here.  The atmosphere is a little schlocky but still cool.  The service is usually top notch, and the food is terrific.
My wife gets the Salad Carbon - see the previous review.  I usually get the Pollo con Cheso - a chimi-style enchilada with a spicy white cream sauce.  Heaping portions with rice and beans that actually taste good.  5 Stars.
