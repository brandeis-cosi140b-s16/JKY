After dining on the Strip for 2 days, hubby and I were dying for some real Mexican food and were happy to see TACOS MEXICO. We each ordered 3 tacos, beans, and rice with drinks and paid a little over $11 (yoo hoo! big deal in Vegas). 

The Al Pastor and Cabeza were my husband's favorites, very flavorful and juicy. The rice was also very good and the beans had a nice flavor. I loved their homemade salsas and did find them to be nice and spicy (I'm mexican, so I know spicy!). We asked for extra guacamole and they obliged. Quite yummy!

We've already decided that when we go back to Vegas we're avoiding restaurants on the Strip and heading there for lunch and dinner since they have other options besides tacos (posole!) and the prices were outstanding.
