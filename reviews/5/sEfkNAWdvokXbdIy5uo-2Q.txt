I came to eat here during their "soft opening"/trial run.  My bf was a partnering designer from Interiors at Southend.  We were asked to join in on their practice run.

The space was cool and hip...very tastefully done.

The waitstaff was on their game and didnt miss a beat with refills on chips, drinks, or salsa while we waited for the food.

The food was delicious!  The portions were mighty and the temeratures were right on.   The rice was a little spicy hot ...and I'm sure they will adjust that in the future.  I love spicy....but people who shy away from spice may find it a little tough to take.
 
The queso dip was really really great...it was like "designer" queso...not the typical run of the mill white stuff you get at the order by number places.

All in all, my experience was spot on and i enjoyed my time at Hot Taco.  I will definitely be back after they get going on Monday.  

Good Luck Hot Taco!  You look great!
