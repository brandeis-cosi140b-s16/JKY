One of the most clean taco bells I've been to. Actually ate in. Which is weird. I never eat in Taco Bell. Matter of fact , I was looking for Subway! Ended up here. Was greeted kindly when I walked in.  It wasn't cause I'm good lookin. They did this to EVERYONE!!! Food was fresh too, nope, this wasn't someone else's order, it was made for ME.
