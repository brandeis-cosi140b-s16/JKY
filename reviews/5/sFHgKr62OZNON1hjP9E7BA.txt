The first time I went there I had fingernails in my mouth but I gave it a second chance and they never cease to impress me. I love how healthy they are. I always get the bowls for maximum healthiness. Little rice barbacoa both beans guac mild medium salsa and lettuce. I have to say that I am a proud chipotle fan :)
