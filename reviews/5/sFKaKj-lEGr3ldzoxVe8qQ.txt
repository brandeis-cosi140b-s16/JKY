My husband and I have been patrons since they opened under the old management. (Gee how long ago was that??) We have always enjoyed our meal or appetizer.  The Margaritas are large, not filled with ice, as I've experienced at other Mexican restaurants.  I actually get more than two or three sips before there's only ice left. The new owners/management are friendly and interested in any comments to improve in any way suggested, however I couldn't think of anything that was not perfect.  The staff, including the person who takes away the used dishes, is happy, friendly and welcoming.  As other reviews, Sherry, the bartender, is terrific, interesting and goes to the trouble to remember your name.  It's a comfortable place and have also enjoyed interaction with other patrons dining there.  Even the clientele are great! If you've tried it before, give them another chance, they will listen to any problems you may have had and will do anything to accommodate you.
