Amazing fish tacos and super friendly service!
The shrimp tacos are banging too. 
So good I unintentionally forgot to share when I went with the fiance and finished the whole thing lol

The tacos are a bit small but super fresh. The fresh salsa is perfect.
Also, there are usually specials (ex: fish taco Friday).

Owner is usually there and seems like a nice guy.
