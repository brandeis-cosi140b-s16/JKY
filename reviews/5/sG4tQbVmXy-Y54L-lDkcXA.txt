Loooove this place! As some of the other reviewers already said, I planned to go to 'North' for dinner one night, only to find that it is now Ninfa's! I've been here 3 times so far, each time, food has been wonderful! Particularly the fajitas- chicken fajitas come smothered in melted butter and chicken broth after flame! YUM! Tortilla's are homemade and delicious,  I also really enjoy the marinated skirt steak. The chips and salsa is also delightful, I enjoy the creamy tomatillo salsa :) Another element worth mentioning is the service, almost always extremely warm and friendly... the only problem I had is with one lame waitress- but overall it is a very nice experience! -- Also not a bad spot for margarita's!
