My husband has totally converted me to a Chipotle-lover.  It doesn't hurt that this little place is a hop, skip, and a jump away, but the more often I go there, the more I find myself going back.

There are days, I find, when all that will satisfy me is a big burrito stuffed with fajita veggies, beans, cheese, and dollops of hot salsa.  I really, really, really love their fajita veggies.  They are inspirational.

I don't eat fast food a lot, but when I do, it's generally Chipotle.
