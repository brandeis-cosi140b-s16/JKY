Fantastic family owned authentic mexican food.   I have been here 3 times since I figured out they were near me 2 weeks ago.  My favorite are the green enchiladas.
It's so much better than chain mexican food.  Stop by and give them some support :)

4 stars for the food + 1 star for friendly service.  I really feel like they appreciate my business!
