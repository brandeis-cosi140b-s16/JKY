I've been looking for authentic mexican street tacos for five years, and by Lordy-Mae I've found em'! I'm originally from Mexico and like any Mexican will tell "My city San Luis, Sonora has THE BEST tacos in all of Mexico" . It's hard to replicate the flavor or the (sazon) but La Frontera has certainly succeeded. Well done La Frontera, well done.
