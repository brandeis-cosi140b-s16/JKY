The service was fantastic.  We had Marissa as a waitress. She kept our glasses full and was beyond pleasant and patient.  . The food was absolutely fantastic.  I hate chicken but theirs was so juicy and tender i fell in love.  All together there was 4 people in my party and everyone left happy.  
The only thing i found weird was they played blues on a Tuesday night. And water was dripping from the ac unit.  But they deserve 5 stars!
