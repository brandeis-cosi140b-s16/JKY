Definitely check out this new treat on Tenaya between Cheyenne and Craig. (It's in the same shopping center as Dairy Queen and the Chevron station.) They opened just this week.

I've lived in Northwest Las Vegas for almost a year now, but I usually have to travel further downtown to get my Mexican food fix. I'm so thrilled I finally found a place that is affordable with good quality food. I ordered an asada taco combo with rice, beans and a medium size drink. I chose horchata and, though it came from a machine, it was creamy, yummy, and cinnamonny.

The rice was flavorful and the refried beans were good enough. My tacos came with cilantro and onion on double corn tortillas with a spicy red sauce I loved. The quality of the asada meat was better than El Gordos downtown and I was happy about that. 

The husband and wife team behind the counter were so pleasant and welcoming - you can really tell this is a from the heart, family business. I would definitely recommend Chicken and Grill, especially to the folks in the NW who have been deriving themselves of quality Mexican food at a decent price point! I can't wait to try their al pastor!
