Glad it's back! They a generous with the portions, the service and food is great and fast and they are reasonable and we have been eating there for 10+ years. They still offer the 10% senior discount a big help to those on a fixed income. 

Ordered the #9 shredded beef taco, green chili burrito and tostada. Was excellent as usual. 

Tried the special of the day the Fry Bread with green chili. Was not happy, the fried bread tasted like burned oil and the green chili pork was not good. I ordered extra cheese didn't see any of that on it either. I contacted them and it was handled professionally, so we will be back. 
Weird note, they wanted me to bring the fried bread back in, I asked if that couldn't be excused so I wouldn't have to get redressed and drive back there. It was! If we would have eaten in, there wouldn't have been such confusion. They have to protect themselves from fraud, and I understand as a former food service employee it does happen. Cudos to Jerrie (sp) or Gerrie (sp) for handling the situation professionally.

Lastly I ordered the Shredded Chicken Chimichanga: Fundito style with extra jalape√±o cream cheese on top. Delish as usual l!!!

Everything was special order, and it was all present and accounted for! A rarity anywhere today! Superior way to do things right. 

Anyone who special orders knows the hell we usually deal with. NEVER a problem or attitude from the staff. Thanks again Hal O Penos for being our favorite neighborhood Mexican restaurant. Much rather help them the a 'Berto' 5 stars for deliciousness, prices, attention to detail, portions size and the excellent customer service.

See you next week!
