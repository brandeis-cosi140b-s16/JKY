Words cannot express my deep love for the food this place has to offer. It's an instant hangover cure, that's for sure.

They're open anytime, which is super convenient, and it doesn't take very long to get your food and get on your way. I love the chorizo/potato/eggs burrito & the carne asada fries make me week in the knees. The prices aren't bad either, but they could use an update on their A/C.
