If you love Mexican food and Korean food then you will definitely love this place. Their beef is tender and full of flavor. Don't forget a side of kimchi. They also have four different types of sauces you can eat it with. Prices are also very fair for all the food you get.

It is across from he Ford dealership as it is pretty easy to just drive by without even noticing it. 

I believe it is family owned and operated; service is always good!
