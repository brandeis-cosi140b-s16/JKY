Yolos has great food, a lot of Mexican beer on tap, including Negra Modelo (I had 2), and the best bartender in Vegas, Nico (Nicolette). Nico was awesome! She handled a slightly crazy and drunk guy very professionally. Nico taught me about her favorite tequila (Don Julio Real) and bartending in Vegas. She is also the face of Yolos Tacos & Tequila Tuesdays. I highly recommend Yolos (You Only Live Once So) for their food, beer selection on tap, tequila selection and friendly service.
