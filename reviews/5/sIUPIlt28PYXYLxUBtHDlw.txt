I can't even begin to say enough good things about this place. After traveling from Texas to Phoenix, my friend and I were looking for some breakfast. This place popped up nearby on Yelp. We thought we would give it a try and I'm so glad we did. We walked in and were greeted by a very nice lady. This is clearly a favorite spot of the locals as many of them knew the names of everyone working there. The menu is painted on the wall and everything sounded delicious. We ended up getting the Huevos Rancheros with chorizo. It tasted great and was served with very hot and very, very fresh tortillas. Not only was this the best meal and service we've had all trip, it's the best I've had in a very long time.
