Let's just say that I finally got back onto to Yelp just to leave this place a five star rating!

Last night was our first experience at Viva Mercados. We loved the super tasty free chips, bean dip, and salsa, as well as the onions and peppers. The Fideo soup is some of the best around, and the dinner portions are giant and well worth every penny; my husband and I were able to split a meal and still leave full. Speaking of the main course, we LOVED the combination plate that we tried! The fish taco was excellent, and the shredded chicken and carne asada were both very good. And of course, the sweet treat at the end was the icing on the cake of a great meal.

Can't forget the service...our waiter was very attentive and nice, and everyone helping out offered great service as well.

We will for sure be back!
