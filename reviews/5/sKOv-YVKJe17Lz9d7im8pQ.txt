Zipped thru the drive thru last week for some of those yummy Doritos tacos and one of the $1 watermelon (I think that's what it was) drinks. 

Service was fast. Tacos had lots of shredded cheese which I haven't seen at Taco Bell's in YEARS! 

Tattooed guy was all smiles as he quickly handed me all my artery clogging treats and sauces then I was on my way lickety split. 

Those tacos were so good. I stood in the kitchen and at all three of mine without ever sitting down, LOL!
