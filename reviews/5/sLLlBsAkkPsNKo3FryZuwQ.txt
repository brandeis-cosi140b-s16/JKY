After moving from Scottsdale to Mesa, our family had to find a new "local" Mexican spot. We stumbled into Manuel's on Christmas Eve in 2012 and we've been coming back since. We like sitting in the bar area since we have a toddler that can get a little noisy (and the bar masks the noise a little better). I LOVE the salsa. Prices are fair, portions are perfect. My go-to item is the chicken taco salad, which has tons of fresh cool crunch.
