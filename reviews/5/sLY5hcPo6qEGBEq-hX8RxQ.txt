This Fausto's is similar to the one located on Stephanie. Good food at reasonable prices and good portion sizes. The service is quick also. I haven't been to Roberto's ever since we discovered Fausto's through my parents. I just find Roberto's to be very greasy and seeing that is not very appetizing at all.

Try it out and taste the difference, you'll be pleasantly surprised.
