Best burger I've had in Scottsdale. Period. Perfectly juicy, hot, tasty, ooey cheesy goodness with awesome fries - consistently delicious. Where else can you get such an amazing burger (double) for $8 - especially  in Old Town?
Cute diner setting, super friendly wait staff, great music and bottomless fries. I always recommend David's when asked where to get a good burger.
I have heard delivery is rather slow, but we opt to dine in - there at least once a month - definitely give it a try!
