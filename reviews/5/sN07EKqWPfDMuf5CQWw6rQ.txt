Heaven on a plate . . .

I dine at Blanco regularly, and it is hands-down the best . . . best. Surely someone will screech that the food isn't Mexican enough, and I don't know about all that, but I do know it is delicioso! And they have everything, really. They have ample seating inside, outside, at a bar, and they even have a order/take-out window just next door with options for people who just want to dine and dash . . . after paying.

I tend to order a hibiscus green tea with a carne asada burrito (enchiliada-style, Christmas-style sauce), rice, and black beans. Everything on the menu is good, though. My buddy loves their mole (if you're envisioning a furry animal, let Google handle this one). Ask for the habanero sauce with your chips!
