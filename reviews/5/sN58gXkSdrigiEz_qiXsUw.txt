I can always count on chipotle for a satisfying meal. Like a best friend, they are always there for you. My favorite is a barbocoa burrito and spring for the gauc if I'm in the mood. It has an extra charge. Its a great tasting filling burrito that keeps you full for hours. I sometimes don't even eat dinner when I have it for lunch! They also carry these izzie drinks and my fave is the clementine or the grapefruit. 

This particular chipotle the service was fast and friendly, however small seating space inside, so beware during lunch hours. There's a ton of outdoor seating all in the shade.
