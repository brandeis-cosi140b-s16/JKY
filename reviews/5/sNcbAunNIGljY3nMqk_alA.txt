My husband and I were on a road trip that expanded across the United States. I checked Yelp for a referral for a Mexican breakfast. We decided to try Irma's kitchen. We ordered the chilaquiles and steak picado for breakfast. Both dishes were fabulous! The chilaquiles has a hint of spiciness (perfect)! The steak has a very tasty flavor! I am so happy we found such a great place for good food and friendly service.
