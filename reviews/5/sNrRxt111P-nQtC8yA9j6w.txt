One thing I really miss about Charlotte is the awesome Mexican restaurants in close proximity to the University area. Don Pedro is among one of my two favorite Mexican places! 

It's a fairly new restaurant to the area, I think it opened about two years ago if I'm not mistaken.

It's also kind of tucked away in a corner, so it's not a place you'll easily see from the road.

...but despite its limited visibility, the guacamole here is some of the best I've ever had!
It's about $5-$7 including tip to have someone come to your table and make guac fresh at your table. Now I realize that a lot of places do this, but Don Pedro's has big portions and something about it just tastes better than the other places!

I am pretty boring when it comes to Mexican restaurants...I always order the exact same thing everywhere I go...and it's not because I'm afraid to branch out....I just really love a cheese enchilada, refried beans, and a chalupa on the side. 

The quality of the enchilada is how I rate said Mexican restaurants.

Don Pedro gets a 9/10.

I've always had really attentive service here too and a bountiful amount of chips and salsa.
