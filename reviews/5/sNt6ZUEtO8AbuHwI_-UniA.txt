I am always amazed with this restaurant.  This time I ordered from the Weekly Specials menu because there was an item I've seen before and heard about before but, had not tried, and it is only on this menu on occasion. I believe it was added to the Specials menu because it is a traditional Mexican treat that is designed with the colors of the Mexican flag, which are green red and white.  Mexican Independence Day is this week.

It's the Chiles en Nogada!  

The dish consists of a poblano chili stuffed with a "picadillo," which is usually meat spice and fruit.  In this case, it was pork.  the whole thing is covered with a creamy walnut sauce and topped with pomegranate seeds!  It was the best meal I've had all week!
