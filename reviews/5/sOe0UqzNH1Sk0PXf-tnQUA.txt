Hanshiktaco is now one of my regular lunch spots. It seems like the Slider Truck (which I love) is never near me, so I was happy when I heard about Hanshiktaco being parked at Lee's Discount Liquor on Lake Mead/Tenaya. 

The tacos are comprised of simple flavors that, when layered, become quite tasty. The meat (I had chicken and pork) is lightly seasoned and is cut, or maybe shaved, in very small  pieces. The kimchee is slightly spicy, but also sour.

The chef used flour tortillas. I was dismayed at first because corn is my favorite, but unlike other reviewers my tortilla was soft and warm. I think it was grilled because it was crispy in places. 

Sure, a trip to Del Taco or Taco Bell would be cheaper, but ew! Why go there when you can have real food? 2 tacos for $4 something is more than enough food for lunch, and I think the price is very reasonable. 

If you are heading west on Lake Mead, it may be difficult to get to the truck because you have to swing a u-turn and take an immediate right to get into the parking lot. Approaching from the east is a lot easier.
