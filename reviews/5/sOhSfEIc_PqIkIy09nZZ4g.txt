Cheap. Authentic. Fast. One on every other corner!?

What else can you ask for? 

Roberto's is the best Mexican food I've had in Vegas. Better than any sit down restaurant and way better than a Del Taco. I usually go for carne asada burrito or chicken nachos, but sometimes opt for chicken tacos, bean and cheese burrito or chicken quesadilla. I've had the carne asada fries as well. Not crazy about them. They're not bad, but just not my style.

A must go!
