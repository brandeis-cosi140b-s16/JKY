Best resonabaly priced fish in town. I LOVE their fish fry special on Friday, and their grilled fish on Wednesday. Cheap beer, the best $3 Margaritas ever, and a staff that really puts forth an effort. Free chips and salsa bar too. I've been a regular every since they opened and have never had a bad experience here.
