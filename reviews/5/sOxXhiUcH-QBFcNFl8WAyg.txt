Don't let the dark eyes and hair fool you. 

I'm as white as can be! 

So, I don't know a lot about mexican food. But I do about seafood and it is some of the best seafood I have EVER had. 

The oysters are perfect. My friend taught me that the secret to empanadas is to put a little mayonnaise on them! 

I have never been disappointed there.
