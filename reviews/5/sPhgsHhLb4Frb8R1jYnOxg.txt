Delicious tacos,  I had one each of barbacoa, pastor, and chicken, all softshell.  The meat was well seasoned with the barbacoa being the best of the three in my opinion.  The habanero hot sauce was great tasting but my mouth was on fire after all three tacos.  I will be returning to try the other taco varieties and the breakfast food as well.  Oh and did I mention they are open til 3am on the weekends.  I will probably never go to taco bell at bartime again.  The guy working behind the counter was very friendly as well.
