This place definitely exceeded our expectations. The portions are HUGE!! You definitely get a lot for your money. The food was super fresh and they put a ton of cheese, not like other places who are cheap about it. We are here on vacation and I want to go again before we leave! I had the taco w shredded beef , enchilada w ground beef, and tostada combo. The enchilada was the BEST I ever had!!! Get in the car and go now!! Oh and I forgot the guacamole was so fresh and delicious. I usually have to "Doctor it up" but not here, the way they prepared it I didn't need to even add salt!
