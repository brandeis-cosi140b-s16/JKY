This is a very basic Mexican restaurant in one of the oldest strip malls in Goodyear. We have been going here for about 7 years now. It is one of those places one goes when one thinks about it. The food is almost always good, but has missed its mark a few times. In this miss it is usually because the food is just not warm enough. But this is not the norm. Working here one earns the money and it is done with a smile and efficiency. SO if you are ever in the neighborhood give them a try.
