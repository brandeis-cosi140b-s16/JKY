I ate here for the first time last Monday. Compared to Roberto's (aka Don Tortaco's) and Fausto's, this place is just as great! The prices are also similar.

I ordered a Carne Asada Burrito. I ordered it to-go and the server gave it to me wrapped in foil in a paper bag with much needed napkins. The meat was thicker and juicier than the burritos at the aforementioned places. The burrito itself was just as big.

I'm a red sauce guy. And I typically get a lot of sauce for just one burrito. The cups at the sauce bar are on the small side, but you can just get more cups if you need more. The pickled carrots, onions, and jalapenos were also good.

I'm a fan. I'll keep coming whenever I'm in the area.
