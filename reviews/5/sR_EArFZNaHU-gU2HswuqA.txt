Always have a delicious experience at BC.  I was there last week, had the table-side guac, fish tacos and some sangria.  Loved everything.  My boyfriend knocked over his entire glass of sangria and our server promptly cleaned up the table, changed the linens and brought out a new drink.  Great service, charming atmosphere, amazing food and drinks.
