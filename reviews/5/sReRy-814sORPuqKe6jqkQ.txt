The tacos here are delicious and definitely authentic. One bite of these savory tacos took me back to my honeymoon in Mexico. I cannot speak of the burritos or the quesadillas because I've never had them. I stick to my tacos. I've tried all their tacos. My favorite are the steak and chicken tacos with a side of guacamole & chips.

For Maize fans:
This spot has better sauces, and is more affordable. If you want the maize taste just ask them to add cheese. You end up eating just as good if not better for a reasonable price.
