My search is over. I've sampled innumerable taco joints in Vegas, and while most do a decent job, there's usually something lacking that makes them a one-time stop. At last, I've found El Compita. Been to 2 locations and they are equally good. Best carnitas torta I've tried, in fact everything's great: tacos, mulitas. Two great salsas that you can grab yourself. Great value too. It's like stepping into Mexico itself. The guy in line in front of me had a "13" tattooed on his head, as in the LA gang, and the girl in front of him was probably 6 yrs old carrying a 2 yr old. Almost thought I had to pay in pesos, but if you want the real deal in terms of food, this place hits the spot.
