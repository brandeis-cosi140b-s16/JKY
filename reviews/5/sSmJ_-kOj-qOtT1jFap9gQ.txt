Ahem, it's called San Carlos BAY seafood restaurant. 

Anyway, this is my favorite restaurant in Phoenix. The seafood is out of this world. I normally only order one dish, the Shrimp in Garlic sauce, and it never ever disappoints. Tortilla, beans and fries come with...but the real kick in the pants? When that delicious sauce marinates everything on the plate, making the fries all garlicky and moist...MMMMM...I can't wrap it all up in the tortilla and shove it into my mouth fast enough. 

I also highly recommend ordering a shrimp or seven seas cocktail as the perfect starter. 

My family has been coming here for years, it's not in the best neighborhood. Last time we were here the place got robbed. No one was hurt, staff casually called the police, I'm guessing this had happened before. I was just glad the shrimp were okay.

But don't let that deter you! If you like seafood and mexican food you will be in hog (cerdo?) heaven! Mariachis on the weekends too...(just don't be that guy that requests they play La Bamba).
