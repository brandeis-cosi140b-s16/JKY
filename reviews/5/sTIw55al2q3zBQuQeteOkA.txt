My girlfriend and I affectionately refer to this place as "Smash Taco." Every time we get food from here, we pound it down like a couple of rabid dogs. It's just that damn good. I don't eat there very often because I'm sure it's not the best food in the world for you, but I make going there an event and mark it simply tastes incredible.

If you are looking for cheap, delicious Mexican cuisine, go here. Not those fancy Phoenix gourmet taco joints that skimp you on everything. Smash Taco is the real deal.
