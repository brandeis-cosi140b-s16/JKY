This is my favorite Mexican restaurant in Vegas. It's an authentic mom and pops place. I love their #2 chicken with a light creamy spicy sauce. I can't remember what it's called.  Chips and salsa are great. I've had their soup, taquitos. I haven had anything I didn't like yet.

It is located in an odd little shopping center.  I don't think I would have ever ventured had I not gone with coworkers the first time.
