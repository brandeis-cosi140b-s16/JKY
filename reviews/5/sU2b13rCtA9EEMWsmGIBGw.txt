I'm switching to vegan. I'm sure that lifestyle and its practitioners annoy you. That said, while I may not be able to enjoy it that much longer, this is my favorite food any time of the day or night. I realize I'm ghetto for loving it so much. You can take a white boy out of Scottsdale but you can't take the hood out of my mouth. It's just sooooooo fucking tasty. Number 17 meal changes lives. The breakfast burrito? Heaven on crack. The horchata? Grass dewed with the blood of the patron saint of tacos wouldn't taste better or look more romantic at 3:00 A.M. on a Saturday night when you're looking impress that cutie you just picked up at the Vig or Glam (or Positino if you've got more game).
