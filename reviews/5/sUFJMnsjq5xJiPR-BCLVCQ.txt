As soon as you walk in the door you notice the aroma of mesquite burning. The staff is friendly and the bueno burger is delicious. I really enjoy the jalape√±o relish. The owner is on site  which is nice and the concept is new. The have been open for a couple of months now and i had a great experience. I had a Sonoran dog as an appetizer and followed it up with a burger bueno style. The chef told me to try her combo and I loved it. I think it is cool that you can choose several different toppings all for the same price. Two thumbs up and I will be back.
