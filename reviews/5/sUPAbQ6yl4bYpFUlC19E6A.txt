This place rules. I'm guilty of settling for Taco Bell for lunch before, but one time the line for the drive thru was nuts while the one for Tacos La Mexicana, which is right across the way,  was barren. I decided to stop betraying my heritage and give their drive thru a try, even though I knew it would take a little longer considering I was buying real food. The wait wasn't too much longer though: I got my food in minutes, it beat the crap out of Taco Bell, and I've been going here ever since. I loved everything I've had so far, the people are always nice and very accomodating, and the cost won't kill your wallet.
