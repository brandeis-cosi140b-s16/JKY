I recently moved to Ohio and let me tell you, I wish I could fight over which Mexican shack was the best.  Amados does a lot of stuff right and once you have to live without it, you realize how awesome it really is.  I would give my left nut for a breakfast burrito or machaca plate!  Don't ever take it for granted.
