This place has the best carne asada tacos and burritos in town. I order my carne asada without sour cream...and always with fresh cilantro, guacamole and queso blanco. There isn't a messy sauce bar, but delicious verde sauce in squeeze bottles. The food is relatively cheap and the meat is seasoned...unlike at Roberto's. 

This is amazing food for a cheap price. Check them out if you haven't yet already!
