Are you kidding me? Anything less than five stars is just your internal curmudgeon looking for attention. The food here rocks! Atmosphere is awesome. Seating outside was perfect. Not to loud. In from Chicago, grew up in Arizona and this food was phenomenal. We had a big group of ten, the food was fast and the staff was awesome! Margaritas the real thing. Try the barbacoa tacos and the pork belly tacos. The street tacos and corn on the cob... Killer!  My teenage kids stated the baked churros are the best they ever had. The lemon tequila butter sauce for these is to die for! If you want the best food at a good value come try the Salt and Lime!
