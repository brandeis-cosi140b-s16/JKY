I brought my BF who is from NYC here and he was very unsure about it. In fact the first time he wouldn't even eat here he went
To chipotle. But when we got home and saw my burrito and tired it. He was then mad he didn't order one himself. Now
He craves it and eats here regularly! We even bought a bunch if burritos froze them and took it to NYC for his family to try.  

I LOVE Cafe Rio. It started in Utah (my homeland) and the lines in Utah go out the door and is always a 30+min wait. So when I came here I was shocked to see it wasn't that busy. I was a little disappointed on the speed of the workers. I am use to having it be like the "Soup Nazi" in Seinfeld, know your order and move along. But this location is a slower pace. 

Cafe Rio is known for its enchilada style burritos and salads. Anyone that i talked to who didn't like it always got something else off the menu (idk what else is even on it) most popular is the steak or grilled chicken. They make all their ingredients fresh everyday. So from location to location their 'special house dressing' can be slightly different.  
They are a little more expensive then other places but deff worth it!!
