I was having a craving for the deep-fried style tacos, hit up the Yelp app and found Famous Burritos. Wondering, "how good could they be, and how famous are they, if I have not heard of them yet?" I took a turn into the parking lot and sauntered in.

As soon as the lady behind the counter was done assisting the customer in front of her, she started offering suggestions as I stared at the menu contemplating. 

Like I mentioned, I was craving a taco, theirs were all the fresco / soft shell corn tortilla style, so I skipped those. I was there, running late on my lunch break and decided to give their shredded Carne Asada burrito with rice and cheese (as I don't like frijoles) a try.

Made it back to work, tore open the wrapper and enjoyed a very affordable and tasty burrito. It wasn't so stuffed that it was an OMGICANTBELIEVEIT kind of deal, but it also wasn't so stuffed that it exploded all over the place. It was a tad light, but still good and did the job for a little bit.

The one "disappointment" was the very small amount of chips that came with the burrito. I suppose I have gotten spoiled by other places that give out monsterous serving sizes of chips to enjoy with your food.

Will be back again once I am in the area and hungry for burritos!
