First things first: you gotta make sure Terri C. is working! She is fantastic! Dad ordered the machaca meal, mom got the stuffed chili relleno and I got the chorizo meal! Next: their salsa is AWESOME. Like, the best salsa I've ever had awesome. Then: their enchilada sauce is amaaaaazing! I need to go back soon, that's for sure!!
