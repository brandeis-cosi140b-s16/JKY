This is by far my favorite taco shop in the states, and that is probably because my all time favorite is the Tacos El Gordo in Tijuana. For some authentic & delicious tacos this place is a must, plus you can't beat the prices for the amount of food you get. I was in Vegas for 48hrs and literally managed to eat here on 3 separate occasions, and I plan for next trip to have a layover in Vegas just so I can stop thru and get my fix.
