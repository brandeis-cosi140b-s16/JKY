Other quick-mex places charge you for adding fajita veggies, or extra salsa on the side, but Chipotle lets you ask for extra of almost any ingredient for free (*not double meat or guac.)  The portions are huge and the whole "ethics of food" marketing is terrific.  When in doubt, I will happily eat here any time, with any number of friends.  :-)
