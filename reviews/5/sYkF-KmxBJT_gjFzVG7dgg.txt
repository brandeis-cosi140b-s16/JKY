Took our family there for lunch and there was so much food, it ended up as dinner!  Had the seafood mocajete and it was huge and tasted wonderful.  My only complaint is that the clam was added in its open shell, and the dish was so hot and bubbly, that I couldn't easily remove it.  This meal has an awesome presentation, and continues to sizzle at the table for quite some time!  The white rice they serve with some dishes is limey, and quite tasty...not the usual Spanish rice (though they serve that too).  Yes, the restaurant is in a run down area and looks pretty iffy on the outside, but inside was clean and definitely worth the trip.  Everyone at the table raved at how good their selection was, from the fish filet to the ceviche, to the shrimp cocktail.  Will definitely go there again when in Vegas!!
