I love that there is now a Braddah's on this side of town. It is a Chipotle style menu but with Hawaiian options. Fish is my preferred protein and I am happy to have a place to grab a quick bite that offers an alternative to the standard chicken & steak. 

I always have the salad with the yummy pineapple green salsa. The fish is always cooked to perfection, seasoned & moist. I have had this dish 3x this week already! 

The pumpkin bark is also a new favorite of mine.
