I feel weird rating my Taco Bell experience but after going to a certain Madison location this was serious the best way I could have ended my day. I live in Madison and work in Waunakee and sometimes my long busy does not allow me time to eat even though I work in a restaurant. Pulled up 5 minutes before they close thinking that they were open later and find out I was going to be "one of those guys". I asked about their closing time and was informed of it and I apologized but he said they would make anything I wanted. Drove up and the guy at the window was super friendly and seemed to really enjoy his job very much. We shared some words about me never visiting this location and how I manage the restaurant down the street, we related, I received my perfect hot order and I was on my way. Thanks, I will visit this location now on my way home instead of the Madison mineral point location.
Cheers!
