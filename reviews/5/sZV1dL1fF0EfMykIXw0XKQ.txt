Love this place. Super Nachos and the chicano meal is enough for 4 people $25.00 is a great price just need to add more drinks. The lady who takes the order is always nice and I have never had a bad experience with food or service. Would have added a picture however I didnt have Yelp before I ate it! Go and enjoy.  But go hungry.
