I am amazed by this location. The store was clean and everyone was friendly! Especially the cashier who took my order. My wife and I know that we are very picky and hard to take care of. Latrell did an excellent job handling us even with a smile on his face the whole time. It is rear to find this customer service in the fast food industry. I am definitely coming back again!
