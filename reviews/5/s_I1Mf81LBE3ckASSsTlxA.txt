Great little taco spot.  Really good service, prices are decent and I love the salsa bar as well. 

The customer service actually won me over but the food is legit. Mexican food is one of my favorites if not my favorite place and for a quick little fast food joint this place can't be beat.  Do yourself a favor and try this place out today.
