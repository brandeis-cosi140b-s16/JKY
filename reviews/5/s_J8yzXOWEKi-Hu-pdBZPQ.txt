I really like this place. Service was amazing! Everyone did their job really well. Their bussers & servers were all hard-working. Our busser always made sure to refill our drinks. I felt well taken cared of. As for food, I ordered the Kikiriki Erika. This dish was amazing!!! For dessert we tried the fried ice cream. The sauce they used made my mouth happy and the actual ice cream tasted better than vanilla. I cannot think of anything negative to say about this place. We liked this place so much that we left them w/ a really really good tip. :)
