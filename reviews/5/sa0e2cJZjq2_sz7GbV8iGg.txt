This review is only for Carlos O'Briens Spinach Dip.The spinach dip is hands down one of the best in the valley. Every time we come here we only get the Spinach dip so if you are a lover of spinach dips you have to try this one. My husband and his family have gone to the Northern location for many years and the Spinach dip is always the same and extremely consistant. We sit in the bar and always get served quickly and efficiently. Give it a try....you will not be dissappointed.
