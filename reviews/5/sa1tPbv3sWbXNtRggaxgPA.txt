Pretty dank

These nachos were high quality and I was really stoked to find they had tapatio.  I bring my own bottle from home because no places mexican places in scottsdale seem to have it.  That's how you know this place is dope.  Always clean always chill.  Mad props to the cooks and home girl working the counter.  Huge portions!  We come in high as fuck and can't finish it all.
