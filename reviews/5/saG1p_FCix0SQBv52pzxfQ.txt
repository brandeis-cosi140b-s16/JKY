The food is huge. Three people can eat one buritto. The place is super clean & you get fast service. If you want extra sour cream dont be shy ask for what you crave its your money your paying for it. If something is not cheesey enough then I suggest you be outspoken & speak up. This company is more than happy to make your food however your heart desires. I discovered this place days ago. Oh the things you find when your lost inside of a casino. Lol! I will return because its great fast hot food.
