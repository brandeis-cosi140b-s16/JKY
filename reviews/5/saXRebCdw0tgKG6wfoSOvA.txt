This place is awesome!  Lots of flavor, nice staff.  The hatch green chili sauce is wonderful.  It tastes just like the sauce at the Pepper Pot in Hatch, New Mex.  The Fry Bread is delicious!  Not too greasy and very soft.  The green chili stew is quite spicy, but full of great flavor!  This place is a MUST try!
