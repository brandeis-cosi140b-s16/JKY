One of the nicest Mexican restaurants to be sure. Our server Roberto was terrific, bringing drink refills without even asking. And when I asked to split a tres leches desert he said no problem, he'd take care of it. When he brought the deserts he didn't split one, he brought out two. Very nice. We were there for Taco Tuesday and the Tacos were really tasty. Lots of flavor and a very unique and interesting menu selection. Definitely worth a revisit.
