This place doesn't look like much on the outside and you'll have to disregard the white foldable tables and chairs as you walk inside....but the food is AMAZING.
This is Sonora Style Mexican food so keep that in mind.  

Here are my ratings:

MEAT:  I had the Carne Asada tacos.  The carne asada meat was perfect.  It had a slight mesquite smokiness and very flavorful.  The type of meat was Ranchera, which is the ideal type for asada tacos.  The meat was cut against the grain, perfect!

Tortillas:  The tortillas are the best!  They're made on site....flour tortillas.  Not that cheap stuff you get at the store with tons of preservatives.  This is the real deal...fresh and tasty.  

Salsa:  The salsa is good.  But it could be great.  I favor the really spicy stuff so for the average salsa person...it will be good.

Extras:  They line the inside of their tacos with Frijoles Puercos.  These are great beans that have ham, pork and a few different types of cheeses mixed in.  If you've never had these type of beans...you've never had beans!  I love how they just add a little to the tortilla and then the meat on top.  It's enough to add even more flavor to the taco but no so much that it overpowers the meat.

They have your basic cucumbers, salsas, onions and cilantro set up.

You have to try this place...it's the best tacos in Phoenix!!!
