I visited this place with my mother while on vacation over three years ago - and we are STILL talking about it!  We stayed at the Cottonwood Resort, which is walking distance to Blanco.  EXCELLENT Happy Hour specials, DELICIOUS Mexican food, PERFECT margaritas and an absolutely AMAZING waitstaff.  If you find yourself in the Scottsdale area, this is a place that cannot be missed in my opinion.
