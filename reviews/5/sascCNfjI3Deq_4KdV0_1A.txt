I've been going here at least once a week for the past year or so. The food is consistently great, the staff is very friendly, and they are able to make your meal quickly.

This is basically like a local version of Chipotle. The menu is very similar. But, in my opinion, Cactus Grill has much better food. The $5.25 daily specials are a steal as well!

I highly recommend the honey grilled chicken burrito or the fish burrito.
