At first i thought their food were awful, BUT I WAS WRONG. I went there this morning and ordered steak fries and steak with rice. They serve a lot too! Food was delicious! I am serious! I was gonna take a picture of it before i eat it, but i was really hungry!..burp..I like how they cooked the steak.! Excellent everything!. Service was great. The lady was really nice. I will go there next time.
