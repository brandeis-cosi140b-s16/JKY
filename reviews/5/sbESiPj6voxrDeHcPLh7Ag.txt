Hands down BEST breakfest burrito in the World!! I drive 30 miles to get one. Actually headed there this morning so I will see the great staff very soon.... Clean place and great customer service!! Keep up the great work guys and you will be running chipotle back home very soon! If you are reading this review then please go try this place. Cody over and out
