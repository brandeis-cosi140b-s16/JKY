I was very excited to find out Roberto's expanded YET AGAIN to this are of Henderson since my sister lives very close to this location. I'm pretty sure they just opened up a couple days ago. 

In case you didn't know, Roberto's is my go-to post-debauchery food after a night of drinking and other shenanigans that happened, if I'm near one. Hell, I even think its amazing when sober. I usually go for their carne asada fries or a California burrito, but most of the time, like during my visit here, I went with the fries. It's a shade under 8 bucks, and so it seems slightly more expensive than the other locations I've been to. Either way I still think its worth it. Something about how they season the carne asada that keeps my fork busy. Pour on some of that chile verde sauce and its a done deal. Every bite is practically like going to heaven... twice. I wasn't even drunk or buzzed when I ate this mind you. 

Since its a brand new location, I appreciate the cleanliness of it all. For a franchise with over 40 locations in the Las Vegas area alone, it sure knows what its doing when it comes to making amazing Mexican food.  If I ever crave it at say 5 in the morning, best believe I'd come here, since like pretty much all other locations, its 24 hours. That's right. 24 hours. Roberto's FTW.
