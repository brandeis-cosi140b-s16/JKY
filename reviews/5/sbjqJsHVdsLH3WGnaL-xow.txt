This was my favorite restaurant that I visited during my stay in Las Vegas.  We stayed at the Tuscany so we had plenty of opportunities to try this out.  My companion doesn't like Mexican food so it was hard to convince him to try it but once he did, he liked it as much as I did.  He ate there twice and I ate there a third time because I just had to get a carryout of the menudo, it was wonderful.  The table side guacamole is absolutely delicious and it's a big serving, the lunch menu offered some great cheap specials and it all tasted like it was handmade.  If I lived in LV, I'd eat here all the time.
