I LOVE Anita's!!! Whenever I come through town... Every few years, I always stop twice. Once for breakfast (corned beef hash or machaca) and lunch. The regular nachos are amazing, the chips are fresh as well as the mild salsa. I've never had anything bad on the menu. The staff is friendly, always helpful and checking on you ( several waiters ) making sure drinks are full and plates get cleared regularly!!! The owners are there helping out and making sure things run great! Definitely a MUST STOP!!!!
