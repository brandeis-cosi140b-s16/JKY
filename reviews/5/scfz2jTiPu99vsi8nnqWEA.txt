This place is delicious. You pick your choice of meat (chicken, steak, ground beef, pork and others) they place it in a corn tortilla for you and the rest is up to you. They have many choices at the salsa bar. You can go mild or very hot. All tacos are $2.50 each. They take cash or you can go inside the store and pay with a credit card.
