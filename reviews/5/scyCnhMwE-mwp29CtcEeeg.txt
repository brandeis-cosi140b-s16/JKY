Second time to Rita's.  The best Mexican food in the valley.  Great mix of real Mexican style recipes (the seafood) sonoran/southwest style favorites, and even fajitas (which I haven't had yet but given lack of good fajitas in az I bet these will be great.   The Chile rellenos I had today was the best I have ever had.
