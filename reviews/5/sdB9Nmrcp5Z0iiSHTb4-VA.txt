The ten courses for two special is PHENOMENAL and just might be as good as it gets for Mexican Cuisine in this area. You can't help being delighted with all the bountiful flavorful tasty plates that give you the feeling you were on a tour along Central Mexico. Everything  we tried was delicious and our dining companions were also thrilled and impressed with the well crafted food. (This now is a new favorite of theirs too.) Many other great Mexican cuisine can be found around town but what's here at Los Sombreros it's a finer dining experience with a very comfortable attractive dining room and shaded patio and very attentive service. 

I thought a few things to go wrong since this was their first weekend open and the multi course menu requires above average service but to my surprise things went well like clockwork.

For $75. the menu per couple went like this.

Chips and salsa
(2) Corn Chowder Soups
(2) Crispy Hibiscus Tacos
Fig and Panela Cheese Salad
Crab and Mango Salad
Snapper and Corn in Chipotle Balsamic honey sauce
Trout and Cauliflower in lemon butter caper sauce
Chicken Breast stuffed with goat cheese, huitlacohe in chipotle tomato sauce
Chile Rellenos
Pork Chop with tamarind mole
House Made Ice Cream

You should plan the ten course event to take over two hours to enjoy.
