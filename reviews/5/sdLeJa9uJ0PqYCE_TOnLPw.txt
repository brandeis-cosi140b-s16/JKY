Whoot Whoot...Taco Tuesday's loved, loved, loved there street tacos.  You can get 10 for $10.00.   No I didn't eat them by myself, lol I shared them.  You can mix them up, they have several different flavors, pork, beef, chicken and the shrimp..  My favorite was the shrimp with the cabbage, it was off the chain!  We will be back!
