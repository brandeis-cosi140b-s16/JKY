Outstanding Mexican food and very inexpensive prices.  Second time eating there and it was as good as the first.  Mixed fajita platter and chile verde platter. Terrific flavors.  Great salas. Delicious beans and rice.  I'm guessing some lard went into making those beans taste so yummy. Really good food.  Really good.
