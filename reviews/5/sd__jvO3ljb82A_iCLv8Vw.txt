One of the things I love best about travelling to Mexico is stopping at the street taco vendors and getting some authentic cooked to order carne asada dollar tacos.  

Taco Azteca brought that exact thing to Las Vegas, and they do it WONDERFULLY.  There is a restaurant storefront, but I am not entirely sure you can go inside (I've never seen anyone but an employee go in) because the sell everything from a food cart in their parking lot.  I have only ever stopped by here after dark, and I'm pretty sure they aren't open in the daytime (or maybe that's when you can go inside to dine...I'm not sure and don't really care.)   

Ladies and Gentlemen, if you have not eaten at Taco Azteca, you are missing out on one of the best culinary experiences in Vegas.   This little food cart has been featured on Anthony Bourdain, and it's not hard to see why the producers picked this place for a feature spot.  AMAZING.  Oh, and there is always a line of Mexicans waiting to get their orders, which to me is a pretty strong sign of good authentic Mexican food.  

Their tacos are a buck a piece, and 50 cents to add cheese (and who wouldn't want cheese?).  They offer traditional fillings like carne asada (steak), carnitas (shredded pork), and pollo (chicken), or if you are feeling adventurous, they have lengua (tongue) and cabeza (which I'm pretty sure is cow brain - I'm not that adventurous)

I cannot say this strongly enough.  Do yourself a favor and FIND THIS PLACE.  Okay...now i'm hungry.  I'm thinking i may have to hit this place tonight.

***Expert tip:  Ask them for some lime wedges and squeeze a lime on each taco just before you eat it.  It enhances the flavor of the meat and makes your tastebuds want to sing with joy.
