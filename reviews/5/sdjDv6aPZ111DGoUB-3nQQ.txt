I love Mexican food and the only thing I love more than eating Mexican is cooking Mexican! Reyna's has absolutely everything you need to have your own south of the border fiesta! Salsa, mole, hot sauces galore, fresh guacamole, dried chilies, house made frozen goods, kitchen gadgets, candles, spices...oh, I could go on.

On my most recent trip I knew I wasn't going to have a lot of time to make dinner from scratch so I grabbed some southwestern vegetarian tamales (made in-house and frozen $8.50/5) guac and some tortilla chips. All I had to do was heat and serve. JB raved about the meal and I almost didn't want to tell him it was premade and all I had to do was heat it up and make it look pretty on the plate, but I have to give credit where credit is due.

Renya Foods is fabulous and if you are a lover of Mexican food, you have to drop in. You will not leave empty handed.
