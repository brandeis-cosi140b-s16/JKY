This is my favorite place for Mexican food. Not familiar with Mexican food from Mexico, but this food is the closest to authentic as my Tia's. Prices are very reasonable, the staff is friendly and I like the inviting atmosphere. It can get full, but we have never had to wait long at all.

This year our family had Juan's cater my Tia's funeral services on a Saturday. Some family could not make it in to town until Sunday, so we had to cancel the order, the restaurant is closed on Sundays. We informed the owner of our reason for canceling and apologized. The owner took time out of his Sunday to cater my Tia's funeral services. We cannot thank him enough for going out of his way to do this for our family...and everyone loved the food! Many Thanks!!!!
