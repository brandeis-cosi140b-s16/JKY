I used to work for a securities company & a coworker came back with food from this resturant. She said it was pretty good, and I went to try it for myself, and have been going back ever since then, and that was more than 5yrs ago. It is a little hole in the wall, but it is undoubtly my favorite Mexican Resturant in Vegas, and I have tried more than half in the city. The staff is always smiling and friendly, and I love their chips and salsa, usually with a glass of iced tea, their Chicken Burrito with rice and beans & Green sauce is my absolute favorite, but they also have good chicken taco's and their chimichanga is delish! Everything on their menu is good, I have taken many family and friends there, and no one has complained yet! You have to just go by there and try it for yourself. I really like it, they have had the same cook there in the A.M. for all these years, and he sooooo kicks ass! You will probably leave there with a smile on your face and a very happy and full tummy! Viva El Herradero! :)
