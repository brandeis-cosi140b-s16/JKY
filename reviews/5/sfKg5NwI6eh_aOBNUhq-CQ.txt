In Vegas for Memorial weekend and we decided to check Yelp for somewhere to eat lunch.  Decided on KoMex because it was nearby and because of its high reviews.  Great choice!  I didn't even realize it was Korean/Mexican fusion until I opened my menu.  The restaurant is small and was very busy.  Five of us were seated almost immediately, drink order taken shortly after and a basket of homemade chips, guacamole and salsa delivered shortly after.  I shared kimchee fried rice, fusion style flautas, tacos, and spam musubies.  The flautas were my favorite.  Everyone left full and happy. 

Decided to come back two days later before heading home and decided on the Bulgogi tater tots.  I requested a fried egg on top and was happy I did.  It complimented my meal perfectly.  It was like breakfast all in one (tater tots, bulgogi, sour cream, cheese, and a fried egg by request) I highly recommend this restaurant.  Food is great, service is good and will definitely come back when in Vegas.
