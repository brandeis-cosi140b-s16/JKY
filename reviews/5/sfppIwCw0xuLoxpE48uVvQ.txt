I love to try different kinds of food so I decided to check it out for lunch.   The food was amazing.  It was freshly made and arrived at my table pretty quick.  I ordered the Pupusas Revuelta and with the sauce that came with it I couldn't stop eating it until it was gone.  It was pretty good size and very filling.  But my eyes were bigger then my stomach and I ordered the Salvadorian Tamales de Pollo.  It was so moist and full of flavor.   I will definitely be back again.  This is a definite must try if you're looking for something unique.
