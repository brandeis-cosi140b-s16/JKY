Food was really tasty and authentic. The service was also excellent from the waitress that we had. Definitely one of the better Mexican restaurants in the area. It was my first visit to a Don Pedro's and I was pleasantly surprised. The atmosphere took me to Mexico and I would definitely recommend this place if you are looking for a new Mexican spot.
