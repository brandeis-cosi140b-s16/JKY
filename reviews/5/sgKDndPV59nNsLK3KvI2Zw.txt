I've been going here at least once a week with coworkers lately. This is definitely the best sit down restaurant in Apache Junction. The salsa is absolutely addicting, the servers are friendly (and technologically advanced with their neat little electronic order pads), and the food is plentiful and delicious. I like to get the chicken breast lunch meal when I go for lunch, and have yet to find a definitive favorite when going to dinner, since that is more rare. They're really good about bringing your food out quickly when you mention you're on your lunch break.

They need to sell the salsa in bottles!
