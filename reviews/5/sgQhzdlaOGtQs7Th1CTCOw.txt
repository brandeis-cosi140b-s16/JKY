Me and my buddy had some time to kill before the show at the joint           ( August burns red, as i lay dying,norma jean, the devil weras prada) awesome show! anyways...i was already prepared to go all out and treat myself.  I ordered a chimichanga meal and it was one of the best that i have eaten. it was well prepared every little detail, and they also had great chips and salsa.  I also had some coronas with my meal and i dont know where they get their coronas but these tasted awesome.  Most of the time they taste kind of burnt when you get em at liquor stores. it was just an awesome dining experience and i recommend eating there the next time you go to the Hard Rock.
