Someone recommended this place and they were right. This is real Mexican food right in the middle of Scottsdale. We ordered the tilapia chicharron and the Tampiquena...they were both really good, the meat was tasty and juicy. The salsas and chips that they serve you in the beginning are to die for! ..great service and great environment. I went to get lunch but they told me that at night they have a DJ, we are coming back for sure!
