Generous portions, simple menu, perfect for a quick meal.  Small, intimate setting so don't plan on a group meal.  The service was friendly but the front counter lady was a bit over tasked (between the take out window, the front counter and the phone) so she was a bit disorganized.  This did not stop me from enjoying my food or my experience.
