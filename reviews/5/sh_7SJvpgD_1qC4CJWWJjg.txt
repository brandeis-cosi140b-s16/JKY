Yes, yes, I am giving a restaurant with a drive through five stars!

Filibertos, my guilty pleasure.. I'm a slave to the carne asada fries!! They always have such big portions and yummy helpings of sour cream, avocados, cheese and salsa!

I will not eat breakfast or dinner just to pig out on this glorious place for lunch! Almost everything on the menu is guaranteed to be good.. let me re-phrase that to "so darn good you will toss and turn in your sleep from guilt!". 

I would also highly recommend their rolled taquitos, yummy! 

Warning: This place is very dangerous because of the fact that it has a drive through and is very easy access food. Thoughts of Filibertos throughout the day and the temptation of the drive through will haunt you!! lol :)

5 stars!! :D
