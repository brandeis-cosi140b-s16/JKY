Myself and 5 friends and 4 dogs stopped in for dinner during the Enchanted Pumpkin Festival. We had dinner on the patio because of the pups. We just missed the dinner crowd and has most of the patio to ourselves. The fish tacos wee absolutely amazing and all the dogs received water bowls and little cups of diced chicken. Everyone enjoyed their meal, the manager changed the patio music to suit our taste and the margaritas were tasty. Fun place. Good food. Bring your pups. We'll be back.
