This is one of our favorites.  They are always showcasing a new crazy burger.  If you're willing to try something other than a standard burger I saw you to try this place. I've tried all of their salads when I'm not in the burger mood and they're all yummy but my favorite is the Fresno.  My BF would like to go every night if I let him.  Very small place so plan on a wait since they were featured on the food network recently.  All good things come to those who wait....
