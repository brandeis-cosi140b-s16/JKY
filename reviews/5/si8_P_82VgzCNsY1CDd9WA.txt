Los Favoritos is an amazing no frills taco shop! The food is always consistantly good and the staff is usually decent. Love the Chicken California. The menu and prices are very similar to Filibertos, however the place is a million times cleaner and I feel safe eating here. Grab a burrito here, you won't regret it!
