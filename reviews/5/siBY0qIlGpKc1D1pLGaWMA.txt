This is not an upscale Mexican restaurant, hole in the wall kind of place but don't get fooled by its appearance. This is the place where you get the best chicken tacos ever. Simple tacos on small fresh made soft tortilla, chicken, onions and lime. Add fresh cilantro and you are in food heaven. How much does it cost? Mind blowing $1.75 per taco. The servers are very friendly. The complimentary chips and salsa is too good. Today we tried sopes... Mmmmmm goodness!! Their wet burrito are super too. All in all, not a single item we tried on the menu so far is bad. Oh and how can I end the review without mentioning their home made flan... :-)
