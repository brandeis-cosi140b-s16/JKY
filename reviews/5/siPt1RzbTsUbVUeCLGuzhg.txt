We don't normally go to this location but we were meeting friends in a central location for all day happy hour specials. 

First off the happy hour deals are pretty good. I ordered a large cheese crisp with chilis for $3 and my husband got the $5 taquitos. The drinks $5 each and a good size. They had a good selection on the menu. 

The service was kind of slow but as I looked around I could see our server was also the bartender so that explained it. Israel did a great job, very friendly and efficient. We will definitely visit this location again.
