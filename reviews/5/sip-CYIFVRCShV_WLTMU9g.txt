So, we are waiting for a flight at 8AM and having a breakfast burrito at Blue Burrito (connected to Taberna del Tequila at Sky Harbor Airport) and I was complaining to my boyfriend that they don't give out their really good hot sauce anymore - instead they give Tapatio (sucks).   The guy sitting next to us (Roger) works at Taberna del Tequila and he got up and went to the restaurant and brought us some!  Went out of his way to make sure we were good and it wasn't even something we bought at the restaurant!   Needless to say, over and above.  Thanks, Roger!
