Best California Carne Asada burrito in town! I used to go to Burrito Express, now I go to both lol. Mostly here though. Came here for the first time, only got a carne asada burrito, came back a few weeks later to try the California Carne Asada, AMAZING. Also the Carne Asada Fries, wayyyy better than Filibertos or Amados. Once a week type place!
