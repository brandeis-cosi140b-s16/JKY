My partner and I have been visiting this Rubios in Mesa for about a year. We usually eat there on Tuesdays for the world famous fish tacos, but have been known to stop in other days. We always enjoy the pleasant staff, especially a certain shift manager Chris. She is always warm and friendly and by now knows our names and order. Thank you for the tasty food, fast and friendly service!
