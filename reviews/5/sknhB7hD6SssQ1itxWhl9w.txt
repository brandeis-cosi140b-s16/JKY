By far the best Mexican food in town.  

Since moving from Texas, near the border, I have been deprived of good Mexican food....until Mas Amigas.

I agree, the Mole sauce is not very good, but everything else I have tried has completely surpassed everything I have tasted in champaign.

I recommend the Mexicana sauce on cheese enchiladas and the chorizo tortas.  The chips and salso are very fresh and are the best in town.  

I also need to mention how amazing the service is.  They are extremely friendly and the food comes out very quickly.
