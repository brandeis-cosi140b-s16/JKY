I LOVE ME SOME LINDO.
Great atmosphere, yummy food & friendly staff. There is hardly ever a wait for dinner. Wonderful view; if seated toward the back. Sometimes, there is a man that sings live, which is pretty cool. All meals come with chips, salsa, bean dip & fideo soup! It can get loud in the restaurant at times... but that (to me) means everyone is having a good time. Elroy gave excellent service; along with the rest of the staff. They all really do work as a team. Authentic experience, service & food! Viva Lindo!
