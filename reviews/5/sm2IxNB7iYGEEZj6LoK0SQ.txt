My wife and I discovered this great little Mexican restaurant after scouting Yelp reviews in our neighborhood.  Yelp raters had it scored at about 4.5-stars; and we agree.  It feels like a take-out joint when you first walk-in, but we recommend you eat-in.  Great chips and salsa while we waited for our food.  The owner is personable and attentive, and the food is really good and good portions.  We had the cheese enchilada combo and the chile-relleno combo and the tab came out to about $20.  We will be back!  :)
