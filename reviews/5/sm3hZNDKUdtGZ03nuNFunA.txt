I love this location! I really think all the employees there know me by name and by my card (as it's a Hello Kitty Visa), hey don't judge! Anywho, the manager/owner is always working and he isn't always behind the register, he's actually picking up and greeting everyone in the establishment, I love that! Crazy concept but interacting with your customers, brings them back. Aside from the service, their food is literally always fresh and to order. I've never had any overcooked food, or old/stale vegies. It's in a great location and just very convenient.

Personally I always go for the burrito bowl, but they have lots of alternaties and especially for the vegietarians/vegans.
