Excellent experience! The atmosphere is very cozy and chic. The staff was welcoming and friendly from the moment we walked in.  Overall, the service was excellent.  To start off, the chips and salsa were great (some of the best chips I've had) and we loved all three options of salsa that were given with the chips. 

We decided to order the Feast so we could get a little taste of everything.  While we loved the pork burrito, the steak burrito was also a huge hit. Whatever the steak is marinated in is perfect. We also took advantage of Yelp's check-in offer and tried a free carne asada taco that was excellent. Everything tasted very fresh. 

For dessert, we tried the fried ice cream and the churros. The churros are filled with caramel- come on!! Delicious!

We would definitely recommended El Dorado Cantina and will be back on our next Vegas trip!
