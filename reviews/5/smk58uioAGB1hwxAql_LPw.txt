I am so happy that Pittsburgh has been blessed with El Toro Loco.  I almost cried tears of joy as I ate my Pollo Ranchero because it was that good. I LOVE this place! I guess you could say I'm loco for El Toro Loco :D

The staff are super friendly and welcoming.  The chips and salsa appetizer is fresh with a kick of spice!  The good is prepared so quickly too. Honestly I think I blinked and it appeared in front of me.

Final Thought:  This is my new favorite Mexican restaurant
