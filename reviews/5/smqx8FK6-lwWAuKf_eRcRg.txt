I grew up in the SF Bay Area and have been in Pittsburgh for 8 years. I've eaten Mexican food from coast to coast and border to border in the US. This is still one of my favorite Mexican places I've ever eaten at period (from high end gourmet places to the taco trucks on the side of the road).

This location just changed hands in the family and they added a ton of new items to the menu along with new sauces. The pablano sauce on the enchiladas or the jalape√±o sauce on anything is just incredible. Some of my favorite dishes are the tostadas, empanadas, flautas, tortilla soup (not a dish but still awesome), homemade guacamole, enchiladas and any of the burritos. All the dishes aren't 100%, cooked at home dishes but every culinary establishment puts their own twist on cuisine.

Atmosphere is usually not too bad (lunch gets crazy) and they started giving away a free meal every Friday at random. The new restaurant name is "Vicky's Mexican Restaurant" ~ definitely worth checking out!!
