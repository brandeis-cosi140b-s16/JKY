This was one of my first introductions to Sonoran style seafood and it is still one of my favorites! My favorites are the ceviche verde de camaron, which is so far the only place in Phoenix I found this at, the pescado mojo de ajo and anything with smoked marlin. I have not had a bad thing there yet and been going there since about 1998. This is how I like to eat in Mexico and glad to know I don't have to wait to go there to enjoy some good Sonoran sea food.
