I order delivery from Cactus Grill via Grub Hub multiple times a month. It is always delicious and their chips and salsa are seriously the best. The delivery is also usually within an hour. I ordered from them yesterday and my order was a little late (over an hour). They called to explain they were running behind because Neil Street was flooded. They apologized and offered a free drink for our inconvenience. I appreciate and respect that they let me know why they would be late. I will continue ordering from them!
