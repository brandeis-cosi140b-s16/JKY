I love this place! I can't Get enough! My best friend and I stumbled upom the scottsdale location one day and we were hooked. I take all my friends here and my sister is hooked too. One of my friends is gluten-free and the manager came out and talked to her to make sure her food was prepared to her needs. 

The chips and salsa are so yummy and I always get guacamole to go with it too. The taquitos are so yummy as is the green chile burro, taco salad and fajitas! I love this place!
