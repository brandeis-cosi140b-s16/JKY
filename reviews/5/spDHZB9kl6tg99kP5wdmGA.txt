Gave this place 5 stars. Some really good fast  Mexican food that is close by and its 24 hour. Defiantly excited about that! Love the breakfast burritos with bacon chorizo cheese and potato, perfect horchata and spicy green salsa. Love that u can eat in at any time. Cheep prices and good sized portions as well............looking forward to coming back again
