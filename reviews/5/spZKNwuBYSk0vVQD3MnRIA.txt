This is exactly what I am looking for when I want tacos. I'm so glad I found it. Don't be afraid to eat the cabeza, if you had barbacoa before somewhere else this is what it is really supposed to taste like. I can't say enough about this place. I may be biased since I am stuck in the land of unauthentic mexican food but this place is the real deal.
