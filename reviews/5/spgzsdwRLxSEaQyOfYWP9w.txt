This is the best Rubio's in town.  The employees and management are so friendly and accommodating.   I am on the Hcg diet and they work with me to make things I can eat.  Every time I am in Old Town for an appointment I make sure it is around lunch time so I can go to this Rubio's.   The place is very clean and they seem to be very happy working here.  Shout out to Steven, he is really nice to all customers.
