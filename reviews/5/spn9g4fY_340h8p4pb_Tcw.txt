Here in Apache Junction on business. We stayed at the Best Western Bout 1 mile from this place.My wife and I decided we wanted simple and hit yelp. Found Los Tacos. It was clean, tasty, quick, and close to the hotel. We ate lunch at Nandos. This place tasted just as good. My wife saw the sopes, and she was set. 

One thing, don't take a bite of the roasted jalapeno until you meal arrives.........
