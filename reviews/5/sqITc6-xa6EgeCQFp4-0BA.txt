We walked by on our way to the Giants baseball game on Friday and it looked good, so we went for lunch today in the rain.  It was just wonderful. We sat on the back patio which was not crowded, even though it was pretty crowded inside.  Our waiter was pleasant, prompt, and helpful in explaining menu items.  I had the shrimp tacos and my husband had Huevos Rancheros.  We also ordered a side of the street corn.  It was one of the best meals we've had on this trip.  The rain added to the already lovely ambience.  

The tacos, in addition to tasting wonderful, looked just as good.  The presentation is clearly important to them.  The service was equally good. 

A great place for either lunch or dinner.
