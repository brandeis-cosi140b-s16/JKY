Great house margarita, the pork chimi was soo good I wanted to order another one. The baja fish tacos are better than rubios fish tacos, and the come with smashed potatoes.. WOW.. Those are good. The salt n pepper wings with chipolte ranch were also amazing!! Great nieghborhood atmosphere, great patio view.
