Get a tofu burrito! You won't regret it!  They have some of the best tofu I've ever tasted. Marinated and has a delicious lime flavor to it. I'm about 30 minutes away and still make a special trip for a takeout burrito.

They've got beer, King of Pops, baked items like cookies or brownies available and a tiny salsa bar. I'm a vegetarian, but I've heard awesome things about their BBQ burritos. There's a nice, little outdoor seating area and the location is perfect in South End. I always like the music they play (usually pop punk or ska reggae type stuff) This is my go-to for a fast, hearty meal.

Extra items can run your total up pretty quick, so keep an eye out. But they offer so many awesome things, it's hard to not want to devour it all! Nom Nom Nom
