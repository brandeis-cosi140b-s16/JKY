The service alone gets my 5 stars! As soon as we walked in everyone greeted us like they knew us! Made us feel very welcome. 

We ordered the carne asada torta & the chicken one... They were served with a side of fries! Food was delicious and the horchata made it 100% better! Too bad I goobled it before taking a picture.

I'm from Los Angeles so we yelped this place and it was well worth it! The area is not the best-est but the food will make u forget where u are ;) 

Come take a taste!
