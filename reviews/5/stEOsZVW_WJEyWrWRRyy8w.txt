Good food, good service, good ambiance. I came here after gambling for awhile and it was a great place to relax. I ordered the Carnitas Enchilada plate with red sauce  which came with beans and rice. The quality of food was delicious and worth the price. The drinks here are strong and generous as well. Our waitress was very attentive and made sure we had everything we needed. I'm coming back for sure!
