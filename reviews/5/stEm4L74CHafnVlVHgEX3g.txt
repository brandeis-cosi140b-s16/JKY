We were leaving the Angel's Tempe Diablo Stadium and craving some authentic Mexican food. Took a chance with this spot because although it had great ratings on Yelp, there weren't a ton of reviews. Sooooo glad we did!! The food was amazingly delicious and exactly what we were looking for! It's kind of Chipotle style in that they make your food in front of you and ask you what toppings you want as you go down the line. We got carne asada nachos with the works (including guacamole and the jalapeno cream cheese which costs extra but is definitely worth it) and a chicken taco and a regular pork taco. All were fantastic! We'll definitely be coming back to visit when we're back for Spring Training next year!
