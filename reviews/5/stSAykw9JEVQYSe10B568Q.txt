This is the most authentic/amazing Mexican food that you will find in Champaign.  The enchiladas were great (especially the mole) and tasted just like they do in SoCal.  The tortilla chips were a little heavy on grease, but as a plus they are fresh, deep fried tortillas.  Mas Amigos does not simply wrap chicken in a tortilla and slather cheese sauce on top of the dish (as almost every other Mexican food restaurant in town does minus Taco Loco).  The service was fast/friendly and I will definitely be eating there again!
