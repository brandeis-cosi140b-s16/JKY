Great little place to eat. I found them on Yelp and decided to give them a try. I was so amazed by the service and the food that I went back later in the day to try something else on the menu. I met the owner that evening and he explained that they were all from SoCal and the history of the food prep. It definitely tastes like something you would get from a mom and pop shop in San Diego. I highly recommend this place. My favorite part of the two dishes I've tried so far is the rice, it was definitely made with love.
