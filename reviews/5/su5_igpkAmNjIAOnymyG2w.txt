We were he only two in the place on a rainy Sunday afternoon, but we had so much fun! The bartender, James, turned on the game and sound we wanted, he was attentive the perfect amount and he made excellent drinks! The $6.99 two tacos with rice and beans special was so good! I recommend the carne asada. We will be back!
