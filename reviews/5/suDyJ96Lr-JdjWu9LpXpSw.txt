Yummmmmm......the guacamole was great, but the cheese dip was even better!   Chicken cheese enchiladas were good too, but the honey corn rice dish was amazing!    Great carne asada, and dont miss out on the margaritas.  Great tequila selection.

Finally...do not leave without eating the churros...they are amazing!
