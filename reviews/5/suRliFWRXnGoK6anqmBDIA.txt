One of my favorite spots for a burger. Always busy, but not overly so where you can't get a table. The fries have this seasoning that's almost sweet. To die for! Burgers are great. They make their own ranch and pickled onions. They really pay attention to detail. 

It's location in a sketchy stip mall, but there is a hidden Gem inside. Highly recommend!
