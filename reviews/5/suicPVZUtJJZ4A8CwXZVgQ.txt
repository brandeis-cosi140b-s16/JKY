Ron's creations are tasty and delicious, especially the Nate dogs! My 7 yo son and I love to visit and try new things, but my favorite is still the Tofo & Egg. Would like a little bit more spice, but that's what the cock sauce is for, right?!

Fast, friendly and fun....and in a convenient location right in front of Lee's. Good eats!
