My girlfriend lives in the area, and we were looking to try something new. I was simply blown away by how fresh and delicious the food was here! It's a family-owned place, which I like supporting, and the owner was one of the nicest guys I've ever met.

I had a carne asada burrito with the works, and it blew Chipoltle and Zabas out of the water. There's really something to be said about fresh ingredients.

My girlfriend has their fajitas meal, and not only was it very tasty, the plate was popping with color! The peppers were were bright and flavorful and when mixed with the rice, chicken, onions and cilantro, it was simply excellent.

Oh, and the prices were astonishingly low! I know it sounds like I'm gushing, but this place redefined my expectations of quick Mexican food in LV.

I only wish I lived closer to this place, but I'll certainly be heading back when I'm in the area!
