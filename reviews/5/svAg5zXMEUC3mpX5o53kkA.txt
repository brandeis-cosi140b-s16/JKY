Yes - go here! 

We were very happy to find this restaurant around the corner from one of our friends' house which would mean many blissful returns to El Ranchero...

We went here with a group of friends on a Saturday for lunch. The restaurant was fairly quiet at the time which suited us perfectly and also had the added benefit of the chef/owner serving us. He was really friendly, sincere and attentive to our table. 

I had a carne asada quesadilla and barbecue pork soft tacos. My husband had the chicken quesadilla and carne asada soft tacos. All of the above - delicious!

The chef also brought us some of the house specialty hot sauce and guacamole to go with the complimentary chips and salsa. These were amazing! I could not get enough of the guacamole and had to ask for extra before we left. 

The food was priced very decently and the serving sizes were more than enough. 
I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for really tasty authentic Mexican food.
