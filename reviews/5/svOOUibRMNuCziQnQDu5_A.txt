I was so excited to try out The Salted Lime! My friends and I (party of 8) had a reservation at 6 for their opening day. 
The bartender, Morri, made the greatest margaritas! Chips and salsa were complimentary. Food took a bit to get to us, but what would we expect, it was opening day! The food was far from disappointing, we each enjoyed our entrees. I will definitely be back to try another delicious selection from the menu!
