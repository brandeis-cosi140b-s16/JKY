Some of the best tacos I've eaten in ages!!!!
 
Pastor, Fish and Mole!! All fantastic with incredible fresh toppings!! Don't get me started on the short rib!! Totally melt in your mouth tender!

Beer from a glass boot! Ginormous Mason Jar margaritas!

Okay ladies, so now you know I like my Guacamole chunky! Love the "smashed" avocados with big chunks - would hit a pocket of lemon juice or hot sauce that gave it some major mojo flavor!

The d√©cor is over the top cool! Super swanky Roadhouse!! Let me pinch myself! Am I in Austin, Texas? Or Charlotte?

Super fast servers! Free valet parking across the street!

So what's the deal? Bakersfield is actually one of five, with most based in Ohio and Indiana. Who whudda thunk it? Not me. Well, they're looking to expand. If all of them are like this, then they have a formula for success. I will need to rent a car and visit all of them!! Or maybe I'll just live in a tent on top of this one!!
