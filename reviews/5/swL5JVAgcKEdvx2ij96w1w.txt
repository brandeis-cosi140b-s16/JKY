We found this spot in the magazine of our hotel room and decided to give it a try. We ended up being very happy with our choice. We got the carne asada burrito and the barrio pollo burrito and both were excellent!

There verde sauce is amazing. Very flavorful!  To top it off we ended with a very delicious churro dessert. Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside topped with ice cream. Yummy!!!!

The service was great and the food came out fast, piping hot, and fresh. So glad we found this place.
