Right off the bat the corn salsa they give you is incredible and could be eaten as a side dish on its own. Food came out a little slow on a busy Friday night, but that just gave us more time to enjoy the salsa-our waitress was kind enough to bring another after we quickly demolished the first one. The fish tacos were excellent and the blackened shrimp and chicken burrito my girlfriend ordered was outstanding. I would highly recommend-my only caveat is that the environment inside is very loud.
