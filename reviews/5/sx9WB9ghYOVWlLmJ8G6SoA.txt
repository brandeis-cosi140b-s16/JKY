I have now been in to eat at Red Estilo twice with my family and both times have been thoroughly impressed with the service and more importantly the food! You can taste the freshness of all the ingredients and the attention to detail that goes into each entree. My wife and I are both vegetarian, and while they don't have many options for us on the menu, they have been more than accomodating and we really appreciate that. If you are wanting a great meal for a more than fair price and want to support a local business then I would suggest stopping in and grabbing a bite.
