I am 36 years old and have been eating at Panchos for at least 32 of those years, It is really really good... It may not be authentic Mexican Food but it is still very good for what it is and an excellent value.  I always look forward to going there, and I dont think anyone should be so harsh on it, It definately beats Taco Bell
