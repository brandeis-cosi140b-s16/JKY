Found this place on Yelp while I was on vacation in Scottsdale so figured we would try it out and it was wonderful!

The service was great and there wasn't really anyone else there when we went so Arturo stopped by and offered us some of the Habanero Tequila (apparently he makes it). WOW it was hot. Not really for me but very interesting and awfully cool of him to come out and offer us some.

Food was great! I had three different tacos (Calimarii, Blackened Fish, and Carnitas) and all were awesome!. Other people in my party got blackened fish entree, the carnitas entree, the carne asada entree. Everyone was happy!

Friendly people and great food. Pricing was very reasonable too. My tacos were $2.50/$2.99 each and most entrees were in the $6-$9.50 range.

Would definitely return!
