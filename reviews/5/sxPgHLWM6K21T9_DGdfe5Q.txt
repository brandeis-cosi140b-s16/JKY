Went with a couple of my Teammates there. The food was good. They were making the burritos and Quesedillas from semi made ingredients. We can select the meat, beans, other ingredients like corn, sauce, cilantro, sour cream, guacamole, onions. The tortillas had options too - Flour, wheat, Spinach etc. The chips that come with the combo was good enough. The guacamole was fresh and good. The hot sauce was fresh and real hot. The people running were courteous and helpful. All in all this was a great place to have a tasty lunch. Will definitely visit again. Will definitely recommend.
