Tried the chicken and waffles Easter Special which was 2 chicken and waffles dinners for $20 an awesome deal..the waffles are delicious and the chicken is too...the staff and owner were very friendly and personable. The ambience was chill..I stayed and lingered for awhile taking in the Jazz that was playing and enjoying the perfect weather coming off the patio. Looking forward to coming back and trying the Mexican food options as well. Highly recommend!
