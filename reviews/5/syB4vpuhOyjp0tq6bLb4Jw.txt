It's got a lot of Mexican restaurants around Mesa beat!!!!  I usually take home about half a combo meal but this time just couldn't get enough of the flavor in the green chili enchiladas and taco in flower tortilla!  Then the chips and salsa wonderful!  We used a coupon in entertainment book.  The whole idea of coupons is to get you back!  It diffinitly will get us back as service was good and food delicious.  My husband and I kept talking about it the rest of day!  :-). From reviews I think we will stay away during live music.  Oh and loved the wrap around wall murals!
