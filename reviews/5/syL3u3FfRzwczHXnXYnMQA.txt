Went here with the girlfriend cause a friend of ours recommended it. And man was he right, the food here is amazing and they are very well known for their queso which is a MUST try!! They also have an amazing happy hour and reverse happy that serves food late and will load you up on food and drinks without destroying your wallet. Also they start you with a selection of three kinds of salsa which is a great way to begin the Mexican meal or drinks. We will definitely be back!
