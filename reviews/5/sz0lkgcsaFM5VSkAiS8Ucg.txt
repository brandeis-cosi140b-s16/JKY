Going to the airport but want to avoid crappy ass overpriced fare around and inside PHX?  Then get your ass to Pitic!

Pitic is a little spot really close to the airport that has good Mexican food.  This is solid, inexpensive, and fresh stuff!  The tortillas here are really good and you gotta support this place.  It's in a little strip mall type place - but then isn't everywhere in Phoenix like that?

Anyhow, eat at this little spot and you'll feel good about supporting a local business and get a nice filling meal that's pretty damn good!
