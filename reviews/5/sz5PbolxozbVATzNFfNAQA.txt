Entered a freestanding shack with posters & coolers in front of the windows. Opened the door to a cozy & clean dining area with folk photos on the walls & 2 fans thrumming the comfortable air. 
Ordered my preferred breakfast burrito: Chorizo, Egg, Potato, & Cheese from a smiling man who jumped to making it. Less than five minutes later he returned & offered hot or mild sauce, I went hot all the way and took the substantial burrito to go. We chatted about the summer season when business lags due to the heat. He wished me well with a smile. 
Sat down with an Iced Coffee to ingest this Mexican delight. It was way bigger than a hotdog in a bun & weighs at least  1/2 a pound. The fresh tortilla was slightly crispy & well wrapped. The Chorizo & Eggs were perfectly cooked together with home made potatoes mixed in. It tasted rich but not greasy. The hot sauce was & I used both mini cups. It was so tasty & filling that I am amazed that I had to add a tip to spend $5. I will find a reason to return to Adrian's for breakfast or lunch, soon!
