It is a rarity in Las Vegas or Henderson to find really good authentic Mexican food at such an affordable price point.  

If you want super expensive Mexican food that really isn't all that great, go to Nacho Daddy.  You even have to pay for chips and salsa, really sad.

That said, the chips and salsa (several kinds) are awesome and you are welcome to help yourself at the salsa/chip bar for as much as you want, no limit.  Want hotter salsa, just ask and you will be on fire.

The chimi, tacos, rice and beans, are the best I can find anywhere, including the entire state of Arizona.  

Awe the time problem from all those low reviewers.  Everyone is in such a flippin rush.  And again I'll say it, if you're in such a rush, go get some crappy, fake, fast food!  Everyone will appreciate that you aren't in the restaurant.  You're not going to tip anyway, so you deserve fast food.

The staff is great.  However they aren't there to kiss your ass every 5 seconds, as it should be.  

Oh, they have their own bar, so if you're into Tequila, yup, they have it.
