I have eaten here a couple of times in the last month...once for dinner and once for lunch. Both times the food was very good - we especially liked the guacamole and chips !
I had the braised tacos for dinner and the green pork enchilada for lunch and would recommend either one.
There is a very nice manager ( his name is Daniel ) that was so helpful and he stopped by to check on us a couple of times...it seemed like the wait staff enjoyed working with him and the place was high energy and fun !
