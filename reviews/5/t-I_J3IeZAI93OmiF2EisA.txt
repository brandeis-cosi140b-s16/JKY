This place is ahhhmazing! Hands down the best mexican food around. My fiancee and I come here almost every week. The owners are super nice and down to earth. You'll definitely end up waiting a while for your food, but it's obviously fresh and totally worth the wait. AND they make the best margaritas! If you're looking for some amazing authentic mexican food, you've found it!
