TThis place is just around the corner from my motel and just opened last summer.  I resisted coming here for awhile because I can get perfectly good Mexican food back home in San Diego.  But I finally stopped in about a week ago to get a lite bite before going to the movies with my daughter, just cuz it was close and cheap.  I got a three taco special for under $5 and it was perfect.  The atmosphere was nice, spacious, clean, Latin music in the background, very friendly clerks/owners.  The tacos were simple, and simply delicious. I got one steak, one chicken adaboba, and one pork.  The pork was my favorite.  I stopped in a few days later when I had to be out of the room so the maids could come in, got a Bacon and egg burrito with cheese, also under $5, and it was about the best breakfast burrito I've ever had.  I ate half there and saved half to eat for breakfast the next morning.  The reheated one was as good as the first  half.  Even home cooking doesn't get any better than this.  Both of the owners, a husband and wife team, are as nice as can be, which always makes a place more pleasant.
