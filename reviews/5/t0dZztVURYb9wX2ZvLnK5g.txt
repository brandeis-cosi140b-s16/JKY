Wow, this place was amazing. We ordered 5 appetizers (during happy hour its half-price), the Cotija Grilled Corn, BBQ Pork Cheese Crisp, Chicken and Poblano Chile Cheese Crisp, Beef Nachos, and  Roasted Poblano Queso. Each dish was full of amazing flavor. 

The Cotija Grilled Corn was honestly the best corn I have ever had, it was grilled perfectly and the cotija cheese adds the perfect amount of flavor without being too over powering. The cheese crisps both had a good balance of flavor, my favorite was the BBQ Pork which had a great spicy BBQ sauce drizzled over it and just the right amount of cheese. The Roasted Poblano Queso  was much more than your average cheese dip topped with chorizo and a hint of sweetness. 

I would recommend this place to anyone who enjoys a trendy atmosphere, and flavorful food. This is one of the few restaurants that I have been to where I equally enjoyed everything we ordered and our waiter Joseph was awesome. I can't wait to go back and try their strawberry jalapeno margarita!
