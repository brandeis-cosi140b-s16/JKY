My favorite "secret" joint for Mexican food in Pittsburgh. They need some better signage because every time I tell someone about it they respond with, "I didn't even know that was there!" Easily the best Mexican food I've had in Pittsburgh, everything is made fresh daily, the meat (7 or 8 different options) is prepared fresh right there in the kitchen, you can watch them blend the different types for different dishes, like campechano. A huge array of options from your usual taco to sopes (so good and not many Pittsburgh places have them), soups, enchilladas, the biggest, most well priced quesadilla I've ever had (they must put at least a dollar or 2 worth of avocado on it alone) and a number of dishes and platters I've never heard of until I started eating there. They aren't pricey either. The most expensive thing on the menu is a huge platter of food, and it's maybe $14. Things start around $2. The hours are cool too. Since it's right on the RED line of the "T" many workers stop to get a bite on their way home because I believe they are open from 10AM to 10PM. It's catty-corner to the coffee shop BREW on Broadway (another fantastic spot in Beechview, this one for coffee and events).  A must check out.
