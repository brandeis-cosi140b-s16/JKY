I am very sad to see such bad reviews for such wonderful and lovingly prepared food. The restaurant is very clean and the food is always fresh. I love the green chili omelet, the Chile Rolleno is exceptional, and the shrimp dish with vegetables (it is not spicy like the diablo--hmm like the devil). When they offer happy hour priced drinks they really are a great value. We try to support family owned businesses in Gilbert. Yes, the service is slow, so avoid the typically peak dining hours.
