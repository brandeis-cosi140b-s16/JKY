Love this location! Never fails me. Sometimes has their off days (flavor wise) but 98% of the time I love it! I've tried so many locations in Tempe / Chandler / Tukee / Mesa but I have never ever been satisfied! I feel like every location lacks flavor and is always dry but never here! I will continue to make the drive to this location every time now even if the closest one to my house is Chandler blvd (it sucks) keep up the great work!
