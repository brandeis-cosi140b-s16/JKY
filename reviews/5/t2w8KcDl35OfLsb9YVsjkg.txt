Excellent chicken tacos, in fact just excellent chicken in general.  The flavor on it was great and the taco shell was perfectly fried.  Also tried the chicken fries and they did not disappoint.  You can stop in the bar next door and order thru a window or walk in to the restaurant.  Either way I will definitely be back and am looking forward to trying the steak next time.  Great value as well for what you get.
