My Las Vegas Foodcation had only three stops. Emeril's, Wynn Buffet, and Tacos El Gordo.  Tacos El Gordo was my friend Jorge's pick.  He kept going on and on about how great the tacos were.  He mentioned how they had these killer asada fries and how the tacos were authentic baja style.  So before we leave Vegas, the foodie brigade and I, (Rogelio, Jorge, and Blanca) make a stop at Tacos El Gordo.  This location was in a little strip mall and not in the best area on the Strip, but maybe that made the tacos better somehow.  As soon as you walk in the chaos hits you.  There are several lines and depending what you want to order, you stand in that line and order.  You get your food and then pay the cashier.  Figuring this out was hard, thank goodness for the adobada guy.  He took the time to explain it to me and even called me Chula.  He made sure he got my full order without having to stand in the other lines.  My friend took advantage of this and made me get his order to.  The food was delicious, but the stand out for me was the tacos de lengua.  I am really picky when it comes to eating lengua (tongue), but it was so juicy and delicious I had to go back in and order some more.  Although I had to wait a bit, the adobada guy chatted me up and remarked about how the tacos would taste just that much better after my wait.  

Asada fries delicious...they have this really tasty creamy green salsa.  Tacos OUTSTANDING! oh and they have grilled green onions, jalapenos and chile g√ºeritos...not the pickled variety but the yellow ones.  No one ever has those and those are my favorite.

I looked up other locations and there are several in and around San Diego.  Next time I'm in San Diego I'm going to look one up and will keep a look out for any popping up closer to home.
