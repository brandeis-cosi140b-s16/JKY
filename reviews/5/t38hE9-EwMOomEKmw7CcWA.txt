I don't know Mexican, but I know what I like. And this is it. Also, it's cheap. Easily spend less than $7 on a meal.

I was introduced by a friend who lived down the street. He's since moved, which removed a ready excuse to visit this fantastic place. Luckily another friend has moved into the area.

I just love the flavor of of the food here, my absolute favorite being the steak huarache (avocado, lettuce, tomato, and meat piled onto a flatbread). It starts out great, but spoon a bunch of the mild salsa (true, I can't take too much heat growing up in the Midwest, but I like chunks of veggies in my salsa and the flavor more than the saucy hot) and it gets even better. The tortas (big ol' sandwich) are also good for a change of pace. Haven't been able to resist the standbys enough to get deeper into the menu so I can't comment on the burritos, enchiladas, etc but have heard good things from my friends.
