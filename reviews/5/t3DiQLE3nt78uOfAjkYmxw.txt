We've been hunting for good Mexican food since we arrived from Texas a year ago - I'm happy to say that we've now found it! Not only was the food delicious, but the service was top notch. Our waiter, Omar, took great care of us, and at the end of the meal the manager checked on us as well. Even though it's a 20 minute drive we'll definitely be back again.
