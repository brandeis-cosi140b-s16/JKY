I'm so happy that one of these restaurants have opened up closer to my house. Mexican food is my favorite and this place always hits the spot. The quality of the food is great if not a tad pricey, but only in comparison to some other Mexican places I've eaten at. But you're paying for what you get. 

First things first, the beans at America's taco shop are better than anywhere else and to make things even better, you should get them Terry's way (with onions and tapatillo). You can also order the bean burritos like this. Unbelievable stuff.

Second, their Cochata (horchata and coffee) is perfect in the mornings.

Third, try their Al Pastor, but for those of you who are not into the sweetness of pineapple mixed with the deliciousness of their pork... their Carne Asada definitely does the trick. 

Last, You've got to try the America's Corn. The best elote that you can find here in the Valley. If you want better elote, go to the Elote Cafe in Sedona.

It's a new restaurant though, and they're working some kinks out but even with the startup, I'd rather go here than any other Mexican quick fix in the area.

Worst part: The chips can get stale. Hope they work that one out somehow.
