Wow. Moved here from San Diego and have been looking for a good taco shop since. FOUND IT. HUGE burritos. Fresh tasting food and its CLEAN! Great salsa bar with carrots, grilled peppers and hot to mild salsas friendly staff and taco shop prices. Love this place. Definitely worth a try.I recommend the surf n turf burrito.
