Lina's is a diamond in the rough. At first, I was a little reluctant to try the place out because, let's be honest, no Mexican food is as good as homemade Mexican food. However, I was pleasantly surprised.

Lina's has a clean, open atmosphere. Almost immediately, my party and I were greeted and seated. Our waiter, Cesar, was absolutely fantastic about explaining the menu and very patient with us as we made our selections. He made it a point to make sure we were happy with our food and that we had anything we needed or wanted.

The food was amazing. It's about as close to homemade Mexican food as you'll get. Cesar suggested the Awesome Wet Burrito and I would highly recommend it, as well. The menu had many options and was easy to read. Everyone in my party was tremendously pleased with what they ordered. PS: The California Burrito is HUGE! 

Cesar mentioned that Lina's is family owned and operated, which made eating there more special. He also mentioned that Lina's shows UFC and boxing with no extra charges. The restaurant has a projector for the customer's viewing pleasure.

I would highly recommend Lina's to anyone I meet. The warm and welcoming atmosphere and service combined with the food that tastes like it's straight out of abuelita's kitchen were MORE than I could have asked for on my quest for good Mexican food.
