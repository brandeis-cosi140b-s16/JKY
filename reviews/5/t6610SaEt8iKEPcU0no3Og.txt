This is my favorite place for authentic Mexican food! They have endless chips & salsa but you have to pay extra for a re-fill of their awesome bean dip. They only have fountain Pepsi products but they do offer cans of Coke products. Their plates are huge and everything is under priced.  They usually have a long wait during dinner and only have a tiny area inside for you to wait.  They do have seating outside but no outside dinning.
