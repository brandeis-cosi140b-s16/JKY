I love Arriba's! We were seated out on the patio by the beautiful rock covered waterfalls!! Served promptly! I ordered the Green chile Burrito plate with Spanish rice and retried beans. The food was exactly what I expected! Delicious! My daughter ordered a coconut smoothie and it wasn't to her liking and our amazing waitress, Bailey, proactively offered her the strawberry smoothie...which tickled her little taste buds just right! Lol Bailey was very personable and accommodating as always! Great job! Just forgot our Silverware ;) I guess you can't have everything! Lol
