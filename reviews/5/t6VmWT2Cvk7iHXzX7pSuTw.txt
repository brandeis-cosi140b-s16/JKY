How does this place not have 5 stars?!?

The food is spicy like real Mexican food should be, made to order, in perfectly-sized portions, and at extremely affordable prices. The service is friendly and ridiculously fast. The space itself is enormous and open, so there's always tables available. And they almost never close. 

I've lived in Houston, Texas, Jackson, Mississippi, and visited Arizona and California several times. And I've never had Mexican as good as this little joint in Madison, Wisconsin. Go here!
