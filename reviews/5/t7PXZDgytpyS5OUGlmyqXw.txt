So far I've had nothing but wonderful experiences here. The food has been fantastic with tasty dishes and the extra large portion sizes. The service always has a smile and is quick to please.

They're happy hour deals are pretty skimpy, just draft beer or a house margarita at reduced prices, but that's no deal breaker when considering their food. I will keep coming back here.
