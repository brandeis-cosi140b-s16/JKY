The food is excellent and the best part of the restaurant is that the patio is open now!  Well that may not be the best part, but it is a welcome addition.  The fish tacos are the best I've had and you can't go wrong with the dollar tacos.  If you're feeling adventurous, order a cabeza taco... It's awesome and after all for a dollar, what do you have to lose.
