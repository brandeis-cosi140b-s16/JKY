Fun place, great food, better atmosphere!  We were recommended here by a teacher at the girls school (apparently the sister owns it) so we checked it out after church one night.
The restaurant is an order and seat yourself kind of place. The price is very reasonable, about 34.00 for a famil of 4. The food was perfectly cooked and everything was fresh and of quality ingredients.
The place was packed the entire time we were there and you could tell that it was just a great place to be. Highly recommended!

Btw: the just got their beer and wine license!
