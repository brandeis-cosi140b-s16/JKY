If there's any al pastor in Vegas that's better, please tell me right away. I need to know.

I've avoided coming back to this taco stand since last year for one reason or another, but since I'm working nearby for a little while, it was so easy to stop by Taqueria El Buen Pastor. Having learned about the standing buy one get one free offer for tacos al pastor on Wednesdays, I've been back on that specific day of the week twice now. At $1 a pop when discounted, those babies were all that I ordered, and they were all that I needed.

I'm not sure how they encase their other tacos, but the tortillas on these get crisped slightly but with minimal use of oil, if any. They're a great base for the excellent fillings. Speaking of which, you have to get the pineapples with the tacos al pastor. Luckily, the cashier has asked me both times whether I wanted it served with pineapple. I'm pretty sure they grill the pineapple up to add that extra flavor to what's already a great sweet and crunchy element. 

The meat itself is a fantasy savory, sweet, and somewhat smoky experience that works even without additional salsa. If and when you do go for salsa, skip the tomatillo salsa because it just doesn't complement the al pastor meat. Get either the spicy avocado salsa, the orange colored salsa, or perhaps both (note to self: try that next time). Just don't forget to add the onions, cilantro, and even lime to your liking. Those are essential for adding even more flavor and texture, so don't forget to stop at that metal-covered condiment station.

I told myself before that I would try their other tacos, but the al pastor tacos alone are enough to make Taqueria El Buen Pastor a must-visit. That's even before considering the BOGO offer on Wednesdays, which makes it all the better. Maybe I'll be able to justify trying the other meats if I have an interesting night in Downtown Las Vegas, but I'd be perfectly content without them.
