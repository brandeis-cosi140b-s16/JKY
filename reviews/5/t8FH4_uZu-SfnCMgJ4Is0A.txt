During the summer, their happy hour starts at 7am! Wow! We went to celebrate Father's Day and had a great meal. Between everyone in our party, I think we tried all the tacos. Not a bad one in the bunch! I loved the Barrio Chorizo one! The Chilaquiles were delicious, the bollito French toast was fantastic! We finished up with the churro desert which is what they serve at their sister restaurant Barrio Cafe. So good! The server was awesome and knowledgeable as well!
