This restaurant is close to my place of work. If I'm feeling indecisive or am short on time, this is my go-to place. They're quick, very friendly, always clean, and I love the variety of options. It's like a diner with its array of food genres from Asian and Mexican to American and classic breakfast options. The staff is very friendly and attentive. Elizabeth almost always serves me and she's never without a kind smile.
