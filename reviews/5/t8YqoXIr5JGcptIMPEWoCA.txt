I love this place!  Have tried almost everything on the food menu.  You can't go wrong it's all good but my favorites are the nachos, shrimp tacos and grilled steak platter.   If you like spicy - try the green salsa at the salsa bar.  The tequila selection is good and they have a few awesome organics.  The house margaritas are tasty and a very good deal.
