The food and drinks were pretty amazing. The octopus taco was incredibly tender and juicy! Not at all like the chewy octopus meat I've had at other restaurants. The special porchetta taco was tasty but I wasn't a fan of the pear slices inside.... Next time I think I will try the mushroom taco that everyone seems to be raving about.
My only GRIPE - and this is a BIG one - is that there is no way to make reservations online. One of the other reviewers was correct when she said that often the phone is just not picked up. Come on Tako!!! ( and your next door neighbor Butcher and the Rye)
It's the digital age. We should be able to contact you online to make a reservations. I'm busy and I don't have time to keep calling back during the day for someone to finally answer. I want to come back. Make it easier for me!
