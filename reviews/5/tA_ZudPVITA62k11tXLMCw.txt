Best place in Laveen for Mexican food!  The tacos are excellent!  The people are really nice.  The place is very clean, smells really clean.  This is as close to my grandma's house as it gets without cooking the food myself.  Anyone who differs has no real taste for authentic Mexican food.  The only food I have gotten that I was not impressed with was the tamale.  But I was spoiled, always had tons of meat in our tamales so there is never any comparison when it comes to eating other peoples tamales.  Thanks for the great experience and not Americanizing the food!
