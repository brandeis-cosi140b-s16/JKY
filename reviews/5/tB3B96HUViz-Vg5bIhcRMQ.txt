Great service. Great food. Great ambience. 

Went for lunch with coworkers and then went to their happy hour. Amazing deal on delicious cocktails. I loved their Skinny Cucumber Mules. Their appetizers were amazing! We got the seared ahi, dumplings, street tacos, spinach quesadillas, and these chips with shrimp on top of them. 

I am definitely going back to try their main entrees.
