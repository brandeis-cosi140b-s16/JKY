I saw a sign out on Southern by LA Fitness for TC Street Tacos. Now I'm a fan of the real deal little tacos, and I happened to not have had lunch yet, so I decided to make a stop in.

The place just opened up last Wednesday. The decor is simple. They basically took over the Chinese place that was there, added some Mexican flair, and called it good. Fine by me.

I got the 3 taco dinner plate. They have at least a dozen taco options. The nice girl working behind the counter recommended the marinated chicken. I went ahead and got one of those, a carne asada taco, and a pork taco (can't remember which one). It came with rice and beans, a couple roasted peppers which were nice and spicy, shredded cabbage, and sliced radishes.

All three tacos were great. I added a little guacamole and homemade salsa from the salsa bar.

I'll definitely be back again. I'm so glad a good taco shop opened up in the neighborhood.
