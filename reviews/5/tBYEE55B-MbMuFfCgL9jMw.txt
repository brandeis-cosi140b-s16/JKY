The best beef/carne possibly in the US. I've had mutliple joints in Southern California and this was my first time trying one in Arizona. I'm assuming Tex-Mex can't touch this although I'll admit I know nothing about Tex Mex. I consider that a whole different type of food. If this is the best carne in Arizona, this is just as good as it gets.
