I am here once a week. The reviews definitely don't reflect the how great Mi Familia is. I would consider it more of a hole in the wall place, but it honestly adds to the charm. Their Green Chile Pork Burrito is outstanding, and their chips and hot salsa is great too. Combine that with $1 domestic beers for happy hour, and I am one happy camper.
