This place is great!

I ate here when I was visiting friends and loved it! Such a friendly atmosphere. The workers even checked on us to see if we liked our food--something not very typical of quick in-and-out type places.

I had 2 chicken tacos and thought they were so tasty. If you're in the area, you should stop there for a quick and affordable Mexican meal!
