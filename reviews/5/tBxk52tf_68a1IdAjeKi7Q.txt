Found this gem when the other mexican restaurant down the street was closed. We got soft drinks and chips with salsa & AMAZING bean dip to start out with. As an app we ordered the Cheese Crisp and got the beef Chimichanga! Our server was hysterical and checked on us frequently. This was a great place and I would love to go back!
