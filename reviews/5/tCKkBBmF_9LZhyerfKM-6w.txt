My friend lives way out East. North East that is. Scottsdale on the boarder of Fountain Hills. This is one of her favorite places to go. I have never been till this visit.
I drove out there to find it quite easily in a nice spacious parking lot. It is beautifully decorated inside and out.
A nice man opened the door for me as I came up and said Teresa, we have been waiting for you. My friend told him she was waiting for me. But, it made me laugh. He escorted me to the booth where she waiting. 
 The server came right away and offered me a drink. I chose water and coffee. She said ,I will make you a fresh pot. Which she did and I always greatly appreciate that.
We both got the special of the day, Fish and Chips. They were wonderful!
Big pieces of cod lightly breaded and nice FF. Along with a side of fresh cole slaw made with apples. Since it was 107 outside it was divine. Our service was wonderful, she refilled our water and the other drinks always on time.
When it is cooler outside it would be nice to sit on the patio. It looked lovely. The ladies room was also, clean and nice.
I would definitely come back again.
