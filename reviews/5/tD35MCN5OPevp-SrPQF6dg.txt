I've lived in old town Scottsdale forever but somehow never made it into Barrio Queen but I'm glad we finally gave it a shot.  Had an amazing burrito and my girlfriend had something that I don't remember what it was but I remember loving the 1 bite I had.  

Great atmosphere and the service was quick.  Would recommend this place to anyone, especially for a special date night.
