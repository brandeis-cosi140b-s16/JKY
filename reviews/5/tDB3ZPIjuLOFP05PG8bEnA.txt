Really good mexican restaurant. Their lunch and dinner specials are awesome (sometimes you have to ask for the specials menu).

Great food, awesome service, unbelievable prices, very family friendly. 

Additional tip: start out with the guacamole; it's as good as it gets. Also try the free bean soup they offer as an appetizer.
