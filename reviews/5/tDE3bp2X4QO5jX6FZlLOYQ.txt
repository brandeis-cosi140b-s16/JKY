Check out their special of the day. They have a good item on sale for a dollar each day. I come here on Wednesday for the bean burritos. For just 1 buck you can't go wrong. I add cheese for 50 cents. Their red hot sauce doesnt taste good so get the green instead. Cheese quesadillas are a dollar on thursdays. Great food for a awesome price.
