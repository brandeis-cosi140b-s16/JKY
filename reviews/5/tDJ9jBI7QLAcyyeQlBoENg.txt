While visiting Arizona some co-workers of mine were recommending places to eat when the name Los Taquitos came up. With Mexican food being one of my favorite types of ethnic eats I knew while in the area I would definitely have to give this place a try and I'm glad I did.

Situated in a safe and standard strip mall sits this spectacular site sure to satisfy your stomach. I walked in to see some very nice art of what appeared to be Santa Muerte or some other skeletons on the wall and placed my order. Per a recommendation from a co-worker I ordered the "bombero pollo".  Once my order was ready it was time to head back to my office and consume this.

The bombero pollo was a chicken burrito with some hot sauce and cheese on the outside, I also got beans and rice with it. To start with the entree the hot sauce on the outside really gives this a lot of its flavor. It's fairly hot and I was warned ahead of time, but I'm no chicken, I merely eat chickens, on a burrito. The chicken and other ingridients were good, a little watery. Overall I was very impressed with the bombero pollo as the hot sauce was a great compliment.

The rice and beans left a little to be desired. These tasted worse than the ones I get at my local Mexican restaurant in suburban Chicago. I'm willing to take a stab in the dark and guess they were frozen and thawed out due to the somewhat bunchy and odd consistency of bean dip. That's not to say they were bad, just not ideal or on par with what I've had other places.

Overall, I really liked the Bombero Pollo, the hot sauce gives it a fantastic flavor. I'm a big fan of Mexican food and this place was fantastic and I would highly recommend it if you happen to be in Phoenix looking for some caliente lunch or dinner. Cinco stars for Los Taquitos.
