Monday is locals night from 12pm-12am cuts the whole bill in half. They have the best organic beers and organic gin. I come here every week to eat the chips they have. Also the salsa is off the chains. Seriously the best Mexican food places I have ever been! I defiantly recommend this to any and everyone.
