I am giving Camarones 5 stars because i feel it is the best Mexican buffet in the valley. Rand H. and I went here for the lunch buffet and I found this place to be big,clean,comfy and well decorated. The food was very good from the soup to the desert and speaking of desert they had that tres leches cake Norm R. has been raving about and now know what it is, it is GOOD.They also had good brownies ,fresh fruit and some pretty good flan.Well when i left this fine buffet i was stuffed.
