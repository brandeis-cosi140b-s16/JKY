I had heard and read about this place for months before finally stopping in for a quick dinner with friends last night. The hype is strong and that kind of anticipation can often lead to dissapointment. Not this meal.
 We arrived seperately so two of us were seated and I quickly chose to try a both a bugogi beef and spicy pork fusion taco as an appetizer and get an idea of what I REALLY wanted to order. Both tacos were fantastic...Everything a great taco should be- fresh, doubled up tortillas, a generous pertion of meat and garnished wonderfully with some fresh pico, cilantro a few strands of cris cabbage and limes. Also there was a slight tang of vinegar like acidity at the end I loved. 
 When I saw the Fusion Fries on the menu my eyes burned laser holes thru that section of the menu, only question was which of these well prepared meats would I choose. Being a risk taker by nature I inquired about the possibility of both meats but was denied by a level headed chef who probably knew better. I went with the beef and was not dissapointed. My only reservation with this dish was the fact that the shoestring fries were no match for the mountain of goodness blanketed lovingly over them. Might go with the nachos next time which my friends ordered and were anchored by the same sturdy homeade tortilla chips that were presented to us free of charge on arrival. Delicious.
 Service was very good, especially considering we had people staggering into our table at different times and seperate checks. Extremely humble spot, but clean and comfortable.
 I was on the fence between 4 and 5 stars but the prices are ridiculously low and the fact that they're bringing something different that is also family run AND homeade to a part of town that needs it? Home run.
