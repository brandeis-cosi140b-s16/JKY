I noticed a few negative reviews, but  I though they were great.   I am partial to Cal-Mex, but having enjoyed eating all over Mexico and the Southwest US and understand styles change (I tend to avoid Mex. Food that has a BBQ sauce influence)

Was driving across country (starting in San Diego), and planned for lunch in Gila Bend with Sofia's as a possible stop over.

I had the Head Tacos, and they were great ...service was good ...I wish they would open a place in MA.
