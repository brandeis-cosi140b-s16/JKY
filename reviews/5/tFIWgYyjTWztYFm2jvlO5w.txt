Still a great place to eat. A little further from Los Tacos in AJ (home for me) since Los Tacos closed, i frequent here more often..

It is good.. I want to add that their green corn tamales are GREAT!  

their Green sauce seems to be a popular choice here on YELP's reviews. I like it a lot too!

I plan to order more tamales for the holidays! hurrah!
