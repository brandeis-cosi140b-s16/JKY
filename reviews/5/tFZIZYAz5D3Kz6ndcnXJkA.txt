Although the place is a bit difficult to look at I have been coming back after my first breakfast burrito.  It's so good and a great bang for the buck as well. The staff has always been friendly even with the frustrating and less than high tech tools of the trade. (Must experience to understand) if it's your first time giving this quaint place a try, an open mind is a plus but once you taste the food it will all make sense with the bonus being the $$ spent for such a fresh taste. Even with some cons (ie: no rest rooms, parking and access is horrible) in coming here I still give it 5 stars. This place is also family friendly and really does feel, as awkward as it is, like your in Mexico :) -peace, love, explore and enjoy
