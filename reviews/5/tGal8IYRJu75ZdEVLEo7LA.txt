I am upping my review to 5 stars.  They have added green enchilada sauce, and their service has improved greatly.  I predict within a few months there will be waiting lines to get into this place as the food is A++++ in taste and homemade fresh goodness.  They now take credit cards, too.  Be sure and check the hours, because they are closed a couple of days during the week.  Plenty of parking, too.
