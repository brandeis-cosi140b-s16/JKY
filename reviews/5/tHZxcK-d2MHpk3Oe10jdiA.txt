This is a huge favorite I have been going to for years.  The dive bar next door is a great place that only serves beer, has great bartenders and sometimes rocks live music - and you can sit in there and they will bring your food over.  Or take out or dine in their area.
  Now for the food, at first all I would get was a shredded beef burrito- enchilada style.  They do it right.  Then I saw someone with a steak quesadilla one night and we have been hooked on those ever since.  And I never order quesadillas - not something I generally dig - but the way they do it - with the cheeses they use - fresh, peppery steak, epic.  Their red salsa that is on the bar - not the hot - but the one with bits of cillantro in it - I don't know what they do to that but it's just wonderful and has a great flavor.  The shredded chicked in the tacos or burritos is always flavorful marinated mostly white meat.  The fish tacos are excellent.  They also make a chicken finger taco in a simelar style to fish and it is a uniqly addictive treat - especially for late night folks.  And that reminds me - they have a midnight special- after 12 they have a list of dishes you can get that comes with two beers from next door for $5.  The best deal going anywhere!
