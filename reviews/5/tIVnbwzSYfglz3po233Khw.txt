We brought a Groupon for this place for our trip. It was a tousand times better than Chipolte's or Qdoba! There was more variety of ingrediets and choices. I had 3 chicken tacos with lettuce, cabbage, sour chrem, cheese and the hottest most wonderful salsa. My boyfriend had a grilled shrimp with peppers, onions, black beans, and tons of other things. 
We will definitely eat here when we're in Vegas again later this year.
