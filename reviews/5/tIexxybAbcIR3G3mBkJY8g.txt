I've been driving past this place every day for a year and never stopped. What a mistake. Carne asade that tastes like Philly cheesesteak meat, melt-in-your-mouth braised pollo, sinfully greasy chorizo and earthy pastor tacos for $1.25 each - amazing. And four salsas to choose from including a green tomatillo that was legitimately spicy by my standards.

The best tacos come off trucks. Count on that.
