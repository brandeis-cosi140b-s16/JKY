Bakersfield is awesome. Since it's opened a few months ago I've been there several times. I've never actually gone for dinner, but we usually end up ordering something. I've had the short rib and al pastor tacos, both of which were really good and flavorful. I'll order them again, but I want to try some of the other items as well. It's never been super crowded when I've gone in (I usually don't go until 9-10pm during the week), but I can see that it would get crowded during normal dinner hours. 

The atmosphere is also really cool. They play old western movies on the TVs and have a cool bar area. They do a different $3 shot each day of the week so be sure to check them out (they are listed on the wall in the back near the kitchen). Also, they serve $2 PBR drafts and they serve them in the coolest cowboy boot mugs! Chips and salsa isn't free, but worth it to share with the table! They usually offer two different salsas (a green and a red) and both are very flavorful. I'd prefer a spicier salsa, just not sure if they have one available, but I may ask next time!
