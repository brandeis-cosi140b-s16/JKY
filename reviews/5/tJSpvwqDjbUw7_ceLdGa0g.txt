My husband and I went to El Rico's tonight - searching for something new {and praying for something yummy}.  We have passed by El Rico's a few times since we live in the Islands and decided tonight would be a great evening to try it out.

It was obvious that the restaurant had been renovated in the last few weeks.  So in regard to any post about paint peeling and bare walls - you need not worry.  The ambience is very nice and feels very authentic.  El Rico's has a nice outside patio, and since tonight was one of the first cool evenings this fall, we took full advantage.

I ordered the #2 combo - Taco and Tostada, and my husband had two taco's {one shredded beef and one shredded chicken}.  Both of us had margaritas - and we only spent $25!!  The chips were sooo good - and the taco's were incredible!!  We decided we will definitely be going back for Taco Tuesday.  The margaritas were very good as well.  I was afraid it might be a weak margarita - but it absolutely wasn't.  I am an Arizona native, and my grandfather was 100% hispanic, so I am used to good mexican food.  This did not disappoint.  The food was not spicy {which is absolutely okay}, but did have GREAT flavor.

The only tiny criticism I had was the service.  I hesitate even saying anything because the servers were awesome.  The only challenge is that they were so busy, that they probably could have used another server on staff for the evening.  The owner was out helping bus tables and serve food, something that I always appreciate seeing.  Our food came out fast, and hot.  You could just tell that the staff was VERY busy... which isn't a bad thing for a new restaurant.
