I drove up to this place and wasn't sure I was in the right spot but then I saw a little open sign and cars kept parking and going in so I followed. 

I was tempted to get the green burrito enchilada style because everyone on here said to. And everyone before me in line was ordering it. But I had exploring to do so I figured if I got something crunchy I'd be able to pick it up and eat it in the car. 

I got back to the car and opened my rice and bean chimichanga expecting it to be a regular sized fried burrito and omg it was huge! It was topped with sour cream and guacamole  so I thought I would just cut it all up and then eat it as I drove. I took one bite. Then another. Then another. And before I knew it it was gone. And I hadn't even left the parking lot. 

I feel ashamed. My only complaint is that this place is not in Sacramento.

Edit: I went back yesterday with the mom and we got a green chili burrito enchilada style. Couldn't resist. This time we ate outside. And it was yummy
