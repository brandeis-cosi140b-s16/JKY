Had an outstanding dinner here.  The cocktails were fresh and strong.  When the shrimp with chorizo and pickled cauliflower came to the table I knew we picked a special place.  I also got a cup of soup which was very generous in the amount of chicken in it.   Girlfriend got the salmon entree and I the duck confit, it was one of the best plates that I've ever had.  
Also, very nice atmosphere.
