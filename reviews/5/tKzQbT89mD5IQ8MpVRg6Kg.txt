"Finally" would be the right word. It's "finally" for those who went to its other location, and it's "finally" for me, as I have been looking for a pizza to call my own in Madison for almost two years now. But it also isn't "finally" in that Sal's needs to get on a west side location ASAP.

I'm not into the California-style pizza with the garden on top, but their "tomato pie" (regular pie) is a keeper. It's closer to a margarita in how the cheese sits next to the sauce, and that's the real winner: the flavorful sauce. The tomato pie is very well balanced, much less greasy than Glass Nickel's and much lighter on the cheese (around the same price, not a "cheap" pie). I will still be back again and again.

Went on a Friday night and it was absolutely packed. Hard-to-get-in-and-out-of-the-door packed. Lots of sad people are going to be waiting outside in the cold this winter as there isn't enough waiting room. Lucky for Sal's, I have a great remedy: open a west side location.
