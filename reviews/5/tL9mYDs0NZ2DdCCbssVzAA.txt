Love this hole-in-the-wall just off the strip.  Can't complain about delicious and CHEAP food!!!

Big fan of the Fusion Tacos!!  I tried the Pork Belly and Beef Bulgogi ones.
Kimchi Fried Rice with Spam was very tasty but a tad greasy for me.
Chow Fettuccine was basically Chow Mein w/fettuccine... get it?

The only thing I wish I did get was the Fusion Nachos!!!!  Next time I'm back in Vegas, I will dine on this!!
