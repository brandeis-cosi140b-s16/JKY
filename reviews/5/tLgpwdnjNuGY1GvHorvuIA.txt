My family's favorite Mexican place in C-U, by far, since they were Mas Amigos at the old location on Springfield in Champaign. Bummed about the name change, but much of the food and staff is the same, and the new owner is quite visible and interested in hearing from his guests. I am absolutely addicted to the heaping bowls of delicious, hot, freshly-made-on-site tortilla chips that they deliver to your table as soon as you sit down. And the homemade salsa is amazing. Easily best chips & salsa in town, particularly compared to Dos & El Toro. And the food overall is excellent. We've never had a bad meal there. The green sauce that they make from scratch is amazing, and I pour it over everything on my plate. I finish every meal by pouring the salsa over the remaining beans and rice and shoveling it all down. Awesome. Great drink specials and atmosphere. It's not quite Mas, but Don Juan still holds my affection.
