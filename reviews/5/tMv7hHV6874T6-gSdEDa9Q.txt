When it comes to good ol Mexican fast food this place has managed to GLORIFY the experience. Flavor is excellent, menu has variety, staff is friendly, and the atmosphere is very much appreciated. The fact that they have a legitimate bar just makes the place go from good to awesome. I'm used to going to Robertos, Pepes, Tacos El Gordo etc. These places have been put on notice. Hopefully taco y taco can come to Southwest Las Vegas, because I love this place! Highly recommend you go... The elote and shrimp tacos were my favorite thing, but then again I haven't tried everything.
