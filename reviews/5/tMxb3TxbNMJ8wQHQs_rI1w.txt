Fantastic food, great service and the prices are very nice as well.  Chips and salsa are on the table immediately, drinks never go empty, and they are very accommodating to special requests (my wife likes no beans and no guac, I love it, so they put it on my plate).

Highly recommended and way better than any of those "chain" places which are just fast food in disguise.
