This is a fun place, it's huge with multiple bars and games to play. There was a live band the night I went. They also had $5 Tigers Blood margarita specials that tasted really good. I don't know how often those will be around. Try Tweeting your arrival there, you might get a big surprise like I did. Manager tweeted me back and bought me a drink
