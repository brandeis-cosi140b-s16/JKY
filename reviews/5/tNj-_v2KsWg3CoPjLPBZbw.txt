menudo menudo menudo...no I am not talking about the 80s Latin group but this hidden restaurant on University. To be honest I would have have stopped had my friend not took me there.  Small place about 12 tables inside. I almost felt like I was at my aunts house waiting for her to bring me food. Sunday menudo red or white!
