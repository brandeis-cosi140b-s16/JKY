I'm on a business trip and I want to eat some good, fairly priced food. I head to Yelp to see what everyone has to say and read through reviews and pictures. I drive the 15 mins to TC Tacos, and I am so glad I did. 
The joint looks a little sketchy at first, and the crowd is varied, (I decided to get it to-go, and eat at my hotel) but that's where the negative-ish comments end. 
The employees are so friendly. They greeted me the second I walked in. I told them I'd never been and asked what I should order. They proceeded to ask some questions about my taste preferences and where I was from.  I ended up ordering the 3 taco meal---Carne Asada, Smoked pork and smoked chicken. Ri-God-damn-diculous. 
I loved the special green salsa, the horchata (a little on the sweet side, let the ice melt or add rum!).  The rice and beans were amazing too.  
Great Experience.  Would definitely recommend.
