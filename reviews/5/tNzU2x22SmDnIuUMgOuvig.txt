This location has the best, freshest food of any Roberto's in the valley (especially if you visit between 10am and 10pm, when the couple who owns the place is working)! I highly recommend the adobada tacos. They season the pork meat themselves and cook it up perfectly. The meat is not too greasy and the flavor is amazing! Other favs include the mix burrito which I get with chicken and beans. Come here if you are looking for quality food, large portions and a decent price.
