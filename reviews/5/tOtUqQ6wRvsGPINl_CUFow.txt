Oh how I was over-joyed when my beloved Senor Taco opened a 2nd location in Fountain Hills!!

You guys/gals really do "get it right". I have made several referrals to visiting company (from out of state) and have rec'd rave reviews from them on their dining experience.


Extra EXTRA hungry? Then try the Senor Burro. I dare you. Soooo delish and sooo huge. I'm serious, that thing comes out and I swear it weighs a couple of lbs. It looks like a 2-year old's leg! Ok, so I don't eat the whole thing in one setting. I can squeeze out a good 3-4 meals from this menu must have! 

Shrimp Burrito is another fave of mine. Lovely. And the churros?? OMG... thought I'd died and gone to heaven. Those are always served FRESH out of the fryer and have the perfect combo of cinnamon/sugar. Be careful - too much enthusiasm will yield burn blisters on top of your mouth. You have been warned.
