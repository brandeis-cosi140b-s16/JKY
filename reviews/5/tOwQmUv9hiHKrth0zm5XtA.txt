"Hideaway" is the only way to describe it. Even with GPS, I had to drive by several times and finally just walked up to the door. There was no sign, and the only reason I recognized it was because there was a sign hanging inside the door with the other restaurants in the 'family's' names on them.

There was a private party in the dining room, which made it even more cramped than most people have described. We were at a ledge facing the wall in the back of the bar. The coziness didn't bother me, but I could see how it might not be loved by everyone.

I had to order the carne adovado after all the rave reviews, and it was definitely equal to its reputation. I wished I didn't have breakfast plans for the next morning, because I would have loved to have made another meal. I love spicy food, and it was definitely up there on the heat scale. My dining companion ordered the sliders and the waiter was very good about not putting chile sauce on them.

I was drinking beer, but the wine list looked good and the bar was well stocked. It was definitely worth the struggle to find it. Be patient!
