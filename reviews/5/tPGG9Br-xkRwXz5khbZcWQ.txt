We are long time Macayos customers but recently moved to this side of town so this was our first time here. I really wish we knew our waitresses name, but lost our receipt as we had a big vacation the next day. Our waitress was AMAZING. We really appreciate good service since my husband and I grew up in the industry and recognize it when we see it! So whoever our waitress was (young lady with dark hair)- THANK YOU! (In case you missed our note on the receipt). She was prompt with our order even though it was busy, but we were especially impressed with her follow up. Our drinks were never half full and she was very kind to our toddler daughter (who can earn us some assumptions eye rolls from servers these days). The food was delicious as always, but as you know the service is what makes or breaks the restaurant. We have since returned and had an equally pleasant experience but we're hoping to bump into our other waitress next time! You just don't see service that well now a days :)
