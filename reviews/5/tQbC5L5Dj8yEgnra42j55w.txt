Finally another Se√±or Taco closer to home! Clean restaurant, fantastic salsa bar (be aware, even the mild salsa has a kick to it, and even hot salsas in the grocery store are too mild for my tastes), and fabulous food. Make sure to check out the five dollar specials. Five rolled tacos and a small drink for five bucks, can't go wrong. 

Staff is nothing but friendly and the good is terrific! The only drawback? I can't find the margaritas. Have to go to Fountain Hills for them.
