Found this place on Yelp and we were in the area so we decided to stop in. The food here was excellent!! Your free order of chips includes a green salsa, red salsa, and pickled veggies. Warning: The veggies are VERY spicy. Delicious if you can handle the heat though!

For dinner, I ordered the chicken enchiladas. It comes with three and you can choose green or red sauce. I'm horrible at making decisions so I had to get both and am glad I did because they were equally delicious. I almost ate my entire plate and wasn't even that hungry. My boyfriend order the steak burrito and the steak was some of the most tender and flavorful I've ever had in a burrito.

This restaurant is one of our new favorites and will definitely be back to try other menu items!
