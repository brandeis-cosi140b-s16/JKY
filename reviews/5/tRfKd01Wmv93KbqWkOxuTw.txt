I don't know if it's this Rubio's, or all of them, but for some reason I really love this place. 

Last night I got: Gourmet shrimp taco & Tortilla Soup.
At first I was a little offended by the price, but after eating the Taco, i didn't care. I can taste the non-microwavedness of the food (freshness seems overused :). Taco was hot not warm, melted in my mouth.  

The soup tasted like it was prepared right before I ate it, in a good way.  I think they actually mix all of the ingredients in it with the base right before they give it to you, that's why it tastes so good.  And who know you could put an avocado slice in soup. Not this kid. But it tastes great. 

Not too greasy, food that's cooked right then and there so it's worth the wait. I'll go back for sure!
