In the last four days I have been here three times.  It's amazing.  The mini tacos are what I call TDF ( TO DIE FOR)  A co-worker got the nachos the other day and they almost didn't make it back to work while transporting them in the car.  Smell was that intense.  Tonight I got my usual four mini tacos and had them gone in 10 minutes.  The meat to tortilla ratio is out of this world.  I love this place.  I thank my co-workers for turning me on to the joint.  One and only one bad thing.  Pepsi products.  Thumbs down.  I just run to the QT down the street and get my diet coke.  PERFECTION!
