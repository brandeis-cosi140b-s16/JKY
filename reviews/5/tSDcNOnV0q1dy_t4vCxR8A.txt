I love Los Olivos!  It's an awesome, family run business in a cool old building.  The food is delicious!  Having been several times, I do not think that I had anything that was not good!  The bar makes a great margarita too.  My favorite dish is the shredded chicken burro with red sauce.  Its just as good as the chimichanga, but I feel much better eating it!  The cheese crisp is large, delicious, and very cheesy.  I love coming here with my family when they come to town to visit because eating at Los Olivos feels like you are at home.
