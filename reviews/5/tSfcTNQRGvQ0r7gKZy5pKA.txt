Everything was pretty good and the menu had a few different takes on Mexican food that I've never seen before. They serve a sweet salsa and a regular, but the food is still pretty good! The sopapillas were pretty damn good for desert! Margaritas were great too! It was not like a regular chain so I would definitely recommend it if you're in the area!
