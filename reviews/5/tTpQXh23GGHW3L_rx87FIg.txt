This place was awesome. We had a groupon and went the day before fathers day. It was not crowded at all. The buffet was really good. It tasted fresh. There was not a lot on the buffet but you could order plates and it was included. We ordered huevos rancheros and a fruit plate on the side. They came out fresh and super tasty. We also had about 7 mimosas each. They had 3 different kinds. I recommend the tamarindo mimosa and the glasses were so fun.It was so delish. The best part was you could barely taste the juice because it was mostly champagne. The service was really friendly even when we knocked over our glasses. I highly recommend going here.
