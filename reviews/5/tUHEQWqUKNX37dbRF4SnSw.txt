I think Jordan's is a staple for the community. It's one of those restaurants that make you feel like you live in a small town. I've been going to Jordan's since before I could walk. My dad grew up eating Jordan's with his friends and we always went here for a quick mexican bite. Now I'll tell you I didn't always love the salsa. It's strange and I can't explain why but after years and years of coming here as a kid I fell in love with it. I now probably eat Jordan's at least once a week. The food is affordable and while the service isn't "express" the wait staff is always friendly. A few of them even remember my order before I order it. For the people who think it's gross. Not every place has amazing everything. Jordan's definitely has its super star items. I always get the tamales, tostadas, open cheese crisps and flautas. As for the salsa they have the same old salsa every other place has as well. Just ask them and they will bring it out for you and if you ever have a problem talk to the sweet man who owns the place. Help keep places like Jordan's around instead of generic places like Chilis.
