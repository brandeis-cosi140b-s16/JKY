OK -- not much else to add to what has already been said, creepy looking place but knock your socks off good Mexican food.

I've driven by this place on my way to work for nearly 4 years and always thought it was a bit too dumpy even for me. 

LEST WE FORGET - the crappier looking, dingy, run down, hot, windowless, next to a bus station types of Mexican food places are the BEST. This one has all the above. Its cheap too.

I had the chimichanga with beef machaca. So freaking good. Probably the best chimi I've ever had next to Rito's, of course. But this place has better hours :)
