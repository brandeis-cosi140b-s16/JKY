Possibly the best tortas in the West Valley.  I always get the original hot Torta Paquime, which is chopped pork, avocado, and sauce on a warm torta.  I've tried a few other torta shops around the state and this one is the best so far.  The fruita drink is also outstanding -- fresh fruit blended with some sort of sweet milk.  They also have assorted gelato and Mexican pastries.
