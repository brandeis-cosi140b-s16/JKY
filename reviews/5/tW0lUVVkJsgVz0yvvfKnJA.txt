Cafe Rio has been a family tradition for me, growing up in Utah. It was the best Mexican food around up there and I I've the taste. My favorite dish is the double pork enchilada with medium sauce (it's not spicy, I promise. Just get it) all rice and no beans. I love their cilantro lime rice, and the pork is tender and sweet. They are usually friendly, but they are making a lot of orders quickly, so I can understand them being a little abrupt. Great food as always from this chain.
