Mariscos Sinaloa is awesome.  Their fish tacos and breaded shrimp tacos are amazing ($2.50 each)!  They consist of corn tortillas topped with deep-fried fish or shrimp that is so fresh and light (not heavy or greasy), cabbage, and pico de gallo.  They also have this wonderful orange colored, creamy chipotle-like sauce that is served in a squeeze bottle and is a must for the top of the tacos.  

I also really liked their ceviche tostada (a great deal...huge and $3.99), which had a ton of flavor.  

They also serve each beer with a frosted, salted mug...classy.  And, they serve margaritas (ok), and shots which look amazing.  

My only suggestion is to stay away from the smoked marlin quesadilla, but I don't like smoky stuff, so that could be why it tasted like formadehyde to me (I feel the same way about smoked salmon...sorry).

Anyway, check out this little place, because the food is fantastic!
