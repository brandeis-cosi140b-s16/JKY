Best Mexican seafood In Las Vegas hands down !!! This place is awesome in every single way shape and form !!! OMG seriously I been looking  for a place like this here in Las Vegas every time we come ... The Chef is super nice and attentive , he gave us a couple of samples of food we were unsure to order , but after we had it for sure we will order next time around , service in general is a plus , don't get fooled by the location , this spot is the place to go , " El Balazo" a seafood shooter kind of like a cocktail in a shot glass , must have ...
Come and feel confident that no matter what you order it will be amazing .
