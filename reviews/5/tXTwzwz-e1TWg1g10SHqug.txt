After trying Roberto's many times and liking it, we discovered Laurita's...it's less than 5 mins from our house.  We are HOOKED on the Carne Asada Burritos...absolutely the best we've tasted since moving here from So Cal 6 yrs ago.  The meat is so tasty, the guacamole fresh and just the right amount of pico de gallo.  The tortilla is thin, like we like it...and it never falls apart.  The salsa's at the salsa bars are fresh, you can tell they replenish them often.  Such a simple, totally yummy burrito..we go often, probably too often and hardly ever want to try anything else.
