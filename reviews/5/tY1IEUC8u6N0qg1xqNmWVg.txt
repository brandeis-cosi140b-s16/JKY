I love this place for brunch on a weekend. I have tried several things from the menu but my favorite is the Richardsons combo.  The combo adds a pair of enchiladas and asparagus with hollandaise sauce to eggs benedict jalapeno. The eggs benedict jalapeno is totally awesome, if you have not tried it your really missing out on something special. Everyone I have brought here has loved it.
