Best place around. i really wish they were 24 hrs, but that is my SINGLE complaint. give lots of hot sauce too (my girlfriend loves it). i agree with Khi, i dont think they are doing illegal things (HA HA Khi,), but there prices are so low its hard to figure out the numbers. who cares, the food is great. the carnitas is off the chain, lemme tell you. they also have menudo on saturdays (possibly sundays?) AWESOME. right on the corner of the 51 freeway and indian school rd.
