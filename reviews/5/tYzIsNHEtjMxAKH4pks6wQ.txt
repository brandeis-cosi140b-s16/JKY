This is my families FAVORITE place! We live in Gilbert, but still drive out here all the time because we love the food, and the servers. Our family of 7 can get out for under $25 if we don't get drinks and order everything ala carte. The price isn't what keeps us coming back though, it's the terrific food (and chips and salsa, i'm very picky, and it's perfect!)
