Every time my wife and I want Mexican food, this is where we go.  Everything is made from scratch, from the tortillas to the tamales.  Everything is good.

The tamales are awesome.  Not dry, lots of corn flavor.   The empanadas are delicious.  My wife especially likes the tostadas.  Good amount of bean to lettuce to queso.  I love the tortas.  Best torta I have ever had.  Nice soft bread, avocado, jalapenos, lettuce, tomato and choice of meat.   I always get the pastor because it is sliced off the spit and is mixed with pineapple.  

Everything is always fresh and the family that runs the place is always so nice.  I will always eat here if I crave some south of the border.
