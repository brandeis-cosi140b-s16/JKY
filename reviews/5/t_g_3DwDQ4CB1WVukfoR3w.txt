The best DT location in town! Old school locals know what this building used to be and we welcomed DT when it took over and decided to make its presence known (incorporating menu items from the previous business) in Vegas years ago. Yes the location is smaller but the building is older. They have never messed up my order here and it's always hot and delicious. The manager has been there a long time and gets to know her regular customers. She welcomes you like family no matter if you come inside or use the drive thru. It's crazy that a fast food place can do that but that's what I've experienced for many years at this location. On taco nights the drive thru can get backed up but it goes by quick so don't hesitate to stop if it looks long.
