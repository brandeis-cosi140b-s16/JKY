Last night, David from Taqueria Guadalajara, came to our house with his taco cart and definitely the BEST tacos in the Valley!  It was my husband's 40th birthday party, and he made this evening so memorable for us and for all our guests.  He set up and started cooking right away, was so personable to all our guests (they all asked for his card), and cleared up efficiently.  The party was so unique and special thanks to him and to the amazing food at Taqueria Guadalajara!  We look forward to having the opportunity to do this again!  Our favorite meats were the pastor pork and the carne asada.  Yum!!!
