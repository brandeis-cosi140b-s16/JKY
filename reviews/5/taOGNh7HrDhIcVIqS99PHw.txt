Place is a hidden gem! Plenty of parking spots! We were immediately greeted. Server was so friendly and helpful. She gave us suggestions and answered all our questions. I got the shrimpadilla. It was huge! Flavorful and spicy which I love! There was so much shrimp. Avocados were fresh. Pico was delicious and the salsas on it was bursting with flavor. It would be really hard to not get it again. My fianc√© got 5 traditional tacos all with different meats. Chips were crispy and the salsa that came with it was delicious and spicy. Loved it so much. Will definitely be coming back!
