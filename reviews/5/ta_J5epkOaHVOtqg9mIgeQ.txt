Dayyyum! I'm not Mexican so you could cook a cat in mole and call it authentic and I'd believe it so if this place is authentic, good for them. It's not your run of the mill taco truck kind of food. Fancy tacos that are worth the price. I'm sad I don't live closer :( but I'd travel for another of their shrimp taco. Also, I'd recommend the mole taco...everything was really good. Beware about the guacamole at the salsa bar!!! It's beyond spicy! My tongue is still recovering from the scorch. The horchata is really something you've got to try too. Prepare to spend a weeks worth of groceries kind of money...but enjoy :)
