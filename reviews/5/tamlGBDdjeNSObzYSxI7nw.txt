I promised to stop by on my way from San Diego to Utah and I definitely wasn't disappointed. The restaurant was clean and well put together. It reminded me of a homey chipotle, but a whole lot more Mexican. The food is fresh. The view to the kitchen is good. I could see workers chopping up fresh vegetables and fruits for the drinks and salsa . The cashier offered us samples of the aguas frescas, of which they have a large selection. After sampling, my wife ordered a chicken burrito with everything and a mango agua fresca, I ordered a marinated pork salad with a strawberry agua fresca. Our food was delivered to our table within five minutes of sitting down. The food was so fresh tasting and the aguas frescas blew my mind. Every bite was better than the last! The burrito was long and plump unlike the short stubby chipotle ones. My wife loved it and the red and green salsas they offer at every table. My salad appeared like something from Cafe Rio or Costa Vida, but not nearly as wilted or manufactured tasting. It was fresh! It came with what looked like an entire avocado chopped on the top, romaine lettuce, beans, the pork, rice and a green ranch sauce. So amazing! Although, I'm not a Vegas native, I can say that Frijoles is one of the best sin city has to offer.
