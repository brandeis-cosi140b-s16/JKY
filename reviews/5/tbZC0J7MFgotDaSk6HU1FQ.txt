Authentic Mexico City cuisine, especially well-represented by an array of "parillas" - chaffing dishes full of tasty ingredients, just waiting for you to assemble into little taquitos.  I loved the ooey-gooey melted cheese bowl... reminiscent of al fresco dining in Central Mexico. The Chicken Suiza was excellent, also.

Attentive service, casual atmosphere (not a tex-mex joint with lots of neon) and very well-priced, too. The most expensive thing on the menu is $14.
