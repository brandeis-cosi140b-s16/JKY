This hidden gem just opened near my office and the food is fantastic. There really aren't any good street tacos in Henderson, and this family owned restaurant is just what we needed. Staff is extremely friendly and the food is bomb. They serve breakfast too and they have specials that aren't on the menu, so there's always something new. 

I'd say it's a toss up between the chicken tacos and the al pastor tacos for best dish. :)
