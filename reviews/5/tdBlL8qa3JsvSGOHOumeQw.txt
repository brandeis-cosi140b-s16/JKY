I love their tortilla chips and salsa, they're made fresh and they're not only crispy and warm, but free! I'm addicted to their spinach enchiladas with the spicy cream sauce. So much flavor and even when I'm stuffed, I still want to eat those things. I don't drink alcohol so I'm not sure how their drinks are but everything else is amazing!!! The staff is very nice and speak English very well so I never feel intimidated. The atmosphere is relaxed. Dim lighting, nice music, the decor is appropriate and some pieces look like they are really old and handmade. Every time my fianc√® and I go, we never have to wait and always get parking in front of the building. I honestly don't know how this place isn't packed on a daily basis. Give this place a shot, you won't regret it! Perfect for date nights!
