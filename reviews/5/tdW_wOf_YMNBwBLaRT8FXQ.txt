I'm not sure if this place is called Mamacita's or Mamita's... The sign outside says Mamita's yet you could get a menu that says Mamita's or Mamacita's. No bid deal. What really matters is the food and service, right!?!?!

When I walked in to the restaurant, I was quickly transported back to my childhood when I visited my abuela's house. It smelled like her house and was decorated just as gaudily with knick-knacks and other various decor. Right away I could sense some authenticity.

Food was great! It did take longer than I am used to, however I do believe Cuban food that is prepared properly will inevitably take time. The waitress happily substituted the fries that came with my meal for the platanos. When I got my meal, it looked as though I was given a whole banana. Everything was cooked properly and seasoned well.

The service was good. The waitress was attentive enough. If we needed her, she was there. She was pleasant. No complaints here.

I will definitely be going back!
