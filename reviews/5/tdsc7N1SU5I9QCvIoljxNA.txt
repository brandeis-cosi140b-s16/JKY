The smell alone deserves a 5 star rating. Just finished up my free bueno birthday meal and it was Yummy like always. Can't go wrong with the bueno style burger, lobe the jalapeno relish. My wife tried the Glendale style style today with green beef chili on the burger. Some more tasty stuff. Bueno is right up there with Lennys as the the burger of the west side
