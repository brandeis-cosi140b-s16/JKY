I love food stands. More importantly- I love food stands conveniently located outside one of the coolest gay bars in town.

While I'm not a frequent visitor of Charlie's the cowboy gay bar, my brother is. And while he's trying to find his designated buyer for the night, I'm usually standing in line for tacos. 

You can order food from inside Charlies. They open a door/gate where you can give the nice lady your order and voila... tacos! You can't order any drinks from here though, its an agreement they have with Charlies so don't even try!

The food is way cheap. $1 tacos, $4 burritos, nachos, $3 quesadillas and the food is grilled right there! You can eat by the stand if you want. There are benches and heat lamps for the winter nights.

I drool everytime I'm in line, smelling the carne asada and pollo on the grill. The place is clean and I even if it weren't I would still eat it!

Don't forget that its cash only and if you're planning on going back to Charlies, make sure you make it back there before midnight or else cover charges are in full effect. But if you can't make it back into the club, you can always eat yourself crazy at this taco stand.
