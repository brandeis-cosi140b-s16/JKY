This is my first yelp review!  I figured I should start with one of my faves.  My family and I have been coming to Ajo Al's for as long as I can remember (and I've lived here for over 20 years).  We frequent the location in Agua Caliente, as well as the location near Via Linda Lanes.  Sometimes we choose to have dinner in the bar so we can watch whatever sports game is on tv at the time. 

Ajo Al's is amazing.  If you like spicy, make sure to ask for both the "hot and the green salsa" when they put chips and regular salsa on the table.  My favorite dish there is the Pollo Con Queso!! SO GOOD!  And it's big enough to split with someone because it comes with rice & beans.  Wow I need to eat lunch right now, thinking about this is making me way too hungry.
