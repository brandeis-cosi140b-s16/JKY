So so yummy.  I had the tostadas con pollo on my first visit and was amazed at the huge portion I received.  It was just supposed to be a snack but it ended up being quite a lot of stuff piled onto a perfectly crispy little tostada.

The next time I went, I had the tacos de ribeye.  Really amazing little tacos, perfectly cooked meat, and great toppings.  It's hard to find stuff this good and this cheap that has consistency and cleanliness, freshness of ingredients, and great personality.  ESPECIALLY out in the suburbs.
