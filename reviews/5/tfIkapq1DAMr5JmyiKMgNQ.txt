I work across the street from this place and we've been waiting for a good Mexican food place in our neighborhood. We frequent the other establishments in this neighborhood for lunch and this is by far our favorite.

They have really good food, the prices are more than fair, it's very clean, and a smiling face always greets you at the front door!

The California burrito for $4.80 is awesome and at least one of our employees has one every day.
