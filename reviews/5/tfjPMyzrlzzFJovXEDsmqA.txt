Oh, the carnitas. I mean, come on. How can pork simmered(usually in lard) NOT be delicious. Exactly. For some reason, the last two times I've gone to La Mestiza, they've had carnitas as the special, and I can not refuse. Mmmmm, tasty. 

I've been looking over a few reviews, and yes...the prices are a bit high, but we ALWAYS take home part of our meal. The portions are large. Also, I have found Dine Madison and Groupon deals for this restaurant a few times now, which basically means half price tastiness opportunities abound.
