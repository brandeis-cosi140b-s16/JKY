Went here for dinner. Ordered the Tamale Platter, excellent. Also, the dos enchiladas verdes were delicious. Chips were fresh and salsas were tasty.  I loved this place, great atmosphere and our server Benjamin was Great!  We will be returning next time we are in Vegas.  highly recommend this restaurant.
