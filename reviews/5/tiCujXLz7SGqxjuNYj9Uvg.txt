If you are not drinking a $3 margarita, you are wasting your damn life child...

If you are reading this because you haven't tried Carlito's Burritos yet, I am hear to tell you that you are in for a treat.

They are not like to typical joints around town. They are well made and packed with bright flavor.

The staff is amazing and friendly. They will help you sort through the menu options and plan your way through a fantastic meal.

The environment is comfortable and fun. I always find myself chatting with strangers and sharing tables with first timers.
