I lived in Mesa for 8 years and san diego for 4 years and left there to the midwest to live closer to family and as wonderful as the midwest is, it is severly lacking authentic mexican cuisine. When I go to visit my family in AJ, this is BY FAR the best food and service I've ever encountered in a 'taco shop' down south. They are immaculately clean and cook fresh to order. This will always be the place we will visit for our mex food cravings when we visit.
