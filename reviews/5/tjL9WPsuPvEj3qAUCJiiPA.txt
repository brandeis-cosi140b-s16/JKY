Great food in a nice setting where Nimbus Brewery used to reside.

I had the carnitas and it was top notch and I liked the 4 sides with it.

Kid's food was really good - tried the steak taco - great portion size.

Excellent salsa and chips before ordering (free).  Margaritas were expensive at $10.50-$14.

Outdoor dining too.
