OMG OMG OMG. I love this place. We come here every year after our Bike event with a staff of 20-25 and they are always very accommodating. The cheese dip with jalapenos is to die for and the tortilla chips are crispy and warm. 

I love that they have so many options for combinations, salads, soups, ceviche, etc. Everything I've eaten here is simple and delicious. The skinny margarita is also delicious.
