I live in California but when I come to visit my in laws this is my FAVORITE place to go. The food is all so fresh and a lot for the great price and my kids enjoy the environment and they get to make roll out their own tortillas great fun and great food for everyone. Thanks Fajitas for always making me want to come here every time I visit Phoenix :)
