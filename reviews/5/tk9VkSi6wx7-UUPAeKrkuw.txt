Great food, service and well priced. 

The salsa is the best in town, hands down. We usually get the 'to go' special and it comes with chips and they always give me a little extra of their homemade salsa. We think they have the best tacos, too.

Dine in service is always great with prompt refills on chips and drinks before you have to ask.
