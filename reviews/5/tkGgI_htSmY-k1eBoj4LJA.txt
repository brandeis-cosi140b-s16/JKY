There is lots to love about this place, and I want to start with the service, attentive, friendly, and gracious. Our servers took such great care of our big table on monday night, that I have to give the place 5 stars before even one plate of food was served.

About the food we planned the visit around Cien Agaves terrific Happy hour, so there were lots of tico tacos $1.50 ea and half price appitizers on the table, rounded out by a few entrees. Everything I tasted was delicious, especially the Chicken Quesidilla. Normally I would skip a chicken Quesidill on almost any menu, but I am so glad I didnt this time. Just the right mix of seasoned Chipotle Chicken and Cheese in a huge folded and grilled tortilla, with sour cream. This is by far the very best restaurant quesidilla in town. Everything served was great, and raves about the food came frome everyone.

They have great drink specials during happy hour as well, including 1/2 price margaritas and special priced beers. It's the tequilla selection that is special though. It's an amazing selection of some of the best tequillas in the world. You can even try some tequilla flights!

Inside the place is funky/cool, super clean, with some really cool art and lighting.
In Old Town There are some real GEMS and a few DUDS when it comes to mexican food, but Cien Agaves might just be the very best choice for Mexican food in Scottsdale.

I MUST SAY TO MY FELLOW YELPERS---GIVE THIS PLACE A TRY!!!!!!!!!!!!!
