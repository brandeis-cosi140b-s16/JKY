I am a sucker for Mexican food and any time I can't figure out what to eat it's my goto. I've always said it would be amazing to have a Mexican place that delivered and have never thought to look into it because you just don't see that often. After browsing on yelp for something new to try I came across cafe casera and saw that they delivered. I was so ecstatic that I looked no further and knew I had to try it. My food came super fast and is all extremely delicious. I ordered the chips and salsa and the chicken tacos and I really have no complaints at all! The pricing is great, food is great, and they deliver!!! I will definitely be ordering again!
