I love Z' Tejas!  They always have prompt and friendly customer service.  I also love their cornbread!  I went here for my sister's birthday on Halloween.  I tend to be a bit of a goofball, even in public, lol.  I used their candleholder as a hat, and instead of getting mad about my unconventional table manners, our server laughed with us.  The servers and staff treat you right, they don't expect you to be the overdressed over done-up folks that feel like they need to spend 3 hours getting ready in order to come to the mall.  They treat everyone the same there, even if you just worked 12 hours, and show up in your work uniform, like I did that day.  Relax, go to Z'Tejas and enjoy a drink and some food!
