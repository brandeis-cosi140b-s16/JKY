Great seafood restaurant with traditional dishes. I highly recommend  the aguchiles and their micheladas. The majority of their food is prepared spicy, but you can ask them to calm it down a bit. They have large platters that are great to share with groups of 3-4 people. Awesome staff and great evironment. Also your first 3 beers are only a dollar, can't beat that deal!
