What an Amazing  Truck!!

First off, my friends and I were running a little late and we were worried that we were going to miss Sloppi Jo because they were only scheduled at Sapphire till 3am. We arrived in the parking lot 3 minutes till and it was difficult to park because of all the choas going on with the taxis. However when we walked up to the truck it seemed  as though they weren't leaving any time soon. 

I order the Sloppi Jo. This is definately a different twist than your average "sloopy joe" hence the different way of spelling they use and the owner even warns you ahead of time. The pork was very tender and well seasoned and cooked in this New Mexican type sauce with an egg all in a warm tortilla. Very pleased, can't complain. The only thing I could ask for is maybe if it was a little larger, I mean $6 is pretty standard, but the size did not match up to it's price.

My friends shared the pork tacos and said they were delicious. 

The amazing factors
1. It was pretty cold and one of my friend didn't have a jacket on and the owner brought out her own coat for my friend to wear while we were eating in front of the turck. 
2. She gave us free sopapillas, which I think was probably the best thing we ate from the truck. I've had never had them before, but boy were they good. If only the honey butter was a little bit more spreadable. 
3. While waiting for our food, I noticed a man next to us asked for a water cup. They didn't have any so she just gave him bottled water. That is really thoughtful of her rather than saying "we only have bottled water for $1." 

I can probably say this is the best costomer service I have ever experienced in my life.

Must try, 2 Thumps up for Sloppi Jo's!
