Had a great experience even though I read a couple of reviews I decided to try it out and make up my own mind. I got the beef tacos and a chips with dip; it was great I was a little taken back by the price but when I saw the portion it was well worth it. I would recommend to anyone on the strip looking to get there money's worth.
