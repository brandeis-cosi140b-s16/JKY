The two comments below are very inaccurate and should be re-evaluated. With that said, this location and its staff is AWESOME. They were very friendly to me and my family. Since the location is new, everything is clean and very presentable. I work at another Chipotle store, and I like to go around giving genuine Yelp ratings on other Chipotle stores. It's all based on their cleanliness, hospitality, and performance- this Chipotle store exceeded my expectations.
