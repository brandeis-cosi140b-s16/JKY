Hometown Dogs is great!  The Hotdogs are fresh and extra large, the homemade tamales with toppings of your choice are a special item I LOVE when they have them available. The Salsa is so darn good we have to buy every member of the family their own container or we fight over it! You gotta try it! They spice it to your liking right on the spot!  Just go there! you will see!
