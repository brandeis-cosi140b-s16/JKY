Tasty! I enjoy the Americano Burrito and cheese enchiladas. I didn't like the Burro that much, but that's my personal preference and I probably wouldn't like it anywhere. It's 24 hours, it's got a drive-thru. It is very convenient. It never seems to take very long to get my food. The location is good, too, like if you needed to pick up some things from Safeway and then swing through the drive-thru, it's very easy and convenient. Their salsas are very good and remind me of New Mexico chile. They add a 50 cent charge to use cards, so if you have cash and want to save a little going there, that's the way to go, but it's relatively inexpensive anyway.
