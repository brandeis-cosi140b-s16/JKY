AMAZING!!! We were driving to another Yelp find and saw the food truck.   We immediately flipped a 'b$tch' and parked.  The menu was short and sweet, just the way they should be.  I don't get when food establishments have a million items on their menus, how can you possibly prepare those perfectly every time?  It's not happening!! Every taco we ordered was made to perfection!  

I'm on the move so I'll finish this review up in a bit..my pics tell the story of what my mouth and belly so lovingly devoured!
