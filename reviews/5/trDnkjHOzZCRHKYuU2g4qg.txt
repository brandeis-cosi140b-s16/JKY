This is one of the times I really wish we could do half stars, cause 5 stars should only be for perfect meals and it wasn't quite there, but it was close.  A definite 4.5

From reading the other reviews I kinda wonder if this is the same restaurant.  We called 45 mins in advance on restaurant week, and they said no problem.  Place was packed when we got there, but we were seated right away.  Chips, salsa, and water almost instantly.  We were obviously wanting drinks, so our waitress asked quickly, but it took us a while to decide.  She came by 3 times before we were ready.  Finally said Partita Margaritas for all.  Sweetened with agave nectar, so not too sweet and better for you.  We had the table side guac, that I thought was pretty tasty.  Was hoping for a performance or something of the sort, but was still nice.

I had the tortilla soup, good, but not memorable.

As per entrees.  I sat and looked at all the taco's over and over.  I wanted to do the mix and match of 3, but everybody else at the table was doing that.  Knew I could just poke at those.  I went for the Salmon with Manchamantel Sauce.  Never heard of it before, so what the hey.  The sauce was simple but spot on.  A kind of fruity puree with adobo sauce.  SPOT ON!  The salmon was tasty but a hair over salted.  No consistency between every body's sides.  Corn with queso fresco was awesome, plantains were pretty good.  Red chile rice and beans were good also.  They messed up on the cole slaw.  no papaya, very little pineapple.  Mostly just raw cabbage.  Have had better at crappy hot dog carts.  The sauteed greens were so salty there were barely edible.

Then dessert, OH YEAH!  Not normally my thing, but i did the restaurant week deal and nobody else did, so figured I'd share.  Mango crisp was like grandma's apple pie with Hagen Daz ice cream.  Highly recommended.

A little pricey for Mexican, but you can get out pretty cheap compared to the rest of the epicenter.  A must try if your in the area.
