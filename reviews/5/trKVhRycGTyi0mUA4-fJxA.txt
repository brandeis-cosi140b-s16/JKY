As many know who live in Las Vegas restaurants come and go.  I am always hesitant to try out a new place especially one that is not a franchise.  After many months of passing by this place with it's one banner and little sign at the door and reading previous reviews, I decided to try it out.  Wow!!! Yum!! What they lack in atmosphere they make up for in service and food.  The waitress is one of the kindest I've ever had.  She's not afraid to suggest one of their better options, though it's all good, she didn't disappoint.  The chips, salsa and guac are delicious and fresh and they do free refills of chips and salsa!  The specials are unbeatable only $5.  I recently had the Chicken Enchiladas which were filling.  I also had a churro for dessert which was better than Disneyland!!  For three people the bill was ONLY about $20!!! I will be going back tonight to try their other appetizers and entrees :)
