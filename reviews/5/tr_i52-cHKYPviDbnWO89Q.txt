When you bite into a burrito from Frijoles & Frescas, it's exactly what you'd hope a Baja Fresh burrito would taste like...but Baja always sucked!  Frijoles & Frescas nailed it!  You can really taste the freshness of the ingredients.  I don't think their tacos are anything to write home about, but they're simple, fresh and hit the spot. Try the Aquas Frescas...it'll change your life!  The house salsa provided on the tables is soooooo good, I wish they bottled it for sale!  

Even though there's usually a little bit of a language barrier with the cashiers, their service is always super smiley, and to me that's the cherry on top!  

This location is usually pretty slow, but I really hope they do well as more and more people discover the deliciousness that Frijoles & Frescas has to offer.  Yum yum!
