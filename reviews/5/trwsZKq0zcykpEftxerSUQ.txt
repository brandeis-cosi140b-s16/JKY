I've read all the reviews for this food truck and decided to try it out for myself!  When I walked up to the truck, I was greeted warmly by the owner and chef and when I got my food, WOW, incredible flavor and complexity to these korean tacos!  I experienced a multitude of sensations like savory, sweet, spicy, crunchy, juicy all in one bite!  And then there were Crazy's Sweet Dough!  They remind me of Hawaiian Malasadas, except smaller.  They were soo oo delicious and sweet!  Keep up the great work Hanshik Taco!  I don't see where the negativity from other reviews apply here!  Stop hating, people!
