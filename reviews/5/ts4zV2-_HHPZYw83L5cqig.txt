This place is dope.  This is what Moe's/Salsarita's/Qdoba/Chipotle wishes they were.  Everything Ive gotten so far is great and the girl at the counter from Mexico is really friendly and knowledgeable.  My only knock is that some items could be cheaper, but we're not in Tijuana so I get that a novelty street food concept in NC can never be as cheap as real street food south of the border.  Props to offering real Mexican Coke in the tall bottle.

Stop here if you haven't already.  Be prepared for it to be busy any night of the week at any time.

YUM!
