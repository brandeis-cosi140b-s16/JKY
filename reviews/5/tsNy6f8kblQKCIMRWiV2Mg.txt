I had about a 2 hour layover while on my way to Chicago.  Was starving so I started to walk around the terminal for something decent to eat.  If I looked for something not overpriced then I would have died of starvation. 

I love Mexican food, when I walked by Sir Veza's I saw that they had burritos and one of their special was the chorizo and egg breakfast burrito ($9).  It had egg, potatoes and chorizo.  It was actually quite good.  The burrito was about 7" long and 3" wide and 2/12" in diameter.   Very flavorful and filling, it did not feel like I was eating a brick of fat. What was so great was it only took less than 5 minutes for me to get my burrito and they have free cups of iced water.  Win, Win!!
