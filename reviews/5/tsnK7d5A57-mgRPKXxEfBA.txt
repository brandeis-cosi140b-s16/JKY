This food is delicious and filling. The prices are amazing for Vegas. And the girl behind the counter is super cool! 

I ate here pretty much every day I was in Vegas. The bean burrito is cheap and huge! The chile relleno is delicious. And you can wash it all down with a big cup of horchata - the most delicious thing from Mexico since Salma Hayek!
