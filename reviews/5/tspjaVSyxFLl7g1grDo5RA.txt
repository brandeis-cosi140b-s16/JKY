Great service, location, and atmosphere. The wait staff was very helpful. I love how it's connected to the pool of the Graduate.

The tacos were really impressive. The guac is great. I also had a horchata slushee that can be served with or without alcohol. I think all horchatas should be served in slushee form now.
