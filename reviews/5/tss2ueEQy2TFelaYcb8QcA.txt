Got yelp solely to tell how awesome this place is. Fantastic place with tons of old cars and signs. While the pizza and food was great, the staff and even the owner, Rand, made the experience worthwhile. The whole restaurant is full of stories from the influence for a van in the movie CARS to the episode on American Pickers, this place is a can't miss stop. We drove an hour to visit and I imagine we will be back in the near future.
