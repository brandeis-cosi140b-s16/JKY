We have been to Ajo's several times now and i can honestly say i cant remember any thing bad, i must say not perfect but definitely better than Macayo's.  we have found sitting in the bar area is a lot more peaceful then in the main dinning area.

Today we split a chicken/beef fahita, which is honestly enough for 2 people, taste was good, and our server Alexa was prompt, for a busy Friday night.

We have tried several item in the many visits, fahita's, cheese crisp , burro's and can honestly say it all has been good.

When we are in the Arrowhead area of Glendale this is a usual choice of ours.

worth a try
