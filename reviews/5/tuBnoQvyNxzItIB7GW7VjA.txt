Best shrimp tacos ever! Best cerveza preparadas ever! Awesome service! Nobody ever gives me a hard time for not speaking Spanish.....probably cuz I'm Asian. There are places that expect me to speak Spanish cuz they assume I am Latina but it's all good over here.

Their fish and shrimp tacos are battered and fried, served with shredded cabbage, pico de gallo, and a white cream sauce with a lemon wedge. If I can recall they are huge and cost about $3 - $3.50. Not bad at all cuz they are not greedy here. The campachana cocktail with shrimp and octopus always tastes so fresh. I have yet to find it better anywhere else.

Their cerveza preparadas are made with a concoction of shrimp stock, lime juice, hot sauce and whatever beer of your choosing. They are served in a frosty goblet that makes the beer so delicious on a hot day, after a long day at work, after a long night of partying--the morning after of course, or just any old freaking time they're open. The first few sips have that icey layer of frost on them that I just love so much. Almost like a beer slurpee, kinda....not really. Just go there and get one. Only then will you know exactly what i mean.
