These are the best tacos I have ever had. I had the tacos de lengua, adobada, al pastor, and carne asada. They were all delicious, with lots of flavor, and their own unique sauce for each meat. 

The carne asada fries were so good. They actually put carne asada not like other places. My wife and I shared the small size and it was more than enough. 

My favorite was adobada. It was full of flavor and really good sauce. The lengua was perfect, which I have a really hard time finding. Their al pastor was bomb with a really good sauce to go with it. 

This place is legit, and a everyone needs to try it. The line is long but worth it.
