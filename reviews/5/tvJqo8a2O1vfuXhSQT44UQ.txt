I love El Molinos!! Their breakfast burritos are my favorite! My definitely my go to place for mexican food and THEY DELIVER! Thats right Mexican food that delivers. The food is pretty authentic, which is rare to find in these neck of the woods. 

I wish I could of taken a pic of how the food is packaged for delivery. I mean everything is sealed, taped and packaged very nicely and professionally! No messes, no forgotten items, LEGIT PACKAGING! Which to me is a big deal means they really care how your food is delivered! 

Again highly recommend this place for eat in or delivery! You guys rock!
