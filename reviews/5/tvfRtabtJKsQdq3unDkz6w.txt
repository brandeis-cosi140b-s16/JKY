By far the best Rubio's we've been to. The food is perfection here at the Riverview location. 
I've been to other locations and the burritos never come close. Usually, you get too much filler in the form of rice and beans with sparse protein. If I wanted that, I'd go to Chipotle! 
Riverview Rubio's definitely packs the meat into their fare.
 My favorites are the shrimp or chicken burritos and the salmon or ahi tacos. Enchiladas are okay too.

Service is always the deciding factor for me though and the staff and manager John are definitely ahead of the pack!
