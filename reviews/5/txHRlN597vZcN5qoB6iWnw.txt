I'm not a big yelper and usually only write reviews when something blows me away and this place did!  My wife and I were in Phoenix for a few days and lucky for us Barrio was not far from the hotel we were staying at (Embassy Suites).  This was such a great experience.  The food was amazing, service was great and the Micheladas were out of this world good!  Also, they had a couple guys playing some live music(if anyone else was there 04.04.15 please message me who they were, would like to buy/download some of their music if available).  Overall great restaurant and highly recommended!
