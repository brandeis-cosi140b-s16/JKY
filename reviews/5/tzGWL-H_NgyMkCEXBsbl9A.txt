Always my favorite lunch hangout! They have a solid staff who always greets you as you walk in and the food is to die for! I have tried quite a few things off the menu never to be dissatisfied. Our server is prompt, very courteous and always remembers our drinks and even our favorite menu options. Then there's Stewart who does their marketing and always comes out to say hello and see how the service is. Overall I give them an A+ and will frequent them until my weight says otherwise! ;)
