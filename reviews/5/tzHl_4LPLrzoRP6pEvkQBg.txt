I went here on Sunday with a friend. MMMmm good! I ordered the steak fajita quesadilla. It was actually good quality chargrilled skirt steak. Not like the bland  itty bitty mincemeat somewhere like Filibertos serves. He ordered the steak fajita burrito. Oh My! It was so huge he could barely finish it! We shared the queso dip. It was my really good. It was white, creamy and flavorful. I favor white queso dip over the nasty yellow/orange queso dip that some restaurants serve. Everyone from the register to the kitchen cooks were pleasant and cheery. We will definitely come back!!
