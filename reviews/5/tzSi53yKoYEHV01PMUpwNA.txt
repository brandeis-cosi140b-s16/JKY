My husband, son, a girlfriend of mine and myself went here for lunch today no wait time when we walked up at 11:45 we originally wanted to go to lo-lo's chicken and waffles but it was a hour or more wait and didn't want to wait that long so went to barrio's instead and was very satisfied with what we got. All of our food tasted delish, the price was not bad at all for 4 people it came out to 48 bucks. My son is a picky one and will not eat a quesadilla unless it's very minimal cheese and that's what I asked for to begin with and the first one came out with a ton of cheese when the waitress saw my son not eating it she offered to make a new one and felt bad so she went ahead and brought him another one that was perfect so it was nice to get that kind of service. 

Very satisfied and will go back!
