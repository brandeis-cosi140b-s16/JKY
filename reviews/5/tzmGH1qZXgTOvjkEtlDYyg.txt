I left Los Cabos 4 hours ago.  Four.  And I can't stop thinking about the salad.  What's WRONG with me?

The salad in question is the Surf Salad - a combination of grilled mahi mahi, shrimp, avocados and so much deliciousness.  Each bite was better than the last.  Get the dressing on the side - fifty bucks says you won't even touch it; the salad is that good alone.  My mum ordered the fajita salad with steak and was equally impressed with hers. 

So - BYOB, amazing food and delightful/fast service.  I'm not sure what else to say. Can I become an investor in Los Cabos? Can I marry the cook? Can I move in upstairs?  Eh, I guess I'll just settle for dining here as often as humanly possible.  Da-a-a-mn.
