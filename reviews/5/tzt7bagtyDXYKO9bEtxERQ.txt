I can't tell you enough just how good this place is. Since it opened, it has definitely become one of my favorite go-to spots for a good bite to eat in East Valley. Lots of the Mexican food I've had in the valley is bland and lacks flavor - Julia's seasons the meats just right. That, and they're awesome salsa bar with other condiments makes it awesome.

Long story short, you get amazing food, huge quantities, at a solid price. Definitely love this joint and highly recommend it!
