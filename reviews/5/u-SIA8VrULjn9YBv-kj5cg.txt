Great go to lunch spot.  More authentic than the typical Mexican restaurant in Phoenix.  You know you're in good shape when you are asked, "Corn or flour?"  And "Red or green?" for hot sauce.  Salsa is available at the counter.  Drink options include watermelon, melon, horchata, soda, and water.  The menu offers 23 numbered lunch options six numbered breakfast options and an array of a la carte options and sides.  The TV is always in Spanish and the walls display paintings with optical illusions that blend in with the decor.  Look for Taco Nazo next to the REI.
