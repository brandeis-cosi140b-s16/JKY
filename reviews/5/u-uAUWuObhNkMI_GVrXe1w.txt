Nothing beats seeing homemade fresh tortillas made right in front of your eyes.  Barbocoa and bean and cheese are my favorite tacos here.. on flour tortillas.  Employees were very friendly and helped me feel comfortable and safe with the staff.  Will be back to try some other menu items.  My only issue is that is is a bit far from where I live and work but I do go by on Camelback from time to time.
