We visited De La Cruz a few weeks ago, almost by accident. I had been passing through Gold Canyon and decided to grab lunch in the area. I noticed De La Cruz hidden at the end of the little strip mall. Being a sucker for a hidden gem or little dive I had to know about De La Cruz so we headed over at dinner time. 

Our first impression was that the service was incredible. We were seated outside on a quaint little patio and greeted by our waiter who turned out to be the manager who has worked there for over 10 years. He told us about the great happy hour options and was well versed on the menu and willing to make suggestions without being pushy. 

We were anxious to see if the great service and lovely setting would be followed up with delicious food, and it WAS! 

Being a latino/american family it was a WIN/WIN/WIN for us and De La Cruz has risen to the place of 'favorite mexican restaurant'!

Please keep it up De La Cruz!! I want to keep this secret to myself so we don't have to wait for a table, but everyone needs to know:)
