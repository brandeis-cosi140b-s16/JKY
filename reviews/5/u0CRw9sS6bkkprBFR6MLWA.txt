yes yes and yes. I have been CRAVING this place since eating here with my bf. It is astonishing to me that there are only 3 stars on the company profile. Jose Andres can do NO WRONG in my book.
Started our meals out with a few yummy cocktails. I got the Margarita with a "salt air topping" wow. I could have had 4 of these, but decided I actually wanted to remember my meal so i refrained. Its your typical Margarita with tequila and fresh lime juice and agave, but topped with a salt foam. Great presentation I may add.
We had no clue what to order so we ordered a few items to share. We had a friend join us so between 3 people, this is what we had
Ensalada Gaspacho Estilo De Morelia; an amazing salad consisting of pineapple, dragonfruit, mango, jicama, queso fresco, and a  chile pequ√≠n 
Tuna Ceviche minus the pecans 
Cctel De Camarones; =shrimp, jumbo lump crab meat, tomato, and diced avocado 
Shrimp Mojo shrimp in a sweet black garlic sauce with roasted poblano peppers 

....and the best thing ive ever eaten

20 vegetable with friend rice. OMG. this is a vegan dream with so many different veggies all grilled served over rice that seriously melted in my mouth. I cant wait to go back to this restaurant and have 2 orders of this...

This restaurant has a very interesting concept. Asian Fusion meets Mexican. I really enjoyed these two combined. The service was impeccable, I wish I could remember my servers name but he was so awesome. With so many restaurants in the Cosmo to choose from, I highly recommend trying this place.
