Hands down, the best Mexican restaurant in Charlotte!

We came here on Friday afternoon for lunch for the first time. This little gem is located in a small shopping center off of Central. Doesnt look like much of a place, but the food is absolutely amazing!

Since margaritas are on special on Monday for $5, I decided to splurge on the drink the size of my face. (My husband got a XX). Usually, house margs are just ok. However, this house margarita was absolutely perfect. My husband took a sip and agreed. Get it and you wont regret it.

We both ordered off the lunch menu. I ordered the one taco one enchilada. I got the chicken enchilada roja and a beef taco. My husband got the Jalisciences (which, btw, he completely botched pronouncing!). Usually Mexican food kinda all tastes the same to me. However, both of these dishes had very unique flavors and tastes. The sauce on my enchiladas was absolutely perfect! Also, my husbands dish had a side of steak....yes, you heard me, side of steak! Both of our dishes were great, but I think his in the end was the winner.Bonus: Both meals were under $10!

Next time I get a Mexican craving, I know exactly where to head to!
