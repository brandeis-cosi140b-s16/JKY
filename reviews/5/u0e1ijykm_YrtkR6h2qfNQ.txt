I love Taco Bell, especially when I just want something quick.  I've been to a lot of different Taco Bells, but this one just became my favorite.  The staff was SO nice, and they made it a point to use each customer's name and to (sincerely) thank them for coming in.  The place was clean and well-stocked.  I was in over lunch and they were very busy, but all the employees had smiles on their faces.  The personal touch was great!
