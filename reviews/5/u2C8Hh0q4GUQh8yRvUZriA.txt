I drove passed a few times and thought to myself, "how long has that been there, and why haven't I tried it yet?" Well, today was the day. The guy at the drive-thru was friendly and helpful. I had the Standard burger with cheese and added on grilled jalapenos and bacon. I couldn't help but order the salted caramel - dulce de leche milkshake. I couldn't drive home fast enough to have a fat kid moment on the couch! This was easily one of the BEST BURGERS/SHAKES I've had in AZ. Do yourself a favor and check it out! If you're going to eat fast food, why not support a local, fresh made joint?
