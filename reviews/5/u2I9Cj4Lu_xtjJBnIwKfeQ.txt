We have been coming here since they first opened many years ago with the Salazar brothers! First they were on Southern and 48th Street, then on 48th Street and Baseline...now on McClintock and Rural. We love their bomburro burritos with no Pico de gallo, shredded beef tacos, and taquitos! Great workers, great prices, great red sauce and we have been followers ever since! We will continue to follow them and recommend you do the same.
