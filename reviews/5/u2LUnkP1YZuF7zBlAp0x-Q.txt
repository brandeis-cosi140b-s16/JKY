Tried several varieties of their meats tonight, in different iterations, and was quite pleased.  It's kinda like filiberto's/chipotle hybrid, but with a much more home made taste!  Standard taco, burrito, quesadilla type fair, but they some reaaaaally amazing looking breakfast items that I'm looking forward to trying, including Migas, Chilaquiles, and breakfast tortas!!  The owners are super cool, and the place has a bit of style. Super thrilled that it's so close to home :)
