This is my fourth time coming here, the food is great! They are very welcoming and serve you right away. I love the atmosphere they have casino music playing everyday and musician's come in and play music as well. They have a lot to pick from rather it's just traditional mexican food or sea food they have it all. The prices are great if you want great tasting good quality food for a great price this is the place to come!
