This place has the best tacos in town. The service is great food comes out fast. Joey and Ty are really on point and always manage to take special care of me when they are busy. Monday nights after 7:00 pm 3$  beers, Wells, and wine. Great atmosphere, great people, and lots of TVs to watch your favorite sport games.
