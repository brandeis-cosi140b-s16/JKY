This place was amazing!! We love Mexican food and this is the best I have found in Charlotte. The chips and salsa were great. The table side guacamole was delicious. They had $3.95 margaritas when we were there which was great.. My wife had the fajita burrito and she said it was one of the best has ever had. We cannot wait to go back and have dinner again. I know good authentic Mexican and this place is tops.
