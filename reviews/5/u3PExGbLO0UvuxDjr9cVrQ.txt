Tried "Dos" for the first time last night.  The original in Cave Creek has been a tradition for years in my family.  

  I was pleasantly surprised!  We sat on the patio which was beautiful and had a great view.  Service was fantastic and we ordered prickly pear margaritas and pollo fundido all around.  Food was fast and great.  Not one complaint from our party of six.  If you don't want to deal with tourists, El Encanto Dos is every bit as fantastic as the first restaurant.  We'll be back!
