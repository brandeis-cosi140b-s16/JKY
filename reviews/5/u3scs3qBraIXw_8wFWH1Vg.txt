A simple environment with incredibly delicious food. Los Cabos is an utterly unpretentious establishment with a great value for money. The staff seems to genuinely care about their patrons, and the food is authentic and wholly enjoyable. This is not a Michelin starred, tablecloth-ed fine dining experience, but for what it is, a good, economical neighborhood place, it can't be beat.
