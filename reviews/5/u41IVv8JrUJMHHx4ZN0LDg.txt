My coworker and I go here at least once a week for lunch. Everyone who works here is friendly, especially the owner. If you tell them it is your first time they give you samples of everything. The pig is the best! The flavors are delicious and one of a kind. Salsas could be a little more spicy, the hot isn't all that hot. But they have bottled sauces that heat it up a little more. Everyone needs to try Braddahs.
