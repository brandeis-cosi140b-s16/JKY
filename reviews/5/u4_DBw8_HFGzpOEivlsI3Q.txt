I've been coming to this place for over 5 years (mostly including the location at baseline and higley) and that should be explanation enough for the 5 stars. I don't venture much past my usual "steak potato cheese" burrito, but I've had their sides of rice and beans, horchata, and both red and green salsa (careful, that stuff is addicting), and I've never left regretting I went. It's $5 bucks for the best, most fresh and most consistently DELICIOUS burrito you can find north of the border. I'd take this over filiberto's any day of the week. Also, Did I mention that red salsa....  

They recently remodeled the Gilbert rd location and its lookin great. It's got places to sit, unlike the other location at baseline and higley which is connected to the circle K outside, with a pair of concrete tables with umbrellas to sit at, not bad on a nice day. I'm probably going again this week, my mouth is literally watering now after writing this.
