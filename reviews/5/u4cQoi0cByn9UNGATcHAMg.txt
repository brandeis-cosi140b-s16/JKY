Excellent! Small and quiet, friendly staff and amazing food! The rice is especially delicious. The salsa has a kick and hit of lime- devine! The Chile Relleno was delicious and presented beautifully. The chicken fajitas were marinated and moist and juicy!

Check out the women's bathroom for a laugh.
