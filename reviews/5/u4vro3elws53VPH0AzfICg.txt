The costumer service is perfect and the waiters are very friendly, the food quality is really good compared with other places, but for me the best of Pascual's are the tortilla chips that they make, and the best is that they can also be found at the grocery stores in Madison. 
The location is good, because you are so close to the downtown but you can park very close to the restaurant, and nice views to the street.

Actually the best restaurant in Madison!
