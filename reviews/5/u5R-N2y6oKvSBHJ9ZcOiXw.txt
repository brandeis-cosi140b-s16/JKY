This wasn't my first visit here, third time to be exact. I keep craving the carne asada...I love the fact that it's not greasy. The first time my husband and I came here he ordered a quesadilla and it was LOADED with onions, he wasn't even able to finish eating it. But now that we've come back several times we know what to expect and know what to stay away from. Other than that, the food here is great. Very authentic!
