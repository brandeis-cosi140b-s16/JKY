I've been wanting to try the hot dog here but I've been afraid to do so... till now! I was nervous about my order :a hot dog and fries ( I know it sounds silly but I was) I guess it's because It wasn't going to be a traditional hot dog that I know how to prepare. "Should I put ketchup on it"?..."Would it taste good with mustard?" .. ."Does he even have any mustard?" These were the questions popping in my mind before my order. While I was pondering over my important thoughts a customer comes up from behind me and praises the owner on the hot dog and fries ...calling the fries "savory". Then I thought I must try this too and see what this savory business is all about! I confidently placed my order. I asked if the fries are salty he said he didn't think so but he will go light on the spices. When I received my order he made me try the fries just to make sure they were just right because if they weren't he'd make a new batch for me. I thought ....Wow that's customer service! The fries were wonderful and the hot dog I was worried about was already prepared with the kimchee mix ..and I think ketchup...all I knew was it was melt in your mouth good! I usually like to pay attention to what I'm eating but it was "Double Yum" so I couldn't concentrate too well. I was full and happy for $4.25 ...that's the good stuff!
