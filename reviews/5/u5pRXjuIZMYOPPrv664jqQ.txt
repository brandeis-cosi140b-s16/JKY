LOS!!...12-1-12...missed you again...guess you have the weekend off.  Dinner is not as good when you are not serving.  See you on our next visit.

Oddity:  I stopped by to ask if you were working and the hostess told me she would not answer that question.  I restated my question and she told me she could not share that information with strangers.  What????  This is very strange...and she was not kidding and never once showed any sort of smile.   I asked if anybody would answer this question;  she stated I could ask the manager.  I believe I then spoke to Mary;  she was delightful.
