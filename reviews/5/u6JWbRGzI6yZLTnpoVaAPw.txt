This is one of the best Mexican places I've ever eaten. I'm in Madison twice a week and I stopped here for lunch both days you can't go wrong the food is delicious, it is made right in front of you. For 6 dollars and some change you can get a gigantic burrito with anything you want on it. I love this place.
