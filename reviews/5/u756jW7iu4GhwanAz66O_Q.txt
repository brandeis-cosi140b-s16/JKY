Phoenix is known for great Mexican food and this restaurant is the best of the best! The food is very authentic and the service was great. I love everything, starting with the chips and salsa, the cheese crisp, to my burro enchilada style. 
Great service, great price, and FANTASTIC food. I highly recommend everyone to eat this yummy restaurant.
