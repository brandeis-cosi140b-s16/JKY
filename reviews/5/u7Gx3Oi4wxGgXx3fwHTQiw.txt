Well I never quite knew the difference between posole and green chile stew but I learned today the green chile stew had a  delicious thick soupy broth with plenty of large chunks of tender pork plus, chopped hatch green chile, corn, tomato and potato it was scrumptious, and came with 2 large fried breads perfect for the first raining day I have experienced since in AZ the staff is always nice friendly and accommodating can't wait for my next visit  FYI they serve posole on Saturdays and make both fried bread and sopas yummy
