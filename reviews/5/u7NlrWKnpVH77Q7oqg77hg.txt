This is the Rubios to go to. I have had Rubios in California for a decade and this one fits right in. 

The management and staff are great at what they do. I recently had an order with a lot of special items and instructions and our cashier was being trained. He quickly alerted the kitchen and another cashier of the needed information. When my food came out the second cashier brought it out and reviewed the items with me that he had checked back in the kitchen. 

Taco Tuesday is a steal and the best burritos I crave are here. If you want lighter but with a little bite the chopped chicken salad is my go to for a feel good/taste good meal.
