my wife put it succinctly. sometimes you don't really get to appreciate mexican food when all you ever eat is the standard TexMex places that we frequent. 
and then you eat at a place like Carolina's and your whole perspective changes. 

i had an online coupon for Carolina's and since we like to stay within our 1-2 mile home radius, it forced us to head outside our box. we invited a friend from out of town to meet us there and he texted me "man travis, i don't know about this place. it looks shady". i assured him that this place was well known and to just wait in the car until we got there and that as AZ is a gun loving place, i would come locked and loaded strapped with my military grade weaponry. 

i was surprised at how unappealing and simple this place was. but that's what works for it i guess. since we don't eat meat, our choices were limited, but what we did order was absolutely fantastic. 

i loved the tamales. they had a few prepared and we tore into ours. then the enchiladas with green sauce. we also ordered a dozen tortillas and ate 5 of them before making it home. i have 2 more coupons for this place and can't wait to go back. i'm sure they taste so good because of the cooking ingredients (being a vegetarian doesn't mean i have to sacrifice lard every now and then does it?). but for a special occasion, this place is worth our drive!
