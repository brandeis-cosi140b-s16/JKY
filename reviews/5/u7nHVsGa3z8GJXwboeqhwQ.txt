Yum....

Chipotle is delicious! One of my favorite places to go. The quality is almost always consistent and delicious. Decent price for the food, clean environment and the staff is always pretty friendly.

My favorite is barbacoa bowl or salad. Always has great flavor. The chips are also quite delicious. Can get a little busy at lunch (although I think that is common knowledge - thought I'd mention it) - BUT that is because it is so delicious. 

This particular location has always done well, but so has most.
