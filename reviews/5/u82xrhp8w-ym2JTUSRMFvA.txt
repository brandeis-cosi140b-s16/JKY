Really good food. This place has unique items on the menu. Full of flavor and an intimate atmosphere. Try the grapefruit marg and the chips and quac. I had the pork tacos, but I would really look at trying their sandwich. They were supper busy, but our server flew around the room. We never felt like we were waiting to long for her. You won't be disappointed, check it out!
