This was very very good! The best tacos in North Las Vegas!  I tried the chorizo, al pastor and nopales tacos. Each one had great flavor and each one was so delish!!

The tacos were great, but if you can only try one thing-I highly recommend the Tortas! The bread is warm and crunchy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. There is the perfect blend of lettuce, tomato and avocado. I got the chicken Torta, but will definitely be back to try the carne asada! It was way better than the Tortas they serve at Roberto's!! There are also vegetarian options: nopales, soy-rizo, etc. Great service, very friendly people! Martinez Taco Bar is definitely a gem in the N.LV area!! :)
