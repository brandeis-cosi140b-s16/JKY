The newest guac on the block, this Chipotle makes one mean burrito. Brand spanking new and shiny, the restaurant is built on the site of a completely renovated 'Barbeques Galore' store right next door to the Lamps Plus in the heart of the Pavillions Shopping Center. 

This is the first location I spotted the franchise's newly introduced cilantro lime brown rice and I've got to say the nuttiness and texture really add to the burrito experience. With everything you've come to love from a Chipotle on top of the added freshness of a newly built kitchen, I couldn't ask for more in a meal.

The staff is quite young, but they spoon out the delicious burrito fillings with the deft hands of burrito making veterans, smiling throughout the interaction and engaging the customer with interest. The cook tended a slew of delicious marinated chicken on the grill, and sat humming cheerfully as they browned. The sounds of the juices crackling on the hot grill echoing through the restaurant seemed to compliment his tune.

Once I had paid, I took an empty seat and began to unwrap the glory that is the Chipotle steak burrito. With childlike abandon, I began tearing into this marvel of modern culinary magic, devouring bite after bite until I was left empty-handed and full-bellied. A highly recommended ending to a long day at the office.

Could not be more satisfied with my meal here, and look forward to coming back time and time again, as the location is perfectly situated on my commute home from work. Clean, friendly, delicious, nutritious and nearby, truly a 5 star establishment.
