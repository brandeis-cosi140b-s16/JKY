This place rocks.  Don't be put off by the appearance, the concept, or the location. It's not really fusion so much as collaboration.  Jade Chicken and Jerk Fried Rice with black beans is an amazing flavor combination.  On paper it sounds almost disgusting, but it is so good!!!  

Staff is friendly and upbeat, and the prices are affordable.  Take out/Dine in, either way it's worth the drive from wherever you are!
