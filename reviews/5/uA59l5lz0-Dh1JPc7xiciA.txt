I am a fan of Top Shelf Mexican Food because of the chips and salsa, and for their rendition of my all-time favorite food: a bean burro, enchilada style. The taste is awesome to me. The waiter, Nate/Nathan was very friendly. He had the orders memorized for some of the patrons. The burro is $4.95 with enchilada sauce (I like the red sauce). The drinks, root beer, etc., are $2.50, and they have free refills. My total was $8.12 for these two items. I would eat there five days a week if my budget allowed it.
