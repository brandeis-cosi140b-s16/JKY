Tapas 51 is a hidden gem. We were starving after a fun day at Carowinds and looking for a healthy option nearby. We definitely did not expect the incredible, affordable culinary creations we feasted upon at Tapas 51. Every single dish is so carefully crafted to form the perfect combinations of savory and sweet, spicy and creamy. The brisket chorizo tacos, the shrimp papusa, and the chocotorta are absolute musts. The Chorizo Brussels sprouts and the sweet corn were also fantastic. 
I could not recommend a restaurant more. Definitely coming back.
