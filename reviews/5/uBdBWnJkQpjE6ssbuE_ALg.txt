i wrote a bad review about this place months back.  always critical about my Bean and cheese burrito with green sauce on the side. finaly I decided to go back... The drive thru wass pretty quick but before had a bad burrito experience so i was still curious of my upcoming burrito quality.  i ordered the usual bean and cheese burrito with green sauce on the side.  To my surprise this burrito was amazing. one of the best ive had in awhile from various other robertos'.  5 star burrito quality
