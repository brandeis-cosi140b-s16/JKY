I've eaten at about 7 different Roberto's all over the valley and this one is by far the best on a consistent basis. I'm not sure what they put in their carne asada burritos here (probably crack, they are that good) but this location in particular has a different flavor than the others. Other menu items are good as well, but if you're going to this location do yourself a favor and get something with carne asada in it. As others have said... Don't bother phone ordering, just order when you get there to be sure you get exactly what you want. Bonus: open 24 hours!
