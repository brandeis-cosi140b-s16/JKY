I came for my friends birthday, and I have to say that this place is awesome. The mariachi was so good they were taking all kinds of requests. The meals are a decent price but you should know that this is a restaurant and it wil have standard restaurant prices. The kicker for me were their margaritas, they make it nice and strong but still tastes so good you lose track of how many drinks you've had. Overall the experience was great and I ordered their chicken which had a great marinade.
