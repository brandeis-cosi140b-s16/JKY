I have been going to Macayo's for years and they have some delicious mexican food. My personal favorite is the chimichanga, which is amazing. I have a hard time ordering anything else because it is perfect. My wife tried the chili relleno last time and that was delicious as well. I've had many different things here and have never been disappointed. Their free chips and salsa are delicious too. I can't find a single complaint.
