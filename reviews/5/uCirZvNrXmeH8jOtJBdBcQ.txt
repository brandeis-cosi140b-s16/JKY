Ok this chicken is so good, it has been said, that even another chicken would eat it. That is an understatement. This is a decent restaurant in the guise of a fast food joint. They have a great loyalty program-Plus. They send out great coupons- Double Plus! A great alternative to fast food, not just in quality but healthier as well. I should also mention the very friendly staff. Live it up you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!
