Two words.  FREAKIN AWESOME. Super Mex is a Sunday tradition now.  My daughter and I always get the Chicken Taco salad and it has never failed us.  Always cooked and put together perfectly.  The Bloody Marys are super good too.  We've never had a complaint with the service.  Delicious and perfect every time.
