Robertos is a regular go to for my self, my family, visitors, and many friends. It is not upscale by any stretch and certainly not fancy sit down mexican food. But it is all very tasty recipes and wonderful prices. I recommend it to anybody who is looking for tasty Mexican east served up quick and cheap. Better quality, prices, and certainly more authentic than ANY fast food chain around.
