This place is the best in town. Great hookah, great food, and great music! $13AYCS most days of the week. To reply to the negative comment for this lounge, the security HAS to check everyone's ID regardless if it's listed horizontal or vertical. I wouldn't want to risk anything with people under the age of 18 trying to get in if it was my business especially with how easy it is to get a fake ID in Las Vegas. So props to the security for doing their job correctly and not half ass. 

You can totally tell that EVERYONE always has a good time. It's the talk of the town for a reason! The comeback is definitely strong. Anyone who lives in Las Vegas or are visiting should definitely hit this place up!
