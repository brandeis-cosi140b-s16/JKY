This little place, right across the street from the Birmingham Bridge, has excellent tacos.  Tacos are cheap and authentic ($2.50 for a taco full of all the fixins' you could want: rice, beans, guacamole, salsa, lime, etc.)  The tortillas are the real deal.  They sell all the Mexican pops along with aguas frescas.  We had agua de pina y fresa, and it was really good.  The decor is nothing fancy, but there are some colorful murals on the walls, and the place is clean.  It is run by a friendly couple.  I will definitely return.
