This is my first yelp review.  I honestly Cannot say anything bad about this place from the last few visits.   All times I was fortunate enough to be seated by the windows to see the great view of the strip.  My most recent visit was only about an hour ago and the food as always was delicious.  Our server extremely busy with a large party but did a great job at making sure that we were well taken care of.  

Not long of a wait.
Excellent customer service
Delicious food
prices are a little higher than other Mexican restaurants, however I've never had this great of service at any of the others.  Well worth the price.

Overall 5 stars
