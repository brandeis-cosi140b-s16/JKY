Oh, Tia Rosa... how you surprise me. With your festive decorations for the holidays, your loquacious patrons sitting nearly side-by-side, your relatively tiny bar area, large and crowded patio and absurdly long wait lines on weekends, I am befuddled as to how I can like you. 

But, no matter how many chips I must munch on before shown to a table, no matter how embarrassingly small your beer selection is (although you do have Dos Equis and Fat Tire), and no matter how I may sometimes be randomly serenaded by your boys with guitars, none of this matters when I peek inside your menu (or even slowly sip a 'rita). I cease to concern myself with trivial matters, like beer selection and wait time. Your menu is vast, proffering fresh fish, including halibut and salmon, as well as a new flair on traditional fare, like the Chicken Mole enchiladas, which I devoured with gusto.

This is a fun place, extremely family-friendly, good for large groups or when you're with a friend or significant other and you're just craving Mexican food without the fire, the typical beans/rice sides and the standard after-dinner heartburn. On weekends, parking can be quite the headache. So, either arrive early or forgo your plans for a week night. 

Bottom line: Tia Rosa's is a must.
