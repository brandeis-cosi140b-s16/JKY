Great food, great service.  This is my go to place when I want to impress friends and family with Mexican Food.  I buy quarts of Beans, Green chili with pork, Red chili with beef, tasty chicken in sauce and fresh tortillas and pack them all home in my corning ware containers.   I make a blender of margaritas at home and everyone makes their own burritos or tacos.  Easy and always a hit!  Everything on the extensive menu is excellent and as fresh as "just out of the  pot".  We have been counting on Caminero's for Christmas Eve dinner and New Year's Day Brunch for years.  Wonderful, caring people run this perfect, corner place in Peoria.  Consistent high quality food at very reasonable prices!
