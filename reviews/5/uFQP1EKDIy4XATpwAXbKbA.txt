Beyond tasty!  Fresh flavors and healthy options, how can this be Mexican food?  Trust me just go. Have the Brussels sprout nachos and die at how good the mix of flavors are. What a creative chef. I also loved the jicama radish and cu umber side with chipotle greek yogurt dip. Had a green chili chicken taco and hubby had skirt steak platter. Tons of leftovers. Margaritas were perfect. Service five star. Adorable inside and out but we sat outside. Just go, go now!!!
