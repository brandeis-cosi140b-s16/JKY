I love this place!  The staff is super friendly and the food is good.  Yes, it's a little pricey...but if you want cheap/mediocre/quasi-Mexican, you should go to Taco Bell around the corner.  My favorites:  shredded beef hard shell tacos, shrimp diablo burrito, and the carne asada fries.  I don't mind that there's only counter seating - Federal Street is not somewhere you want to sit and eat, anyway (not much in the way of a view and there's still some sketchy characters roaming about - the area is improving greatly and undergoing a renaissance of sorts).  I always phone in my order and pick it up on my way home from work.  I've never waited and never had a wrong/messed up order.  It's consistently fresh and yummy :-)  So glad El Burro is in my neighborhood!
