First time here. I have seen them around but avoided them because I thought they would be bland. I was wrong. Everything was yummy but the stand out for me was the cilantro dressing. Ordered a side of it for my pork taco and it took something yummy and made it yummier. The other delicious treat was the strawberry lemonade. Not to strawberry with a hint of melon? Either way it was quenching to say the least. It's giving the restraurants around it a run for their money
