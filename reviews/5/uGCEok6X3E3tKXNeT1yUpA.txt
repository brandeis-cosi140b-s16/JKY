Stopped here on our way to Salt Lake City, Utah. Was looking for a good seafood restaurant, and La Playita popped up on line. Gave it a try and never regretted it. My wife commented that she was the only white person in the restaurant, but she loves Mexican food. The food was fantastic. We asked for Salsa to go as it was delicioso and had it in Salt Lake City with chips. Don't blink or you'll missed this place, I almost did.
