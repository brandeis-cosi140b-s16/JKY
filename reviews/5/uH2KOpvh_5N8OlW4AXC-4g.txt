I eat at Zabas at least once a week, and have been doing so for the past 5+ years. Everything is delicious and it can also be healthy(dependent on what you get), also love that they have wheat tortillas.

As for service, it is usually pretty solid. They had a rough start when they first opened this location, but it got better.

As for the grub, my usual dish is a steak burrito, wheat tortilla, brown rice, black beans, pico, guac and salsa on the side. You get that protein, nutrients and some bomb salsa. The red salsa is great; very spicy. I have also tried pretty much everything else they have to offer and none disappointed. 

Only negative comment I can make is that they are strict with the portions on some of the items.

Definitely worth checking out if you are undecided. Oh ya, they have a loyalty program too; free food rocks.
