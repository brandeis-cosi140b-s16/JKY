I just read that Verde is closing tonight, I hope to hell that is just bad info.

I LOVE this place, it is SOOOOO good. 

If great food could marry great service, then have a child called great location- this would be it.

Simple, tasty food, with AMAZING tortillas and they have the BEST classic guacamole in town. Very large portion which doesn't try and break the bank. Best of all, they are awesome in not loading up the guac with tomatoes and other fillers, so they can use less avocados (yes Baja Fresh, I am looking right at you)

Pair your meal with a 500ml bottle of Mexican Coke (think Santa, not Scarface) and you have a great meal.

Please let the rumors of Verde closing be terrible lies told my evil people!
