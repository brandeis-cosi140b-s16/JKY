We tried Serrano's for dinner while visiting family in Mesa. This was some of the best Mexican food I've had. It was more authentic than most other places we looked into, which is exactly what we were looking for. They seem to have a really wide variety of dishes, which was perfect for the varied tastes in our party. The complimentary chips, salsa and bean dip were great. The chips are served fresh, and the bean dip is hot! Service was great and the prices were fair. It took a little while to get our food, but we were fully satisfied munching on the chips and bean dip, which they refilled on request. We will definitely return the next time we are in Mesa!

Recommended: Bean dip (amazing!) and Enchiladas Suizas
