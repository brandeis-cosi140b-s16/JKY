Seriously best place to get tacos in Pittsburgh. Not a very big place but the food is so good I would eat it standing up! The employees are so nice and the place has a cool Mexican atmosphere with great props and artwork. The location is right on Carson so it is very convenient and affordable. I've never waited more than 2 minutes for my order which is great when your on a lunch break! And my favorite part is they serve sodas in glass bottles. Great place - kudos to the chef!
