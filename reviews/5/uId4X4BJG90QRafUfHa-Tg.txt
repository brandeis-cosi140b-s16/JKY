I'm a big fan if this place! The restaurant, the outdoor
patio and the bar is 5star all the way. I usually have
1 breakfast and 1 lunch or dinner per week. The menu is pretty straight forward and I think I've had everything on it with praises for it all. I also recommend spending the nite at the adjoining
Clarendon Hotel especially when you get a $49
