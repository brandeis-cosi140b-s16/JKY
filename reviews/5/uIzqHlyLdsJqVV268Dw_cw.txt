Living a matter of Minutes from this place and hearing so many good things has had me curious for Oh so long. Finally it was a hot evening and we had somehow switch the air off and the house was boiling so there was no way we were going to turn on the stove so we headed out to Cafe Rio... For some odd reason I was like a Giddy little kid who had been told all about Disney land all winter and finally summer had come! I was Ready to get my Pork Barbacoa Ears........ Yep I said it! 

I ended up ordering the pork barbacoa Nachos, these things were nothing less than huge and delicious. While I was ordering mine they through together a free kids quesadilla meal for my daughter...  I have to say, I personally feel like the hype of this place is justified and the food was excellent. For those hot nights when you do not want to turn the oven on this is definitely a place worth checking out!
