Great, good service staff, good food, good lunch buffet, price is fair and very nice looking place.  I have eaten there about 50 times in the last 4 years and it never misses the mark.  Traditional mexican food and a family run place good for lunch or the family.  Also they have a quiet bar if you like to go for a quite date.  Always plenty of parking and rarely a wait to get seated.  My kid likes it too and the kid menu is affordable.
