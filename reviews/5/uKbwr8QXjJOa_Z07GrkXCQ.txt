Ok all my foodie friends, this place is the real deal Mexican restaurant. All made from scratch! Had REAL menudo today, not like other places, its like your Tia's kitchen! 2 fish tacos, amazing, carne asada, delicious, chinchuroni taco, looks weird tastes Bomb, and a chorizo taco, this was the absolute best! And the flan... oh my! The service and owners were so awesome too! This is a new staple in our dining! You ABSOLUTELY MUST TRY IT!
