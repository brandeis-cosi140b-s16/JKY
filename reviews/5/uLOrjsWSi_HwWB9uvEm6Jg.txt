Great seasoned meat, full of flavor. The salsa is amazing with thick crunchy, salty chips that taste homemade.The most nicest people. Great service, and actually cares for the customers. Adorable Mexican wrestling theme. The tres leche is to die for, and so are the tacos! It's amazing that they went from a taco truck to an amazing (not huge) restaurant. I recommend this to anybody that wants an amazing family friendly, (Mexican food) restaurant.
