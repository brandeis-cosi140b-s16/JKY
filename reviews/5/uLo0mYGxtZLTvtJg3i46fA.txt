We tried this place for lunch based on the reviews here and were not disappointed! I don't think I've ever had better tortillas anywhere. The shredded beef burrito was very tasty. Since I'm watching my calories right now I did not add cheese, sour cream, or guacamole (which I would always get any other time) and this burrito was still one of the best I've ever had. There were five of us and we all thoroughly enjoyed our food: tacos, enchiladas, or burritos. I will definitely come back to this restaurant!
