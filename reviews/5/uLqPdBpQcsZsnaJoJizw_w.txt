I initially tried Braddah's based on my fellow Yelper's reviews, and as usual, you all were right on the money! This place is awesome!

When I walked in I was greeted by a friendly staff.  After telling them that I had never been there before, they immediately began getting samples together for me. Nom nom nom.  EVERYTHING was delicious, including the fish...which can be hit or miss with me.  I settled on the tacos and tried one wheat, one flour, and one hard shell.  For meat, I selected chicken and fish (combination).  Not only were the tacos filled to capacity, but each and every one of them were the bomb dot com.  

I was also able to unlock a yelp "check-in" offer for a complimentary coconut bark. What is coconut bark, you ask? It's CRACK! Yes, I said it...CRACK.  This delicious treat taste like a combination of a Twix bar and heaven! 

If I could eat here every day I would. Every. Single. Day.
