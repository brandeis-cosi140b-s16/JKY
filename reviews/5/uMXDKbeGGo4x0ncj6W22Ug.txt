I love Taco Bell. 
This location is beautiful. The interior reminds me of a local cantina vs the generic fast food feeling. 

The food is consistent and the store is always clean. Even the art work is a little more hip that I'm used too. 

The only gripe I have is the hours.... 
9am to 10pm lobby. The drive through an extra hour.   I feel like Taco Bell is known for fourth meal, which is in the middle of the night. 

But I'm sure the staff doesn't mind not working overnight.
