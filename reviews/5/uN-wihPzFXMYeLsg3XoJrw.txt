My favorite restaurant in Phoenix. I love the turkey enchiladas, and the leftovers are great in the morning reheated with two fried eggs on top. Great, somewhat hipster ambiance but not too young of a crowd. Not all that child friendly but they have been friendly to a friend's well behaved son we take there. Overall, great place. I live in Tucson where we have no shortage of good restaurants and still look forward to this place every time I visit Phoenix.
