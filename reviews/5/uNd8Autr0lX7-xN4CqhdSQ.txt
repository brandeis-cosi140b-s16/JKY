I was visiting my brother and he doesn't cook and I didn't want to... I saw Jefe's here and since it was close thought I'd give it a try. Ben (owner?) told me to get on Yelp and tell about the lousy service and bad food.  I can not tell a lie Ben. So I'll say how great the sevice was and holy buckets the size of my Chimi'!  Plus it was delicious!  The seating is very limited so I had to take it out as the table was occupied.  I got back to my brothers and opened the carton and my remark was as stated above.  I dug in and was barely able to finish it along with the rice and beans.  But I can't let good food go to waste...  I wish them the best on their business venture and Ben on his Buick restore.  If you're ever in Alamogordo Ben... open one here!
