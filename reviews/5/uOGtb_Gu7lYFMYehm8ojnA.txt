Try the crispy fish tacos they are delicious! They are perfectly battered and crispy and garnished beautifully.The carne asada quesadilla was very good as well. I love that you can also get all the chips and salsa you'd like without it costing a few extra bucks. Skip the burritos though. They taste like the enchiladas that Pollo Loco just added to their menu. Definitely not worth the $8 price tag. And last but not least, the drinks! My mouth just waters at the pure thought of them. I'm personally not a fan of margaritas but man oh man! The drinks were stirred and executed perfectly!
