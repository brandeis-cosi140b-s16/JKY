Its a little yellow building, a hole in the wall type of eatery, not much to look at, but it give that Mexican - mom & pop character.

I've been here many, many times. Great food, great price. I love their Carne Asada burrito - Zee best. Wife always like their Chili Rolleno combo. it is not fine dinning, but for the money, its hard to beat. 

very good food for decent price.
