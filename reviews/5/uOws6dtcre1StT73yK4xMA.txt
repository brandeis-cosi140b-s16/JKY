AAAAAMAZING! $7.95 for the lunch (M-F) 3 taco special which includes a small drink. I had the carne asada tacos (with the double small corn tortillas). Now, for you folks who don't like spicy, ask for them WITHOUT salsa. Otherwise, its on there and you are in for a spicy surprise that will clean your sinuses from here till the end of flu season.
