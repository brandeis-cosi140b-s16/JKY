We were going to a play at the Mesa Art Center and planned to go to the old restaurant at this location.  It was gone so we tried Margarita.  We were so pleased!  We had delicious guacamole & a yummy cheese crisp to start.  Then my husband had his new favorite chicken mole and I had the best soup!  I just wish I could have tried more of the menu because it all looked so great!  

We may attend more events in Mesa just so we can start with dinner at Margarita's.   The prices were very reasonable as well and their Margarita menu looked so good that we almost ordered some even though we don't drink!
