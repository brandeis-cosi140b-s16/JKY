Came in because I was nearby that day for work. It was this or subway. Definitely got more than I expected! Service was great and good came super quick. I've had plenty of chicken burritos all over the southwest but the blackened chicken burrito here is the best I've ever had. Hands down. That thing made my day. A friend had the bean and cheese burrito and said the same thing. Give it a try if you're looking for some quick quality Mexican/ southwestern food
