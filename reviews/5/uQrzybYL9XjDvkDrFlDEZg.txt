We were on vacation in the area, and went there 3 times in 5 days. I couldn't get enough of the food here. The chiliquilis were heaven on a plate, with homemade tortillas and house made salsa verde. The portions were extremely generous for the price and the service was fast and friendly. Not a destination to if you want tons of ambiance, but if you want quality, homemade Mexican food, this is the place to go.
