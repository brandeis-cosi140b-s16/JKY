The staff are all very frindly. Place is very clean inside and out. The food is good with lots of flavor. I know it's fast food but it is a lot better then Taco Bell and I think it's even better then Filibertos. If your unsure what something is they will explain it to you. They are open 24 hrs but the best thing I like about them is they care about their employees. They are closed on Thanksgiving and Christmas like they should be. I respect that very much.
