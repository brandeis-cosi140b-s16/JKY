Rosita's is THE mexican food restaurant when you're near the 10/51 interchange. Everything is great -- the food, the atmosphere, the service. The salsa is excellent but watch out for the verde, that stuff gets caliente. Fortunately their glasses of water are plenty large.

Tie for favorite items are the shrimp chili rellano plate and the two ground beef and potato tacos. The taco shells, like the chips, are freshly prepared and topped to the brim with lettuce and cheese. Just a very legit mexican dining experience.
