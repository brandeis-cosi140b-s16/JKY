I have been a fan of this place since it opened. The Tequilaria style is a big plus for me, because it allows me to get my favorite beer with my "fatty tacos". I normally have to get the same thing because it is one of those places, when you find what you like, why change? (carnitas tacos)

Although they have a larger selection when it comes to entrees, meats, and toppings than Chipotle. Everything from Mahi Mahi, to shredded or grilled steak. 

Going there for games if great, because they always have  3 large HDTVs above the bar. Little secret of the trade, if it is a slow Sunday/Monday/ect. night you can get them to play Rock Band on their PS3. 

Oh yeah, and the other Wednesday night I saw they were holding some kind of Madden Tournament, I think. Pretty cool to have in a bar I thought.
