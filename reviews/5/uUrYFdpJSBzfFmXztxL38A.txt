My wife and I have lived in Maricopa for a year now and finally trued cilantros. I had a sampler of steak and egg breakfast burrito with a fish taco, 5 rolled tacos (taquitos) cheese quesadilla a side of fries and topped it off with a piece of flan. Granted...I didn't eat all this food myself but we all sampled everything. I was not disappointed as I typically am in wanna be authentic Mexican fare.  The service was prompt...food was great in taste and authenticity as well as portion size. Overall a great experience and we will return again.  Way to go cilantros.
