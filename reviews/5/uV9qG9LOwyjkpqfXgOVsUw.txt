Los Favoritos goes above and beyond what a typical taco shop should do. Every plate combination I've come across is not only delicious but extremely affordable. They keep the place clean, they are always kind, and they work with all kinds of requests. I highly recommend deep frying or getting an enchilada (wet) style burrito with green sauce. Best casual sonoran mexican restaurant in the Tempe area by far.
