We are regulars of Komex
I have tried several things on the menu and enjoyed them all
My personal favorite is kimchi fried rice with pork for the meat it is delicious and spicy (love kimchi and spicy food)
Spam masubi with or without egg and it a nice big severing and you get 2
Plenty of different drinks to choose from usually just get water, if it's cold out then hot white/green tea which they serve in a nice pot 
Highly recommend trying Komex
