This is my favorite restaurant.  Their chicken mole is SO GOOD.  The papa con carne, chili relleno, and fish tacos are amazing as well.  NOTE:  The Taqueria's are not as good as this, the original restaurant.  The quality of the food is not even close.  I recently moved to another state, but whenever I come to town to visit family, they know that a trip to Tia Rosa will happen.  I have to get my chicken mole fix :)  And I love the atmosphere of the restaurant, and during the winter we always eat ourside, especially at Christmas when it's decorated.  Try this place atleast once.  Don't get the usual chimichanga or tacos, try one of their specialty dishes and you'll enjoy your visit so much more.  ENJOY!!
