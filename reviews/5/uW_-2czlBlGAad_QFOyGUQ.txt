Been here three times. Every time, service is great, fast, courteous, and attentive. Ceasar is a very nice guy. Last night he took the extra time to explain things for me. I appreciate the attention. Every time we come we try one new thing. We always get tacos though!!! The soft tacos are AMAZING!!! The hard shell tacos are huge, but just as good. My husband says he could drink the salsa with a straw. Last night we ordered a "torta" this is a Mexican style sandwich. Beans, your choice of meat, Pico, lettuce, tomato, guacamole, layered on a hoagie style roll that has been grilled. The "torta" is not for me. My husband loved it. The asada fries are my personal favorite! Get them with carnitas, CARNITAS ON EVERYTHING!!!
