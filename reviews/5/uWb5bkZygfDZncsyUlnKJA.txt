This moderately priced place really rocks.  I can't even begin to tell you how happy I get when I think about a potential lunch or dinner there.

Because it's so good, Rosa's is usually packed.  Lunch time is just plain INSANITY!  Groups of parties with with 10-14 seem to be quite the norm.

I've been there consistently for the past 3 months and I've yet to see the restaurant have dirty floors, bathrooms or unfriendly and slow servers.

I've tried just about every dish they have and I would recommend the Flying Saucer or the Chimichanga Plate.

The meats are heavenly -- they are spiced just right, are flavorful and juicy.  The chicken has never been dry in all the times I've eaten there.

Ok, I'm cutting this review short -- I'm heading out to Rosa's.  Hope to see you there!
