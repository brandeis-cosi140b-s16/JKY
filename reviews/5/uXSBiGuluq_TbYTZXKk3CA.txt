Carne asada fries was delicious! They even placed the toppings on the side. My son really appreciated that!

The carne  asada was enough for 2 or more to eat. (Or for lunch the next day!) My son and I truly enjoyed them.

My daughter ordered a shrimp burrito.  She said that it was fresh, delicious and filling also. 

We love that they are opened 24 hours and that there are digital coupons that you can use/redeem if you go to their website!

We now have a new late night eatery.
