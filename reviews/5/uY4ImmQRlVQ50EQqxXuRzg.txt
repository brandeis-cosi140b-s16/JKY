My husband loves New Mexican food and this place was amazing.  A friend of ours recommended it as she is a New Mexican Native.  We live in AJ but will travel to go here.  Love that they give you sopapillas.   As a previous reviewer mentioned that it is hard to screw up sopapillas.  This is true, but I am a sopapillas connoisseur and  have gone to places where they do screw it up.  I love this place and am so thankful to have a true NM restaurant here in the valley.
