I love the taco stand outside of Reyna's. I've tried all of the tacos that they have to offer and wasn't disappointed with any of them. My favorites are the lengua and chorizo, so when I go I usually get one of each.

Their homemade tortillas are also pretty delicious. Warming them up in the oven with a little oil makes them even more delicious. 

They have a good selection of things in the actual store, including Salsa Lizano, which I had previously thought I'd have to order from somewhere in Latin America. And they have Guava Jelly, which is always absurdly delicious! 

I would definitely go back here, even in the snow. Too good.
