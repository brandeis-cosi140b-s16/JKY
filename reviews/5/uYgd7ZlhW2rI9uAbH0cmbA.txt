I took a friend and tried this place after reading the reviews here on Yelp. The food here is great!   Started with great chips and salsa, the green tomatillo salsa was especially good. Tried the shrimp tacos and the tacos durados chicken. Both were excellent, They were served with beans, rice, and a small salad. There was plenty of food for both of use, my friend gave me one of her tacos as she could not finish her plate. They have various Mexican beers and Bud Light available and it was served very cold with a frosty glass and a lemon slice. They also have Mexican bottled sodas in real glass bottles. We left stuffed and very happy.  I will definitly be back!!
