Bless you little pink building full of taco goodness!  This former gas station & Jack in the Box location now houses taco nirvana. And at two dollars a pop you can graze through the vast offerings without breaking the bank. 

They have three stations with an array of selections of meat at each. Including real honest to goodness adobada al pastor on a shawarma. This being my first time I had tripas, carne asada and three trips back for adobada al pastor. Very satisfied. Clean, friendly and great tacos. And did I mention two bucks each!
