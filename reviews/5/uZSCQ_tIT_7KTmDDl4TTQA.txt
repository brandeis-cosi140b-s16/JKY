I was so blown away by the quality of the food had here. The wife and I decided to give this a try looking at yelp for some great kosher food. We nailed it and my wife was very happy with me. We orderd  the hummus falafel and the kosher mexican (big burrito) was wow wow we were sooo happy. We love middle eastern food and we now have a new spot plus they are open until 10 (or later) . You must try this place now. Don't let the outside fool you. You will thank me later.
