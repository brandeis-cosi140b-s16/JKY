OMG...I cannot believe the whiners.  Sorry folks...but this place is part of the ghetto-fabulous food experience that made Phoenix RITO'S the best....and now they are sharing with Glendale.  The original Ritos is in an old hot house in the hood...like, in the freakin downtown ghetto...where white folks don't go at night without an escort.  They had horrible hours, long lines, limited menu...we LOVE them.  You want their good food..then plan your trip there accordingly...who cares about ambience.  If you want to look at pretty pics on the wall...go somewhere else and leave this place to people like me who appreciate good real home made mexican food.  THANK YOU RITOS FOR COMING TO GLENDALE
