My family should own Mattas by now.  I grew up eating at Mattas weekly.  It has the BEST Chile Relleno in the world!!  It is stuffed with the best tasting meat i've ever eaten.   They also have delicious chimi changas.  Try the Sandy's Special.  It will not dissapoint.  I'm probably going to regret telling the Yelp world about Mattas, as it will mean longer wait times.  Oh well, the world must know!
