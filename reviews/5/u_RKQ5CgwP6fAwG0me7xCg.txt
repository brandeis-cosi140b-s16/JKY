Longtime downtown spot on 10th and Charleston. Salvadoran and Mexican. Nice, big place inside with comfortable seating and good service. We had all the pupupas, cheese, pork, been with cheese and a combo of beans, cheese and pork. Really sumptuous pockets of corn based dough. Be careful, the fillings are hot. Served with a vinegar slaw and tomato sauce. Mammon, good. Did I mention they were $1.50. That's no typo. Tamales are a buck fifty too. The Elote tamale is a sweet, light bundle of yum. Beef burrito, enchilada style with rice and beans all tasting great - $6.50. Beautiful shrimp enchilada with tons of decent sized shrimp. We ended our meal with Fried plantains that were served with a sweet cream sauce - so good. Highly recommend for downtown eating.
