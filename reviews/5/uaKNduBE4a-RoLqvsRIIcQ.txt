I have been a regular customer here for over a year. 
At one point, I at there every day!

I always get a cheese Quesadilla with white rice and black beans. The staff is very customer-friendly and work hard to make your experience enjoyable. They often have my order ready to go once I reach the counter. 

Sometimes the lines can be long around meal times, but the people behind the counter can move them along pretty quickly.
