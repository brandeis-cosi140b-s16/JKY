I tried a torta for the first time last night based on the reviews that I read on Yelp about this place. Well I wasn't disappointed - I had the cochinita torta and it was DELICIOUS!  yummy shredded pork with a mildly spicy sauce, shredded lettuce, tomato, avacado, mayo and peppers on an awesomely fresh roll.   My torta was prepared in minutes and the young women at the counter that helped me was very friendly.  I can't wait to go back and sample some of the other torta options.  Truth be told I wish I could head out right now and get another ... it was that good.
