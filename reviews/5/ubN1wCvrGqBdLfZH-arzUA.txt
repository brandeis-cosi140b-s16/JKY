This place is crazy good. Years ago, I used to drive 4 hours to their only location in St George to get my fix. Later, I was thrilled to drive to Scottsdale to partake. And now...7 minutes away. My life is complete. Pork Barbacoa Salad with tomatillo dressing is not to be missed, along with their amazing Horchata.
