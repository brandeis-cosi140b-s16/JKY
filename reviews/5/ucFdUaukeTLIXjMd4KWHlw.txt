Authentic street tacos! Yum! The initial visit is a bit overwhelming as the service system is unique. Speak Spanish? Great! If not, you will undoubtedly be able to ask a fellow patron for advice. Once you know what KIND of taco you want it's easy, walk up to the corresponding number and the chef will prepare it for you, made to order. My husband and I are vegetarian and we had lots of options. We chose soy chorizo & cactus. We each had a taco and shared nachos. The salsa bar is amazing! To top off our delicious meal, 2 cervezas mas finas.
