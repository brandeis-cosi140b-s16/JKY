We absolutely love this place! They were in the top 3 taco places near Tempe Diablo Stadium by mlb.com's Alden Gonzalez and he was so right!! The meat is great some is really spicy and some is a bit milder but all is very good. The horchata is worth it if you like horchata. 

The one thing that brings us back here every time we visit to watch baseball is the churros! They are amazing. Simply they are the best churros we've ever had. Every time they are perfectly crispy on the outside and moist on the inside with a little bit of filling. The caramel they serve with it is a perfect compliment. They are pretty much worth our trip here whether our team wins or loses. Be careful of their hours. They are easy to visit on the weekdays but not open much on Saturday and Sunday.
