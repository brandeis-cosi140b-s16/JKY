I go to this restaurant regularly for lunch. The lunch specials are a great deal, and my favorite option is the burrito verde with refried beans instead of rice. The food always comes out hot and quick. The complimentary chips and salsa are always good and fresh as well. Servers have always been quick and attentive. I haven't been at dinner time yet, but it is one of my favorite lunch spots in Fort Mill.
