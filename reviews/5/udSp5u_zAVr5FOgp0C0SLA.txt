Sol Mexican Cocina is a definite go to for lunch when shopping at the quarter. My server Marlena was really sweet and on top of things. There were loads of wait staff on hand to see to our needs. For instance Beth was so knowledgeable and explained many items on the menu making it easy for me to make a great selection. I had some kind of fish tacos with salad and guacamole. Yummy!! The best. Next a fellow came over to refill my coffee. He said he was going to make a fresh pot that would only take a few minutes. Turns out that was Matt and the coffee was delicious. I really loved the ambience and not feeling rushed at Sol MC. Thank you to everyone. It's so evident that you love what you do. We benefit!!
