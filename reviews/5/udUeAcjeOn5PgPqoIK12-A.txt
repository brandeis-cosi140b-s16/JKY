A MUST TRY, I consider myself a "self professed Food Critic"and Mexican Food connoisseur. The View has authentic Mexican Cuisine. You can tell their food is made from scratch. The Refried Beans, Green and Enchilada sauces, Tamales, ect. I could go on and on, the bottom line don't take my word THE FOOD IS SOOOOO! YUMMY, try it your self.
