Clean environment and friendly staff! The burritos are priced low, but are not gigantic in size. I'd say your average person could eat 2 depending on your diet (or lack thereof). I ended up having their RCB burrito and a quesadilla. I was sort of expecting more than just meat in the burrito, but to my surprise the brisket held its own while complimented by their freshly made tortillas. The quesadilla was also quite tasty as I paired it with their green salsa. Overall, I had a great experience and will be back to try several more burritos. I don't suggest dining in, especially around lunch time as the space is relatively small. I see this place expanding soon as business seems to be booming for them. Keep up the good work.
