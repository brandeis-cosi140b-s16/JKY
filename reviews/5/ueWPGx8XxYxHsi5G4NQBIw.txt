Good service. Good food.

I like how their food doesn't taste heavy like most Mexican restaurants. Chips & salsa to start while you look over the menu, soup while you wait for your food & then the entrees! Everything tasted delicious.

& our server, Omar(?) was very attentive & very nice. 

I think I found my new favorite Mexican restaurant!
