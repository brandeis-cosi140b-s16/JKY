Everything we've had there is delicious. The fry bread is a must have, my kids love the fry bread dogs with cheese. We've tried the Navajo tacos, chimichangas, corn cakes, quesadillas, and big beef tamale - they've all been amazing. It's simple, fresh, homemade, and delicious. Beware the chili is spicy, but if you like spice its a good choice. The portions are huge and prices are very reasonable. Our favorite Mexican food place! The only issue is they close at 5, before dinner time for most people. So you have to get there early.
