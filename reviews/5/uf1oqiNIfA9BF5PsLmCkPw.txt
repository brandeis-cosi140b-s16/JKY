Finally! I've lived in Las Vegas for ten years and have yet to find quality Mexican food. I've tried Cafe Casera twice and have been more than satisfied. Nothing in the valley compares to the quality and deliciousness of the restaurant. The enchiladas with green sauce are unlike anything else around. This is my new go-to for Mexican food!
