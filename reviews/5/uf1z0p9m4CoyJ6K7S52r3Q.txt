Great chips and salsa, carne asada burrito, side of beans, side of rice, large coke $5.40 tax included on Thursdays. WOW show me where else you can get that?

The place is a dive similar to many I've eaten at in Mexico. That's fine for me makes me kind of nostalgic for the time I spent down there. Is this place a drug front? Possible. It would explain how they stay open charging those prices. Maybe not a place to bring your wife or girlfriend but if your meeting a friend for lunch and you want something cheap and tasty. Bienvenidos a Maribels.
