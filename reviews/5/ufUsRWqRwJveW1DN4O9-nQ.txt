A friend and I we're staying at the Clarendon  for a staycation we went on a breakfast voucher for breakfast during the week day and we had a server name Jacob he was amazing went above and beyond even offered us or try horchata to put with our coffee very personable very cute. He brought out every kind of homemade salsa the restaurant had to offer without even asking him . Was unsure to try cafe tranquila cause I was obsessed with Gallo blanco but I was very much so pleasantly surprised ! Thanks Jacob !
