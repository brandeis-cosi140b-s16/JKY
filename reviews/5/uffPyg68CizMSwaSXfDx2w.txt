I'm absolutely in love with this place. Hands down one of my favorite little spots. I'm by no means Hawaiian or do I know much about the culture, but I don't believe I have to just to give a great review. All their food is fresh and it's simple. Sometimes trying out new place I can get a little overwhelmed by all the different options, but they keep it simple. If I were to compare it to some other restaurant I would honestly say its incomparable. You can choose between making a burrito bowl, a regular bowl with seaweed rice or brown rice, a salad, 3 tacos or their nachos. For me I ALWAYS go for the three tacos, I usually get each one different (Huli Huli Chicken, Kahlua Pig, Pulehu Steak, Grilled Fish, or Grilled Veggies).  From there you pick what you want on top of it. The other toppings are great, but in no way, shape or form compare to their homemade sauces! They have Charred Pineapple Verde (mild), Mango & Roasted Corn (medium) and Tomato w/ grilled Maui Onions (hot). Bottom line, if you go to Bruddah's and don't try their sauces and most of all their coconut Bark, you're missing out! Also on top of being amazing, their coconut bark switches up during specific holidays (Thanksgiving- they have pumpkin bark). I could go on forever, but you might as well check it out for yourself.
