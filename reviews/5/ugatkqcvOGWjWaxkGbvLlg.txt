It took us 4 months to get around to trying this place...we heard about this place from a colleague and were hesitant because of the lower star rating. We are sad we waited because we love it! We are native New Mexicans and have been very disappointed with the food here. This has become our new go-to Mexican food restaurant, hands down. I, personally, love the Poblano Cream Enchiladas - I'm salivating as I type. We have only eaten in the restaurant and have not been to the patio. We have been for lunch and then around 7 pm and it's been moderately busy and service has been good. Staff is friendly and accommodating. This place is located among a bunch of shops in downtown Scottsdale - so parking is spotty. They have their own lot but it's often full. My only complaint is that the tea isn't so great!

Give this place a try!
