This is authentic Mexican food the way it is meant to be. I especially have fallen in love with the enchiladas, but the burrito, flautas and chimichangas also have been quite tasty. Service is friendly, too. The only thing I wish for is a homier ambiance. Because it is a square space in a strip mall, it has the feeling of a square space in a strip mall. Some authentic rugs on the walls, a little more vibrant color and better furniture would help. But go there for the tasty food!
     Well, that didn't take long. Days after this review, over Thanksgiving Thursday and Friday (2014), The owners added some nice booths, new furniture and opened an addition by cutting into the space next door that used to be a little fitness center. Well done!
