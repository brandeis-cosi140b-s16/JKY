OMG!  Can't believe they have one in North Scottsdale, only 2 miles from my home, sssssoooo Happy, but Dangerous!  Great Mexican Food, and Great prices!  Close to my 24hr fitness, so at least I will be able to work out, before I have a Giant Green Chili, or Bean Burrito, my Husband loves the Fish Burrito!
