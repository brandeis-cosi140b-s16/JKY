Yum yum! I have tried something different every time I've gone and never been disappointed. The bean dip is amazing! Super fresh and warm. Also with the combos you get a soup to start and I dream about that soup, it's so good! Plus on top of that they have the best margaritas in many flavors. The service is always fast and efficient. I don't think we've ever waited for a table either.
