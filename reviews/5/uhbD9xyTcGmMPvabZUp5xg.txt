Ugh! How I love this little hole in the wall place.. their tamales are all to die for in my opinion! I crave tamales the most around Christmas time but I always get those odd cravings throughout the year, and I love how this place makes their fresh daily! It's like heaven for me, tamales on demand so I don't have to wait til the end of the year to get my fix!
But come early so they aren't out of what you want!!
