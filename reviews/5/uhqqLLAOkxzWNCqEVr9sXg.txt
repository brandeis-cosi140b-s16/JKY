We ate at KoMex for lunch on Saturday 3/30/13. We knew it was a popular place, so we went right when they opened at 11am.

We each ordered a taco fusion that we wanted and shared family style:
Fusion Bulgogi Fries (1/2 order) $5.99 - this was really tasty, and a half order was plenty for 5 of us to share.
Fusion Pork Burrito $5.99 - this was a huge burrito with Mexican rice, green & brown onions, pico de gallo, lettuce, soy/sesame base sauce.
Bulgogi & Spicy Pork combo rice plate $9.99 - the bulgogi was my favoriate, the spicy pork was my husband's favorite

I tried the pork fusion taco, others at our table had the beef fusion taco, and the calamari fusion taco.

Everything was yummy and so inexpensive. The bill was $37 for the 5 of us, and we took leftover food home!  We'll be back to KoMex!
