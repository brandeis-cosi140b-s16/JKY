We come here about once every month or so and love it here. I like to order the molcajete, which is basically a huge pot filled with meat and seafood, in their "Diabla" sauce. It is spicy as heck, but I can't stop eating it! It's my favorite sauce by far. The food is always fresh, as well as the veggies they serve on the side. The staff are all friendly and very attentive to you. The atmosphere is very chill, with different cumbias playing softly in the background and a soccer game always on TV. They just recently remodeled and now there's way more seating, so wait times are cut in half. I love Playa Hermosa and am a loyal regular. Five out of five stars.
