Last weekend, Darren and I went to Chica Loca Taco during the Shadyside Arts Festival and were blown away. I had the Al Pastor which has pulled pork and pineapple and it had me swooning. The tortilla is doubled and the moist, salty pork compliments the pineapple and vice versa. 

The guacamole was really good also as was the Mexican Street Corn which has some awesome sauce on it that you have to taste to believe.
