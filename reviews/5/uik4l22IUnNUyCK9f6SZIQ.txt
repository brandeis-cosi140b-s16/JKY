I go to Regio's a lot; today I went and want to reiterate how great I think it is.  I have been going there for a couple years - have never been disappointed in anything I've ordered.  Their beans are delicious, as is their menudo (only on Saturday and Sunday, unfortunately), and eveything else: tacos, burritos, enchiladas, chile rellenos, etc, etc, etc. is great.  It is so inexpensive it's hard to believe.  Today my bff and I had 5 tacos and an order of beans (between us) and it was $10. HELLO! We had the mini-tacos, but we were stuffed and left there saying how wonderful it was and how full we were.
  Check it out next time you're in the mood for some awesome, authentic Mexican food.  You will be glad you did.  Yummy.
