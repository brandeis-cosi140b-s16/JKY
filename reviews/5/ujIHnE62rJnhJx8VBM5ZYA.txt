Went here based on the 4.5 stars on yelp. Was craving a mexican shrimp cocktail. It was bomb! Loaded with shrimp,  avocados, tomatoes, cucumbers, onions and the sauce was perfect!  Didn't need to add a thing to it. Did I mention it is huge? My husband ordered the El pastor plate it was a little different then traditional El pastor but still yummy. The beans were amazing not the traditional pinto beans that you find every where they use Peruvian beans. We also got elote.  Super sweet and seasoned perfectly.  Very impressed, we will definitely be back. Keep in mind that they are closed on Sundays.
