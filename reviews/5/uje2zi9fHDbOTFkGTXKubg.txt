Discovered this gem when staying at the Downtown Grand Hotel. (why doesn't the hotel publicize The Commissary???) This is a great concept for quick & easy foodservice and beverage. Not necessarily plush....but definitely comfortable, with great hospitality.

Great coffee shop (Jenny is awesome!) with Lavazza....'nuff said.The latin chicken for lunch was incredible moist and with just the "right" amount of spices. Perfect. 

And, the bar at The Commissary (bartender Adriana...another terrific asset to The Commissary) was exactly what is needed after a long day out and exploring LV. Manager Kris Sainsbury should be complimented for his attention to guests throughout my 3 day stay. Overall, a very well run operation, with great food & beverage options!

This hotel needs to promote The Commissary as I would never had known it was here other than I just "happened" to stay here. Downtown Las Vegas is on the rebound and I would get here quickly as I have no doubt that the crowds will be here soon.

Now...if only they can figure out how to deal with the wind outside on the street so that we could have enjoyed the outside tables......

We will be back.
