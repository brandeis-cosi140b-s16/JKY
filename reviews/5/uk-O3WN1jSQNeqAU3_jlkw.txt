I've been going to Braddah's since the first location opened on rainbow so I was thrilled when I found out one would be opening across the street from my school! I have lunch here at least once a week and I still can't get enough. All of the ingredients are fresh and tasty. I've actually stopped going to chipotle since Braddahs opened because it's just so much better. My favorite thing to get is a steak burrito with seaweed rice, beans, Maui onion salsa, cheese, guac, cilantro, sour cream and some lime mmmmm also the pig is wonderful. The real gem of this place is the coconut bark, no matter how full I am from the burrito I can always eat a whole box of that lovely bark. Seriously try some! Everyone who works here is always super nice and helpful/inviting. So much love for Braddah's!
