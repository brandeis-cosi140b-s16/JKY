Don Lencho's is my favorite authentic Mexican food joint in the Valley.  The place is a hidden treasure tucked away in Peoria, I'm surprised more people don't know about it.  Always clean and inviting.  The staff always goes the extra mile to make sure the guest is at home and receives great service.
