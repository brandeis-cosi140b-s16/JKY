Prickly Pear Margaritas were ordered by my best friend and her mom-I had to join the party and ooh what a party it was!  YUMM!!  

I have to say that I have never had food like this!  I absolutely LOVED the authentic Spanish/Mexican wonderland of flavors which danced (not literally) on my plates.

Following the Prickly Pear party, I enjoyed the most amazing spinach salad: Spinach and Frisee Salad, Sweet and Spiced Pecans, Goat Cheese Croquette with Warm Chorizo Dressing - I want it now!!

Who would have thought that goat cheese in a croquette could be so decadent?  

The other members of my party enjoyed the tomato salad, and the chilled avocado soup.  We were all pleased as we moved onto the main course.  My best friends dad went with the suckling pork and I loved my oven roasted chicken.

Atmosphere: We went on a Sunday night so it was very very quite and intimate.  I can imagine it being much more alive on a weekend evening.  
Price: I think it was up there but thanks to visiting parents, I was able to dodge this one!
Food: Outstanding

I cannot believe I am just the 6th person to review this...lets go Yelpers I know you will LOVE this!
