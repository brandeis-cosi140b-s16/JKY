Needed a quick dinner on Sunday and wanted the BF to try out this great Yelp find.  We took our food to go.  The BF got carnitas nachos and I ordered the shrimp tostado.   He took a bite of my nachos and voila. ...it was a shared order.  There was a large portion of delicious sweet chunky shrimp, marinated perfectly.   The crunchy deep fried corn tortillas  with freshly sliced avocado. YUM!  My BF wanted three more orders.  I think that I will surprise him on the way home!
