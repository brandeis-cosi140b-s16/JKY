This was a truly memorable experience. Having just arrived to Phoenix from a long flight, were looking for a place to eat near the airport and ended up at Pitic based on Yelp reviews and how close it is in the airport. Location looked a bit weird with a fence and a strip mall what appears to be in the middle of nowhere.

As soon as we came in, the food, the service were all spectacular. We rarely order Mexican food so were not very familiar with the menu, in addition we did not want any meat. The head waiter took the time and helped us to order. We ordered vegetarian taco salad as well as vegetarian burrito. Both were spectacular. The desert was even better, not sure what it is called but it is an apply pastry - truly amazing.

We really liked this restaurant that even came back before our flight back to Toronto, unfortunately it was too early and there were not open. Highly recommend, humble location, great foodie place.
