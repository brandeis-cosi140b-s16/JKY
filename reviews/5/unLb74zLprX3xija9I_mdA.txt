I haven't been to Top Shelf in almost 5 years... I forgot how good it was! 

My hubby and I came here last weekend for dinner (check out their website, they had a printable coupon when I was on there last week - hey it's a recession, I'll take what I can get!) 

Anyway, we usually end up wanting the same dish when we go out so we decided to pick 2 and share. I ordered the sampler platter and he ordered the Burrito Fundido. Both were excellent! I do recommend to ask for their "hot sauce" as the salsa they first give you is a little weak - just mix the two together for a perfect fix. Even my husband agreed the salsa needed some kick and he doesn't handle the hot stuff like I do. 

Now onto the awesome beer specials! 32 oz domestics for $4.75! My mug was so big I felt like I was doing bicep curls. Awesome. We asked the waitress, who was extremely attentive, what the beer price is like during "happy hour"... drum roll..... $3.95. I don't know how they stay in business with prices like that but I'm all for it. 

After dinner we moved into the huge bar area for another drink. They had so many flat screens I couldn't decide which one to watch. We visited on a Saturday night but left around 9pm to meet up with friends and the place was just as busy as when we arrived for dinner. That many people can't be wrong!
