LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT!!!!  I've eaten there several times - probably once a week since they opened - and yes, the line is long and maybe the way they prepare your food could be a bit more organized.  But the FLAVORS..OMG...so worth the wait.  The fresh made corn or 50/50 tortillas that are made right before your eyes - they taste so good that I crave them.  I've had the tacos and the enchiladas and my favorite are:  1) to get one pork taco and one chicken taco with a mix of cheese, pico salsa, crema, and gotta get the guac; or 2) when I'm in the 'lada mood is to get one pork and one potato (yes-potato-they're AWESOME!!) with the red sauce and a mix of cheese, the pico salsa, the crema and the guac.  Two tacos or two 'ladas may not seem like enough, but it is...I can't finish them.  You can also add one more for an additional charge if you're really hungry.  The staff is great - they have a fanstatic attitude and give you service with a smile.  Even though sometimes it is frustrating to stand and wait when the line is out the door, you get a positive vibe.  The place is fresh and clean -could probably use more parking, but we ARE in downtown Phoenix.
