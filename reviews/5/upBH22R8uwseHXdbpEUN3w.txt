Oh man. This place is awesome. They've got great service, and I don't know how they make those chips, but it's a good thing those things aren't for sale somewhere because I'd get so fat if I could eat them at home. The salsa you get isn't the most amazing thing I've had, but the chips definitely make up for it. I really like their guacamole too. Tastes really fresh and really delicious.

They're food's great too. I've tried their tortas and their tacos, and I loved them. I also got the fajita taco salad once, but that wasn't as good in my opinion. They've got some egg dishes too that I'm wanting to try. The best part about Mas Amigos though is that it's cheap even though it's delicious and filling. I've never paid more than $10 a person, and I usually only pay around $5 and I'm satisfied. I'm really happy this place is here.
