This place is great. It's like chipotle, but 10x better. My go to is the pulehu steak however all the meat choices are fantastic. To top it off, drive thru. I can get this tasty goodness without leaving the confines of my car. I just hope this location stays open, because the previous business that was there didn't seem to do too well.
