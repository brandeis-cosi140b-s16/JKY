OK so fish tacos!! Was never really a huge fan but after reading many reviews in general about them and this west coast taco obsession craze thing going on I decided to give it a whirl. I must have passed this place a thousand times and caught the indian head out front and not go in. First thing is this is a one man show, he takes the order and makes the food, so prepare for a short wait. 

I ordered a fish taco and a chicken taco with a cup of water. As soon as I paid he washed his hands at the sink behind the counter which is always good to actually see. WARNING..if you pay with a credit/debit card you will have to pay .50 cent surcharge, not stingy just saying. The taco sauce bar had a selection of 5 sauces, all of which range from mild to their spicy chipotle sauce. I like when restaurants put the food rating right where you can see it instead of being hidden in some back window somewhere, it is located directly in front of register. It always reassuring to see that A rating.

The fish taco was MASSIVE and crunchy. The ingredients tasted fresh and it was meaty or fishy I should say. It was the best fish taco I've ever had, the server was super friendly and even changed the channel to an english speaking channel, antique road show rocks! I will probably never go back to Robertos ever again after coming here,  would also like to try other stuff on the menu. This is a mom and pop shop, family run and close to home.

BTW me and Ellen F. ate for $14.00!! Awesome value for what you get. I wanted to eat some more but dinner plans suddenly came up and I was eating so couldn't get stuffed. We will def be coming back for more really soon, they open at 7am. Say hi to spiderman!! You can catch him hanging around the register on a rack.
