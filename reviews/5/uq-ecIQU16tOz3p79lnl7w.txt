Not sure what was BETTER!...the food or the service?

Every time I stop at this location the staff is just so welcoming. For a "fast" food service I wouldn't necessarily expect it but the people that work there must love their job because it seems apparent. They are so friendly, every time. The food is always awesome. Fresh and fast. Reasonably priced as well. Love, love, love.
