Re-decorated, re-named, new menu, new chef, new new new. Was fortunate and grateful to get a table at the soft opening. Gonna miss mucho gusto. Seared scallops for the appetizer were really fantastic, if not just a tad too sweet--they're in a bed of "gran marnier syrup." The black bean mango soup with chorizo is fantastic. Will get it again next visit. The duck was very very good, although just a little chewy. The half roasted chicken was the best of all the entrees I tried. Prices here are higher than what they were before, although the dishes have the quality and presentation to justify it. No entrees under $20 makes me wonder if the heart of a college town is the best location for them, but our server told us a happy hour will start once the grand opening happens. All the servers are awesome, attentive, knowledgeable of the menu, and friendly. Great beer selection, and extensive wine list as well. Definitely plan to return.
