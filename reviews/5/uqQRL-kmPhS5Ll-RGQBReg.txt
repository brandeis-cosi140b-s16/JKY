What a great combination of great food and service!  It was an unexpectedly busy Sunday, 8/16, night yet the manager handled it like a pro.  As is was my birthday my Father had come in earlier in the day asking to reserve a table and the manager said 'no need, we will have plenty of space tonight'.  Whoops...Yet the Sunday night manager rectified everything quickly and with a smile.  The food was delicious, and this is the second time I have been here and they are 2 for 2.  I have no doubt they will be 3 for 3 after my next visit for some of those nachos and a beast burrito....also Victory IPA on tap, nice work.
