I met a friend here for dinner one night back in March and we had an amazing and memorable experience.  First, the patio is fantastic - large, shaded and totally relaxing.   Our server absolutely, hands down made the night even better - he was funny, engaging and completely directed our culinary adventure.  We started with some craft cocktails that were expertly mixed and a great way to kick off our experience.  We shared the braised duck taquitos to start and we shared the chile relleno and the chimichanga for our appetizers.  The food was incredible and our server convinced us to order some things we normally would not have.  This place is definitely worth checking out next time you are in Tempe!
