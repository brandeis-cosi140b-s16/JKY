i love this place. a friend of mine in college turned me onto it and i have been coming here for years now. i always bring out of town guests/new people here. the look of when you tell them "yeah its chinese/mexican throws them off quite a bit.

the food is great! i always eat too much and leave feeling ridiculously full. the combination of chinese/mexican works amazingly well. the jade red chicken is pretty much their staple item. i normally always get that in some form, and usually their emerald chicken. their snickerdoodle cookies are amazing too. first timers you can sample all the items before making your decision too. their staff is very helpful for new people who have not been there or ordered before.

price is right. not very expensive but you get a ton of food for your money spent. if you come here on a friday night it will most likely be super busy. be prepared to wait a little bit to get your food. other than that i have no complaints.
