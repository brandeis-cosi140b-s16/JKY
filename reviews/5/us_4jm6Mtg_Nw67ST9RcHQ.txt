A decent Mexican food restaurant off the strip in Las Vegas. This restaurant is located inside of Sam's Town. I like the food and service here. I would also be willing to say, that it's one of my favorite Mexican food restaurants in Vegas. Certainly, if you are visiting or staying at or near this property, you should give W & J's a shot. It's good for a dependably filling, tasty meal at a very reasonable off the Strip price.
