This is my favorite Mexican restaurant. It's a Chipotle-style counter ordering system, but tastes completely unique. After getting your food, you can pick several salsas to have with your meal.  My favorite is the salsa that looks like wasabi, while tasting nothing like wasabi... I'm not sure what it is, but it's purely awesome. You must try it if you go here, as long as you can handle hot. It's labeled "extra hot.,"

The burritos with green chili beef is my go-to menu item. It's very filling and tasty for a good price. One of these days when I don't feel like stuffing myself I may try the street tacos which look fantastic and seem to be a popular item.
