I was excited to try such a highly reviewed Yelp 5 STAR taco shop. When I arrived I was most surprised by the strange location near Sunnyslope, in a little strip mall. 

I ordered the tacos, of course: "5 Small - $7.70" And helped myself to the salsa bar.
Tinga - chicken
Morita  - pork
Pastor - pork
Barbacoa - beef 
Asada - beef

Short and sweet: Good portion size, build how I wanted (Chipotle line style ordering) and everyone of them a flavorgasm in my mouth.

Who woulda thunk this would be where I would find my taco soulmates?
