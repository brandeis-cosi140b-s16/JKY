$1 TACOS!!!! Who can beat that?! Not even Tacos Mexico across the street, not only are the tacos cheap but they are deliciosos!!! Also, they are the only ones, pretty much, that serve tacos de pollo  (my favorite). The salsas are uncovered, but who cares they're good!!! The staff is always friendly and funny to talk to. Make sure to bring your piggy banks, cash only.
