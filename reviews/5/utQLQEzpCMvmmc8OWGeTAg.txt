WHAT IS THIS PLACE and WHY DID I NOT TRY IT UNTIL NOW. I think this is where Jesus gets his Mexican food when he visits Las Vegas (but it is Sin City, so I'm not sure that's all that often). I don't care that it might one day end up on the Dirty Dining section of the newspaper or the local news. I don't care that it has no nutritional value and that its ingredients are not top notch. This place doesn't look like it makes sense until it makes all the sense in the world inside your mouth. 

The menu is not high on description, but it is low on prices. It is not health food, nor could it really be considered nourishment in any sense of the word. I had the cheese roll ups, which, vegetarians be forewarned, have beef inside. (Though if you had an aversion to beef, this place might not be for you anyway.) My friend ordered what I had and a beef taco, and total it was $6 and change. Fine by me! Taco Bell sells chemicals for more expensive prices. 

I am salivating for Jesus' favorite Mexican food now. Too bad it is in an awkward part of town for me to get to!
