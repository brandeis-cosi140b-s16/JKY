Best Torta Ahogada in Vegas!!  My friends are from Guadalajara, so they told me I had to try this place.  Suffice to say, I was not disappointed.  I just let my friends order and I just feasted.  There was a potato taco that they topped with carnitas... phenomenal.  Possibly my favorite item.  The Torta Ahogada reminded me of a Mexican French dip sandwich.  Loads of meat drenched in a delicious red sauce.  I only wish I had a bowl of sauce so I could drown my entire sandwich in it.  The bread held up well to the generous helping of sauce on the plate.  Absorded all that goodness while maintaining its form.  So glad my bread didn't disintegrate.  And the best part of the meal, the bill.  Cheaper than Roberto's and much better!!!
