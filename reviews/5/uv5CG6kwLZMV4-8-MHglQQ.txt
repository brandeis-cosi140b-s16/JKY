We stopped in Old Pueblo for lunch on a road trip. Having never actually stopped in Florence before, I thought (like many do) that the prison is the only game in town. That may be mostly true, but at least there is some delicious food. Old Pueblo gave us some of the best road trip food we've had -- and maybe just all around great food. Michael had a burrito that was so good he finished it and immediately ordered a second and ate that one too. I had some nice enchiladas. In addition to the food, the restaurant is cheerful and comfortable and the service also top notch from our lovely waitress from Milwaukee. We had a great lunch!
