I couldn't wait to try their fish tacos here! When I got to the counter I was disappointed because they don't do fried fish tacos. I was bummed but I decided to try the Cajun fish taco, with a beef taco just in case I didn't like the fish. The fish taco was delicious especially when it's served with the Wahoo's Green sauce. The green sauce is a sour cream base with I think Cilantro? I could be wrong but it is so good! The beef taco was tasty. You also get a choice of either white rice or brown rice with your combo. I liked the white rice because they put some type of fresh salsa on the top. It reminds me of what my mom puts on top of white rice tomatoes, onions a little fish sauce. Don't worry this topping doesn't have fish sauce in it. My combo was $6.50. It also comes with black beans or Cajun white beans but I passed on that. 
I also had the Chicken Tortilla Soup for $3.89 it was big bowl for that price. It was light , not salty and soothing after a crazy day at the airport. 

The decor reminded me of the surfer/skater kids I used to go to school with in junior high. I think the way Wahoo chose to decorate their space is much more tasteful than Chronic Tacos. There is no graffiti here just random stickers. It was also cool how the bar is glass enclosed in the middle of the restaurant. I can't wait till the one in Boca Park opens!
