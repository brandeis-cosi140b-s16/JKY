Love the late night midweek cook here.  The cleanliest Roberto's I've been to EVER.  I always tip them here because they work hard, understand English & they are always pleasant people at the counter.  Give them a smile & they smile back. I hate when I smile & I get death stare. That's what keeps us coming back.

You can tell a lot from an establishment when the employees are cleanly, cheerful & don't mind if you want more.  They're happy to be working and they remind me of myself when I started out in the fast food industry.  I feel like they go above & beyond, as I did for my regulars. You show me respect I give it back, plus a tip. :D  Probably the cleanliest fast food place I've ever been to. During the afternoon is the best time to go.

My Boyfriend usually gets Carne Asada Quesadilla only cheese.  I have a moderate allergy to Wheat so I grab the Carne Asada Cheese fries, only refried beans, steak and cheese.  I hate the avocado, pico de gallo & sour cream. It makes the fries soggy. yuck.

Those of you that don't tip shame on you. :( Whip out your phone calulator & take the Total multiply by .15
