I mostly go to the Monroe Street location due to living closer to it, however I enjoy the Hildale one much more. The food here is much more Tex Mex rather than authentic Mexican. The staff has always been friendly and I can always get seated within 5 minutes. My go to meal is the spicy fries and the half order of nachos. I suggest the half order of nachos if you are getting them as an appetizer or sharing them with another person due to the amount you receive.
