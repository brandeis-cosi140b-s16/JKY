Cabo fish taco is the best restaurant in NODA. We go here probably once a month and the food has never disappointed. They bring out a basket of corn/tomato salsa and chips for everyone. It is a bit difficult to eat but I love the corn in this. My favorite restaurant salsa! The grilled Serrano chicken tacos are my go-to. Last time I went they were so big I couldn't even finish them. The white sauce is the best, I always order an extra side of it. The mashers (mashed potatoes) are great. They are obviously made from scratch and are some of the best I've ever had. The El Cheapo is a great basic margarita. Highly recommend Cabo, great value and great food!
