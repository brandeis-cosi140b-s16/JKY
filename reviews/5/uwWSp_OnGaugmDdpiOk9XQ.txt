Saw it on the street today at lunchtime.  Pulled over and checked it on YELP, after which I just had to try it.
The young woman recommended the chicken stew when I asked her what to take back to my office. ..and told me to tear up the tortilla and drop it into the stew.
I took it back to work and found myself not in my office, but in heaven.  GREAT STUFF!  There's still a faint burning on my tongue, adn a slight wateriness in my eyes...and I can't wait to get back for more.  And next time, I'll get multiple orders...not that's it's not filling...it's just too damn good to not have more!!
