This is the perfect location for an intimate date night or family get together. You will find parking very convenient and the food is incredible!
I ordered a shredded beef chimichanga and it exceeded my expectations. I had expected something on the smaller side but the portion was more than enough. I can't get over how delectable it was! The meat was cooked to perfection!! I also ordered a mojito which can make or break my decision on where I dine. ;)  It was delish and mojito's are my drink!! Yummmmy.. I will definitely return soon.
