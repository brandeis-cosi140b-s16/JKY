I recently held a happy hour event for Realtors at Beach Club Cantina and it was a blast! I worked with Peter, the owner, for a few weeks leading up to the event to plan everything out and he was so gracious and helpful throughout the process, as tedious as it was and given the circumstances beyond either of our control. The Realtors and Lenders who showed up to the event were very impressed with the restaurant and the quality of the food and drinks. Everyone had a great time and the staff was very accommodating. We are looking forward to another great event here in the future!
