Taco Truck! This is the right way for this yanqui to start this trip in AZ. Stopped late in the evening after getting my car rental. Place is classy - parking and picnic tables.

Got 2 carne and 2 carnitas tacos. Both really good, classic tasting tacos. Real tortillas. The only thing that's missing is some music. Def stop by after you rent a car.
