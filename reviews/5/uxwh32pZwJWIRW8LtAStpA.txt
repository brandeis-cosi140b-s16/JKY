I eat at the Shack at least once a week.
I'll be the first to admit that the exterior of the Shack kept me away for a long time.  I'm a pretty big food snob, so I judge the proverbial book by the proverbial cover and didn't go.
It wasn't until a friend took me by the hand and personally escorted me to the Shack that I discovered the gem it is.  Now I'm hooked.  The breakfast burritos have become our whole office's regular Friday tradition,and I'm typically there for a lunch or two during the week.
The food is fresh, Kurt and Peggy, the owners, become family after just a visit or two, and the ambiance really begins to grow on you.  It's eclectic!
Give the Burrito Shack a try.  You won't be sorry!!
