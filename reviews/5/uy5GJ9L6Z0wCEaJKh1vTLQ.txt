Waiting for my 5 tacos.....got Asada, pastor, cabeza, tripa and chicharron ooooh n a Fresca .....waiting patiently.
Place is nice.....service is great.....except for the young cook yelling at the aawsome cashier.
Anyways food is ready n im about to dig in!!!

First is the Pastor.....great taste just like the ones I member from TJ when I was a kid.

Next is the asada....Wow not dry like other places I have tried....nice n tender....very good

Next is the cabeza.....hmmmmmm.....great taste....nice n juicy....love the cabeza.

Next is the Chicharron....Oh my the chicharron is the kind that has meat on.....lordy lord!!! Yummy!!!!
