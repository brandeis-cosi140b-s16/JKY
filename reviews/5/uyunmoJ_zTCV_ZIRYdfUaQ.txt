Oh El Toro, how I love you!

I've been a loyal patron at the El Toro on South Neil for five years, eating there at least once a month--and usually once a week in the summer.  Sitting on their patio getting schnockered on margaritas is a fabulous way to spend a summer day, and, oh yeah, the food is awesome.  When they mentioned they were moving, I was understandably nervous.

I shouldn't have worried.  Their new building, freshly renovated, is gorgeous--and only two blocks from my house.  (Can you say 'stumbling-distance'?)  The bar area has less seating, but over all, the seating seems to have expanded.  The d√©cor is much more understated and less kitschy, which makes the whole place seem classier.  The outdoor seating area hasn't opened yet, but it looks fabulous, with several glass doors separating it from the inside, so even if you prefer to eat indoors, you can still enjoy the summer sun with your margarita.

The food is consistently good and very fast, and the margaritas are strong.  It's no longer on the menu (the owner told me they are redoing the daily specials), but the Paisa Burritos are delish.  You can't really go wrong with chorizo-stuffed tortillas slathered in cheese sauce!  I also tried something new: a Margarona.  It's a frozen margarita with a bottle of Corona up-ended into it.  Trust me, it tastes better than it sounds, and it looks really bad-ass.

Two small nitpicks: a distinct lack of parking during lunch--after 5 you can park across Williams Street at Bacon & Van Buskirk--and during the busy times (Saturday nights, for example) the food and service is much slower than at their old location.  I hope this is just them working out a few kinks in the kitchen and they'll return to their speedy service in time for me setting up camp on the patio this summer!
