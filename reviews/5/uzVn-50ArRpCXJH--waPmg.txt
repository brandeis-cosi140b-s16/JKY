Wow. What can I write about Bahia San Carlos... well, let's start with it is "off the hook" delicious! I tell everyone I know that if they are going to Phoenix this should be the first stop. I order the Marinated Filet - their house specialty. Why? Well, because it is their house specialty! 

The flavors in this dish are incredible. It is spicy (don't be a hater if you can't handle the heat) and is served on a bed of super hot french fries. I asked why once and was told that the french fries keep the fish hot while you eat it... they are right because it is wonderful. Rice and beans are top notch. Fresh tortillas (you choose corn or flour). Amazing. 

The have incredible cerviche. All of their "cocktail" related items are delicious (not the "sippy" kind, the "shrimpy" kind) 

Something to drink? It wasn't until I went with a friend that speaks Spanish at dinner time that I learned they serve Michelados. They basically pour the cerveza of your choice into a spicy, wonderful mixture of wonderfulness. When I took my first sip I remained tentative but then fell in love. Just when I thought it couldn't get any better! 

Service is exceptional. They remember me even when I come back after a year. And, they always ask about a coworker who I used to come in with a few years ago. 

I don't say this about a lot of places but San Carlos Bay is on my top 10 spots in the world. Yes, it is a darn good piece of fish! DO NOT be fooled by the location or the look of this place. Just park behind and go on in. And, order the Marinated Filet.
