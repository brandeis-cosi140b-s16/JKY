I first visited this establishment back in 2008 while on vacation in Las Vegas. We have family in the area so they know the good "local" places to eat outside of the strip. 

My first visit was very good - coming from Texas where we get top of the line Tex-Mex, as well as authentically cooked Mexican dishes. 

My favvvvorite item on the menu is the "Spicy Chilorio"... The words I want to use to describe the feeling I get when I wrap this creamy, cheesy mixture into a fresh flour tortilla - are not suitable for your general audience. When I tell you I dream about this dish, I am not telling a lie! It is perfectly spicy, very creamy but not overpowering like some similar dishes can be. 

On my last visit in late November - my entire table of 5 ordered the "Spicy Chilorio", and everyone agreed with me on how amazing the flavor is!

The service here is always great. I wish I could remember the name of our server assistant, he was white, very tall, and very attentive. He NEVER let our glasses get even close to halfway empty. The chips and salsa were constant - he was definitely better than our waitress (who was just fine, no complaints!). 

The only draw back for me, is the location! It seemed to be sort of shady, not somewhere we wanted to be late at night. 

Overall, I love this place!
