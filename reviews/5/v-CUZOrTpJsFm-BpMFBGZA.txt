Los Antojos is a small little restaurant with amazing food. Located in a unpretentious area of Eastern and Sahara, Los Antojos does not disappoint. Bringing their food and culture from Mexico City, the restaurant has a friendly and laid back atmosphere with the best hurrache in town, my favorite is the alambre hurrache. With Familia P.Luche on the tv and families laughing Los Antojos is simply the best. All the food is excellent there. A must for locals and visitors :)
