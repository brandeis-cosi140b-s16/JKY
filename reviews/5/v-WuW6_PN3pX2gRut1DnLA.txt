Awesome food-hands down best guacamole I've ever tasted-excellent shrimp and fried chicken tacos and great fried chicken and waffles (and my husband is definitely an expert!!).
The service was also fast and courteous,all while putting up with our 2 years old daughter!!!
I would definitely recommend this restaurant and we will for sure come back!
