The food was delicious, from the cheese and bean dip appetizer to my chimichanga entree. The portions were plentiful that my three friends and I all had to take part of our meals home. They also loved the Mexican Bulldogs, which I wish I had a sip of (but I'm pregnant). The service was timely and the chips were refilled without being asked which was a nice touch.
