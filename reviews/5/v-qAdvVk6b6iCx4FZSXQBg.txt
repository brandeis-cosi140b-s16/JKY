When anyone from Phoenix, or especially Tucson, considers a Mexican food joint ending in "...berto's" it is extremely easy to picture a place that is rather disgusting and probably about to get shut down.

Not so with Filiberto's. This PARTICULAR location breaks the stereotype of the abused and unclean fast Mexican food restaurant by actually being cleaner than most sit-down restaurants. I've been going here for quite some time now and this location is always spotless and the food is always excellent.

I never have to worry about getting sick when I go to this place. There are awards for their quality and cleanliness all over the walls. If you've been burned by other ____berto's places, give this one its rightful chance, you'll be getting what you were intended to.

Well done!
