A lot of my friends were telling me about the Mexican food at LB Inn in Florence, so I drove down to try it.  We arrived at about 3PM on a Saturday and received outstanding service.  I happen to love salsa, and theirs did not disappoint - very fresh with a hint of garlic, Mexican oregano and cumin.  All three of us decided on the lunch menu taco and enchilada plate.  I found the enchilada sauce to be very similar to what I grew up with in El Paso - wonderful and fairly mild.  Next time I will ask for them to put onions in my enchilada, though!  My taco was shredded beef and it too was excellent.  Beans and rice are very good, as well.  I definitely will return soon!
