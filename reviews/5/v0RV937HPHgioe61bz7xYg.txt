OMG, why haven't I been to Los Dos Molinos sooner?

I have been to the location down on Central & Baseline YEARS ago but with this new location opening about a year ago, I was excited to try it again.  I am so bummed that I didn't try it sooner.  It ended up on our "list of places to go before we move" and now I wish that we had been going here more often. 

We walk in, the atmospher is really charming.  It's set up kind of like a "cantina" maybe?  Clean, nicely decorated and just a charming resturant overall.  They have a bar area you can sit in or they also have some dinning rooms off the bar and then some additional seating outside.  It was a bit warm out still so we opted for inside.   

First round comes the chips & salsa.  You get Hot & Hotter.  If you're sensitive to spicy food, this might not be the place for you.   That being siad, their salsas are so flavorful and I crave it just as I am writing this! 

Our server was really friendly and noticably attentative as were the other employees.  You never waited for anything.  It was busy too, so the service in my oppinion was fantastic for the amount of other tables.

I ordered the Chimi with red sauce. It was so yummy and it had a kick to it as well.  This rivals Ajo Al's for sure. 

If you want good mexican food and a nice evening out, this is your place!
