After living in Southern California, it's hard to impress me with Mexican food. I'm used to real mexican food, great street tacos, and getting it all cheap. Chicken Itza is better than any other mexican food I've had in Las Vegas because it's real.  The curb appeal of the shopping center is lacking, but my favorite foods always come from dives and holes in the wall. The chicken in the enchiladas was amazing, their green sauce made me tongue happy and their horchata was authentic. We spoke with the owner, and he is delightful. Give Chicken Itza a chance, your taste buds will thank you.
