Their California Burrito is a sign that a higher being surely exists. Everything I have tried here has been delicious, however. Literally everything. This is by far my favorite place to grab some Mexican food.

The only thing that I'm not to keen on about this place is that they aren't always on their game with their customer service. The first time I came into this place the girl working there was insanely rude, but it has gotten better through time. I'm usually rolling in pretty late, and I'm sure with how busy they are that the people working there are just more than ready to go home. I can't really hate on  them for that.
