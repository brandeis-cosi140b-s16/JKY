I've only ordered for delivery from David's, but good god, are they fast! PLUS you can put in orders through Yelp. How kickass is that?!

I order the carne asada burrito every time.. for a reason. It's a bomb burrito! You don't get those cheese and pico pockets exploding on you every few bites. I also get the chili.. lemme tell ya, I ain't no chili expert, but David's does it right. It surely is delectable. And the prices are low! Can't beat it. Ha, beat it.

I would highly recommend this joint to ANYONE in Old Town or surrounding areas. You won't be let down.
