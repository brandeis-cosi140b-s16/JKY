So I just returned from Bordeaux, France and Venice,  Italy.  I've been living here in Fountain Hills and eating at Senior Taco for over 10 years.  It's finally time to write this review.  Senior Taco is my go to comfort Mexican place when I get home from my travels.  I can honestly say this is better than much of the food I had this past week in Europe.  And we ate at some very expensive and nice restaurants.  Okay I didn't have Mexican food there but in terms of quality and the flavors that are in this food.... Senior Taco For The Win!!!  From the enchiladas to the burritos and tacos everything is bursting with flavor.  The salsas are to die for (especially the roasted chili oil.)  The portions are huge and I almost always finish what I order.  Do you know why...?  Go to senior taco, order anything and you will understand.  This place simply ROCKS!!  OH,  and the Margaritas are pretty good too.  Mucho Bueno!!  I don't hand out 5stars easily.
