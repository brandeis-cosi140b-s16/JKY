Chipotle is amazing, and this one is no different from all of the others. Fast service, great food, reasonable price.

Get the bowl not the burrito for more food. I think they charge 99 cents for a tortilla with the bowl so it is no longer free. I was originally mad about this but it makes sense for them. Also make sure to get salad dressing on the bowl, it makes it infinitely better.
