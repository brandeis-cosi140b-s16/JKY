So much better than Roberto's, for real! Open 24hrs! And they have a drive thru! and the have aguas frescas! Pretty much any Mexican plate you can think of on the menu.  I like the tacos de cabeza, Birra's bomb.com, barbacoa, chile relleno, it's pretty much all good.  Asked the cook for grilled onions no problem.  Staff friendly and place seems clean, compared to Roberto's.
