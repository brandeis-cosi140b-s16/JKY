So...I do not eat much Mexican food....but this place is excellent. A great variety of menu items above and beyond the usual boring choices you would find anyplace else.
Not to mention the amazing service.
I might have to start eating Mexican more often....plus I live right around the corner....don't know what took me so long to try this place.
