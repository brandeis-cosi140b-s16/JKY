This bar is kind of hidden, if you're not looking you will pass it! Went there by chance the name caught my attention and I had to check it out. I have to say its a great find. The food is good, my favorite is the Carne Asada Nachos! The tacos are really good too.  The drinks are inexpensive and the staff is very friendly.  Lots of regulars that go there but they are welcoming. I have since returned several times to this bar and always bring more friends when I come.
