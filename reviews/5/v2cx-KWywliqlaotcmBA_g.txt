So I've been here twice.  Both times, I thought the food was excellent.  Sam's enchiladas, while non-traditional, are admittedly my favorite in town; they are significantly better than Barrio Caf√©.  The portions are huge; the prices, very reasonable; and the atmosphere, especially the beautiful outdoor patio near the fountain, is fantastic on nice Phoenix days.  

And this is all before you consider the chips.  Good gracious, the chips and salsa!  Five star worthy chips and salsa.
