We never ventured into this place because it is attached to a veterinary clinic,  BIG MISTAKE. If only we knew what we had been missing.   I'm a super stickler for cleanliness and I just couldn't get past it. Alas, we met a relative of the owners who told us we just had to try it and she was so right.  We were seated within 5 minutes of entering the door. Drinks and chips were on our table immediately. The salsa was just the right amount of spice and not overpowered with cilantro (I hate cilantro and thus I get very picky about salsa).  We had to wait about 5 min to order which would give the average customer time to look over the menu. We happened to have gotten recommendations on what to eat before going so we already knew what we wanted. Within 5-7 min the food was on our table, served on hot plates and the food was hot.  My husband had carmones chipotle (sorry if I spelled it wrong but it's shrimp with a chipotle sauce). He was immediately in love.  He completely cleaned his plate which isn't something he normally does.  He couldn't stop eating.  I'm a light eater and I ordered 2 beef soft tacos and rice.  I took half the rice and a taco home,  I was so filled up on the delish chips and salsa I couldn't eat all my meal. We also had a house margarita which was quite tasty and definitely had a healthy amount of alcohol in it. Next time I will try chicken or shredded beef instead of the ground beef to see which I like better. And I will branch out to some combo platters which I don't do until I know I like a place.  My husband says he will order the same thing! They have a nice patio set up and the inside is typical Mexican restaurant decor,  several different colors of paint on the walls that go together nicely. A cute little bar area where they mix up goodness.  We asked about the crabs on the walls and found out the owner was a crab fisherman in Alaska.  Gabby was our server and was really pleasant and answered all our questions.
