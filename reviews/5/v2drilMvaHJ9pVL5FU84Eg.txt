El Molino consistently has some of the best "fast" Mexican food in Scottsdale. I really find it a go to place for their chicken burrito, it is truly fabulous. White meat chicken, juicy and wet with a green (?) spicy sauce-it is hot and delicious. I have never found a better chicken burrito. Awesome! Sometimes I think their prices are high, but when in for lunch and the "make it a combo" deal is used (you gotta look for it), it makes it a very reasonable venture.
