I've been in the Phoenix area for eight months and FINALLY, FINALLY I have found Mexican food worthy of the cultural name.  Always a good sign when the friendly counter staff greet you in Spanish.  They make their own Michoacan style ice cream.  The Flautas Ahogadas with the spicy sauce are BOMB.com!!   I also had the chicken soup that reminded me of my Mother's.  "Happy"!!   The Milanesa torta was perfect.  My only complaint was that I got full and couldn't eat any more.  But I will be back tomorrow.  I'm a true Mexican/American and I love my heritage inspired foods.  Highly recommend this place.   10 STARS!!!!
