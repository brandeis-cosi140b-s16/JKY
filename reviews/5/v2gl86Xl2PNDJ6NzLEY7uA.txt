Thank you yelpers.  I was looking for great Mexican food and you guys and gals were great.  We came here Friday after a game and I was impressed.

To begin it is not a sit down restaraunt.  You place your order at the counter then find a table.  I ordered the carne asada tacos and they were awesome.  They had onions and cilantro.  The slasa was great.  These little tacos were a great way to end the day.  Now if they sold tequila it would be perfect.  But I do recomend it for those who want delicious tacos.
