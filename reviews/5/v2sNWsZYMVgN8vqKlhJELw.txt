i honestly did not expect much from this restaurant upon first glance on the Groupon offer site. after tasting their delicious food, i am a new loyal customer at this neighborhood eatery! i ordered to-go and i was shocked at the over abundance of food for 2 entrees. they packed each dish separately (one package for beans and rice, one box for the Fish Mexican Style, one for the Mix Seafood Tostada, and 1 container of the salsa , one for 2 huge slices of perfectly ripe avocado and another for guacamole. oh, yea, i forgot the huge back of non-greasy , crunchy , chips for the salsa. ) most take-out only include the entree ordered. there was enough food for 4 people from this take out bag! the food was hot 25 mins later when i arrived home and not a single drop was spilled. the beans and rice was perfect texture and right spices added. the Fish Mexicana was made with a light , flaky  Tilapia topped with peppers and onions with a tangy salsa-like  tomato sauce. the mixed seafood tostada really made me fall in love. it was a ceveche prepped dish with octopus, fish, and shrimp topped with limes. the chips and salsa were very light and not greasy or heavily ladden with oil. you can tell they make it in-house with a high quality cooking oil. the salsa and guacamole is fresh, fragrant, cool, and crispy with a hint of spicy. he manager and cashier was very friendly. they smiled and welcomed the Groupon. they got the order ready, packed in less than 15 mins! what a fantastic experience. i am going back tomorrow to try something else on the menu.
