A friend recommended this place to me and my guy pal so we decided to stop in one random afternoon.  Coming in, the place reminded me of a ski lodge.  There were booths set up everywhere and longboards, snowboards, stickers, and posters of all kinds of extreme sports tacked down.  The menu gives you a lot of options. You can have chicken, fish or tofu burritos, tacos, or all kinds of plates.  Jonathon at the register was extremely friendly and recommended the enchiladas. You basically order once you come in, they give you a number and then you sit and watch the awesome projector showing extreme sports clips of guys eating it and doing gnarly tricks. Apart from the restaurant is the bar, which is in a separate room that you can see through the huge glass window from the restaurant. What I love the most about this place is it is opened 24/7 with food and drinks.  Oh yeah!  

As for the food, my enchilada was tasty and my shrimp tacos was ehh. My guy pal got the bonsai plate with Cajan fish that was oh so very good.  I was pretty jealous.  Otherwise, this is another great place to grab a late night dinner or another place to sober after a night of partying.
