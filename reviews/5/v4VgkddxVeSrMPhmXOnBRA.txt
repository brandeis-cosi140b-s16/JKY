Love this place! Fantastic patio, great staff and on the occasion that the kitchen is a little backed up and taking a little longer the manager is there to make it right! I often come here with my family on a Sunday night and I would recommend it to anyone! The fajitas are to die for and I definitely recommend the coconut margarita! Yummy!!
