BOMB.COM for sure!!! I absolutely love this place!!! My favorite is there San Francisco Burrito ($5.95) it has carne asada, fresh pico de gallo, BACON, French fries. If I came here first I'd think Robertos was biting off them. Much cleaner than Robertos, I want to same the prices are about the same but the quality of the meat and seasonings in there burritos are by far way better than Robertos! Super quick service. I literally had my burrito 3 minutes after ordering. FRESHLY MADE! The serving size is huuuuuge! DONT EVEN LET ME GET STARTED ON THEIR GREEN SAUCE! SALSA VERDE IS THE BESSSST! I can finish a bottle all by myself with just one burrito! I have to have it in every bite! You will not be disappointed! Whenever I'm just craving a burrito, this is my go to spot. Definitely. They do have fries, nachos, tortas, combo plates etc. It's definitely a must try if you haven't already!
