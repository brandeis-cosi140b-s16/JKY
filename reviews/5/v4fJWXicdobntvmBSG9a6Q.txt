Things you need to have:

1. Fish Taco(s)
2. Chips and Salsa (Mild)
3. Bean Burrito 

I would suggest you go and get the Fish Taco Especial but I don't want to be at fault for making your taste buds physically explode with happiness off your tongue.

Oh, and the BEST THING?  The onion and cilantro mix that they have by the salsas....FOR FREE. I can't lie you guys...I have taken some home with me before even though I had no leftovers. Am I an onion thief? Maybe.  But if I go to jail, it would be worth it.
