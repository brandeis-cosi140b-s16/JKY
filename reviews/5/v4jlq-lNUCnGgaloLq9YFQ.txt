Yet another 5 star review. Its in a little bit of a rougher area, but not that terrible. The food is AMAZING!!!! Portions large enough to share.  The prices are almost criminal!!! It is insanely cheap. And when u order water, they give u bottled water, no charge. You also get free chips with salsa and guac. The owners are so sweet! We actually ended up bragging about  komex to some friends who are locals. They promised to go, as should you!
