We are staying in a hotel one block away, and ordered food to go. The guacamole was terrific, and the optional pomegranate seeds made it spectacular! We loved the hand made tortillas that really made the tacos special. We had a carne asada taco, and adobada, a shrimp, and a roja crema. Every one was delicious. The fabulous flan finished off a perfect dinner. And it was prepared in a short time. Very pleased. The atmosphere inside is delightful.
