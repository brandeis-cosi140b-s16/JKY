Talk about this Rubio's in particular...

Now we all know Rubio's food is great and their fish tacos are awesome. But this location in Henderson has some of the nicest staff of any place I have ever been to. I came here today with my husband to redeem my $7 Birthday Meal Coupon. I was greeted happily and all of the staff said "Happy Birthday!" to me. 

The place is always super clean. The salsa bar is always stocked. The food is always good. The staff must be loving their jobs because their happiness does not seemed forced. 

This is definitely my go-to Rubio's out of all the ones in the Valley.
