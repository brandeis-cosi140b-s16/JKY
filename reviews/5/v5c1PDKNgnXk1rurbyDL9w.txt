This was our 1st stop in Arizona (my 1st trip to here) , being from South Texas I was looking forward to some good Mexican Food and boy did we find it. The atmosphere of this restaurant is beautiful, casual, and relaxing. The staff is friendly,  quick, and courteous.  I had 2 skinny margaritas (I'm usually a beer girl) they were delicious!  Our food was beyond incredible I had enchiladas and my husband had Carne both plates came with black beans and grilled veggies . Let's just say we both wanted to lick our plated clean that how good it was. We will definitely recommend this place to anyone we know traveling to this area and we will definitely be back for more !
