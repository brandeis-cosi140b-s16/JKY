The salsa bar alone would make this place phenomenal! Our favs were the Salsa Strawberry and the Salsa Cilantro. My only advise for this place would be to just order one taco al a carte because we had so much chips due to the quality of the salsa we were stuffed. The horchata is home made and the best I've ever had! They top it with cinnamon, pecans, strawberries, & cantaloupe. It sounds weird, but it was very good. They also use extremely fresh, crisp cabbage on their tacos. It was very impressive! My boyfriend had the pork shoulder "quesa" which is actually a fried quesadilla and that was also very very very good. We will be back.

My ONLY complaint is that I ordered two different tacos & got two of the same tacos... But it was still very delicious & we will go back to try anything else that sounded good.
