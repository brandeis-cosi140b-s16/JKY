I love me some Mexican food. I have had a lot of friends tell me that this is the best Mexican food in Las Vegas, so I have to try it. Upon entering the restaurants the door is right next to the entry door for sapphires Gentlemans club. But once you're inside you don't even know or notice that your next to a strip club. so don't let that stray you away from coming here. The food was absolutely delicious, it is probably the best Mexican food that I've had in Las Vegas. Everything from the appetizers to the dinner to the dessert was amazing. The waitstaff was really nice, everything was fast, friendly, the restaurant is very clean. I will definitely be coming back here.
