This place is freakin phenomenal! I go there once a week sometimes. It is not necessarily close to my work, but my co-workers and I dont mind the drive!!! Their pork tacos are by far the best. Sometimes there are some random specials, and the chicken ones are ok. Besides, 5 bucks for 3 tacos? Yes please!
