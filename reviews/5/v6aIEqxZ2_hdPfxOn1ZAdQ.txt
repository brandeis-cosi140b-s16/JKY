We were trying to decide where to go near our house. We also wanted healthy options. Yes at a Mexican restaurant! Fajitas and grilled fish tacos. Both,delicious. We arrived and were seated immediately in the bar and our server Jordan was excellent. We arrived at the end of happy hour so we each got a margarita. Yumm. Salsa and chips on arrival too. Food was hot and so yummy we will definitely be back!
