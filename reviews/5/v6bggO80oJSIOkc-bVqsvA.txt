Tacos are amazing! Fresh, Fresh, Fresh.  Small restaurant and very small menu - but everything on it is great. All tacos are carne asada. They also serve Mexican coke and sprite. Parking lot is rather small, but doesn't seem to pose any issues. Tacos are worth it though! Will definitely be coming back soon! The owner was very friendly and welcoming.
