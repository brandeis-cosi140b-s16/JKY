I have lived in El Paso, Central Arizona, and Albuquerque for many years and have loved New Mexican style foods (e.g. Sadie's, El Pinto, Julio's Cafe Corona, Tomasita's Santa Fe Station, Maria's New Mexican Kitchen, Rancho De Corrales, Los Dos Molinos, etc.).  La Ristra is amazing - I love their fresh salsa selections.  Try the lunch special - it is sure to fill you up (ends at 3PM) and is very easy on the wallet.  The Margaritas are fantastic so I will suggest you don't drink and drive!   This is a very busy restaurant so it may take a while since everything is prepared to order - but well worth it!
