I am addicted to Chipotle.  There I said it.  I previously reviewed Chipotle prior to truly understanding just how darn good this food is.  Five stars, I scream it from the top of the mountain!

Folks that work here are always helpful and laid back friendly.  But very very efficient, professional and awesome!  

ALSO, Check out the iPhone app they have now so you can pre-order EXACTLY what you want!  AWESOME.


ENJOY!
