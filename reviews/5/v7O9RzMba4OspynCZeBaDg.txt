Best ceviche I've ever had is at Los Picos! Their chips and salsa are addictive. Their margaritas are amazing and fresh(ie not the bottled mix). Last but not least, their enchiladas(both red and white) are delicious.
I highly recommend this place as affordable and delicious!

I have posted most of the photos of the place and know the layout pretty well. Definitely a small place, but not too small(I'd say intimate is a good way to describe it). A party of 25 would fit just fine. Maybe more since there is also outdoor seating(two tables). Staff is wonderful and place is quite cleanly. What more can I say? Go there, and enjoy what so many already do.
