Excellent service!!! Wonderful and friendly staff!! I am always pleased with Chipotle food and staff. Tyler today was on point! He was busy making me a quesadilla and always noticed and greeted any new guests coming in. He is a true leader and an example of the high level of service Chipotle strives for.  Thank you for a good experience today.
