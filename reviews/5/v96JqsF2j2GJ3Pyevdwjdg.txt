Holy crap!! So nice to have a great NM Chile joint here in Vegas!! Had the chile verde and a chile relleno and the were both top four I have ever eaten.  You can taste the NM / Hatch chiles in both dishes.  Will be eating here as often as I can, excited to try all the other dishes. Great job folks, see you again soon!
