I work downtown and have been here several times for lunch.  I keep raving about it to my wife and finally got her to try it with me for dinner a few weeks back.  She went in not wanting to like it for whatever reason and came away as impressed as I was.  Dinner is a completely different menu and equally exciting as the lunch menu.  We started out with the skirt steak skewers, nicely charrerd and perfectly cooked with the best chimichurri glaze I've ever had.  For entrees, she had the vegetarian quesadilla, with a real garden basket of ingredients inside.  I had the filet mignon chile relleno, a different and wonderful take on the traditional Mexican offering.  The service was attentive and professional.  Highly recommend for those looking for an upscale Latin cuisine experience.
