This is honestly my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. Not kidding. Maria's is easily the best value around and the food is great. My favorite is the Adobado - delicious marinated pork. It's great in everything, but my favorite is Adobado tacos. Mouth-watering perfection! I'd eat here every day if I could. Go with the red salsa, it's spicy and great. I like the green salsa mixed with my rice. So good!! Also, Maria is super friendly so be sure to tell her hi, she works the register a lot.
