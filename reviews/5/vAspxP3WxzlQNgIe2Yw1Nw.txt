my boyfriend and I had seen an add for BCG several mos. before they opened.  Yesterday we had to run over to the Apple Store for a repair, and there it was!  We had our daughters ages 9 and 12 with us and we were all starving, so we decided to give it a try.  This was 3:30 in the afternoon on a Tuesday....slow time of day for a restaurant.  We walked in and were immediately impressed with the inside.  Large and modern.  The hostess welcomed us and sat us...there were maybe six other occupied tables.  You can see right into the very large kitchen which was clean and organized.  Our sever (Joe) came right over and welcomed us and took our drink order.  The menu is not huge, which we like.  Its not a novel you have to wade thru.  We quickly decided what we wanted.  Joe took our order and came right back with chips and salsa, which was very yummy.  The salsa tasted like it had a lot of lime in it...very refreshing.  Our food came very quickly and had a very nice presentation.  The girls kept it simple with cheese quesadillas, I had a pork quesadilla which had a nice, smoky flavor.  My boyfriend had the chicken enchiladas which had the choice of red or green sauce and were served with delicious black beans and rice.  We enjoyed our lunch completely!!!  We were stuffed.  Out of the blue, Joe showed up with a fried ice cream...not sure why, but it was nice and the girls were thrilled!!!  We plan on going back sometime in the evening to dine and try a fresh fruit margarita...their selection of tequila is AMAZING!!!  Omg!!!
