After trying 702 wing spot which is excellent I decided to try their other restaurant across from them tacos El jefe. 

This place is just as awesome as wing spot food is delicous. Every order made fresh and prices are good to. The food court there in has seen better days but I always get my food to go anyways. You are doing yourself a great injustice if you don't come try these two places.
