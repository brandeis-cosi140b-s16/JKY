our final stop on a pub ride, dos never disappoints for drankin. it was early, so there weren't many people (which is fine with me, as i was already half drunk, and i'm that douchbag who gets a little cocky when he drinks too much and thinks he's George St. Pierre, and then gets punched in the face for oogling some girls big boobs while her much bigger boyfriend is fuming at me). 

the doormen welcomed us in and even gave us a friendly good night when we left. the bartender was all smiles and pleasant, and with so few people there, drinks were in our hands within seconds. 

this place has always been fun, and of course, we'll be back!
