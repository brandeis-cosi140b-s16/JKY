While deciding what to make for dinner, decided to go here for my first time. Wow! I got the steak super burrito, and it was super delicious.  Food tasted clean and fresh. Top of the burrito had a white, thick, cheese sauce glazed on it, which made the meal even better. I loved this place!  Great quality food, good customer service, and not to mention really cool fluorescent lighting.
