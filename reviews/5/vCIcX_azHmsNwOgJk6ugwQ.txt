hands down this is the best mexican food out there. their bean and cheese burrito is phenomenal as is their cheese quessadilla (to be shared). the salsa is addicting and their tortillas are the best type that have the homemade goodness with brown spots and large ~ the margaritas are not too sweet and will have you feeling fantastic! my family has been going here since we were little and it is a family owned restaurant that has succeeded in keeping it's quality over all of the years. My boyfriend who never really liked mexican food is now a fan because of this place. Definitely worth going to and the ambiance is wonderful for a date, a family meal, or go to the bar that is dark lit and slightly separate for a fun evening. enjoy! & get extra to go as you will want it every day!!!
