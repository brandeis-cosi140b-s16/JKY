Great place to eat with friends during lunch.

I've been frequenting this location for a few years and I have never been disappointed.  The wait for the food is reasonable, even when they're are exceptionally busy.

The employees are very friendly and even though we become a "regular" once a week, they even know what we're going to order before we can open our mouth! :)

My usuals consist of one of the following choices:

- 2 Fish Tacos Plate
- Nachos Grande w/ Grilled Chicken
- Fish Burrito & Taco Plate

Always a good choice here.  Food is a great deal for the price!
