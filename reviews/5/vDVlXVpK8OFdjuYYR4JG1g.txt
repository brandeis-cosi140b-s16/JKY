Compliments to the chef(Chef Ino if I may). This is a must try place. Dont be fooled by small menu, this is what makes them excel. Its simple,easy and yet delicious. Im still not done finishing my food as I write this review(well i did finish my 2 Bao). 
I had to just take a break from this food-me attraction. I order a combo of chicken and beef Bao(included the two Bao and side salad, but no fruit as in other reviews :-( maybe they forgot but it did not affect my experience). I must say the Chicken Bao stood out the most. Waaaaaaayyy more than the beef. The chicken was seasoned perfectly and cooked to perfection, the mango salsa and the chimichurri definately elevates this Bao experience. The beef was good but the chicken definately took over as i ate it first. 
I also ordered the Fish Ceviche. I was going for the Seafood Ceviche but after consulting with the Chef he said to me that the Fish is more popular as they use mahi-mahi. And Man!!! was he right. this is definately a flavor explosion. It could definately be an addiction. the flavors are just outstanding and the fish tastes so fresh(we are in the dessert afterall). 
I had high expectation of this place, and no doubt they definately met them. I would definately be going back to this place be for work lunch or just a weeknd craving i will definately make the long drive.
Thanks Adobo Dragon. My taste buds have been awaken once again!!!!
PS - No line or wait on a Tuesday morning at 11:15 a.m for a to go order.
