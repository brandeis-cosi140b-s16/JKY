We arrived 10 mins before closing and the woman at the counter was helpful and friendly and let us finish our meal while she cleaned up. The burritos were awesome. We got the spicy shrimp and the chili rellano (great idea for a burrito). Both were awesome. They also have a rotating vegan special daily and vegetarian beans. We were jut visiting Pittsburgh but will definitely make it a stop every time we come through. Friendly, fast and really good!
