Delicious! I got the chicken green chili tacos, beef taco, and the rice and beans. All excellent. The chips and salsa are really good. The guacamole wasn't the best and a little brown. Server wasn't very good (slow and not knowledgeable). Love the decorations and the draft beer selection. I'll definitely be back. So excited a place like this is in QC.
