Beyond happy that Espo's is back in business! Everyday driving by on the way home was so sad knowing that Espo's was gone. All I could think was how much business would have been brought in by the new hotel across the street. Well now it will!

Same menu as before but laid out very nicely in the front of the restaurant. Same type of ordering process, order at the front, they call your number when your order is ready. It looks like they no longer have a liquor license which is no big deal to me and I don't think it will be detrimental to the business, the food speaks for itself.

I had two machaca beef tacos which were delicious. Espo's does machaca beef so well. The green chile beef is a staple here and great in both burrito form as well as chimichanga if you are being adventurous. Service was great.

I'm so glad Espo's is back. Reasonably priced Mexican food that is done so well. You can't beat it!
