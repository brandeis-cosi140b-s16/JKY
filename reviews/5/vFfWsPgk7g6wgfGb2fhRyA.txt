Went back and along with the spicy pork had some of the beef stomach tacos.  I like the pork better but the stomach was solid.  This place just hits a home run every time.
Was told by the nice cashier they are going to be opening up a location at the strip mall right next to encore.  It's on the Strip and just past Encore coming from Venetian, Bellagio, etc. heading towards Stratosphere.
Good  times.
