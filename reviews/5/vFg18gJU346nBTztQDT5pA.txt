We eat here every chance we get. We live about 30 minutes away, but we still get there every week or two. I love this place... the food is excellent and the manager is a sweetheart. The cheese enchiladas.... yeah... get those. Also, the specials are always great! My favorite restaurant since moving to Wisconsin!
