Went back today with the whole family....I have to suggest the al pastor vampiro!  It's like a tostada, but so much better!  The corn tortilla isn't fried, but it is crisp, light and not greasy.  A great option for those who like crunch.  My dad had the carne asada torta and was really happy.  He's not a big fan of tortillas, so the sandwich was the perfect choice for him.  He thought this was a great place because there are so many different options.  Definitely go for the carne asada or al pastor on anything!
