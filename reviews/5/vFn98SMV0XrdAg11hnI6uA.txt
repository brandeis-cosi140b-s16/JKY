Our waitress, Rachel, was amazing! She was very attentive and friendly. She made good recommendations on the menu. I would come back here just because of her. 

The food is also delicious. The black cherry mojito was fantastic, as was the watermelon margarita. We shared the carne asada quesadilla. It's was really tasty. 

Thanks again, Rachel, for making our lunch great. :)
