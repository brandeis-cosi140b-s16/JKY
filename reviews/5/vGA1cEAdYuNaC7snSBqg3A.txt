If you're searching for some good Mexican food, you should visit Del Yaqui.

It's in the mercado on the corner of Avenida Del Yaqui (which is PRIEST) and Guadalupe.  

The food is pretty affordable, and it tastes great.  I always get the Carne Asada burrito.  You should get the chips and salsa side too...they fry the chips right when you order them and they come all greasy and hot.  So good!

Bring cash though.  They have a minimum credit card charge, which is around $5.
