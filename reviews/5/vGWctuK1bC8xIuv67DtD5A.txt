There's nothing like a fat burrito on a Saturday morning!!

I love a good burrito when I'm hungover, and I don't like to walk into a crowded shop and wait 20 min for it. This BE is small and fast. They have tables outside, and they are hooked onto a gas station which is majorly convenient. 

They also have a pretty good size delivery area, AND no delivery charge... love it. Get the green salsa, its mild but awesome.

I haven't tried a burrito from here that I didn't like; the only downfall is that they are closed Sundays, and weekends are my chill food days.
