My review is based on the catering service.  I first spoke with Carmella, who was very helpful and knowledgeable about the menu, and made great suggestions for our order without being pushy at all.  I placed the order on Friday and gave a specific time to pick up on Monday.  When I arrived, the food was all packed and ready to go.  Carmella and another employee provided excellent service and even helped me take the items to the car.

As for the food, we ordered the steak and fish for 15 people. The fish was delicious and uniquely flavored with just the right amount of char, and the steak had a tasty sweet flavor as well.  Along with the meats, we also got all of the fixings, including generous portions of brown rice, brown seaweed rice, black beans, lettuce, bean sprouts, sour cream, cheese, and three types of salsa.  I'm sure I'm forgetting something, but it seemed like they literally gave us everything!  The food was a huge hit at my work, and I will definitely order here again.  Thanks Braddah's and especially Carmella!!
