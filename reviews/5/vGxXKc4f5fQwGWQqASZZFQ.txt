This restaurant is great!  We went out to celebrate a wedding in the family and were pointed in the direction of Mundo.  The chips and salsa were great.  Excellent sides.  We got the corn, the spinach, and the risotto and they were all really tasty.  I ordered the Shrimp diavolo and it was amazing, spicy, but amazing.  I would recommend Mundo for any occasion and it is another example of the way that downtown Las Vegas is slowly being upgraded into the nice/ hip part of town.  Great place!
