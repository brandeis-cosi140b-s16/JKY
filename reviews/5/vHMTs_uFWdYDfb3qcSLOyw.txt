Had dinner here while on a recent vacation. I absolutely loved this restaurant. The spanish mission style is so beautiful and pleasing to my spanish style loving eye. They've created a lovely environment. The owner is very nice, staff was as well but I have to say that the Chef is clearly trying too hard with the menu. The dishes are over thought and pretentious. I think that the food should be uncomplicated. I'm not suggesting they do standard Mexican fare, rather that they keep a dish's integrity. They put things toghether on a plate that do not make sense to the palate. I think they need to do the regional foods of Mexico and elevate those dishes instead of doing a "Latin inspired"  menu with no cohesion. Having said that, I found that the sides were the stars of the menu... the popcorn grits were out of this world , as was the guacamole.  Overall I would highly recommend this restaurant, however I would caution one to pay attention to ingredients and stick with simpler dishes.
