This is truly the best Mexican food I have ever had, and living in AZ, that's saying a lot. I was introduced by my friend who's family has been going there at least once a week for years. Once you get to know those who work there, you realize they're not rude like people say - they're friendly faces. As for the people who prefer the cheap orange Mexican blend cheese you find in overpriced chains, they really don't deserve to review this restaurant - queso fresco is the way to go!
