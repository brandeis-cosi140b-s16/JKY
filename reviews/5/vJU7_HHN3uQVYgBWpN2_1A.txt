We came here for my sisters birthday and it was great.  We made a reservation so we got a great seat, the view was amazing, food was great! My husband got Novello al co√±ac.... It was so good... Much better than my tacos al pastor.  It was a great time with my family. Manny was a great server the don julio anejo was so sweet and smooth, it was a great way to end our dinner:)
