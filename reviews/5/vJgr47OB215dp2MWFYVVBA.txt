Weekend Breakfast Review Only =  Came here Sunday morning after church and getting complimentary chips and salsa immediatly after sitting down definitely calmed my inner hunger beast.  Next came the coffee, oh the coffee, so delicious with a hint of hazelnut or vanilla, I meant to ask what it was but got too engrossed in my Huevos Rancheros I forgot.  These were definitely some of the best Huevos Rancheros I've had at a restaurant. Beans - good, Potatoes - good, Sauce - delish!  I was so stuffed half way through I had to take a small break to get those delicious looking pancakes in, and they are goooooood pancakes.  Great meal on all levels, the waitress was super nice too, so much good food for the money and so many other delicious looking options on the menu, I will definitely be back, loved it!
