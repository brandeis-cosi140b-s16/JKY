Las Vegas has many options when it comes to Mexican food. But if you really  like to enjoy true Mexican gastronomy this is the perfect place to do it! The food was serve fresh and fast, the service that our waiter Gustavo give us was outstanding. The place was very clean and nicely decorated. Highly recommended and worth it to give yourself a chance a new wonderful taste.
