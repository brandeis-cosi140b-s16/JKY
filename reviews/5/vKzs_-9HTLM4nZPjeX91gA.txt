Have been here twice now in about a week. If I can make three, I would try it!  Love Mexican food and with Carolina's North down the street from us, it would seem hard to find a place that would give us a good Mexican food fix.  

It wouldn't be fair to compare the two though...apples and oranges.

Have never really got into tortas before our visit here and this place is NOT your typical Mexican fast food place.  The atmosphere makes you feel like you are in a real Mexican restaurant.  The wait staff is super attentive and always cleaning up for you.

The food....The food is awesome.  Some simple advice.  Be adventurous.  While you might find some familiar fare, you have to try one of the tortas. They are awesome!  Have tasted three different ones and they were all excellent ( ordered the pork loin and the Alambre de Res...tasted my son's Lengua Torta...hmmmm).  

On my last visit I met my cousin there.  He beat us and had already ordered a quesidilla.  That sucker is big enough for three people.  I was stuffed before we even put our order in, He doesn't like to stray from his comfort zone , so he insisted on ordering the tacos.  He also wanted rice and beans. For the most part, everything comes with a "salad" of shredded iceberg, grilled onions and jalepeno,sliced radishes, and lime.  When his order came, I think he was taken back by the white rice and white beans that it came with. I wanted to try them, but he does not share!  The  looked good, but I don't think I would order them..only cause the amount of food is already overwhelming. Twice it has put me into a food coma.

Try the agua frescas!  There horchata tastes homemade also...not like the stuff the serve at most places.
