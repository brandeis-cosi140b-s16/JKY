Came here with my colleagues after a tradeshow and not only was the mexican food super tasty with quality flavors...the service was spectacular!  
There was a girl up front with a huge basket of avocados and salsa making fresh guacamole all night!  
I think our server's name was Alfonso, who was awesome!  Our appetizers and dinner all came out at once, but we didn't really mind at all.  Alfonso apologized but we let him know that it was totally fine... seriously no bid deal.  Shortly after we started digging in, the manager (with a little earpiece wire) came by our table to check how things were.  We said GREAT so far!  Everything was DELICIOUS!
Then I heard Alfonso whisper to his manager that our apps came out the same time from the kitchen.  The manager swung back around and apologized about what happened and said he's going to take off the apps from our bill!!!!!!!!!!!  We didn't even complain and they took care of $20 off our bill, even though they really didn't have to!!!  They really cared about our experience!
Then Alfonso was walking by as my colleague said, "I'm cold! I just want some coffee!" and before we can even flag him down to put in her request, he brought her a cup of hot coffee!!!!  We didn't even realize he overheard her!  Amazing.  I'm sure he'll be a super successful businessman with that kind of attentive service!

The pulled pork tacos were sooo delicious and came with some herb buttery rice and black beans...mmmm so perfect.  
The chipotle salad, taquitos, fish tacos and beef fajitas were all AWESOME!
And the FLAN...wow.  Rich, creamy and perrrrfect.

The prices were decent for Vegas and I will definitely be back next time I'm in LV!
