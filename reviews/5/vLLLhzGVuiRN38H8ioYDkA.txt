Absolutely delicious! A friend sent me here because I was looking for good Al Pastor. As soon as you get there, you know you've made the right choice because of the sheer number of people in line.

I was planning on getting three tacos, but when I saw the guy making them I ended up getting four. The meat looked incredible, roasting and dripping over the heat. 

There wasn't an open table in the entire restaurant, so I grabbed my tacos to go, but I couldn't wait. I devoured all four tacos in my car, and decided I wasn't done yet. I got right back in that long line and got more tacos. 

Two or three is usually good four me, maybe four if I'm feeling really hungry. These were so good I had six tacos in total, and I felt like a huge fatty. But it was so worth it.
