YES!!! As soon as i tasted the quesadilla that we ordered as an appetizer i knew we were in for a treat!! I had tried the one on 16th st a couple of years ago and was completely disappointing. I'm glad i decided to give this one a try. Can't wait to go back! I had the arrachera tacos protein style. they substitute the tortillas with thin slices of grilled cheese. So kinda like a stuffed quesadilla.
