I was referred to this restaurant by a friend and we have been here every week, ever since.  Not only is the food amazing and for a great price but the staff are wonderful.  They are polite and respectful every time we come in.  They are playful with my 6 year old daughter and even she loves going in there.  Out of the many times we have been there they only messed up my order once and were so polite and prompt with getting our order out. I have recommended this place to all of my friends.
