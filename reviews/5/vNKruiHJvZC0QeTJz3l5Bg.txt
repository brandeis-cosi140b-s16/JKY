I have to say this is my second trip and per my bride. Why have we never knew this place here. Surprisingly thirr Green Sauce delivered oh so good burn, chip's are one of my favorites possibly due to the light salt and fresh made daily tortillas. Tonight they ran out of Pollo for tacos ao the boy had beef (devoured as usual).

May need to join a gym 

Later
