Came here during my lunch break! The owner (Elias I think) took my order with a smile and a couple of jokes. Really friendly guy who clearly enjoys what he does. He gave me a few recommendations on what to order. I ended up getting the chicken enchiladas, which were very tasty. The plate came with rice and beans on the side. I also ordered a small horchata which was really refreshing on a hot afternoon. My coworker had the bean and cheese burrito - simple but delicious. 

Behind the cash register is part of the kitchen. You can watch the "assembly line" and see your food getting prepared right in front of you. 

The restaurant isn't fancy but the food is great quality, authentic Mexican food. It was clean and felt welcoming. I will definitely return!!
