It took a few minutes for anyone to greet me once I arrived, however, staff was friendly and helpful with selections. 

The environment is great! Very urban and hip like their other restaurants in Central Phoenix. They have Local First AZ books at the front which I'm a big fan of. Cool vintage steering wheels and headlights hang around the interior walls... Lots of group seating which is perfect for get-togethers. 

We ordered three tacos (crispy fish, short rib and chicken) and a carne asada burrito to share. In my opinion, the tacos are a bit overpriced for what you get, but everything else seems normal price wise. 

The carne asada burrito is a BIG YES - absolutely delicious. The crispy fish tacos are also really good. The chicken taco was fine (not worth $3.50). The short rib taco is a complete "pass" in my book. All I tasted was the corn tortilla. 

All in all, I loved it and will be back!!!
