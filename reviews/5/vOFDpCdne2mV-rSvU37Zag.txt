I came into this Chipotle late last night not knowing it was teacher appreciation night (buy one get one free for all education employees).  I weathered the long line because I happen to work in education and I was exceptionally hungry.  The staff seemed understandably overwhelmed, but remained pleasant even with a line out the door after 9:00 PM.  I've come in at other times as well and have yet to have a bad experience.  Great staff, great service!
