So I sit down and get an ice cold dos xx to get started after a stressed out day. My day was already getting better. The miso soup was delicious, The bartender recommends a roll called "limon roll" and it was like he knew my taste buds. AMAZING!!!!!!! This roll didn't need Anything else, no soy, no sauce, no nothing. I get another beer, drink a glass of water, and I was on my way. Good experience I recommend this place to anyone that likes sushi or Mexican food (the tacos looked good) lol
