This place is exquisite. Normally I wouldn't expect much from a restaurant in the mall, but La Taqueria is full of flavor. The food is fresh and tastes like a lovingly prepared homemade cooked meal.Â  Items on the menu include the very traditional sopas, empanadas, enchiladas; there are also original items like the avotacos. The food is seasoned with signature sauces that you won't find anywhere else. La Taqueria introduces large traditional Jalisco meals at very reasonable prices.
