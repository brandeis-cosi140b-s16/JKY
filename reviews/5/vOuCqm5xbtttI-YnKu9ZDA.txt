my go to mexican restaurant now!  inexpensive and delicious!  everything is very fresh and well prepared.  I typically get the chicken taco with their homemade tortilla, the bean tostada, and the ceviche tostada.  their ceviche is the best I have had in the city.  not to mention their salsa is always fresh, a little hot, and very good with the free chips.  ummmmm!!!
