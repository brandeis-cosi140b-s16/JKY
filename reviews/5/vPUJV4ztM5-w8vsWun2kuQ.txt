Given the ancient Mexico/modern Scottsdale mashup on Barrio Queen's website, I figured it would be too trendy for me, but I ventured in around noon on two occasions and found it perfectly down-to-earth. Maybe that early hour helps avoid the service woes that are noted in some reviews.

I stuck with tacos on both occasions to sample more things. The ingredients excelled on their own (as in the cochinita pobil) but were even more memorable in unexpected combinations. The best item was the taco with smoked salmon, egg and cactus - while I'm not the most fusion-friendly customer in the word this was a fascinating merger of things not usually found together.
