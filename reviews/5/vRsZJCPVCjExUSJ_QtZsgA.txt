Wow! I was really impressed by this place. I just needed semi-decent Mexican food in the area, and was surprised at how great the reviews were for this place, so I gave it a try (with a 7-person group).

Apparently it's crazy at lunch, and there isn't much seating inside--but we were there from 5:30 to 7 p.m. on a Thursday and it was pretty empty.

The staff are wonderful, and will do whatever to make sure you are customizing your meal to your preference. They offer samples of their different meats.

The guacamole was authentic, but not very flavorful (again, downside of being authentic)--everything else far made up for it. They have a salsa bar, and make your quesadilla/tacos/burrito/whatever you wish right in front of you, adding whichever ingredients you'd like as they go. I got a quesadilla with red chili chicken, which was flavorful and very delicious. The quesadillas are HUGE.

Very low prices.

I'll be back!
