Love this place. Anytime we are in Anthem we make a stop. I'm originally from Northern Cali and love the hole in the wall Mexican joint that cranks out great food and this is the only place I've found that fits the bill. Consistent and delicious. I am a huge fan of their carnitas plate. It's cooked to perfection. The staff is great as well. Very nice and personable. Ordered two extra burritos to go for Football Sunday.
