Not a place quite like this in Charlotte. One of my favorite places in Charlotte so many options and everything is truly scrumptious. 

If you have never had an Arpea which are grilled corn cake tortillas filled with grilled chicken, cheese, tomatoes and onions, I highly suggest trying one. 

The Dominican nachos: Yuca fries smothered in shredded chicken, pico de gallo, cabbage and sabor pink sauce are also another one of my favorites. The nachos are HUGE. They also have a salsa bar that consists of 5-6 salsas all fresh and tasty.

This place opened my taste buds to Latin street foods done right and I am very fortunate and grateful. Go check this place out you will not regret it.
