This taco bell used to be the worst one around and I would avoid if possible. I literally got a 12 pack of tacos with only lettuce once!  I'm not sure what changed but the quality of food and service did a complete turn around and now I will go out of my way to come to this location. I leave with food and even a free drink if I have to wait 2 minutes! It's incredible!   It's been better for a couple of months and hasn't let me down since!
