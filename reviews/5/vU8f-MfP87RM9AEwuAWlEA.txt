LOVE this place. Traditional Mexican food, family owned.  Food is awesome, Phoenix Metro Area has lost many of it's family owned Traditional Mexican Restaurants and we were so happy to find Los Taquitos.  Frequent here often.  The pazole soup is one of my favorite dishes, homemade, chunky, just enough spice.  The menu has plenty to choose from & the prices are reasonable.  
We ordered at the counter & it wasn't long before they served us a delicious, hot meal.  Atmosphere is very Sonoran Mexico as well.  If you want good Mexican food, Mexico style, go here.  We give this place & frequent it often ...  a double thumbs up.
