I was really happy to find this place a couple of years ago and I've eaten there once a week ever since. The food is awesome. Consistently high quality, flavorful, fantastic variety. They must have the fastest order-to-table time in town, and their prices aren't bad either. Weekday lunch? no problem. They make it quick and easy (and the margaritas aren't bad either!)
