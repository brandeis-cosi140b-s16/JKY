There was a lot to say about the Salted Lime, but what I really wanted to praise was the service. Will was an absolute delight, funny, witty, and prompt. He took care of us and made it seem like we were at his personal dinner table. The food was excellent, I had the Carne Asada on his recommendation and was not disappointed in the least. The bar was a little slow putting out drinks, but that wont deter me from coming back!
