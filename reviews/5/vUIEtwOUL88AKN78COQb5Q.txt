Nice little gem in this town full of cheap Mexican food. 

I ordered the el pastor burrito. Nice juicy flavorful meat, fresh avocado, delicious beans, and a great cilantro salsa. The house made red and green hot sauces really kicked it up.  

My date got the steak quesadilla, and I was jealous. Huge portions of fillings, with great flavor. The tortilla was fresh, and plenty of cheese too!

The order gal figured out it was our first time, so she gave us a sample of EVERY fresca they make. There are some really great flavors(9 of them!), and I'll be stopping in next time I want a cold drink. Their spinach fresca rivals what you might get at one of those fancy juice places, and they're only $2.50. 

She also brought us one each of their chicken and carnitas tacos, on the house! Really great street style, but with good salsa, cheese, and crema. 

I'll be back for sure. This is what cafe rio and friends strive to be, and nearly at Roberto's prices. Definitely give it a try if you like Baja style fresh Mexican food!
