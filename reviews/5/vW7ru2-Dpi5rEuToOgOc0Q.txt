I have to say, I absolutely LOVE Chronic Tacos. I was initially hesitant to check it out, but ever since my first experience I've been going back consistently. These days I hit it up at least once a week for their lunch special (a huge burrito, chips, salsa, and a drink for just over $8), sometimes even twice a week. Personally, I prefer the chicken, but the carne asada wasn't half bad either. Once I find something I like somewhere, I don't tend to venture too far outside of my "usual" order, so I can't really comment on much else on the menu. That said, the service is always good, the food is delicious, and there's always something at least moderately entertaining on the tv's. Seems like they've got a good selection of alcohol and beers, but I've never really gone there with the intention of getting drunk. Overall I gotta go with 5 stars, keep up the good work!
