Late night, and you've got to get a Mexican food fix? Roberto's Taco Shop is your best bet.

Haven't been to one since I moved from this area over seven years ago. I would, daresay, Roberto's has gotten more commercial with their shop design and uniforms, and it's gotten cleaner... but the food has not been sacrificed in the commercialization.

Ordered their Machaca (#8) - Boy, is this good. A little too much salt, but a great dish for only $5.35! Flour tortillas were hand-made and home-made, and above average size.

The BEST Mexican fast food I can think of in Las Vegas! Compared to Lindo Michoacan... five stars for sure!

As everyone knows that read my reviews... I love Chile Relleno. Don't think their Chile Relleno is adequate... but their other dishes... Burritos, Carne Asada, Tacos are superb. I'm just very particular about my Chile Relleno.
