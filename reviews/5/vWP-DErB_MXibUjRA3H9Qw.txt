I've been here 3 times since I discovered this place two weeks ago. I love it! I'm not a big pork or steak eater but I tried both and I'm hooked!  I've had the bowls and salad. Met the owner once and he's super nice! Customer service is top notch and the coconut bark is awesome! I love that they were willing to make my daughter a quesadilla since she wasn't interested in anything else.
