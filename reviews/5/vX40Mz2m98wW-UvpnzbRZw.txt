There aren't enough good things I can say about Popo's.  My husband and I are locals who have the choice of dozens upon dozens of Mexican restaurants, and we always choose Popo's.  We don't even consider going anywhere else.  The food is awesome, the prices are very reasonable, and the service is great.  It's where we take our out-of-town guests, where we celebrate any occasion, and its always the choice for "let's do lunch".  They have recently opened a location at 59th Ave & Bell and the food is exactly the same.  Hubby likes the enchiladas and, me, I'm a machaca girl myself.  Go there!  You won't be sorry!
