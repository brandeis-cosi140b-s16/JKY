AMAZING & Won't go to any other mexican restaurant .. This was our first visit & will return to have many more.. 
First off:: FREE beans, salsa, peppers with onions & chips.. Saut√©ed and yummy!
Delicious Cadillac margaritas for $9.50: HELL YEAH.. And can taste the liquor! 
Then food arrived with a fabulous presentation on the fajitas.. Table Side fire in air & very juicy!! Free sour cream, guac as well.. *many places charge extra. 
Amanda was our server:: very personable, friendly & knowledgeable on menu..way to go..
GREAT dinner.. Highly Recommended
