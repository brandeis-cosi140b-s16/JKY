I had some serious cravings for good tamales, and this is THE place to go.  They have a wide assortment to choose from, and many are still warm from their steamer.  I freeze them when I get home and steam them for 35 minutes and they come out just as fresh and tasty as the ones I get from the store.  The staff is friendly as well.  It's a little out of my way, location wise, but well worth the drive.  Also... Do t forget to pick up a jar of the red and green tamale sauce.  You won't be disappointed!
