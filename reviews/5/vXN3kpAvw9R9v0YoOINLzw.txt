I'm in constant search in Las Vegas for good food with great service. Usually you either get one of the other but not both.
 I just happen to be taking my nieces for a ride on the High Roller at the Linq. After the ride we decided to get a bite to eat and the kids wanted Mexican.  The restaurant atmosphere was lively and exciting, We were greeted and seated almost immediately. Since we never eaten there before our food sever "Patty" gave us a great recommendation to try a little of everything, so we ordered a bunch of Tapas and different types of tacos. (Lobster, Steak, Fish) All was delicious. The service was outstanding !!! Our server Patty was very knowledgeable about the menu and gave us great recommendations. She was the star of the day. It's not often that I'm able to find a server who makes dining out so pleasurable. Always smiled and seemed to go out of her way to insure that we were having a good time. Keep up the good work Patty. Thank you for making our dining experience a great time at your restaurant. We will be back for sure because of you :)
