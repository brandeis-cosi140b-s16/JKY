I'm not quite sure which location I went to, so I'll just review this one.. 
I don't know what it is about this place, but their food.. I don't even know how to explain it.. it's so GOOD. 
Especially open 24 hours, going in at 2 in the morning, never tasted better for a midnight snack. 
Definately the best of the best.  I wish there was one in the bay area. :-(
