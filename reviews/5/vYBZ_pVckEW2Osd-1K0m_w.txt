Charlotte does have quite a few Mexican rest. However the places I've been to the food was quite bland .. The food here was great .. I ordered the chicken quesadilla and it was great the cheese was a gooey mess and perfect seasoning.. (Not sure what the guy ordered on one of the reviews,but totally diff from what I got) the salsa and guac are great and we also ordered the fajitas the meat has good taste to it and was cooked to perfection! Can't wait to come during the weekend to enjoy some drinks at the bar! The staff was great and friendly as well! 
*** on a side note the other reviewer that posted negative remarks abt it being some korean place before.. It's not there anymore so why rate the new owners? Be angry somewhere else! Enjoy life guac and margaritas! Smile :)
