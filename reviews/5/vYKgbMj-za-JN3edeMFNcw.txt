This is for sure a hole in the wall kind of place.  However, places like this have the best food!!! I LOVE LOVE LOVE the Red Jade Chicken! I highly recommend this place. 

This place could use some new tables and a fresh coat of paint but the food is amazingly delicious!!! Make sure you try the cookies..MMM!!
