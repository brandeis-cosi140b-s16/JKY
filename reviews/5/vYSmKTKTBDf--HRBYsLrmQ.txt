AWESOME! This place is great. I was in Vegas for a couple days and got sick of the strip real quick. We checked this place out because of the great reviews on Yelp. Never would have guessed that it was so good, it's not a looker from the outside... in a strip mall. But, Yelp didn't let us down! I had the bulgogi tacos with kimchi. SO GOOD. The owners are super nice. And there's a newspaper article cut out and framed on the wall describing how this little gem of a restaurant was actually saved by Yelpers. This place is cheap, delicious and definitely worth checking out if you're in Vegas.
