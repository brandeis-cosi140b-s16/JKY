Yes this area is sketchy. But if you know anything about authentic Mexican food is that its on the hood not in the upscale areas.... As i walked into this place i remembered those restaurants in Mexico that j visited as a kid. The ladies cooking are those humble looking tias(aunts) that have cook d since they were little girls. The pastor is sizzling outside on that standing "trompo" rotating slowly and tempting you as you walk by. The restaurant is small and has old Quiznos seats and tables but who cares!! The food is what you come here for. The tacos are $1.75 but worth it. Burritos are $6. And quesadillas or tortas are $6 if i remember right. Theres 4 different meats. I had carne asada and pastor. Asada i could skip but al pastor was the best i've had in Arizona. Nothing has came close to the authentic al pastor taste as these tacos. They serve them with grilled onions, chile toreado(grilled jalape√±o) and nopales(grilled cactus). Those little sides just add more authenticity and deliciousness. The salsas are in little Daisy cups, the only con to this place as i prefer the salsa bars. They have all your mexican sodas and more. They will have all the boxes of sodas and onions surrounding the dining area(this is what reminds me of the D.F humble restaurants, theres no place to store them so they store them wherever they can). Try this place you will not be disappointed!!!
