So a few years ago I discovered my favorite thing about Japan: robotic beer pouring machines. I still go out of my way to change planes inn Tokyo so I can star in amazement. (Plus enjoy a nice Sapporo, or three) Rubios is the closest thing I can find in my native California: a fast food place that somehow serves both beer and lobster burritos. How could you go wrong?
