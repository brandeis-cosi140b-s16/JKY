This is by far my favorite Mexican food in the valley. The tacos aren't massive, but what they lack in size they make up in taste. If you're going for the first time, get the number 5. It's a great way to try a burro, taco, and enchilada (I love the red sauce, my friend loves the green).

Whenever I go camping, I pick up burros here and eat them with no food prep mess. My friends are always jealous of my food on those trips.

I can't get enough of the chips and salsa. All around, I'm certain you'll love this place.
