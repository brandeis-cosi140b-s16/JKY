Most authentic Mexican in Charlotte!  I tried my fair share of Mexican joints in the Queen City and, in my opinion, this is the best!  Additionally, it is the most affordable.  They offer excellent lunch specials for under $10!  You can't beat that.  

So, let me start with the best.  Carnitas Criollas!!  Large chunks of Mexican fried pork with marinated onions that are to die for!  This dish is absolutely worth trying and, honestly, it's what keeps me coming back for more.  It is a large portion and be prepared to take some home.  Or just dive in and pay the price of fullness, haha.  I also branched out one day and got the flour chicken enchiladas.  They were excellent as well and came with three different sauces that complimented each enchilada perfectly.  Mole, tomatillo, and queso - I believe.   Chips and salsa were plentiful and the chips come out nice and warm every time.  It's the little things, ya know?

Drink selections is vast as well but I keep going back to my Go To...  The Mexican Bulldog (they call it a coronita).  Simply, it is a margarita on the rocks with a corona flipped upside down in the drink.  Trust me... It's awesome!   

The environment and staff are always helpful and welcoming and we always have a wonderful experience here.  Soon, we will be remembered as regulars, haha!  "Ian, Sara... the usuals today?.... Yes sir!"

Enjoy!
