This review is based on company caterimg. Second time this week, catered lunch. I tell new employees to expect to gain 20 lbs working for us because we feed them so well. This time, leadership training for 16 staff members. Another favorite of ours is Rubios. 

Rubios has a great selection of catering packages to choose from; salads, taco bar, burritos, and enchiladas. Everything is fresh and so good. Leaders are always looking for healthier options and Rubios satisfies that criteria. 

This time, we ordered two taco bars and chose the grilled chicken and steak. Wouldn't you know it, the chicken always goes faster than the beef.  The order comes with guacamole, rice, beans, lettuce, cheese, Spanish rice, 3 different salsas, corn and flour tortillas, chopped salad and two large bags of tortilla chips.  Because its a taco bar, everyone can create their tacos or deconstructed tacos however they want to. Sometimes I choose to have a nacho salad but this time I made chicken tacos. So so good. I'll call this one a power lunch; content and fueled up for the rest of the afternoon, no 2 or 3 pm crash.
