This is a diamond in a coal mine on that intersection. Great food to eat in or take out. All freshly prepared, and very tasty, love their red chili beef sauce, and their grilled tacos. The kids love the fry bread. 
They are a great new business in our community, they donate their tips to local non-profit organizations.  
Also, did I mention their service is great!
