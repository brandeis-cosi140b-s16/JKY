This is a review on Cafe Caruma's Happy Hour.

5$ appetizers!!! YUM.
We had some really great things... but the number one thing I need to recommend (I would really be a jerk if I didn't) are the sweet potato fries. I've had sweet potato fries before... but these not only came with ketchup, but a side of warm maple syrup. The mixture of the fry and syrup was something sweet, delicious and dreamy. It was like, a mini-French Toast... without being soggy.

Other highlights... 2$ domestic, 3$ premium draft beers. And I think this is a summer special, but 5$ full size Patron margaritas! Woo woo!
