5 star update!  This is, so far, my favorite place for tacos in Madison.  If you're looking for tasty, authentic Mexican eats this is the place to get it.  

I went back a few times for lunch recently and left super satisfied. 

Here's how it goes:
1) walk in, head straight back and grab a beverage from the cooler.  Mexican coke, anyone? 
2) take a seat, any seat. And wait (sometimes a while) 
3) place your order.  3 tacos: campechano*,  al pastor and steak
4) eat
5) pay. 6 bucks. That's some cheap eats, friends. 

I recommend eating in so you can try their amazing sauces in your tacos. Everything comes out fast, hot and fresh. Everything I've had here has been incredibly tasty
Service isn't the best, but the food is so tasty that I don't care.  When you're done eating, check out the store.  You'll find some housewares, spices, groceries and even some of the meat you just consumed. Pastor meat, get it. 

I still need to get out there on the weekend to try their specials.  Barbacoa, pozole, carnitas and chiles rellenos are a few that come to mind.  

*the BEST taco in Madison. Chorizo and some crispy steak bits. Do yourself a favor and get this.
