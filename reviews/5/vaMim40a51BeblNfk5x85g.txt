Legit hole in the wall family run Mexican restaurant. The food was delicious. We hit it during a rush so there was a long wait for our food. But it was worth the wait and they brought is complimentary chips and salsa and apologized several times for the wait.  We ordered chili verde with rice and beans, a taco plate of one each chicken and goat tacos with rice and beans and a shrimp taco ala carte. The salsa bar had many delicious offerings including chick peas - first time ever seeing that on a salsa bar and they were yummy. With a large coke the entire meal was only $22.50. You order at the register and they bring the food on real plates with silverware. Nice place. Terrific food! You will love it, I bet.
