Love it! They have a variety of food ranging from tacos and quesadillas to hamburgers and desserts. The portion of food you get is more than enough . I had the carne Asada quesadilla and that came with beans, rice , and toppings for the quesadilla. It was so good! Make sure you get there early because it gets pretty busy during rush hour.
