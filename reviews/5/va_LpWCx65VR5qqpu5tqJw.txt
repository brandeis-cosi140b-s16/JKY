Best tacos in Arizona.
We got the Crazy potato and pollo/Asada tacos! Every bite of everything is amazing.
Best hidden treasure in Mesa by far! They are fairly newer and super cute ambiance. The customer service is excellent and in the small joint they have about a dozen people working constantly keeping those lines flowing.
We will certainly be back... With more people!
