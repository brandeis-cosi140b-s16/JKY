Since moving cloeer to this area, I needed to find a new closer Place to get my burrito and Margarita fix without driving so far.

I am VERY dissapointed usually with the margaritas and most places, they are from the machines and are disgusting... 
BUT i asked for a Blended Fruity Margarita and got the MOST delicious smooth fruitiest Margarit ever! OMG delicious!

The food was amazing, we had the special. A Lobster Shrimp Enchilada. There was a lot of Shrimp in there, not so much Lobster. But anyways, it was like an orgasm on a plate. I swear!

The chips and salsa was nice as well, the hot and mild salsa is awesome and they give you a great bean dip. 
Since I LOVE beans but yet had to go to work... i didnt have to much of it. But the little amount I had, was SO good!!

The staff is SO friendly, and SO fast. Awesome for a close to the strip restaurant.
The prices are ... a little higher.. but yet we are closer to the strip.
