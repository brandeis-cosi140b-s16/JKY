Went for lunch with the hubby yesterday and LOVED it.  Finally I have found a Mexian restaurant that I liked and can't wait to go back.  Food was amazingly yummy... I had spinach enchilada with pinto beans and zucchini.  I ate every last bite on my plate.  The free chips and salsa were the bomb also.  My hubby got shredded beef tacos with rice and beans.  He was a happy camper also.

Next time we will go for dinner and drink some of those $1.75 margaritas.  How can you beat that?!?!  

Seems like a decent place to bring the kids also... inexpensive and the inside is along the lines of a Garcias.

When I was at the register paying the bill I saw some Quesapilla's being served.  OMG they looked so fabulous that I will be ordering that next time.
