Love the new Sandbar at Desert Ridge!  The patio is so inviting, and a place like this is much needed in this area.  I'm pretty sure that this will be my new spot for strawberry margaritas during happy hour.  We came for opening night and tried the guacamole and mussels.  It was insanely busy, but I couldn't believe how quickly our order came out, considering it was their first night open and how many people were there!
 The guacamole was great- I'm very picky about my guacamole, at some restaurants it gets a stale taste to it.  At Sandbar, however, it was fresh and nicely prepared.  The mussels were phenomenal.  I've always been more of an oyster gal myself; mussels always seem to come out a little too fishy for my taste.  However, ours came out very well.  Overall, we had a blast.  FINALLY, a great place in the Desert Ridge area! Kudos!
