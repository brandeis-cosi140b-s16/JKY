We come to this particular Ajo ALS regularly.  We always sit in the bar area, our service is always amazing, our bartender Micayla is right on top of all her customer needs. And is an amazing multitasker! They recently put in a new margarita machine these are to die for. Although I must say she makes a mean blended one herself ! And to top it off she brings us chocolate tortilla chips with caramel sauce on them! A very nice touch!
