I'm so excited about the opening of this new location!!!! its only a couple of miles from my house and so far it has not been packed when I go in. (that is until word gets out about it. lol) The staff is friendly and generous with the portions, they have not skimped me once. The whole place is nice and clean plus the condiments ,and utensils were filled. 
Being that its brand new I had to check out the bathroom which was clean. lol (yes i have an OCD issue with bathrooms being dirty. check previous reviews. lolol) But like I've said before when the bathroom is clean that typically means the staff is clean. 
I LOVE CHIPOTLE:)
