I wanted to follow up my initial review with another one. Since discovering this place I've been coming here for lunch almost every day and dragging my coworkers along. I want to share some of my favorite dishes:

Soups:
Borsch - the Russian/Ukrainian beet soup. Borsch here is amazing. I think it's just as good as my mom's and believe me, that's saying a lot!

Kharcho - another classic, spicy lamb and rice soup. Here it's perfectly seasoned, wonderful hotness that is not overpowering. 

Rassol'nik - another classic. Every Russian will tell you that this soup is a perfect cure for hangover. But you don't have to be wasted to enjoy it lol. I absolutely devoured it and wanted to ask for seconds, except I didn't want to miss out on the entrees lol. 

Appetizers:
Do yourself a favor and try pirozhki! They have two home-made varieties, ground meet (square) and cabbage (triangular). Both are finger-licking good!

Olivier. This is a classic Russian potato salad that is reliably present at every celebratory feast. Another item I can favorably compare to my mom's version :)

Entrees:
Beef stroganoff. Their spin on this classic is probably my favorite dish here. Large portion served with home-style potatoes. Ask for some bread to mop up delicious rich gravy ;)

Pork steak. Sounds weird but this huge piece of grilled pork tenderloin is juicy and flavorful, smothered in saut√©ed mushrooms and onions. 

I've tried other delicious items that skip my mind at the moment. I'm sure I'll be adding more as this place is now by far my favorite place to eat and hang out. The service is always great and attentive. The only problem is going back to the office after lunch and trying not to slip into a coma for the rest of the day!!!
