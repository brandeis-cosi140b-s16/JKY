This place is great and the pollo fundido was tasty and deep-fried perfection.  Our server, Diana, was friendly and very accommodating.  For example, we asked for spicier salsa and she whipped something right up.  

The frozen margaritas really hit the spot and after one 12-oz glass I was ready for a nap.  I live in west Madison now, but the drive is worth it.  Hands down the BEST Mexican place in Madison (and coming from Texas, I can tell a great Mex place when I see one).
