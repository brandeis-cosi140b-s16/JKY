The restaurant is owned by a celebrity chef, Susan Feniger, who appeared on Top Chef Masters on Bravo TV. We used a Restaurant.com coupon ($25 off with purchased of $50 or more) and we got to try out some great dishes. 

The meal started with a basket of nacho chips with four different salsa. We ordered a pepper crusted steak salad with shrimps ($22, grilled sirloin steak, heirloom tomatoes, roasted tinkerbell peppers, avocado, blue cheese, spring greens, grapefruit jalape√±o vinaigrette, guacamole, and black beans on a giant grilled flour tortilla), grilled fish tacos ($19, cucumber citrus slaw, guacamole, black beans, red and green rice), three glasses of sparkling white peach lemonade ($5, $2.50 refill), and a 2-scoops of mango and pear sherbet ($5). The salad was excellent! My fish tacos were a little bland, but the sides were good. The peach lemonade was so yummy that we ordered three glasses! Overall I was very pleased with their food and service. We would definitely come back for more!
