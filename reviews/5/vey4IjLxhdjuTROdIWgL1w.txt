This location is great!!  What makes it better than Chipotle? The food is fresh and prepared to order, the kitchen is in the dining area so you can watch the food being made.  You won't find gross cafeteria food served under heat lamps and warming trays here.  

My favorite is the Baja Burrito, I really hadn't been a fan of guacamole before but this burrito is so delicious!  Recently I ventured out and tried the Nacho Burrito, which is also great! I didn't find it spicy though like it was supposed to be, but no complaints.  

It had been a few years since I had last had Baja Fresh and am very happy I got hooked on them.  Also, if you sign up for their Club Baja online they send you emails every so often for $2 of $8 or $5 off $15, both nice savings if you go often as I do.
