I LOVE Chipotle. 

No matter which individual place I go to.... There seems to always be a line.....just about any time of day. I don't think I have ever just walked in and ordered.. be prepared, be patient. I feel it's worth it.

Now, is this a classy, over authentic spot. ? eh... No.
But, it's no Taco bell. 

The plates, tacos and bowls are based off of which meat you want. My go to is always the carnitas...
White rice, black beans, medium salsa, their corn, sour cream and cheese. 

I'm usually pretty good about how I eat, and what I eat... But, let's be real..

I can eat a complete Chipotle burrito in 8 minutes... 

The staff seems kind, and this is one spot that I do not mind eating alone at...
