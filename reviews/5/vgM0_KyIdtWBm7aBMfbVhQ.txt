El toro loco is definitely a great place to get some Mexican food! My boyfriend and I ordered a chorizo and cheese dip app.. Which was great! And since it was happy hour.. I got a strawberry marg, which had just the right amount of tequila :) I got a quesadilla supreme and my boyfriend got the chorri steak, which both came out hot and very timely.  Ally was a great server and made sure we had everything we needed! Definitely check out this New Mexican restaurant if you are in the area!
