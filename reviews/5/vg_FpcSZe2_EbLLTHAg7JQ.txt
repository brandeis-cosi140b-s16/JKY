Food was delicious. Prices were a bit higher than I expected. Most entrees were around $18. Lots of food. We did have a bit of a language barrier since ordering beer in Spanish is the extent of our fluency. The ceviche instead of chips and salsa was very nice indeed. The salsa served with it was smoking hot, but delicious. The portions were very generous and we were not able to finish our meals. Shrimp diabla and octopus diabla were our entrees.
