Customer service was great!! The people working were friendly and accommodating. I was surprised by how good (and fresh) the tacos were! We had the carne asada and carnitas with beans and rice. The portions were large, too. Most places give you three small tacos, so I ordered three, but could only eat two because they were big. Also, the place is CLEAN and inviting unlike the previous taco shop. I'm not a fan of their chips, but the guacamole is amazing. Will definitely be going back.
