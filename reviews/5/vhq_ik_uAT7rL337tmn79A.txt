Back in Los Angeles, "Kogi" is the heralded as the best Mexican/Korean fusion food especially since they are reported to have first introduced the idea. I don't care who started it or what not, but Komex is far better.

Owned by a middle-older aged married(?) Korean couple, Komex express offers a variety of fusion made foods rooted from Mexican and Korean style. They not only serve fusion tacos but they also serve the traditional tacos with pastor, asada, and etc. And no this ain't no Roberto's, it's actually legitimate Mexican food that they serve. 

In my first visit, I ordered a pastor taco, asada taco, and bulgogi fries.

The tacos were nothing special nevertheless, delicious and they are as good as it gets. 

The bulgogi fries were amazing. For those of who you don't know what bulgogi is, it's marinated beef. And in this case, it is cooked and cut to small pieces so that it can be collected when forked upon along with the fries, cilantros, and etc. Oh man were these good. If a half hispanic and half Korean were to have tried these, I'm sure they would have had a identity crisis.

The only negative thing I would say about this place is the location. It is located right on the border of las vegas and north las vegas, south of the intersection of decatur and washington. I would love for the owners to move or start up another business more in Spring Valley or the South because that is where they are surely to get more business. 

If you're a biracial with Hispanic and Korean in your blood, be prepared to see a psychologist after trying the bulgogi fries cause that food may confuse you of your ancestrial roots and ethnic identity!
