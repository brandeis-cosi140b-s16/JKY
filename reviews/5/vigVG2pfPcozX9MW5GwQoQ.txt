I had been to Texicali before and didn't think much of the food but it always had a great location and a cool set up. My girlfriend and I decided to give La Revolucion a chance because it was new and close by. After eating there, I had such a great experience that I decided I needed to write my first review. The food was terrific, the staff was great, the drinks were extremely tasty but you could definitely tell there was alcohol in them, and the owner was fantastic. He came out to greet us, explained they had just opened, what type of food they served, and brought us a complimentary appetizer. The meal was also extremely affordable. 8 tacos and another appetizer for $20! I wrote this review in hopes people would come back and give this great place a shot because I really hope it and the owner succeed!
