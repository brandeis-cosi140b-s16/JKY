I have been searching for a Rocky Point style taco in Phoenix and I have finally found it.  

Simple menu  

Tacos, Vampiros, Quesadillas..... thats it.

Tacos - exactly like the delicious street side tacos in Rocky Point.  

Vamprios - grilled corn tortilla with cheese, beans, and carne. 

Quesadilla  - little street style quesadilla  with the best cheese ever.
                       
I'm sorry but Americas Tacos just lost me as a regular.....  I have found my new taco stand!!!




Update - Still thinking about that Quesadilla!
