Sals was packed Saturday at 5:00, but we were promptly greeted and told there was a ten min wait... No big deal.  We were seated in five minutes in a quaint little corner table for two by the window.  Our waitress arrived with water, menus and description of the special pie of the night; duck confit, caramelized fennel, shiitake mushrooms, craisins and  fresh greens. Sounded great but we decided to go more traditional for our first time.  We ordered a delicious cheesy garlic bread with delicious bacon crumbles served with a side of baby greens and a hot sauce-AMAZING! My boyfriend had a Goose Island coffee ale. Then the star of the meal arrived very timely; a kalamata (sp?) olive, spinach, and prosciutto... The crust was crisp bottom with chewy end, the sauce was AMAZINGLY tangy yet sweet with fresh basil which was the secret to its fresh flavor....Salvatore's was a huge hit- will go back again and again.  But probably for takeout next time around.
