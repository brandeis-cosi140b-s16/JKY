Nothing like a good Chipotle review to ice the veins.

I'm not even sure what that really means. I was hungry the other night, and happened to be trolling around Vegas for a bite to eat.

I'm a former resident of the Sin City...I don't need to eat at disgusting Buffets, the Hash House, or other spots. A simple off-the-strip visit to a Chipotle will do me.

This location closes at 10, and I got here a few minutes before that. They were super chill and didn't rush me. 

Not sure if this is a state law, but the menu tells you the caloric value of each item. AMAZING. Make smart decisions fatties. Yeah...you. Kidding. I'm fat too.

Here is what I had, and they didn't mess it up:

Salad w/ Double Chicken, some onions and peppers, Red Salsa, Corn Salsa, a sprinkle of cheese and thats it. BAM! Under 600 calories. SUCK IT!
