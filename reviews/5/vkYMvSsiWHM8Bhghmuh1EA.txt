SIZZLE, SIZZLE, SIZZLE...This is a MUST! I'm not a fan of spicy food, but this has such an amazing flavor, I actually don't mind that extra"kick"! This is a family owned restaurant from New Mexico and the food has all the wonderful flavors you expect from homemade dishes. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this place!
