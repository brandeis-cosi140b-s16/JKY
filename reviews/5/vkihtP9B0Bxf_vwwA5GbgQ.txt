best tacos hands down!!!! 
i've been here a number of times over the years and i will keep going back every time i go to vegas! honestly i look forward to eating here everytime! 
the guys on the line are all so nice and quick to make your food, all fresh and made in front of you. i love that they have fresh made tortillas the lasy is literally right in front of you making them! their vegetables are always so fresh and so good! 

LOVE THEM!
