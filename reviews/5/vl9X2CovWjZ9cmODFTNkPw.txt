I've lived in Maricopa for about 5 years and I have to say Penasco's is by far the best restaurant in town. Went last night and as usually was greeted with a friendly hostess They are under construction and have added these fabulous booths, love the ambiance, Spanish music was playing im not a big drinker but decided to have a drink and ordered a margarita and needless to say it was delish!! For dinner I had there speciality las concha's with whole pinto beans with chorizo which are great, I could eat a pot of them. They are a meal on its own. I think the have been opened in 2006 so they are definitely doing it right. I recommend if you live here or driving thru Maricopa stop by it will be worth your while!!
