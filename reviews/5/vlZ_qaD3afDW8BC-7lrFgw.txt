I loved this place! I was on this side of town for my anniversary and convinced my husband to eat here during the first half of the cardinals game because they had the game on. This was definitely my kind of place! Great open atmosphere, live relaxing band, amazing food and bottomless mimosas!  The only issue was that we sat at a high top for 10 minutes without being acknowledged then ended up moving to the bar where the service was not as good as we were hoping. 

My husband had the mexican omelette and loved it! 

I had the mexican pho and thought it was good but heavier than I was expecting 

We took the bacon guac to go and absolutely love it! 

I will definitely be back :)
