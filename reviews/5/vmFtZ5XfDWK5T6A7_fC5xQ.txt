This Taco Bell is always fresh and quick. At times Taco Bell has been notorious for the stale gordita and soggy bottom of the taco. Not at this location thus far! They always get my order correct and they're very friendly. I also like they've changed their bagging from plastic to paper. Cool Taco Bell(it's kinda odd reviewing a t bell in general). Get the baja sauce on your tacos, Mexican pizzas, etc. It's the best.
