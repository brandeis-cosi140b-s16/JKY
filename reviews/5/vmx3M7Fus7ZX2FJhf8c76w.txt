This place is great: I'm a mexican food connoisseur and was so happy to stumble upon this place moving to Cave creek. Staff is super friendly & restaurant is really nice. All items on the menu are fairly priced. The spinach con queso is amazing and I highly recommend it. I usually order the cheese enchiladas or tacos (1 shrimp and 1 carne asada).. Both great! ALSO, happy hour is from 3-7 Monday through Friday. $2 off all alcoholic beverages & 20% off all appetizers. You'll enjoy this place :)
