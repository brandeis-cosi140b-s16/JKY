Hell yes.

Its about time that we got some PROPER Mexican food in this city that isn't a chain or some overpriced frilly place. I've been dying for a joint that I can go and get some taco truck/taco stand style dishes without having to get on a plane or fight for a parking spot in the strip, and CTS is the perfect place for that. The staff is super friendly. The owner's wife asked us if we were from out of town since we didn't ask a million questions about the menu haha, which led into her telling us the story of the shop. I guess her husband moved here 9 years ago from San Diego and was disappointed in the lack of authentic taco shops, so he opened his own.

The food was awesome. I got the #6, which included a beef taco, a tostada, and a taquito, then i got two extra shredded chicken tacos. I could hardly finish it. Their guac and pico were both really tasty. My boyfriend got a beef/bean burrito and a fish taco for there, and a jalapeno burrito for later at home, which he said was better than his other dishes. Can't wait to go back and adventure into some tacos con lengua.

Thanks CTS, you're going to be seeing my face quite a bit. Hopefully you'll open another shop closer to the city soon!
