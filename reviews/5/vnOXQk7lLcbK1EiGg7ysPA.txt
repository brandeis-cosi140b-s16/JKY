Hands down the best  burger joint on Phoenix, AZ! Let me start with food. You walk in and  see large photos of the most beautifully designed burgers imaginable.You see the promotional pictures for the food served at the restaurant and yeah the food looks exactly if not better than advertised! These are not just thrown together patties. They are works of art! Any culinary professional would be more than impressed. I have not even gotten into the best part yet... These burgers taste even better than they look. 

Each of their signature burgers is unique in test and design. I was impressed that the could make a bacon and fried egg cheeseburger exponentially more delicious then somewhere burgers I've had in the past. But they did. The Brule Burger was the first burger i ordered over a year ago and i have been a happy customer since!

What truly makes this restaurant more unique is that the future at least one brand new custom burger special each week. All of which are again culinary masterpieces. another great thing about Paradise Valley burger company is that they don't only sell burgers. They also have a wide array of tacos and sandwiches. No I have not taken advantage of there vegetarian and gluten free options they also happily serve these options.

Lastly, the initial thing that made me want to come back other than the tasty food was the amazing customer service. Owner and General Manager Brent and Brian we're very cool and sociable. I have been eating at their restaurant frequently for over a year and they still ask each time how my meal is. That means a lot. 

I have brought many friends to eat here and I love it. I have also had a few business lunches here. That is how great the environment is inside Paradise Valley burger company.
