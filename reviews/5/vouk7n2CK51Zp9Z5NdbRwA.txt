This is a great place to bring a date.  The food is great and service was too.  The menu changes and you're sure to find something you'll like.  Everything you order here has a Latin flare to it.  I loved the osso buco that I ordered and have had other things as well but can't remember. lol  Bring a date here and enjoy the great food.  They have a nice variety of drinks.
