I'd agree with Alex, the food is great... the neighborhood not so much.  By far the best Mexican seafood restaurant I've been in north of Rocky Point... it's situated off a Mexican courtyard, in which there is another Mexican restaurant with killer food [although I can't remember the name off-hand]...
