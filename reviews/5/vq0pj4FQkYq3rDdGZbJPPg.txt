Great hand crafted tacos using fresh, local ingredients? SÃ­! (SNL Stefan voice while covering nose and mouth) This place has everything...pork, beef, chicken, vegan, pop in glass bottles and fancy, churched up black beans. Friendly service, fun atmosphere (although small) and window seats for watching the fabulous ebb and flow that is Carson street foot traffic. When it comes to tortillas you have two options, flour or corn. My advice is corn...you won't be disappointed. I went for lunch yesterday and ordered the bbq chicken special , the pork and a bottle of Pepsi. Total damage was $8. Great lunch spot, and word is that they are open until 3am on Fri and Sat for those saturated folks leaving the bars and not too keen on pizza.
