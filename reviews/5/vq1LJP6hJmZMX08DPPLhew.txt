My mom and I ate there last night. I had the Vegetable Fajitas and she had Enchiladas and the Food was FABULOUS and the service was FABULOUS!!!  I'd eat there every day if I could !  I don't see any truths to any unfavorable reviews for this place.  I've been a customer 30 plus years! You're missing out if you don't stop in! The chips, salsa and hot sauce were perfect and no we didn't have to ask for hot sauce,  they asked how many we wanted!
