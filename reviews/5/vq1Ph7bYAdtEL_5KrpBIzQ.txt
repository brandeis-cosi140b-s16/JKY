Seriously. Just stop reading this and go eat at Leticia's. 

Blah, blah, blah, recommendations, blah... Are you there yet? 

I love it here. I love Leticia. Thank you Leticia. Totally worth the drive to the end of Las Vegas every time I go. If you absolutely cant decide, just get full from the amazing chips and sauces. 

Service can be a little "come and go" but I get it, that place is always busy. 

By the way, I just saw someone write "Maguritas" Get out of here!!!! You dont deserve to drink one if you spell it that way! 

Maguritas....
