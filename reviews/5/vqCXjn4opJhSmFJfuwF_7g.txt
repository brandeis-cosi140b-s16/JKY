I came to Vegas for my buddies bachelor party, we got wasted the night before, no Bueno lol any how I yelped near by restaurants and this little Gem came up! I rarely rate restaurants but seriously everything we had was amazing!!! the chicken was moist tender and delicious, my buddy Joe had a burrito with al pastor which he said was freaking delicious! I tried a  piece and yep! he was right.. The staff was really nice and welcoming which is a plus, but I care More about the food..  Haha try this place you won't regret it:) specially if your looking for authentic Mexican food.
