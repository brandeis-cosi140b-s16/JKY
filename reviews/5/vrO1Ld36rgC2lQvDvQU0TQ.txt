Always consistent, great and healthy Mexican food! Same cook since I can remember. I can grab a chicken fajita bowl with chicken, rice, pinto beans and a tortilla and it all comes in under 500 calories with about 5 grams of fat. Extremely tasty and I enjoy the spicy and rojo salsas. I never have to wait long for my meal and always enjoy a house margarita for $2.99. They also have a Blue Burrito card that you can get stamped each time and on your 10th visit you get $5 off. If you want some healthy options I would recommend BBQ over Chipotle. I respect a place that shows the calories and fat in their dishes and gives people options to enjoy good food that is healthier than the usual lard loaded, calorie disguised foods. 

I only wish they offered baked tortilla chips similar to what Top Shelf does.
