Something about taco trucks but an Indian food truck??? Definitely caught my attention while walking towards Wynn. A little hesitant to try at first but I must say I was surprised at how authentic and traditional the Indian food tasted. Mexican food was great as always but my friends and I loved the nachos the most. We loved them so much we decided to come back after a long night of partying, and nothing beats tacos and nachos after a wild night. Quick service, delicious food, cheap prices, all available 24 hours!!! Can't walk away from that!
