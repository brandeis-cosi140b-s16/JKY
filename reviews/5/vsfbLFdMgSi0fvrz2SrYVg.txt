We started with the chips and guac which are amazing. Super big portion and flavorful for both.

My husband got fajitas with steak which he said were awesome. There were pepper onions mushrooms and pineapple. Also came with rice veggies and of course the warm Shells. Also a huge portion.

I got two tacos which I didn't even come close to finishing. Tender meat with a a lot of flavor. I added their homemade spicy sauce which added a great kick. 

It's byob too. 

Lastly, over the top service. 

Totally coming back.
