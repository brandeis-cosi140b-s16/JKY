Delicious food and generous portions.  The tacos are huge and always hot and fresh.  Fresh, hot chips with a large selection of salsa on their salsa bar.  The salsa bar is always clean and kept cold with ice that is refreshed often.  I eat there at least once a week but many times twice.  So many good choices.  I highly recommend Alfonso's.
