So happy that this replaced Phat Burrito. I've been a fan of three amigos (their other restaurant off of Central Ave) for a while now- but I didn't always want to go and sit down and do the whole waitress/waiter thing. Enter Sabor. Anddddd it's still in my neighborhood, double win. I tried the tostada and the chips and quacamole. All good! Loved the salsa bar options. I'll be returning very soon to try the street food options (arepas! woohoo!)
