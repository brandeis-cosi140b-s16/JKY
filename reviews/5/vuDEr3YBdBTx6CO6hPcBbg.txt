I've tasted plenty of tamales always searching for a great tasting one because I don't know how to make tamales myself. I almost gave up looking for a good tasting tamale's that  is until I came across "The Tamale Store", what a great find!!!!!! Every bite was soooo goooood"! The taste couldn't get any better. These tamales are everything a great tamale should be: soft, moist, corny, and packed full of great tasting ingredients. There's no skimping on these tamale's what a selection to choose from, the Tamale Store offers meat, vegan, vegetarian, and sweet tamales. You have to try the chicken with green chili, rice and cheese, incredible!!!!
