I'm from the taco capital of the world San Diego & this place rocks.  Incredible quality, awesome taste and very filling.

Order the 12 pack taco board if you have 3-4 people.  You get to try different types at a lower price.

Also, great service and experience.  Expect a long wait on prime nights.  Jason was also a great server.
