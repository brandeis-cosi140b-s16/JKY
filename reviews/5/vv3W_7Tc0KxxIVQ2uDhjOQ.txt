I had a picnic lunch in my car with my boyfriend and I brought him the Al Pastore tacos and I have the ceviche with the shrimp! That was the best choice ever :-) the salsas where fresh, my ceviche was made to order, and The taste of the food was amazing! The store was very clean but I didn't eat there but either way I would definitely go back because of the service and the cleanliness :-) very yummy and traditional Mexican food to me!!
