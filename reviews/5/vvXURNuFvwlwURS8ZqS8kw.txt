I've lived rather close to Top Shelf for about 20 years - never ate there...until now.   Wow, the green chili chimichanga is hands-down THE BEST I have had ever!   I thought it was a fluke so to make sure I ate there 3 more times (take out as well) and yep, the Chimi is the best.  Shredded beef tacos are excellent as well.  

Dated decor but it's all about the flavor - and Top Shelf delivers.  

I try to be stingy with my 5 stars but hey, Top Shelf deserves this one.
