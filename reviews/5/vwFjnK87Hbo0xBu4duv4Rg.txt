Excellent place, nice owner.  Came by here yesterday after thinking about the good reviews I had read here.  The owner was super nice and friendly and I had me a delicious carne asada burrito and some chips to go.

It was like a home cooked meal and very simple and fresh.  Inexpensive and delicious, what more can you ask for.  I don't like the construction on Main Street but what can you do.  It's not going away, and somehow businesses are still able to keep going.  

I would like to try the breakfast menu and will definitely be back !
