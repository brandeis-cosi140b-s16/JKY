Very nice and CLEAN! The food was delicious, real mexican flavors, (most of the Mexican restaurants have a very strong flavor, not pleasant).  The staff was nice and friendly, I agree that they overcharge on some items comparing to other taco shops, but the food is better, the place is clean, and they offer a nice atmosphere.
