This is the best Rubio's I have been to. 

The standard good:
Tacos- steak, chicken, grilled fish, breaded fish, shrimp, all yummy
Ice cold beer
Help yourself to the Salsa Bar with fresh cut lemons, limes, and jalepe√±os, too.

This location's extra goodness:
Cute Tiki patio...huge lighted tiki umbrella, and at least one other smaller tiki umbrella. I forget to take pix a lot, sorry! 
Exceptional customer service- especially the two dark hair young women. The cashier and the expo girl worked very well together. They served food to customers, kept everything clean, were quick and efficient during the lunch rush and did everything with a smile. I wish I knew their names to mention.

Try the new mango habenero ono taco! 

Good place if you have children.
