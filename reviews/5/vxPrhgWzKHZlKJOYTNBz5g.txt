Mmm, yummy. The food was served HOT. Refried beans were good, usually they taste salty at other restaurants. The Jamaica was a little too sweet for my taste buds so I added water and much better. My server was the sweetest person ever. Props to her for holding it down at this hole in the wall, seems popular here for this small town.
