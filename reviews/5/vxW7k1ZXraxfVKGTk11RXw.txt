I've never ordered anything from here that disappointed me. My boyfriend is obsessed with their fried rice and usually orders a chicken/pork combo. I love their veggie tacos, kimchi fried rice, and tofu fried rice. They really know how to infuse both Mexican and Korean flavors and make it so delicious. Their kimchi fried rice is so damn good. It has a good spice level with a generous portion of kimchi and is topped with a fried egg. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. I'm so glad this place is nearby because there are days I don't wanna go out to eat and I'd rather have take out so I can be fat and lazy at home lol.
