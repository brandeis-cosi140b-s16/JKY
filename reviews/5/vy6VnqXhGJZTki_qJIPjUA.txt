We have been going here for the last 14 years and have never had bad service. The restaurant is family owned and has great staff that have been around since we have been eating there. I always order the chicken fajitas and my son and husband order the cheese enchiladas I have tried many different items from the menu and loved everything I've tried. The chips and salsa are good too
