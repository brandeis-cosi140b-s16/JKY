It's finally here! Mexican food in Pittsburgh that is amazing. I ordered the Chorizo, Barbacoa and Pollo tacos. They not only had generous portions but the meat was perfectly seasoned. The toppings were not too heavy or too light and the prices were low ($3.25 a taco). This tastes like genuine Mexican food, and this isn't something I experience often (if ever) in Pittsburgh.

Beyond great food you can expect excellent service, our server Lester was friendly and attentive. A really good server is proactive and when our Mexican cokes were low he brought us glasses of water without any input from us. The owner was also very friendly and checked up on us. We felt at home and stayed to talk with them about how they're enjoying Pittsburgh. 

You can get take out (which I will be doing frequently) or eat in where there's seating for around 20 or so people

The place has a great atmosphere and is conveniently located at a good part of the South Side. I can't wait to stop by again!
