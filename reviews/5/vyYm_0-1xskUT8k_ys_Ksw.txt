So being of Hispanic origin & a true AZ Native, I would like to think I am somewhat of an authority on Tamales. Not really, but I know what I like & I have tried them all over town. I do believe that these really are the "Best Ever". I love the old standby pork tamales but I thought I would give the chicken and  the corn tamale a try. They both knocked it out of the park, although the Chicken one was" very" spicy, the blend of green chili, chicken & monterey jack cheese was a beautiful palatable combination. Then to cool things down I feasted on the corn tamale which was savory yet sweet,  I love that they did not sweeten the masa for this delectable treat as I was not looking for a dessert tamale. Kudos to the chef now perhaps they could work on the dining room a little. Never mind... I will probably just get my dozen to go anyways.
