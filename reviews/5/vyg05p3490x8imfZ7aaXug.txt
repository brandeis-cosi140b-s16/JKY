Had seen the place earlier in the week when I tried YC grill and decided to give it a shot. I initially ordered 1 traditional (lightly fried pollock) and 2 wild salmon fish tacos, all on corn tortillas and with a large side of guac for $12. They came, I saw, I conquered. The flavors were great and the sauces offered go great as toppings. The staff was friendly and personable as well.

  Unfortunately I had a buffet-worthy appetite and had to go for a round 2... I went back to the front and ordered another traditional (great crispy texture - and they were on a special sale for $1.50 each!) in addition to a garlic shrimp taco (with bacon!? sold!) and a small side of guac for $7 (so much for my dinner budget!). The shrimp taco had a great combination of cheese, avocado, bacon, and garlic grilled shrimp.

  All in all a great place to grab a bite, though they have better options than fish tacos for larger appetites!
