I flip back and fourth between the carne asada burrito and the bean & cheese. XL if I'm at "fighting" weight. I must admit, their beans are ethereal. My fianc√© would marry them over me, if not already locked down by America's. To boot, their low-priced and large-portioned chips & salsa ($2 - Med spice) is the kind that I can't stop eating. I have yet to try the tortas, and was not as swooned by the tacos, but the burritos are as 5-star as the day is long.
