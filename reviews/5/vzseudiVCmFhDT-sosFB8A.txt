For traditional Mexican fare with large portions and no frills, this is a fine place. It's a little out of the way down there on Independence, but don't be fooled by the strip club and lingerie store in the same plaza -- for a strip-mall place, Don Pedro is a spacious treasure.

Everything is good here, from the Camarones (Shrimp), Enchiladas, to anything with Pollo (Chicken) and Carne Asada (Steak). Rice and beans are heaping as the sides, and the fresh, hot chips and two kinds of salsa deliver nicely before the meal.

You can eat there as a family, with friends, for an office lunch, or even for a little party, if you're in the margarita mood. I've been to Azteca (which I believe is the same management) and the other Don Pedro (down there on Tryon near 485), but I tend to like this one a bit better.

The service is good, the food is authentic (our resident Mexican gave it a thumbs up) and on top of everything else, you leave smiling without spending too much cash. They even give you a little free dessert!
