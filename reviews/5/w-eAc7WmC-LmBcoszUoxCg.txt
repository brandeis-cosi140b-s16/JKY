Quite excellent food and drinks. I went for happy hour and got two tacos for only $6 total, and boy they were good! Their drinks are also quite good, the other members of my party got fantastic white sangria and I purchased their prickly pear margarita which is one of the best I've ever had. This is a definite go to for awesome happy hour food and drinks. My new Favorite.
