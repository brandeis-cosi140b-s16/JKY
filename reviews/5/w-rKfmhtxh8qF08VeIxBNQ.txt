I must say that this may have been the best Mexican food I have eaten, and I eat a lot of Mexican food.

The restaurant is on an elevated section in the center of the Luxor pyramid, giving it an interesting atmosphere amplified by the excellent mariachi band.

We visited at lunchtime on Sunday, which just happens to be 2-for-1 margarita time.  The margaritas were excellent - on the rocks, and made with fresh lime juice.  The tequila was evident and tasty.

We started, as one does at a Mexican restaurant, with tortilla chips and salsa.  There was a red and a green salsa and both were great.

I usually get the fajitas when I visit a new Mexican restaurant, but I saw a plate at the next table that looked too delicious and filling to skip, so I ordered it.  It was the most amazing pulled beef burrito.  The meat just melted in the mouth.

The rest of my party tried the steak fajitas, huevos rancheros, and a pork dish (of which I don't remember the name).  All were amazing. 

While pricier than I'm used to, for Mexican food, by Las Vegas strip standards, the prices weren't bad at all.

I highly recommend T&T (Tacos & Tequila).
