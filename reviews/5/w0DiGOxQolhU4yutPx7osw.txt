Family owned Mexican food stop, fresh salsa bar with a good variety, beats the heck out of the other chain just down the street. Clean interior that is well lit and cooled with ceiling fans during the hot summer months, nice subtle decor, comfy booths. I've eaten here there or four times, and never been disappointed, always leaving fat n happy! Just had a breakfast burrito with chorizo, enchilada style, and yum yum yum!
