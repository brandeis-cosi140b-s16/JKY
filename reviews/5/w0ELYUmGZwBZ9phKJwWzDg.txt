Amazing chile rellanos!  This is the place to get authentic New Mexico style green chile dishes.  

Their fry bread is delicious as either a taco or dessert.  I haven't had a bad meal here.  They offer chips and great salsa if you eat in.  My family loves this place and it is our go to mexican place.  

It is tucked away in a corner of a strip mall that you can't see from the street.  It is a great find and once you know where it is you will keep coming back.
