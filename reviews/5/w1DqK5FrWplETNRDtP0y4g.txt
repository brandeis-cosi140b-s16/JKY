The first time I came here I was impressed by the fact they let you try everything before you order. I decided on the emerald chicken and jade chicken with the black beans and the jerk fried rice. Me and the person I was with were so impressed we ordered again for dinner/left overs as we ate our lunch #DontJudgeMe lol

It was dangerous because at the time I lived a short distance from this location, which I still visit when I happen to be on that side of town because for some reason it just tastes a little better from the original hole in the wall location. Maybe it's just a little more love put into it. While the Chandler one is still good.. just something about the original. 

Over all PHX or Chandler.. I"m a fan!
