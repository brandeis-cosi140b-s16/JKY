I LOVE this place!!!! They heat up the tortillas but it makes no difference to the superb quality of the ingredients at this location. I love that I get to choose the ingredients in my burrito (like a Chipotle restaurant) so I load up on cilantro and their homemade pico!

THEY HAVE THE BEST SALSA, HANDSDOWN.
