Pros: Authentic, Small, Friendly, Beer.

Cons: None.

This place does a great job on authentic Mexican food, which is pretty obvious from their menu.  Plenty of meats and veggies to choose from, as well as dishes like Lengua and menudo.  Plus, they have a few bottled beers to choose from.

Salsa is awesome, although the red may be too much for some sensitive types - no worries, they have a mild green which is also great.  I typically get a gigantic combo plate to go and eat half for lunch, half for dinner.  Also, a pretty good place for the kind of food that soaks up a hangover...

Service is prompt and gracious and they appreciate their customers.  Great place, plenty of parking, and no-nonsense food.
