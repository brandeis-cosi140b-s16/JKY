Best street tacos in the Valley!  We find ourselves at this little hole-in-the wall at least once a week - more when my husband is craving their breakfast burrito on Sunday mornings.  

My favorite is the carne asada with just cilantro and onion with their delicious red sauce.  Hubby goes for the chorizo and chicken tacos.  Everyone we take there is immediately hooked.

Even better?  Every employee is friendly, helpful and so welcoming.  You feel like you just showed up in their backyard and they are your new friends.
