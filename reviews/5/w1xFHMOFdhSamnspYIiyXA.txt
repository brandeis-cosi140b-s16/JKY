Discovered this place thanks to Now Deals on Groupon, $5 for $10. Most, if not all the combs were under $10.00. I had the taco and gordita combo which comes with a drink and a choice of chips/salsa or rice/beans. You get to select what meat you want and looks like there is no additional charge for shrimp. I picked the carne asada. I added the chips and salsa and flan. All of the food was delicious and reminded me of homemade meals of my grandmother : )

I especially loved the gordita. Instead of a deep fried thick corn tortilla it was made out of thick flour tortilla. A way healthier option without sacrificing taste. The beans were flavorful and the rice moist. No skimping on the meat, it was lean and it was some of the most tasty, I have ever had. They also included a grilled green onion and grilled jalapeno. Although, I live in the Centennial Hills area, I will be going back here regularly and recommend you try it for yourself.
