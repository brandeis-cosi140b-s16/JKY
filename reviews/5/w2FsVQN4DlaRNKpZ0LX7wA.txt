Love love love it!  Walking distance from my hotel, nicest staff ever, best happy hour!  The mini chimis with jalapeno cream cheese were excellent.  My waiter John (5 pm on Monday) was awesome!  The bill for it all was hilarious, what with the 99 cent Margaritas!  

Thanks for a great time from someone visiting from Seattle with a foot cast on!  Lovely patio and fountains!
