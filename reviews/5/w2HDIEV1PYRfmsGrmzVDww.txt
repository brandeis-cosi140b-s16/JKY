Someburros is an excellent fast, great quality Mexican food. It could honestly make the cut for a food network show for fast food,fast service delicious Mexican with that blonde spiked hair dude, Guy.

Try the pollo/shredded beef fundido or the classic tacos... Mmmm. The hot sauce is not for the faint heart, it's awesome.
