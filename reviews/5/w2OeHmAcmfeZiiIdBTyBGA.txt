I'm surprised to find the overall rating for La Parrilla Suiza is so low.  But, then again, I don't live in Phoenix and I only come here once a year when I'm visiting...AND i always order the same thing (the Parrilla Suiza in the table grill).  

I love this place for the ability to get amazing, fresh mexico-city style meals.  Note, NOT TEX MEX.  The salsa is pretty good to start, but nothing to write home about.  What I truly crave anytime I get in the greater Phoenix area is the chorizo at La Parrilla Suiza.  Awesome, just awesome.  Again, I highly recommend one of the table grill options where you get chorizo, a couple quesadillas, seasoned beef, and a poblano pepper stuffed with cheese.  I'm currently chewing on the side of my keyboard right now just thinking of it. 

See you next year La Parrilla Suiza!
