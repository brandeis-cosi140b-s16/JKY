Every Wednesday night during my lunch break I stop by this location for their 99 cent chicken taco special. For less than 4 bucks I get very filling, greasy, and delicious tacos in my belly before I have to go back and toil away at my miserable job. Its the only thing I look forward to every Wednesday night. Haha.
