This is one of my favorite places to grab a Carne asada burrito. Yum yum! I usually get the junior burrito with everything on it. It's the prefect size. The fruit juices are super good too! Try the watermelon. Also, their tacos are bigger than normal so start of with one or two. You can always order more. And if you're in there during the day, say hi to Daniel (owner), he's awesome! :)
