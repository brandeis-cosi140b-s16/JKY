Over 800 reviews and 4.5 stars, this restaurant is the real deal. I went there for my 2nd time yesterday to take my friends and they were all thoroughly impressed.

Great service and staff, everybody is extremely friendly, prices are very reasonable, but most important, the food!! They source everything locally, non-GMO, etc. The food is amazing, you can't go wrong with any of the tacos. The flan is also the best I've ever had. Make sure to check-in when you're there to receive a free flan, locals also get 25% off. (this was on a Monday, so not sure if this applies during the weekend)

I can't wait to come back!
