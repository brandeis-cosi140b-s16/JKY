Went here for the boyfriend's birthday dinner. He asked me to look for a good Mexican restaurant somewhere in or near Downtown, and I found this place based on Yelp... Thanks guys! 
The boyfriend called to make reservations for his small dinner party a few days beforehand, but they had gotten the wrong reservation time. We got lucky though 'cause they were still able to accommodate us. There were only 2 servers: Jose and Joaquin (sp). We had also gotten there about 15 minutes before the reservation time we thought had been made, and they were very hospitable and attentive until the entire group got there/trickled in. 
Jose was very personable with us, and observed that he was just as courteous to his other patrons. Chatted it up with everyone, making our group laugh, and made us all feel at ease. I have to commend him and the chefs for being very accommodating to one of our friends 'cause he was allergic to garlic - made sure that the dish he ordered was all good for him. Onto more food details...
The Sangrias are dangerously good! We had ordered the pitchers of the Blushing Se√±orita and Blanca. One pitcher of each was not enough for the group. There's this Chorizo special they had that night, and it's a kinda "make-it-yourself" taco platter that a few of the friends ordered. Man... Wish I could've had some of that, but I still loved my Enchiladas de Carne! Still wanting more of that as I write this. Got a taste of the boyfriend's Enchiladas de Pollo, and that was just as good. I actually gave him a friendly slap for not finishing his yummy plate, but he did chow down on some good appetizers like Quesillo Fondue Mexicano, chips and Guacamole. Think we spent about $200-$300 for a group of 7, but the food and service was totally worth it. 
We definitely will be heading back down there whenever possible (AKA in the area).
