This a one of my boss's favorite places to take special guest. Located in the same parking lot right next to the new Richardson's. There is a really cool patio that connects the two restaurants with an outdoor Bar. Instantly puts you in the party zone and makes you feel right at home.

This is the first time my wife and I have been to the Rokerij and it was truly a fun and happy experience. Been to Dick's Hideaway and the older Richardsons many times in the past. The selection on the menu here has several of the same tasty good SW options with some really nice EuroAmerican surprises.

Love the way you can instantly smell the aroma of the Pecan wood coming from the sizzling grill. Pecan gives the food some very nice flavor and that extra kick. Everything here and his other restaurants always taste great and leave you satisfied.

Upstairs and downstairs are both the Rokerij now. Upstairs is quite a bit larger with a nice bar and a larger seating area. Downstairs has a top secret elevator or you can take the stairs. It is smaller and offers food and drinks as well. Could even be a nifty bomb shelter in a parallel universe.

We started off with some Prime Rib Sliders and Bacon Wrapped Shrimp. My boss and his lovely wife ordered the New Mexican Platter and the Salt and Pepper Encrusted Prime Rib. My wife order the awesome Chimayo Chicken and yours truly went with the tasty Grilled Swordfish Special. Chocolate Flan with a 1/2 shot of Grand Marnier completed the trifecta.

Really love the way they layer the flavors. The atmosphere of this place and friendly servers are also a delight. We arrived early and were able to get a large table by their cozy rustic fireplace.

Place gets really busy quick. Try and go before the crowd and you will enjoy everything that much more. When we were leaving it was starting to get crazy. DRINKS ON ME EVERYONE!
