Ghetto but spectacular. I constantly wake up craving their beautiful red and seasoned chicken cooked on an open flame.

This is my favorite make your own burro type of place that I've been going to since I was little.  Don't expect chimichangas and re-fried beans cause that's not their style. They have a small but satisfying menu consisting of mainly chicken.  

Only downside to this place is that it can get pretty toasty when the fire pit is going and it's the middle of summer.
