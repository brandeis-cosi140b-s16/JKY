I have been wanting to try this place for a while and I am glad I did.  The waitress was nice and friendly.  The beer was cheap and ICE COLD.  I ordered the nachos and they were excellent esp. for a little dive bar.  The pico de gallo and guacamole were fresh. It was a little dead, I think there were only two other people in the bar which is odd for a Sunday but I have to say I was impressed.  Everything was clean and the waitress was friendly and accommodating.  I would come back for sure.
