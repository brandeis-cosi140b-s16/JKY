Burger nachos and buffalo nachos!! Yum! Mango Thai basil margarita is my favorite and everyone should go there and try one! The pork burritos are delicious! The also have a vegan menu for all the vegans out there with some really yummy healthy selections! Breakfast is so yummy too! I'd recommend if you are cousin downtown Las Vegas to check out nacho daddy! The owners are amazing people as well will make sure your experience is 100%!!!
