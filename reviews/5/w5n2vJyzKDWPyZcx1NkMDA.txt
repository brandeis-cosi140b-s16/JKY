CARNE ASADA fries. Amazing!  I hope this place lasts. Horrible Del Webb sign blocks the entire location as you are heading west on Bell road. The sign has been an eye sore forever. 
Every taco place that opens here doesn't survive.   I hope this one does.
I LOVE the play on words "senor" taco in Sun City. Hehe and to pull up and see a row of gold carts...just makes me giggle.  My mum loves this place. So I am sure I will be picking up for her again.
