So impressed. Came for lunch and will be back soon. The food was awesome. 

Got the enchilada style burrito with shredded chicken, hot sauce and pinto beans and it was delicious. (Added sour cream)

Also hat he Saturday Special which was 2 shrimp tacos with rice and beans and a drink for around $9. We got one of each type of shrimp (coconut and Caribbean) and both were really good. 

The real selling point for me is the fresh made tortillas that are hot and chewy and really what I want at any good Mexican restaurant. 

We also really liked their sauces (the enchilada sauce and the cilantro ranch) 

Last good thing to say is the drink fountains....in addition to normal coke products they have awesome horchada, mint lemonade, strawberry lemonade and limeade.
