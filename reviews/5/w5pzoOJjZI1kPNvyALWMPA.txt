We came here on a Friday night and ordered 
1. Fries and fried chicken wings, 8
2. Chimichunga meal - shredded beef, 11
3. Enchilada meal - carnitas and cheese, 12.25
for $8 (used the $15 Groupon valued at $30) 

- Sort of next to WildFire Casino. In a desolate area by itself. Authentic feel. haha. 
- Free chips and salsa. warm, fresh and crispy chips. Generous servings.
- All food served blazing hot. Seriously, be careful not to touch the plate. 
- Fries and fried chicken were nothing special, taste like any other cheap HH restuarant. Ask for the sauce on the side rather than on the fried chicken. Just had a craving for Fried chicken wings. 
- Chimi was delicious! Deep fried, very crispy! Best tasting chimi I've had thus far. It came with guacamole and sour creme that made it extra flavorful. High recommendation. 
- Enchilada was amazing. The presentation was something I haven't seen before. It had a Fried egg on top. They made it over-medium, which is good, bc even at breakfast restaurants, they have difficulty or just lazy to make an over-medium. 
- Generous servings of meat! 
- Carnitas seemed juicier than the shredded beef
- I always go to a mexican restaurant and ask for all rice, no bean. Maybe it's the Asian in me. haha. Great tasting rice though. 
- Friendly service. 

Tues/Thurs they have AYCE Tacos for 9.99 1-4pm, soft or hard taco, any meat except fish. Sounds like a deal to me :)
