Great service and great food. From the chips and salsa to the entrees, everything we had was amazing. I had the carnitas and mushroom tacos and the tacos are pretty big. They give you two corn tortillas for each taco. Our server was great and I had a glass of the moscato d'asti and it was delicious. The salsa they give you is really good and we ate so many chips!
