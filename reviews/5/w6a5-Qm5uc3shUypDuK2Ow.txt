Boom! my old favorite mexican food place closed awhile back, but this place easily takes my favorites list by storm.

Had the torta pastor and pollo asado burro. Both very delicious. Don't worry i didn't eat both...that would be horrifying. Servings are huge, the place smells EMACULATE! (what you expect an Asadero to smell like). I loved walking in there and getting the most beautiful aroma of bbq'd meat. MMMM

would I go. Yes! the trick is going when they are actually opened. I totally lucked out on this instance. I've only seen it open 3 times and I've drive past 100's of times. maybe i have bad timing. Anyways definitely note worthy on Phoenix's authentic mexican foods to try.
