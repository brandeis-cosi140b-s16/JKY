On the Border is a great place! We've come here twice, in the past 2 weeks, and both experiences were wonderful! ! The watermelon margaritas are amazing....make sure to get an extra flavored shot added to it- I love adding the Madori! The fresh chips, and salsa are always plentiful,  and irresistible! ! They have weekly specials, and the food is nothing to complain about. Both times, our servers were very friendly, accommodating, and very attentive!!
