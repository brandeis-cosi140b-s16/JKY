I LOVE this place, the freshly made salsa is always amazing, the food is great and I you get a lot of food for your money. I used to live only 15 minutes away and loved going, now I moved all the way to Gilbert, and I still try and make the drive once in a while to get my fix on Popo's. I recommend this place to friends and family.
