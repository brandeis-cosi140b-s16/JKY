Don't you dare hit up Filiberto's or Julioberto's ever again in your Mexican food life. This is the authentic shit. Pollo Asado is what dreams are made of.  Again, who cares about the exterior and crappy intercom system in drive thru? That's all part of the experience; you're lucky if a homeless man hits you up while you're waiting for your burrito baby.  I've never been inside...one can only hope it sparkles more than the outside, but whatever! Those tortillas and freshly cooked chicken make up for anything that may seem sketch. Oh, and the staff is perfection!
