We went here last night. I thought it was pretty good. I would compare it to Qdoba or Chipotle but if you're comparing it to a local Mexican restaurant it's going to be different. I got the Norrita readable and I was very satisfied. I thought it was an extremely reasonable price. I have no complaints.
