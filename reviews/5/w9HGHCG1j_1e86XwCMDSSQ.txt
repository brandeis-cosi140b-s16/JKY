Enjoyed some food from this joint on Sunday night. I had the chorizo burrito and my boyfriend had the three taco special. He said it was "so good" and that it may just be his favorite taco shop in the area. That's saying quite a bit considering some of the amazing local contenders, like Sombrero's and TC Tacos. 

I look forward to trying some of the other offerings here.
