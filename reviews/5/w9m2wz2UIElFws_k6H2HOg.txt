I love these places. This is one of the best chains in the Phoenix area. I was missing the "-to's" brand of SoCal mexi food from my diet for years. This makes moving here all the better!  

Today I had the rolled tacos Monday special with rice and beans (double rice) and a soda for $4.99. Muy deliciosa!  But my favorite menu item is carne asada burritos and their amazing quesadillas!  

This particular location was clean and friendly and the food outstanding!!  (I live me some taco stands!!).  That's two for two for filibertos in the Phoenix metro.
