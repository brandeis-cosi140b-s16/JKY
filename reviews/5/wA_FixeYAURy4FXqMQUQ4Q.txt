I stopped by for an early lunch and was pleasantly surprised.  The server (Taylor) was excellent and had personality plus!  Aaron (owner) was very gracious and came over to talk with me.  The menu is not large but varied, and I am already looking forward to trying the chorizo sliders next time.  I am not a big eater and feel that I waste a lot of food when dining out.  Tapas portions are just perfect.  I had the brussel sprouts with caramelized onions and chorizo.  Not only were they delicious, perfect in size, but also very reasonably priced.  Be sure to try the sangria....very refreshing!
