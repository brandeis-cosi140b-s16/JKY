A great place for a quick meal in Ahwatukee! (Thanks to Yelper Mark E. for the tip!)

Food:
The menu is extensive! I saw so many things I'd like to try, and settled on a Breakfast Burrito "naked style" (no tortilla, in a bowl). I had it with chorizo, pico, and their excellent green salsa, and it was delish! 

Cost:
Very reasonable. One burrito (to go) with no drinks was $6.28 including tax.

Service: 
Today they were very crowded. Even so, my order came out promptly. The staff were helpful and friendly.

Atmosphere:
This is a small, family owned restaurant in a strip mall. That said, the interior is nicely done, Mexican music is playing, and the staff keeps it very clean!

Overall:
A definite repeater! This place is now on my local "short list"!
