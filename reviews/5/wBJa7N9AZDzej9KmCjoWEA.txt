Just came here after a 10 day all inclusive vacation in Mexico where I was deprived of good Mexican food. I was hoping el burrito would live up to my expectations of delicious enchiladas, nachos, quesadillas and fajitas. I am STUNNED at how delicious my meal was. The group got nachos and a chicken quesadilla to start, then I shared chicken and steak fajitas along with the enchilada plate that comes with rice and beans. It also comes with a soup or salad, and I got the homemade noodle soup. I have never been so pleased with a meal... After getting mediocre Mexican food and coming here I absolutely refuse to go anywhere else.
