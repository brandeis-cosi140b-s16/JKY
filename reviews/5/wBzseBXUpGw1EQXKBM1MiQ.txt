My favorite place in town hands down. I've been eating it since I was little. I've gone there enough to know the service depends on the person but their chips and salsa, oh my word. I could go there and just eat those. 

My favorite thing to get is the tacos authenticos. I can split it with someone and I can kinda built my own tacos. 

To finish your meal I recommend the churros. They make the prefect ending. Their French vanilla ice cream is delicious in top.
