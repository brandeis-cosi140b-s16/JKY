Best Mexican Restaurant in Champaign/Urbana area. This is my college favorite. The menu is great. They give free chips and salsa to start you off. I love the vegetarian option E. It is mouth watering. It had the most succulent mushrooms, beans and rice inside, topped with a nice creamy cheese sauce. The rice is so moist and not dry like most Mexican restaurants. The margaritas are huge and great as well. The portions are huge as well. You can't miss this place. You have to try it. 

Highly Recommended. If you don't, you are missing out big time! Oh and did I mention, its super cheap!
