I completely agree with Sarah's review.  What I also love is they have huge cheese crisps - great for kids.  Their burritos are huge!  

I also enjoy their atmosphere.  If you go to their website, it tells you alot about what their restaurant is like.  Very eclectic with corregated metal and birch wood.  Very clean atmosphere.  

One of my favorite Mexican restaurants!
