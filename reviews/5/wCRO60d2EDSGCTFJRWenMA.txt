Oh El Toro, how I miss you so!  We knew when we moved up to Chicago that we would miss you, but never realized that we'd have such a problem finding a replacement that even comes close to your awesomeness.  Seriously, El Toro possesses the Mexican food trifecta - great taste, great service, and great price.  Thank goodness Urbana is a half-way point between where we live now and where my parents currently live.  Is it wrong that we stop there both on our way down and on our way back up again?   This weekend will be no exception.

Do they still have the antler chandeliers?
