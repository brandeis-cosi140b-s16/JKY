After a busy day, I was starving and craving a little Mexican food. After checking Yelp, we decided to give Juan's  a try. 

We went early around 6 pm and were seated rather quickly.  The service was very good and the server, busser, and manager were all attentive. They brought out bean dip and salsa immediately which was so good. 

Once we ordered , we received fideo soup which I could have eaten 5 bowls of.  

I ordered a shrimp chimichanga w veggies and my hubby ordered a carne asada burrito.  Both of us cleared our plates!  

My first margarita was a little strong and just ok. But it was happy hour so it was good for the price. 

I definitely wouldn't go that early again as the place was packed with kids. I'm not anti kid but don't think they should be allowed to run around and scream in a restaurant. 

We will totally go back again soon and will recommend to friends.
