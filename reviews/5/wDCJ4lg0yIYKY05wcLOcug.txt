Well, this is the real deal when you want a taco or tostada.  It's the EXACT food you will eat in Mexico.  Exact.  I ordered the asada.  Beef on a corn tortilla that is made there-- a real tortilla.  

Then you go over to a salsa, quacamole, hot sauce, cucumber, cabbage and radish, onion bar and fix it up how you like.  

The 5 stars is for the food, the ambiance and setting is not anything special.  In fact, it is a bit of a turn off , but very clean.  It's in an old Wendy's I think. 

The food is so delicious, it doesn't matter!!!!!!
