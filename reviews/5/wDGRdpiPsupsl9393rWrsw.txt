it's a winner.  make sure you sit outside on the lake and order the mini taco basket split between 2 people.  free chips, salsa and bean dip are plenty especially along with the ritas on the rocks.  it's also a kick azz happy hour because the apps are half-off.  the food is cheap and super good.  don't try and walk around the lake though.  it doesn't connect up in a full circle.  and don't swim in that sh*t either.  just eat the good food at valle luna:-)
