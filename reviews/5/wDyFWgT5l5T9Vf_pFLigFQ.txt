Wow! I never write a review before, this will be my first but let me tell you guys how I love this place. Very good customer service and food was great. I was craving for  some burritos so my husband yelped out some good mexican place so he came across to this place so we decided to try it out with our kids and let me just tell you it was the best mexican place here in vegas we ever encounter. Manny was very nice and easy to take order from, he really made us feel comfortable and welcomed. Thank you! We will be coming back soon...
