I've been to this restaurant many times over the years. I've eaten a wide variety of dishes here (about seven). I really like this restaurant in "Restaurant Row." My husband loves their cancun sauce, a cheesy creamy seafood sauce that he could happily drink with a a straw. I have never had any problems here but then again, I rarely make adjustments to my selection. We frequently went to this restaurant when it participated in the www.restaurant.com certificate program. (Sad, that they no longer participate in this program.) The manager, Tony, had come to recognize us. We also really like the ambiance. The staff is very good. 

My favorite dish is the Fajitas Grandes- tortillas, guacamole, sour cream, pico de gallo, beans, & rice with roast pork, shrimp, beef and chicken. It is soooo good. The roast pork is the best I've ever tasted (I've been to Hawaii many times and I've been to many luaus.) and this is saying a lot since I do not normally eat pork on a regular basis. It is delicious and the portion is generous (I usually ask for a to-go box). You can order this dish for one or two people. My husband's favorite dish here is the seafood burrito with the yummy aforementioned cancun sauce and it does come with beans and rice. I've had this one before; it's very good, but I keep ordering the fajitas. We like other dishes here, don't get me wrong, but these are our favorites.

This restaurant has a Happy Hour and does catering too. I looked at the catering menu online and it looked reasonable. I would definitely consider this restaurant for catering service.
