Manuel's is so good. It's one of our favorite restaurants and I have withdrawal if I don't eat there often enough.  My favorites are their chips and salsa and the chicken fajitas. The best part about this place though is Luis. We now request him every time we go in. Even if it's been quite a while, he remembers us and our order (call me predictable)... Besides, the fajitas are so good, I can't bring myself to get anything else.
