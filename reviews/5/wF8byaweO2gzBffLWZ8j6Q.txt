You can not judge a book by it's cover- Nor can you judge a restaurant by it's unassuming appearance....
Because this place has Great food EVERYTIME! 
Yesterday, I picked up my friend Lisa and we decided to do some old school Henderson Eating!
El Torito has been in Henderson for as long as I can remember- It has gone from a one room eatery to a nice size cafe. 
I am not crazy about their nachos or fajitas ... but what is good- is their traditional style mexican food. 
Cheese enchiladas.. YUM
Green chili pork enchiladas double YUM
Their tacos with homemade shells are delicious too. They have so many good items that it is hard to put them all right here.
Yesterday I had a green chili pork enchilada AND a ground beef taco. 
DIVINE! Also sampled some chips with their unique and totally scrumptious salsa. 
Their rice is not like most rice at a mexican food eatery. It is their own recipe and it is not tomato based... hands down the best mexican rice ever. 
They also make albondigas soup , which is a treat you simply can not miss out on.
I love that this restaurant is family owned and passed down generation to generation. 
Unbelievably good...
