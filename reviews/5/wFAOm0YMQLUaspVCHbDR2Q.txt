This is the best Mexican restaurant in the Phoenix area.  I go there for lunch at least twice a week and the staff is always friendly and the food is consistently outstanding.  I love good Oaxacan food and this is absolutely excellent.  I have never had a meal that was less than awesome and I've sampled quite a lot of the menu.
