What can I say, Chipotle is Chipotle and I will continue to eat here until the end of my days. However, this location is exceptional because of service from the employee's. The line is continually out the door and they always handle the mad rush with great composure. I believe Paul is the manager on most occasions when I visit and he really knows how to rally the troops and keep things moving making it a much more enjoyable experience for the lunch rushers. Come here for your typical Chipotle meal but with a guaranteed satisfactory experience with the staff.
