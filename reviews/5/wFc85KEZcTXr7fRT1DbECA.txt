My absolute favorite Mexican food restaurant on the planet. I live in Mexico for two years and craves El Charro even after eating authentic Mexican food. Their hot sauce is seriously the best I've ever had and my favorite things are just the classic bean burrito or cheese crisp. 
Definitely a must go and you've got to have the hot sauce. I crave it all the time. 
I don't know how this place doesn't have 5 stars.
