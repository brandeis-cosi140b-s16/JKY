Its official, I'm leaving my wife.  I am leaving this exquisite and undeniably beautiful half eastern indian, half white chick for the Brulee Burger and Paradise Valley Burger Co.  It has to be done, I am in love.  Everything on this burger works together like 100 bikini clad women chasing Benny Hill.  The beef, the bacon, the fried egg with the drippy yolk, the havarti, the burnt sugar encrusted bun, I FACKING LOVE YOU!!!!!!!!!

Not to mention, cool dudes run this place, cool dudes I say.  

I am going to make my Dad drive down from Tucson just to go to this place.  He is getting old now and shouldnt be making that drive by himself.  But he loves burgers and PV Burger company is worth the risk.

Thanks AZ yelpers, you did me right homies!
