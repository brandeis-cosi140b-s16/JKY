Yes, you see it correctly, I just gave Chevy's 5 stars.... Why you ask? Well when i lived in Cali we would meet our friends at Chevy's for the awesome happy hour and have some great margaritas. Since coming to Vegas I thought that there was not any Chevys around anywhere. 
We ventured over to the mall and guess what I spy?!?!?! CHEVY'S. 

I think they have great salsa and I really like the nachos.. I am in no way saying that this is "real" Mexican food but it was good and cheap. If I really think about it I am giving this place stars just like how you would give your friends that you have not seen in a long time a high five long before you ask how life has been treating them. So in all reality the food could have been so-so but it was all about the reminiscing.

Anyone want to go get a Margarita... Count me in!
