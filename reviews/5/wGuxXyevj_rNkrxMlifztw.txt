Came here the other weekend to grab some of these highly rated tacos after friends wouldn't stop raving about them. As someone used to side of the road,  cooked on a hot piece of foil, tacos, these were a pretty big departure from the norm for me, and although different I thought they were just as good. 

To be honest, I'd probably prefer my street tacos to these tacos at Most Wanted, but they definitely are different than what most other taco places offer, and I think everyone should make an effort to come by and try it out at least once, they're definitely not bad for the price and taste like nothing else I've ever tried. They hae a huge selection of meats both spicy and non-spicy, from pork to beef to chicken, and they are more than wiling to let you sample all the meats, so don't be shy. Come through and give this place a shot, try all the different meats, pick your favorite few and chow down!
