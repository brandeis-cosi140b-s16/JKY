If I die young, bury me in queso.

Queso from Burrito King (or Torticas, or the Burrito King truck...) will easily be the most delicious queso you have ever had in your entire life. The queso dreams are made of. The queso that makes the world go round. The queso that Burrito King smothers on everything...

I love this place. Fantastic staff, good chips and salsa, big portion sizes, veggie options. And did I mention the queso? Whether it's 2 pm or 2 am, this is the place to be. And if it happens to be sometime in between 2 and 2, they have a bunch of different flavors of margaritas, but they are a little pricey. 

Tip for the wise (or drunk, or reaaaaally hungry): if it's one of those nights that everybody has the same great idea as you and the restaurant is packed, order your food to-go! They'll even let you snack on chips while you wait - the best.

Another thing to note: The Burrito King truck only accepts cash. Don't get mad, don't cry about it, the restaurant is literally a block away. Seriously, don't cry about. Seriously.

Five stars 'cause I'm in love.
