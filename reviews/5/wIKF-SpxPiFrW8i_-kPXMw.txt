Its hard to give a 5 star to Robertos Taco shop, but I have to do it, its deserved, and its because of the concept and the food, its just done right with some thought and authenticity.   If I looked at any of the many locations, I would think, hole in the wall, due to the simple take out setup, but the food is better than some really fancy sit down spots.  I love the rolled tacos, the burritos, the hot sauce bar with carrots, peppers, green and red sauces, radishes, etc.  Its just perfect, I feel like I am in Tijuana every time...bravo!  5 star for food, 1 star for decor!   food wins!
