What happened?? I had the best tacos of my life here. I came back the other day... and its closed???

Taco Gods why have you forsaken me!??!?

Street tacos at its finest. It was like the real deal from Mexico minus the diarrhea. The fish tacos were second to none. I'm gonna miss you Taco Azoteca... Ayot... Atoyec... how do you say it?
