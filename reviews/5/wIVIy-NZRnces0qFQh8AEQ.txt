I ask what there isn't to like about this particular Julio's Too? For my entire adolescence I searched and searched for a tex-mex style restaurant in my hometown area... but alas found nothing. It wasn't until aught nine that I discovered this magnificent shrine to tasteful eats. 

Family owned and operated, Julio's provides a warm and friendly environment for the casual diner. The menu is simple yet diverse with plate combinations and creations that are not so easy to find in the sonoran style valley. Looking for  recommendation? Try the Green Chile Relleno plate with a side of love from full timer Steve Rosa. Want  a burrito, well they come in size BIG at Julio's and full of all kinds of fresh ingredients. Need I mention how delicious the FREE chips and salsa are with every meal purchased? And with a handful of good friends the restaurant can quickly turn into a wonderfully amusing adventure into the land great food. All in all, I highly recommend stopping by and not just getting a meal, but maybe making a friend or two at the four stool bar section... I know I have!
