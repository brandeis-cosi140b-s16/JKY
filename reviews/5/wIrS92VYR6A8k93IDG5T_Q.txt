Ok we all know airport food is overpriced.   Got it. We aren't judging based on that since your totally at the mercy of whatever they are charging unless you would rather starve waiting for your insanely delayed flight. After waking around for 45 minutes and realizing this was the only open restaurant we thought we were settling. Boy were we wrong! The only thing better than the food was the service. So friendly and welcoming. Great margaritas and incredible Mexican food. This place was a much needed oasis in a desert of airport hell.
