How I've missed you, my go to place for mexican eats.  I had to experience some of the others before coming back to you.  I usually try the carne asada nachos at every mexican place i go to so the wait was well worth it.  This time the shredded beef super nachos, huge chunks of shredded beef, and all of the toppings I could ask for, didn't event have to pay extra. Excellent meal while I watched my football. Don't forget the cucumber and carrots.
