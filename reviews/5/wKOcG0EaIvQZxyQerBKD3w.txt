Sometimes, you just experience a perfect moment, and I had one at this place!  

We went to El Pedregal to check it out on a typical early November Scottsdale day - which is to say, absolutely gorgeous weather!   I've only been to El Pedregal once before, and it was a ghost-town - but that was at the height of the summer with temps in the high 90s or more.  This time it was high 70s, and there was a music/wine festival going on, with good live music and lots of happy people ... the atmosphere could not have been better.  

We saw the Spotted Donkey and managed to get a table outside on the patio, which was full.  I felt like I'd died and gone to heaven right then ... sitting in a gorgeous setting, with views of mountains, palm trees, blue skies ... being waited on by nice folks, surrounded by happy patrons ... it was just ideal.  Then we got the food.  To my surprise, it was all good ... the chips and salsa (pretty expensive, when most places give the stuff away) were both great - 'perfect' chips, and the tomatilla salsa was to die for.  My main course (stuffed pepper) was awesome!  I just can't describe how good it was. I've become so jaded by Mexican restaurants, growing to loath the big plates, piles of beans, piles of rice, goopy sauce on everything ... this meal was refreshing, delightful.  

I'm really looking forward to coming back, maybe next time for dinner; my biggest fear is - it will be dead ... I'm not sure what kind of traffic these guys get on a typical evening - but I will give it one shot.
