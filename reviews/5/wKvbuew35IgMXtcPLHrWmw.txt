OMG, the Chimichanga Mediterranea is one of my favorite all time dishes in Dane County!!! Seriously, it is amazing! I can't even tell you about anything else on their menu as I'd never order anything else as I am addicted to this. Seafood stuffed chimi with that white sauce, and fresh grilled veggies on the side. Plus their chips and salsa are excellent!
Nice outdoor deck seating.
