I've gotten a few things from here, from zalapeno balls, to quesadillas to burritos, to fish tacos. I have not been disappointed.  I stand by their "best of las vegas" fish tacos when normally, that is an item I would never order, but now I crave them. Service is top notch with lot of smiles from employees. Great job!
