Whole in the wall

off the strip

small and ususally crowded (which means its good)

everything in this place is good. everything. try it, you will love it. 

I ate at the Wynn buffet the night before...I paid $36 at the Wynn...for food that lacked flavor and personality. At Los Antojos I paid $12 for food that is made fresh, with love, with flaovr, perosnality, just amazing. 

5 stars.
