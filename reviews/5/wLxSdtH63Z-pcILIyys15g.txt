Arrived to Phoenix, AZ and my first stop... Taqueria el Chino!! I had one of the most amazing burritos de carne azada and tacos the barbacoa de puerco. The  owner se√±or Rafael and his entire team super friendly and the service exceptional. I was curious why he called his place El Chino. He said his great grandpa is from China and family comes from Sonora, Mexico. A great to start my vacation.
