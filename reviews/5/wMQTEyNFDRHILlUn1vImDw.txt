My favorite find in Vegas this trip. We wandered in looking for some appetizers and drinks and sat in the bar. We got the queso fundido and margaritas (tamarind and Javier's). I would skip the queso next time - it was bland - but the chips/salsa and margaritas are worth the visit. Chips were thin, crispy and fresh and the salsa was absolutely delicious. The margaritas were the best we've ever had. Don't pay $8 for a sugary mess out at the casino bar - come here and spend the extra $ - you won't regret it. 

The atmosphere here is so cool. They have the world's largest wood sculpture on the back wall and it was carved by a chainsaw artist from Oregon. I could stare at it for hours - it was amazing. The servers were also really knowledgable (how we learned about the art) and had a vast knowledge of their tequilas. When we were heading out the waitress asked if we wanted "roadies". Best suggestion ever. Would totally just come here to get a drink to walk with - they're that good. We came here twice in one day.
