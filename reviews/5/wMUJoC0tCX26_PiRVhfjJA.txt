The food was amazing! The drinks were amazingly... STRONG! Good gosh, one was good for a few hours! Lol If I remember I had some tacos and an enchalada. I can't remember what my BF had but him being Mexican and approving the food, then it must have been good! Definitely would like to come here again if I stay at the Hard Rock the next time around. The customer service was pretty good too, always checked on us and made sure everything was okay. She was always nearby (I loved her tattoos too!)
