Love this place! I work at the forum shops and our staff frequents this place for lunch! The food so good and the service is outstanding. The 3 salsas they serve with chips are delicious, but if you like things a little spicy ask for the habanero one. I've had the brunch at their Mandalay Bay location and it is to die for, I would recommended it to anyone!
