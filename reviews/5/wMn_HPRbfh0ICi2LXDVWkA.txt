First time coming to this restaurant , so I was kind of nervous when i didn't see other customers inside , but I'm glad we still have it a try , portions are huge & prices are just right . My daughter got just one carne Asada taco and that thing was packed with meat , I ordered a carnitas taco and chicken tostada , I didn't thing that I'd get full off one taco , but I did and it was delicious , I saved the tostada for later and was still delicious . And on top of that ordered a carne Asada quesadilla which was also Amazing , I'm not too much of a carne Asada fan because usually most places are bland and dry but the carne Asada here was to die for . Can't wait to go back and try the other things on the menu , thank goodness this is close to home .
