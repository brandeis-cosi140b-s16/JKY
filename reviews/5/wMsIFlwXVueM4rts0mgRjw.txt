Fresh yummy food. You cab even get a beer! (I hear Taco Bell is going to start selling beer too). Lorena was the best employee. She was so patient as we placed our order. Super friendly and helpful through out our visit. I like all of the different salsas. Vonda was also super friendly! They deserve a 5 star themselves! I had a salad w grilled talapia and it was great.
