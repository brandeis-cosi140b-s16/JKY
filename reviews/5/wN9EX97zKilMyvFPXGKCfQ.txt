Amazing hot dogs!  I had the chili dog with nacho cheese and jalape√±os!   The dog AND the chili were SO good.  My husband likes his with just mustard and green onions, so JR fixed it just right for him.  JR and Teresa own the restaurant, and are so fun to talk to. When you go there, you will immediately feel like they are your friends.   It is most definitely a place to put on your list of favorites! !!
