Chicken bao is my favorite. The bun is so soft and perfect with the chicken. My husband's favorite is the seafood ceviche, he says, "it's good to the last bite :)". My 5 year old nephew loves the beef bento box including the veggies with it, although he says he kinda like the chicken bao too :). Thank you, chef Allan! I just wish your restaurant's near our home.
