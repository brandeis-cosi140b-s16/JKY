I have lived in the area for over 10 years and have tried tons of Mexican places.  After trying this one, I realized I was wasting my time with the other restaurants. The food is insanely bomb every time! On top of that service is ultra friendly and the food is very reasonably priced. If ur in the mood do not miss Se√±or Taco
