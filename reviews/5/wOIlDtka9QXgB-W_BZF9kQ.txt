A friend and I, after having a vehicle serviced at the local Avondale auto center, had an itch for Mexican food. Boy did we hit the gold mine! The food was excellent and the drinks from the Horchata to the Lemonade were equally as great! The Restaurant was very clean and the staff extremely friendly. The prices were reasonable for the large portions. I wish they were open later than 3, but for making everything fresh every day, it's definitely understood as to why. I  will absolutely return to this place very very soon, and would greatly suggest this place to any friends and family!
