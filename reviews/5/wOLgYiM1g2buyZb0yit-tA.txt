We went to Red for a late lunch/early dinner on Saturday. We were seated almost immediately. Our server was very friendly and attentive. We ordered the Machaca Cheese Crisp as an appetizer for the table. The chips and salsa are fresh. Be sure to ask for the spicy salsa for an extra kick! I ordered the Pollo Asada Chimichanga, my wife had the Mornay Enchilada special and my daughter had the Carne Asada Chimichanga. All of these came out beautifully plated and hot! The bits of sweet pink cabbage in the green chile sauce set it off like nothing I've ever tasted in Mexican food! Between the chips, cheese crisp & entrees, we were too full to try dessert. The special usually run about $8 or $9. The entrees vary from about $7.95 up to $14.95 or so.
