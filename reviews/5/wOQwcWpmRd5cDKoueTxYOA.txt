We decided to go to dick's after reading the reviews and seeing the rating. We are in town for spring training and decided we wanted to eat and drink at a place with a good ambiance. This place has just that. It's a small bar, but the bartenders are very friendly.

This place is hidden, just look for the door between luci's health market and the hardware store. Great food and drinks, all my friends and family will hear about this place when we get back.
