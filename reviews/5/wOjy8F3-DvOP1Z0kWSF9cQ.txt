I have upgraded Los Fave's to 5 stars! 

I'm SO GLAD I gave them another try! I now go every Saturday morning for a bean and egg burrito and often during the week for a green chile burrito for dinner. Their red salsa is INCREDIBLE!

Update on the hamburger reference in my earlier review...I'm told they are nasty:(. But I don't care, I don't eat hamburgers anyway! I still want to try to ceviche!
