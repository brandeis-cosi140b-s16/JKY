You can't go wrong here. I've been here three times now during business trips to Phoenix and have never been disappointed. This place is always busy the food is great, You have to try the fresh guacamole (with cranberries even). Tonight I had the Suiza Enchilada, previously I've had the Pollo Poblano both were excellent. I highly recommend you add Barrio Cafe to your list of favorite Phoenix restaurants!
