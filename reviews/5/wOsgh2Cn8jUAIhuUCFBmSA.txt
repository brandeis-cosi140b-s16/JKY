We met some very old friends at this restaurant a few weeks ago for lunch and had such a wonderful time - staying for well over 2 hours - never feeling rushed or pressured to leave.  The food was ridiculously good and so well priced.  Our server, Mark, was all smiles, friendly, and exceptionally attentive.  The decor and atmosphere was so authentic and relaxing we did not want to leave.  After arriving home to Chicago, we realized we left a very special gift on the table.  When I contacted the Pasqual's, Benjamin Roberts was quick to assure me that they had the gift I left behind, and Mark  very carefully wrapped it up and mailed it to me. I really felt that these guys have a "we care about our customers" attitude.  Our son is a Freshman at UW Madison so we will certainly be back!  Can't say enough about how good the food, service and value is at this outstanding restaurant.
