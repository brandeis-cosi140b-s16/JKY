Genius food spot!!

Everyone that likes/loves sushi MUST go here and try this place. The service was great and the sushi itself was fresh and delicious! 

Menu allows you to make your own or pick one of their creations. It's like a chipotle style for sushi lovers! 
Proportions were good sized, price is pretty fair, they have a variety of drinks to choose from and they offer Mochi for dessert.

I will go back.
