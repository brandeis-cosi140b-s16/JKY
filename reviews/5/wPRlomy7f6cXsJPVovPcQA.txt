We have been to joyride about 5 or 6 times since becoming vegetarian. Food is wonderful and the service is typically good. 

They have a wonderful vegi taco and there salsa is very tasty. Top all of that off with the pinto beans and it's a wonderful meal. I took my mom for Mother's Day and the parents were very impressed. This is a must visit place.
