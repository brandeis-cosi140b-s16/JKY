As AUTHENTIC as you can imagine!  
Carne Asada is a MUST, either the taco or burrito.

Burrito's are stuffed with choice of meat, beans, pico de gallo salsa, guacamole and/or sour cream (pay extra.)  I would hold off next time on the guac/sour cream, but I just wanted to enjoy the burrito simple style.  What did I know, it was my first time. But will return.

In addition, I had the carnitas tacos, served up right with cliantro & limes and extra salsa, which was on the tables.  
I'll be back as it was PACKED & need that taste of 'little Mexico' every now & again.
