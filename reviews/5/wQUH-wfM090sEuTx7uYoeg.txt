I went to Garcia's as part of a company business trip to Phoenix. As excited as I was to temporarily escape the record snowfall in Boston, I was even more excited to indulge in Mexican food. The service was absolutely excellent and the free bean dip and chips was such a wonderful surprise. I had the enchiladas and afterwards we all indulged in the churros with a savory cream cheese dip. Next time I am in Phoenix, I definitely want to come back. 5 stars!
