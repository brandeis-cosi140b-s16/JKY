Excellent and kindly service. Family friendly, authentic and delicious pozole. Authentic Mexican food with a nouveau cuisine spin. The ceviche is fresh and the beans freshly cooked. Very creamy Mexican flan drizzled with real dulce de leche. Been coming here for two years; it never disappoints. Dinner/happy hour is very busy, great for socializing, but not an intimate setting. Patio seating perfect in late spring! Appetizers are $2 during happy hour. Waiters are constantly removing empty dishes and refilling water. Come hungry-hungry!
