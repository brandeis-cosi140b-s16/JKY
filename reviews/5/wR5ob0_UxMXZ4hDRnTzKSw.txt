Stopped by based on reviews on yelp. We were greeted by the owner who was super friendly. We were curious as to what made the tacos Chicago-style and he kindly explained that the tortillas were hand made especially for his shop (which were delicious)and he cooked everything they made in-house. I got the pastor windy city fries with mozzarella and nacho cheese and they were the best fries I've had in my life! Also got the thin-salted steak tacos which were amazing. He even gave us some Champurrado on the house to try and it was really tasty. Finally an awesome taco spot in Las Vegas!
