What a delicious haven in phoenix. watermelon agua fresca was perfect. the chicharron de queso was delicious, its a huge grilled/fried piece of cheese. their tacos are absolutly perfect. the grilled veggies, quac, and salas. mostly local and organic, huge board on the wall saying where all their food comes from.
