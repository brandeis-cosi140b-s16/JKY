This is easily a 5-star spot for me.  Where else can you get a big pile of flavorful meat and vegetables for a good price?  I brought my lunch today but I sure am glad I took a chance on Maki Taco instead!  I went with the Low Carb Hibachi Chicken and was thrilled with how fresh and nicely seasoned it was.  It's tough to get a healthy, hot meal for lunch without introducing a lot of bread/rice/carbs, but this hit the spot and didn't break my new years resolutions or the bank.  If you're lucky enough to have them in your area, don't miss the chance to check them out!
