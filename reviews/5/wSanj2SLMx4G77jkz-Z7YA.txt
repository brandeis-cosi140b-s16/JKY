What a damn shame. We've been living in Surprise for over 5 years and we just visited Las Fuentes for dinner tonight for our first time. I happy to say, adios Macayos, you are officially done. BTW, we have eaten at Las Fuentes for their Sunday brunch, F in good. Surprise is lacking in the Mexican food for dining however Las Fuentes answers that.
