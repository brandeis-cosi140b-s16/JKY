I was iffy to try this place because on the outside it looked kinda ghetto but I'm SO glad we did because the food is SO tasty! We love to get the Bacon Breakfast Burritos and the Carne Asada Burritos. SUPER tasy, huge burritos with amazing flavor. My mouth waters just thinking of it. I love the green salsa but the red they have is good too. Oh and their Horchata isn't too sweet, pretty tasty ;)

The inside is actually pretty nice compared to the outside but we usually just use the drive though.
