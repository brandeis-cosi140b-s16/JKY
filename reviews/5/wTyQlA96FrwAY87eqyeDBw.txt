I ordered the tamale dinner, one of each with refried beans and rice.  The green corn tamale was excellent maybe one of the best.  The filling of the pork tamale was stringy pork, good but too dry.  The masa was great however.  The rice was salty which I enjoyed and the beans were perfect.   It is true, they no longer serve bean dip, and the house salsa is sub par.  Better to ask for hot sauce with the chips.  It was busy, but they did a good job with seating and service.  Would like to go back soon.
