Having been a huge fan when Robert own this store, I went back in June and it was so disappointing. BUT I went this past weekend and it was fantastic. I had the chili verde platter & carne asada tacos. My dinning companions had the carne asada burritos & a combo platter with the chicken tamale, cheese enchilada & chile rellano - all for under 25.00 with drinks. I would for sure recommend the salsa verde as my personal favorite and the side of guacamole came with a spicy kick. 
Now that I'm writing this, I want to hop in my car and have some gorditas (which we got to go for lunch the following day) a little pocket of goodness. 

If you haven't been in 2013, go back. The counter is new, it's bright and colorful plus the woman at the counter was very helpful tho the tall dude looking over her shoulder was handsome but made me nervous for her. She did great even with his spying. 

Good deal for fresh made mex.
