Had lunch on the patio with my sister last week.  Pretty, spacious patio, lots of shade so comfortable on that hot afternoon. The service was great and the food delicious.  I had Tacos al Carbon with sirloin - excellent, generous portion.  We also had guacamole with our chips - nice and chunky. The server was very attentive and kept refilling our bowl of chips.  The salsa tasted freshly-made and perfectly seasoned.  Highly recommend!
