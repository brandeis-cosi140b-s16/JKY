This place was busy but we were still able to get a table right away on a Saturday night. We had the guacamole to start and it was good, but the avacados could have been cut a little smaller. We had the chicken fajitas which comes with rice and beans. There is something special about the rice and beans. Can't place my finger on it but far from plain, lots of flavor. The fajitas are great and come with a garlic butter sauce which is amazing. I just dumped it on and they were delicious. Comes with all the fixings, sour cream, cheese, pico de gallo, guacamole, all fresh. We finished with the cuatros leches dessert which is like heaven. Loved my meal and I will be back!
