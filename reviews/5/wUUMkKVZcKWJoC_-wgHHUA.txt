an AMAZING place !! we stayed at T.I for free and had $50 in food comp and decided to go here and it was AMAZING !!!

their margarita is amazing - the PRIMO one ! omg - its blended so well..and yum !!! just delicious

the salsas they bring are pretty amazing- a tamatillo, a pico and a some kind of smoked pepper salsa - and they chips are fresh- but not heavy :) 

my dad and i both got MOLE- OMG- AMAZING- the perfect blend of spices and flavor in the mole sauce - the chicken was grilled with a rub- i mean great food- great service- great music playing the background ! perfect !!!
