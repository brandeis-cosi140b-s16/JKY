Incredibly friendly service right off the bat, Ben makes you feel like a valued customer and friend.  Food is all reasonably priced as well.  I got the chorizo and egg combo platter, which came with an absurd amount of outstanding food for only $7.50, easily enough for two meals.  Plus, I got a free horchata for checking in on Yelp.  He'll give you free refills if you dine in, and if you're taking your food to go he'll top off your drink before you go.  I'm definitely coming back!
