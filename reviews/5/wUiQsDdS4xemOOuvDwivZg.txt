Excellent Mexican food. A bit pricey but worth it. The owner Raul is a really nice man. Very accommodating and hard working. 

The enchiladas are great. Tamales too! Even the noodle soup is good too.

Can't go wrong here. There is a bar too with full accommodations. 

Best downtown Las Vegas Mexican joint.
