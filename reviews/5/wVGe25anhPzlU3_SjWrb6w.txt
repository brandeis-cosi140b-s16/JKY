Went for breakfast today. It was their third day open..Great little spot at "The Yard" on 7th street between Camelback and Bethany Home. 

Showed up just before 8am and was greeted warmly by the friendly hostess as she was cleaning the windows. I was shown to a table in the small restaurant, which affords everyone a view of the open kitchen. Chef Silvana Salcido Esparza herself was behind the line with the cooks. The waitstaff was friendly and knowledgable, if somewhat nervous. Chef Silvana made her way out into the dining room and talked with the customers.

At the Chef's recommendation, I tried the Fruita a la Tijuana and the Chilaquiles. The fruit can only be described as a bowl for fresh explosion in your mouth. The menu description for it reads "mixed fruit of the day, topped with cottage cheese, Arizona Crockett honey, sunflower seeds, golden raisins, and housemade granola." The fruit does change daily, depending on what is fresh and seasonal. Today it was pineapple, strawberries, pomegranite, papaya?, and I believe mango, along with the other goodies. This was a great dish and much less sweet than most places fruit/yogurt parfait. I also had the Chiliquiles. It reads as "corn tortilla chips topped with chili verde, an egg any style, cotija cheese, jojoque crema, and fresh avocado."
It is served with a side of delicious black beans. The dish was very flavorful and spicy, but not overly so. A great balance of flavor without being hot just to be hot. The avocado was slices of a perfectly ripe fruit which helps to balance out the dish as well. 

I have long been a fan of Barrio Cafe. Now I can add Barrio Urbano to my list of favorites. As a big fan of breakfast spots, I have taken some off my list this past year because they were inconsistent and just going thru the motions. If today was any example (especially after just 3 days open), Barrio Urbano is hitting on all cylinders.
