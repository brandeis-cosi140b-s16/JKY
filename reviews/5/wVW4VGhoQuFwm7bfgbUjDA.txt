Another Filibertos near the homestead....score!!!  As stated in previous reviews, this is a newer location with very effecient service.  Just when I didn't think their glorious food could get any better, I tried a new burrito today, the ADOBADA is the bomb!!!!!  Tender chunks of marinated pork in a reddish spicey (and somewhat tangy) sauce, homemade guacamole and shredded cabbage wrapped in 36" of mexican goodness.  

Now, where did I put the Tums?
