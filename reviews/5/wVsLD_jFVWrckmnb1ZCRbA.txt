Just had the shrimp tacos and they were great! Ton of shrimp and I really liked the coleslaw and sauce! I have eaten here a
few times before and have had the chicken salad and the sausage, Serrano breakfast burrito is my fav! Even though there was a line when I walked in, I was able to order and be served quickly. The staff is super nice and friendly with a family like feel. I will definitely be back to try some different items on their menu.
