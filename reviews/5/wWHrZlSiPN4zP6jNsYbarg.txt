Seems like I've had these guys bookmarked for a while now. When my buddy Bronsen K. asked me to look up a place in the Eastern and Silverado Ranch area for lunch, Las Cazuelas was almost a no-brainer.

They managed to be a hole in the wall in spite of being in a huge plaza. Proof? I somehow didn't even remember them even though I was at Windy City Beefs a few months ago. Luckily, they are on right on top of that signpost near the Eastern Ave entrance.

After some brief discussion, Bronsen and I decided to split some Enchiladas de Mole Poblano and Enchiladas de Salsa Verde (both items $7.00 for 4). Both are based on shredded chicken inside corn tortillas, but aside from the obvious sauce differences, the Mole Poblano enchiladas had cotija cheese, a couple rings of raw white onion, and roasted sesame seeds, while the Salsa Verde had cream and melted mozzarella.

I must confess that I have never had mole before. The rich chocolate-based yet savory sauce was relatively mild in spice, which was totally fine with me. The tomatillo green sauce on the other enchiladas was vibrant and perhaps a bit more spicy, and it felt entirely different even though it was chicken and corn flour underneath both. I really enjoyed both orders and was glad to have the experience.

We also received some complimentary tortilla chips with a more medium-level red salsa to start. No complaints there. However, I had an extra Taco Oriental ($1.50) that  I could've done without. Pork, onions, parsley on corn tortilla, but nothing special compared to other taco places around town.

I probably could've used another item or a larger portion to get full, but maybe I'm too picky about that sort of thing. I am certainly looking to try a lot of the other items on their menu, since the enchiladas at Las Cazuelas were so great to me.
