They weren't kidding when they said they had an extensive salsa bar!! I tried most of them and they own had their own distinctive flavor and it made my burrito great!! 

Ok so this spot is in a sketchy part of phoenix. That's the first thing I noticed when I got off the freeway. Transients mostly around BUT I've learned that the best food spots come from restaurants that are in places you wouldn't think to go. Hence the term HIDDEN GEM.

It's SUPER small here. Luckily it wasn't too busy. But it's literally a small box of a restaurant. It looks like it can hold up to 25 people safely. 

I ordered a carne asada burrito, chicken taco and one of the houses popular burritos. I can't remember the name of it but it was delicious!! My burrito had lettuce, tomatoes and their own house sauce. It was so delicious! My burrito is on steroids!! It was so big too!! You have to come try this spot out if your near Phoenix!
