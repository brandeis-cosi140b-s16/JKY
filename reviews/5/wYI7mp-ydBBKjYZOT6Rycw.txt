So glad that there is a great urban vibe with great food coming to the east valley.  This type of eating is a first of its kind, and if you love tacos and want to eat at one of THE COOLEST(meaning reddest, most hip, not referring to temperatures) places in the valley, then stop here. 


Oh. The tacos are amazing as well. I can't remember what the waitress said, but I think it's owned by some famous chef. 

Speaking of waitresses. You'll have multiple ones. They all just stop at your table and make sure you're taken care of. Awesome concept.
