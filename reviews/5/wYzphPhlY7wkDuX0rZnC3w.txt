Really enjoyed the tamales and can't wait to go back.  The process/service is a bit odd.  There is a buffet steam table filled with whatever flavor tamales they have available for walk ins at the moment.  You choose from there what you want and how many.  I first tried to order a combo meal but it seemed like a hassle.  We ended up with a dozen tamales to go.  We had beef and corn  and chicken (the only three available).  My husband enjoyed the chicken.  I shared the beef and corn with my daughter and a friend.  We all really enjoyed them.  I think I liked the corn a bit more than beef but would still order both again.  We also got a large side of Mexican Rice and a bag of sliced limes with our order.  My friend has been back since to pick up a dozen!  I am also thrilled that they are open on Sunday.  There are so many restaurants in the area that are not.  One tamale is now $2.25 and a dozen was just over $18. I understand the prices went up 11/1/15 but still very reasonable price for tamales.
