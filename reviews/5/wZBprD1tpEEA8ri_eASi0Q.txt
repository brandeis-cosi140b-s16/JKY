I first discovered these delicious tamales at the Farmers Market on Cactus and the 51.
   After trying the Chicken and Green Chili tamale, I was hooked. I now regularly buy tamales each week when I'm at the farmers market. 
   The chicken chipotle is hands down my favorite tamale they make! Perfect amount of spice and is great when you top it with goat cheese. 
  These tamales are a taste of heaven! Not to mention guilt & gluten free!
