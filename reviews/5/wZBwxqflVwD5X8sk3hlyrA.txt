I am a big fan of chipotle! I always either get a vegetarian burrito bowl or a salad which is kind of the same thing but with the kick ass salad dressing!
 
I love that all their ingredients tastes really fresh and I am a huge fan of their guacamole! It is actually made fresh and doesn't have the texture and taste of frozen ones! They use to charge extra for guacamole in your burrito bowl, salad, ..etc. but now if you get vegetarian it is included! yeay! 

Chipotle is a must try for everyone and I consider it one of the healthiest fast food in town. :)
