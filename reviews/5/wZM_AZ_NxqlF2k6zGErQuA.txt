Carne asada chimichanga and the Lauritas special burrito are my favorites. The breakfast burritos are really good too. I have never had anything bad here. The food is always fresh. The portions are generous. The place looks clean. The staff are friendly. I have been coming to this location for a long time. It used to be a Robertos. The food here is way better then any Robertos.
