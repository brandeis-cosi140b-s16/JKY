One of the most perfect, small, family run Mexican food places that I ever encountered. Atmosphere was authentic, the place is clean and the food is great. Not upscale by no means.
I had a Huaracha for the first time, and I loved it; it is loaded with good ingredients (including a cactus, which I had for the first time and it was great).
I stumbled upon the place following a Yelp recommendation, and was shocked at first how tiny the place is, but you discover there is more to it later. Although, try to sit at the bar if you can (if you like it), for a feeling different from other usual Mexican joints.
