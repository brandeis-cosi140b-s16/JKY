This place is awesome.
(I suppose I can't end my review here, can I?)

It's pretty authentic stuff and all really interesting.
The chips are a bit funky, but the salsa is really interesting. Not your normal stuff at all.

I got four tacos ( I think loco, lamb, pork, and chicken), and they were all amazing. There's a huge variety, and you can't go wrong with any of them.

We also got a chicken quesadilla. Sure, boring, but it was crazy delicious. Lots of chicken though! If you're a cheese fan, ask for extra. You can thank me later.

It's a bit odd and the menu can be a bit strange too, but it's well worth it!
