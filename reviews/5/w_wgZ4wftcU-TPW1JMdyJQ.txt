We went to Que Mas for a second try. I was hell bent on finding something wrong with this place. My first experience had to be a fluke. Sure enough, I had the nacho's and they were not as good as the steak ranchero...who would have known? Nacho's here are for an appetizer and although large enough for a meal, I will stick to the more traditional and actually order an entree! Silly me!
