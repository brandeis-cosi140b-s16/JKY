This is the first time I have ever had a fusion taco. I have seen them all over tv. This was worth it. I spent less than $6 bucks for 4 tacos, chips and salsa with guac on the side, and a bottle of water. They are short staffed, but the person waiting on was so nice and was worth the wait. Where do they get their oranges they serve at the end of the meal? It was sweet and the best thing to end your meal with, light and refreshing.
