Before I give my review 

I moved here from Texas and we  have excellent quality Mexican food on every corner. Down to the homemade tortillas and fresh homemade salsa and chips that are always free at every Mexican restaurant. It's an expectation there. So sadly im here still wondering where I'm going to find my chips and salsa for free..booo..lol.

SERVICE
I walked into this place thinking ahhh it's another filibertos place and it will taste the same. From the time I walked in, I was greeted and treated like I was one of their friends. He went above expectations just by letting me know they have a closer location to where I live and asking if the food was great and salsa.


THE FOOD
Steak potato and cheese burrito was ordered. I haven't had a great burrito in a long time. Plenty of meat and taters as the country folks would say in Texas. It was amazingly excellent. Nothing fancy about the burrito, this goes where they say...Keep it simple stupid....they did just that....and that makes this burrito....darn good!!!

Chicken Tacos, were ordered. The guy really knows his stuff and makes ordering easier. He asked if I wanted one or two and then when I said two, he said you might as well go with the #17 or something like that for .14 cents more and get yourself a drink. I did just that. Back to the tacos. I was expecting some super hard shelled taco with hardly any cheese and little meat. I was wrong. The tortilla was fried lightly which is the exact way I love making my own corn tortilla tacos at home. I was surprised with that part already and the amount of cheese way more then you would get at taco bell anyday. The tacos are excellent.

Breakfast Burritos-I went back the next morning I ordered the potato, cheese, ham and bean taco. Wow!! Amazing with plenty of cheese and the greatest red tasting hot sauce I've had around.

Don't hesitate to ask me any questions....I prefer this place and will go out of my way to get here than to go to Filabertos!
