Really liked this place. Have gone back about three times before posting here. On my first visit I told them I was brand new and  they let me sample each of the meats. Very cool. The food was very flavorful and I really liked the fusion aspect. Staff was great to make recommendations on salsa and meat combos. I really liked the crispy tacos shells too! Very light and flaky.
