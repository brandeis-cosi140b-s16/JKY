This is my joint when I need my burrito eats. Everything I usually would dump like veggies are extremely fresh over here, so I never go skimpy. Then there's the meat *drooool*...Honestly, I've never tried the pork but I can surely vouch for the chicken and steak and might I say, the marinade is manifique! If you're unsure when you walk in, don't be scared. The staff have been consistently outgoing and friendly to walk me through how the process goes, even though I've been there a couple of times already. For me, anyone who greets you right when you walk up is good in my book for customer service. So there it is in a nutshell. Great food. Great people. Going back again
