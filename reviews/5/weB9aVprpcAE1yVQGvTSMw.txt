Went here yesterday for a late lunch after reading all the great reviews, and now I have too add my own.

We had the chicken enchiladas, al pastor huarache, and a chile relleno.  All of it was excellent.  Great green sauce on the al pastor huarache and enchiladas.  Want to go back and try the pambazo.

The gentleman working behind the counter was very friendly and answered our questions about the different dishes.  Restaurant was spotless.

Will definitely we going back again to try some new dishes.
