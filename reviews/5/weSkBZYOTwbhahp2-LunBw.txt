I had the angry hippie vegan burrito, and oh my god. I was absolutely in heaven. I haven't been inside of this location as my friend ordered me food to go very late at night, but I seriously wish I had known about this place a long time ago. At $9 a pop, you get a massive burrito filled with vegetable goodness. 

It was hard to eat, and I only had half for dinner. The other half made excellent leftovers for a hangover breakfast the next day. I was pleased! 

I guess it's a little difficult to thoroughly review a place if you haven't EXPERIENCED it. I can say that I am immensely impressed with the vegan options. I don't have to eat a plain burrito here, I can go all out with vegan sour cream and cheese too. That's the beauty of Mad Mex.

I hope I get to visit again in the future. I find myself craving one of those Angry Hippie burritos time to time, and right now is definitely one of those times!
