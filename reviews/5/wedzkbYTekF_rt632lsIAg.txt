Found this place on Yelp and decided to give it a try. I'm so glad I did! I've eaten here maybe 5 times in the past week already. The carne asada street tacos are the bomb.com and the rice is really flavorful too. I love that there is a salsa bar with a few different types of salsas and some veggies and peppers as well. The service has been really friendly and the restaurant is very clean. It's also pretty affordable and there are several different specials as well. This is my new spot for good tacos.
