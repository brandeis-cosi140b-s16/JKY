Their pan dulce is to die for! Baked fresh every day by the grand father/ owner and he does amazing work.  It sells out super fast so you know that its amazing.  Ive tried a few lunch items off the menu as well and it was great.  The staff/ family that owns the place is so nice and they treat you like family.
