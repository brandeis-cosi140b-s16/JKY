La Palapa is an amazing addition to Pittsburgh.  I went with a friend, at nine pm on a Thursday evening, to this new BYOB. We were greeted immediately by a very friendly person upon walking in the door.  It is a small, well lit and clean restaurant with interesting artwork on the walls.  The menu is even more interesting with a range of authentic Mexican dishes.  We began with the guacamole and chips and agreed this wonderfully chunky guacamole was amazing, and we promptly are it up. Everything looked exciting on the menu, so it being my first of many visits, we ordered the sampler to share.  When the plate arrived, it was a beautiful set of sights, smell and tastes!  It was well portioned, more than enough to satisfy two very hungry people.  I recommend La Palapa to everyone, it's a brilliant combination of wonderful service, amazing authentic eats at extremely reasonable prices.
