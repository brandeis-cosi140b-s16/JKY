We loved this place! We're from New Zealand and had no idea what we were doing. First time in the states, first time at Taco Bell. The young guy at the counter (wish I knew his name) was really friendly and made good conversation. Also helped out with orders. He was really awesome. Had dark hair and tan skin - wish we had more details so we could give him a shout out but he was lovely!

The tacos were really good and we got our food in a timely fashion. We'll be back!
