This place is AWESOME! Very fun atmosphere! A large group of us went here for my birthday. Brian the manager was super nice & hooked us up with a cabana for free. The pool area was great and the food was really good. All the drinks were buy 1 get 1 and the margaritas were EXCELLENT! We all will defiantly be back!
