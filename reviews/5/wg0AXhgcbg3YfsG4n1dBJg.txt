Always amazing food here. I lived in Korea for a year and a half and love good Korean food. I love good Korean fusion food too and Komex does it better than almost anybody. All food is very well priced and ginormously flavorful. Burritos are huge, tacos are fantastic and the nachos and fries are humongous portions. You can get Korean style beef, chicken or pork. Authentic flavors in all. There's also a great variety of hot sauces to put on everything. I strongly recommend getting kimchi added to your order for a little more kick.
