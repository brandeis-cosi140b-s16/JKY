I have eaten here before love it.  We brought a medium size party in with dietary restrictions.  We had the pleasure of Jamar waiting in us.  He told us to put away our menus and he would take us on a journey!  He did just that.  When our kids food came out too spicy he had her exactly what she wanted in 3 minutes.  He did an amazing job, one of my all time best waiters.  Go, ask for Jamar, even if you don't get him, you will have some of the best food in Old Town!
