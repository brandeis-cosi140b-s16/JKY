This is my 4th time here and I love it. They are so friendly from the time you walk in. It's amazing Mexican food! The fajitas are their specialty and their amazing. But their guacamole is bomb! They margaritas are to die for. The cactus is amazing. The liver and onions. To the tacos end enchiladas. I would tell anyone visiting Vegas to come here!
