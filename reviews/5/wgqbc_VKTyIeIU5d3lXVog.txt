I cannot speak to many of the menu items because I get exactly the same thing every time I go:  A Wet Green Chili Burrito.  Hands down the BEST in town.  The ambiance?  Well, there isn't any.  The service?  They don't give a crap about you and they don't have to.  The prices?  This ain't no Bertos, but the food quality is fantastic and totally worth the $10 you will pay for this scratch made scrumptiousness.  Tender, lean pork, slow-cooked in a mild green chili sauce and wrapped in a thin authentic flour tortilla, and smothered in a spicy red chili sauce with the perfect amount of kick that will make you sweat in a good way.  

Mmmm.  Seriously.  MMMM!!!!!  If all you care about is spicy Mexican delicious...go here, order Green Chili, take it to go, and enjoy!!!  You're welcome.
