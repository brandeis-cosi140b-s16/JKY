MGM has a fairly sad food court, but this place was awesome. You can actually see them making the tortillas fresh in front of you -- definitely wasn't expecting that.

The nachos with steak were a perfect snack. It was a really large portion (and they don't skimp on the meat and cheese, either) -- perfect to tide two people over for a few hours.

The nachos come with your choice of meat, plus cheese, which all goes under the salamander to get hot and yummy. Then they add salsa, sour cream and guac. This place does nachos right -- the salsa had the perfect amount of heat and flavor. The guac was good, and the nachos were some of the best-constructed nachos I've had (and I'm from LA where awesome Mexican places abound).

This place is so much better than any of the other food court options.
