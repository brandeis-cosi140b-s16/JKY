Yes yes yes.  So bomb!  My friend from Seattle told me about this joint and to check it out for her. This led us to a little hidden spot next to Palace station.  Line was fast.  Service was quick and kept us entertained.  They really loaded our burritos up.  And it was soooooooo delicious.  We had The Long Beach and Redondo each cut in half for sharing.  Would recommend to anyone who loves sushi.  Great minimalistic modern interior as well.
