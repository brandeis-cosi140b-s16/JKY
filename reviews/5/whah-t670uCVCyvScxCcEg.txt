Easily my wife's favorite tacos in Pittsburgh. Pick your meat and then it is filled to the brim with lettuce, onions, tomatoes, and cheese. I kind wish they let me fill my own tacos, but it isn't really practical since they generally have a line on the weekends. 

The grocery has the best tortillas, tamales, and salsa in town. I bought the jumbo container of their taco seasoning so I can imitate at home.
