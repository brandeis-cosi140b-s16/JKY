Just flew in from San Diego and the first text I get when we land is, "I hope you guys are hungry!" All my cousin can talk about is this amazing mexican place we have to try. He seemed to be over selling the place for about two hours. After we finally get our appetites we head over. We start with chips and salsa and it's good.  Spicy and delicious. Then the molcajetes come out and damn. There's beef chicken and shrimp in this amazing sauce in this boiling stone bowl. With sides of beans rice and guacamole and fresh tortillas. Two big bowls was enough for all four of us. If you have not been here you need to go. The service was good and the food was super tasty. I could not keep from pigging out. They really need to expand to san diego.
