Great food! Im from California but heard about this place so many times I thought i would give it a shot instead of going to the buffets and it was worth it! The shrimp was not over cooked like other places. The empanadas were by far the best i have ever had, I cant wait to go back to vegas and try another dish. Also they have love music playing, the vibe is great. I would definitely recommend this place
