200+ tequilas, one of the only places for cochinita pibil, and amazing tableside guacamole with pomegranate seeds. 

This restaurant is amazing. Don't go here if you are one of those schmucks looking for a chimichanga with rice and beans all topped with red sauce and cheese. This is real Mexican food, not some American creation that the bible belt thinks is Mexican. I've actually heard people say this place doesn't serve Mexican food, where are the enchiladas, chimichangas, etc. Go to school!

I've eaten cochinita pibil just about everywhere that serves it, and I've made it on my own. This place does it WELL! The atmosphere is interesting and fun, but the place can get really really really busy.

Go early and enjoy, and sunday brunch is great as well with live music.
