My husband and I came in here late one night, close to closing time, and we still had amazing service. We were treated like we were valuable customers, even though it was late & the staff probably wanted to go home. I got the mini chimis & my hubby got the chili relleno. I'm a Mexican food junkie & this is pretty dang good!
