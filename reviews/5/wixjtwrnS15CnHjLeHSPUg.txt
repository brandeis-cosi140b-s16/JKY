Our favorite Mexican restaurant. We have eaten here at least 30 times. There has been nothing on their menu that we have not enjoyed. Even the chips and salsa are worth the trip. Pedro's is in the Entertainment book and often have Groupon offerings. From the outside, it appears to be the proverbial hole-in-the-wall, but it is like coming home.
