May King Tino rule forever!!! I've always loved taco bell, but this one by far is my favorite! and the reason is because of King Tino, he is so cool, he has multiple times gone out of his way to give me something for free, just for the heck of it! One day my debit card wasn't working and the guy at the counter said don't worry about it its on us.
