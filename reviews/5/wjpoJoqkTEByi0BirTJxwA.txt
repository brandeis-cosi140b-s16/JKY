Found out about this place on groupon so we decided to give it a try. Everything is freshly made right in front of you. I had the pollo asado bowl and was able to choose what I want added into it, my husband had the 3 taco combo and chose 3 different meats and completely enjoyed himself. Oh and the best part, a fresh made salsa bar with chips. We will definitely be back!!
