3/25/15. Stopped in on our way home for a fast, cheap solution.  $2.36 for two soft tacos.  Guy calling my order by name too. What a sweetheart, nice to feel better than a number.  I love my tacos grilled since I no longer can enjoy the Gordita Crunch my favorite (I can't have the corn shell).

Still doesn't stop me from the occasional fast food.
