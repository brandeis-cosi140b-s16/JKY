This place just opened today, and doesn't even have a phone yet. So tonight things were a bit hectic, but service was good. I got a naked burrito (similar concept to Chipotle's Burrito Bowl) and it was pretty good. I like that Qdoba has more choices for toppings than Chipotle. I think it'll take a few visits for me to fine-tune the ingredients that I order, but Qdoba definitely has promise!
