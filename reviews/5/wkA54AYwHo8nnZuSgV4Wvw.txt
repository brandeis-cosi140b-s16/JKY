Keeping this short and sweet.  This is a restaurant/bar that wants its patrons happy and completely satisfied.  Excellent, personal service, great tasting and creative food, yummy cocktails, beautiful funky atmosphere.  I was so impressed by this place, I cannot wait to return to Phoenix to eat here again.
