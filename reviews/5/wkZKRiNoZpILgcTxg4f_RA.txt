We stopped in because my husband wanted to try the new place, even tho we weren't hungry (to see if it's worth a future drive). He had a little carne asada taco that was excellent.  He also ordered the cheese quesadilla which was typical. Served hot, fresh and crispy. The food is served with a red and green sauce that's fairly typical. Since it was our first time there, she have us complimentary chips and salsa. If you come here-order some salsa! It was very fresh and the flavor was just right. She sold us! We will be back to try other items and we will order the yummy fresh flavorful salsa!
