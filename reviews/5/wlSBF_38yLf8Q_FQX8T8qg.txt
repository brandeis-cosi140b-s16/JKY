Lucky find for Friday night dinner!!  Little store front in a shopping center near Harbor Freight. Very authentic tasting food. Chips were awesome and the salsa was very fresh.  The chili relleno and cheese enchilada was awesome!  The sauce was the best I've had in a while!  Friendly fast service.  Great prices. The speakers are a little loud but that's not a big deal.  I would definitely recommend.
