Best place for day drinking!  I've spent way too many days people watching and drinking myself into a stupor here but it's so much fun that I don't even mind!  There's definitely a large showing of the typical Scottsdale crowd but mixed in there are a few non converts wandering around.  Besides it's fun to watch the juice head gorillas walking around trying not to pass out from flexing so hard!

Besides people watching though the drinks are good, average priced for the area and the food I've tried is actually good.  The bartenders are nice to look at too (male and female).  Most likely you'll see me there on Saturday nights or Sunday afternoons having myself a grand old time!
