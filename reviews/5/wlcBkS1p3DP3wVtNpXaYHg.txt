I had such an experience that I felt the need to share. I made an online order and went to pick it up, it wasn't ready yet, however, the employees were extremely nice and apologetic, I wasn't upset in the least because they had complete positive attitudes, especially Saul, and showed true customer service. And plus, the food was bomb.
