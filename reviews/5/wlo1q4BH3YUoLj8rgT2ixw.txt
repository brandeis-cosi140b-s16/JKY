Hands down my favorite mexican food place in the world. The bean dip is, of course, awesome. You gotta make sure you don't get full on the bean dip because they'll just keep filling it up and bringing out fresh chips! I alternate between the machaca quesadilla and the carne asada chimi, and although I don't venture out much beyond that, my family enjoys the machaca tacos, the chicken enchiladas, and the green chile burro. Oh, and I really like the salsa - great taste, great hotness level. I'm getting hungry just thinking about this place.
