Cheap and delicious Mexican food.  Ironically across from a Taco Bell.  Great place to grab a quick lunch l, particularly convenient as it's just a short drive outside the gate for Nellis AFB. 

Corn and flour tortillas for the tacos are good quality, and the multitude of meat choices were all delicious.  Sides are also great, and the value for the amount of food you get is hard to beat.

Not a single complaint here!
