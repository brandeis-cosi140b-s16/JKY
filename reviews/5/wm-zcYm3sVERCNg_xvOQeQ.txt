I wish this place was open for lunch, but it's not.....The best thing here (the only thing we order) is the table side guacamole. It's great! The rest if the food on the menu is basic "safe" watered down Mexican food....seems to make tourist, wonderbread middle America happy. 

Order the guacamole! YUM!  :o)
