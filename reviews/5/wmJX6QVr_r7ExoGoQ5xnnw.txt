Only tried this place because the guy in front of me at the restaurant next door ordered ten sandwiches. Whoever that was, thanks for sending me over to Julio. It worked out well as the lunch specials run to 3pm and the chips and a good version of chunky mild salsa was free and clear with my to-go order. Of course, my thing is white meat chicken and Julio delivered with a simple chicken burrito that had a huge amount of chicken bathed in some kind of mild spices (nothing else inside but meat). The burrito is served enchilada style with rice/beans or double rice like I prefer. It is a large item and only costs less than 8 bucks at lunch. There should have been leftovers, but on this day there wasn't a scrap left in my metal tray.
