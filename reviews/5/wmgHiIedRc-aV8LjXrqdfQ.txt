Ooey gooey, Antonio.

Best green, sour cream enchilada and chili rellano I ever had.  The taste was excellent, but it was the textures I really liked.  Tons of stringy cheese, like great pizza; al dente burrito shells, like lasagna; and slightly crisp chilies,  like red onions on a pizza.  Antonio the Mexican sends his best.
