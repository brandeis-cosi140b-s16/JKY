Good luck finding better carne asada in town.  This place is crack.  Be prepared to become addicted.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE their Jr. Carne Asada burritos.  Their quesadillas are amazing too....I don't know how they make them so tasty but they are the best ever.  The only lil complaint I have is that they charge to take the beans OUT of the burrito (.30) but whatever, it's worth it.  The amount of food for the price is great.
