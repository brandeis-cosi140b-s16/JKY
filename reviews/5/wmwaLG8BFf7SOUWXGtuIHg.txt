If you haven't tried this place.. It is definitely a MUST! The food is excellent. The place is ALWAYS immaculately clean! You will see the hard workers there mopping the same area 10 times! The staff is amazing! The carne asada fries are delicious! This place makes me feel like I'm at a taco spot in real Mexico! Prepare for a line! But it's well worth it:)
