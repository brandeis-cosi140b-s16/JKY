BLACK BEAN CILANTRO TAMALE.


Best tamale I've ever had, and I'm an Arizona native from a consistent tamale-making family(don't tell them I said dis)...

Bought them from the farmers market on a whim, I eat vegetarian but decided to try the vegan options since they sounded good. So far have only had the black bean, but I've got a mushroom, corn spinach one that is in my freezer currently tempting my gut. Can't wait to try some other options, the convenience of the farmers market is perfect! I bought frozen, but could only imagine how amazing fresh.
