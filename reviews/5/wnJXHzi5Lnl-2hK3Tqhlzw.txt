I'm long overdue to review Pepe's, seeing as I've checked in enough times to warrant a cot in the back.  This place serves the *best* street tacos in Las Vegas at a great price.  

Once inside, the friendly staff does a good job keeping the place clean, and the salsa bar stocked.  They also always have a large portion of spicy carrots and chopped radishes.  The red salsa has a nice heat with great flavor.  I would take it intravenously if I could.  And here's something else unique about Pepe's:  Free refills on Horchata and fruit drinks (holy crap!).  That right there is one of the best values in town.

The tacos themselves are glorious.  I almost always get the chicken tacos with the 3 taco special which is served with beans and a smattering of chips.  The carne asada is also *very* good, though the el pastor is just kind of "meh".  What I love most about this place is the consistency; the tacos are always delicious, always hot, and always made exactly the same.  This is in contrast to some other locations *cough* Rainbow and Flamingo *cough* where the product ranges from palatable to "Dear god, did one of the cooks find an old horse dead in the street on the way in to work?".  I would seriously eat here 4-5 times per week if my cardiologist hadn't threatened me with an anesthesia free heart procedure if I didn't cut back.  This is one of my "go-to" places in Las Vegas for friends and visitors alike.

Some find the location (Boulder Highway and Flamingo) to be questionable, but just think of it as dinner and a show.  On the plus side, this location seems to attract a surprisingly attractive group of prostitutes, so bring the kids and play a rousing game of "Spot the Hooker".  It's fun for the whole family!
