What a great find!   This Mexican restaurant is located next to the Ultrastar Movie Theatre at Wadell and Litchfield Road in Surprise.   From the outside, you can't tell that it is a really nice, roomy, restaurant on the inside.  It is a sit down Mexican restaurant with all you can eat chips and salsa.  (Before we went there the first time, I thought it was just a small fast-food place, but I was wrong - it is a big, full-service restaurant.)  They have very reasonable prices, great food and a great atmosphere.  How can you go wrong?
