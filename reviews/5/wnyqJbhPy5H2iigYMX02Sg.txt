Ordered two bean and cheese burritos (one for the girlfriend) and a breakfast burrito thinking I was starving and could eat. Oth...

No way.

These things were huge and I could barely get the breakfast burrito finished.

If it wasn't for the deliciousness of it I may not have. The bean and cheese was amazing later on as well. 

Easily one of the best Mexican meals we had in the US and all for under 10 bucks.
