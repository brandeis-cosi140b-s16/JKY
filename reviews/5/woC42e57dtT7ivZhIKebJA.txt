So I've been to Sandbar like a million times in Scottsdale but I have never been to the one in Peoria, AZ. I have 1 friend who is always bugging me to go to "her side of town." I decided to venture out there the other night and it was totally worth it! Every night of the week has different drinks and dinner deals. We went on a Wednesday which was open mic night. It was so cool watching different bands and people singing their songs. After that they had their resident DJ (which they do several nights a week) and he was awesome. It was so fun to get out of the usual scene. There is always something new and exciting going on so I'll go back for sure!
