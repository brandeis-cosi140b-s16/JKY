This is my favorite ahwatukee Restraunt! It's damn good. 

I've been coming here since I was a kid, and I've never even tried any of their plates! I only ever get a b-fast burro, #12 with guac! Their salsa is fantastic, I could eat it with a spoon!  (and I have...)

Dfinately give this place a try! Mmm!
