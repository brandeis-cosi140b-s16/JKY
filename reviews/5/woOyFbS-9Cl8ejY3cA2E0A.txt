The atmosphere was great. That is strange way to start a review but I really did enjoy how the restaurant felt. It's a little far off from other restaurants and it's definitely not in the center of town. That being said the food was great, the staff was friendly, and the atmosphere was inviting. We didn't have a single complaint. I wish there were small pleasant restaurants like this around.
