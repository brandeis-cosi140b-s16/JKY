I moved to Vegas from San Jose, CA. Some of the best taco trucks ever are in the Bay Area and I was really craving that quality/ authentic flavor. I found it!!!!

BEST TACOS IN LAS VEGAS! This is not a question it is an absolute fact. You can't go wrong. I always order some Adobada and Carne Asada tacos and when I am feeling extra indulgent, I do the fries. Either way, order and enjoy because you won't be able to do it any other way.

YUMMY!!!!
