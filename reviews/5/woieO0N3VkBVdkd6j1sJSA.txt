It's is one of the best small Mexican restaurant I have been to. All of their food is awesome! I recommend it to all my friends and their prices are affordable. Trust me I'm Mexican and I know my Mexican food. Although, there are other bigger Mexican restaurant in Vegas and I have tasted them and yes they are ok and very nice but trust me the food is awesome here. Too bad they are closed on Sunday.
