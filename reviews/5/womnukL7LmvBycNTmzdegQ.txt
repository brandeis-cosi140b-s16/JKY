Auburn is great, very attentive and friendly. I love this place, and it's my go-to for a quick, great tasting and incredibly inexpensive option for Mexican food. (Or any food for that matter. It's funny because for less than what it would cost to drive through some crappy fast food joint, stink up your car and clog your arteries you can instead eat here. 

I love how the food is always fresh, and the eventually remember your order once you become a regular like myself. Granted I only do water because I'm a tad healthier than most, it's still very reasonable cost wise to get beverages. 

One of the best things, aside from speed, taste, Etc is they are usually open when you want them to be. Couldn't be happier as usual. Have I mentioned the water tastes of angel tears?
