Opening day at El Guero Canelo September 1, 2015.

Located at an old Discount Tire Store transformed nicely into a restaurant still with the roll up doors. 

All I had today was the Sammy Dog - the double dog wrapped in bacon, just as good as the original in Tucson or on Oracle. 

I understand it was the first day and will give the staff a break.

Will be back again for the Carne Asada Burrito and Tacos.
