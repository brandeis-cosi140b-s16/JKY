Best tacos in town. Period. This little place is a hidden gem. Everything I've had here has met or exceeded expectations. The women that run this place, though a little shy, are always more than accommodating. I am somewhat of a tacos aficionado and have eaten many tacos in many locales... These are some of the best I've had anywhere. The tortas are wonderful, too.
