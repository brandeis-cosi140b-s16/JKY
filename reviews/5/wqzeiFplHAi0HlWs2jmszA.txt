So this past weekend was one of gluttony -- one of my close friends from Indy and her b-f (a chef) came to visit me.

I knew I needed to bring my A-game while they were here.  Luckily Friday night I brought them to Richardson's.  I just can't explain how wowwed I was by our food.  We started with the roasted garlic appetizer.  It was an elephant (not a misnomer) clove of garlic that was roasted, so when you peeled the cloves, only mushy, garlicy goodness came out.  It was served with toasted slices of baguette and this incredible cheesy, chile pepper queso that was amazing.

We should have just not ordered entrees, because we wolfed down so much of the appetizer that we didn't have a lot of room for dinner - but yet, we pressed on...

I had the green chile pork enchiladas.  They were absolutely amazing.  The rice and beans that came with them were oh-so-tasty too.  Karen got the fish tacos -- she really enjoyed them, but prefers a tortilla to a crunchy shell.  Thom (the chef) got one of the fish specials, and loved pretty much everything on his plate, although he wasn't too wowwed by the green chile mashed potatoes.  I thought they were pretty yummy myself.

The service was OK.  The guy wasn't super friendly, which I think blows, especially considering the fact that it's a fairly pricey restaurant.

The iffy service aside, I will absolutely be coming back, and urge ANYBODY that likes southwestern food to run, don't walk, to Richardson's.
