A low-key, casual place to get delicious tacos. A bit of a trek, but just use Google Maps to get to the courtyard where DJ's is located- it's worth it! More than just a taco bar, they also offer tortas, burritos, nachos, and steak fries. The owner and the three other employees were all very courteous and quick with making our orders. It's set up similarly to Chipotle where you tell them what you want in your taco as they make it. 

The owner made me some delicious vegetarian soft tacos with black beans, rice, medium salsa, onions, cilantro, cheese, and lettuce. They also had a large selection of meat for all the omnivores out there. Complete with a beer menu, soft beverages, horchata, and jarisco, DJ's is a wonderful place to refuel without putting a dent in your bank account.
