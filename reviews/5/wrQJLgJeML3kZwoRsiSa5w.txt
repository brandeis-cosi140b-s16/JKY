My favorite Mexican restaurant in Madison.

My daughter and I visit La Hacienda pretty much weekly. I LOVE the Enchilada Suiza. Although I usually fill up on chips and pico before the meal. I crave the pico. Spicy and chunky, definately not out of a jar. Add a blended lime margarita to my order, and I am one happy gal! Other favorites: Chorizo tostada, chicken quesadilla on flour tortilla, shrimp fajitas, all queso fundido, and combination azteca. Also shout out to the waitstaff, very friendly, and I have never been dis-satisfied with anything they bring to my table. Enjoy!
