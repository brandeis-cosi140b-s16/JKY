This is officially me and my boy Lu.E.'s (SSSSTTTUUU!!!!) spot on friday nights. We went for the second time this past weekend. It was the same drunken dancing mess it was the first time and simply amazing. This place is full of locals. We met two pairs of ladies the first time and they were there again this  time and were hella cool. Only thing is that the locals here dont like the after parties. We also had bottle service. Its nexpensive in Vegas money. Its 1 bottle per 4 peeps. There was one small drawback about the bottle service...you pour your own stuff more often than you should. In addition, the tables are a bit removed from the dance floor. So if youre into people checking you out while youre popping bottles you might want to reconsider unless youre like me and dont give a crap about that as long as you pull!! One more thing. If your trying to check in with your iphone app, good luck cos this place doesnt show up for some strange reason.
