Simply put, after stopping here once, I've never stepped into a Chipotle again. Authentic Mexican food, incredibly delicious, and all at amazingly affordable prices. 

The carne asada burrito is a home run every single time. It comes standard with guac and pico de gallo, but I usually add rice/refried beans, cheese, and sour cream, and still pay less than for what I'd pay for a burrito at Chipotle. 

You know what the best part about Roberto's is? THEY'RE OPEN 24 HOURS!!! So if you're coming home late from Tao or XS or whatever may have you, this is the place to stop in to satisfy those late night cravings. 

Great food, great prices, great staff!!!
