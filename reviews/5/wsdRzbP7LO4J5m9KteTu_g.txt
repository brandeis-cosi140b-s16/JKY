I loved their brunch buffet.  You have lots of choices and the portions are small, so you can eat tons of it.  The breakfast burrito and the enchilada were the best.  I didn't care for the corn tamale, but the service was great.  We had to wait awhile for the food, because of how busy they were, but the server advised us of this.  The food for how small the portions were was delicious and appetizing and was actually feeling.  I was surprised how much stuff they can stuff into a small portion.  The restaurant has a nice view of the pool as well.
