Definitely my favorite TeX Mex place.  I've been coming to Rosa's for many years and I haven't had any bad experiences. Rosa's was always one of the restaurants on my "visiting home from college" list. 

First: Decor
The place looks nice but tiles are EVERYWHERE.  And yes they're pretty and colorful, but sometimes it can be a little hard to keep your balance when walking to the bathroom and your chair will not stop rocking.  The cheap paintings and plants are OK, definitely better now than ten years ago.  Overall not great, but WAAYYY better than El Charro.

Second:  Service
The service can be hit or miss.  Some days it seems like they have enough servers and things are done in a timely manner, but some days the whole place is just off.  Like it will take forever to get drinks, and then an eternity to get food, and then you get sick and tired of waiting to pay the server so you end up taking your bill to the front counter and have whoever is up there ring you up.  But those days are few and far between, and most of the time the people are nice and quick.

Third:  Food
As I mentioned I've been a regular for quite some time, and so I've tried everything on their menu and not one complaint.  My usual is the shrimp tacos, but I also enjoy anything beef especially the nachos.  The only down side is probably their salsa, its a bit too watery and not spicy enough but I ask for habanero sauce and that definitely punches up the spice.  And while I enjoy the taste and texture of the food as I eat it, I also greatly appreciate the fact that it doesn't "mess me up" later in the evening.  Most other Mexican food I have usually results in me re-enacting a traumatizing scene from Dumb and Dumber, but Rosa's doesn't.  All in all, the food is good.

In summary, Rosa's is and will always be my standard for TeX Mex.
