My only regret is not trying them sooner.  They are not open 24 hrs, but I think that's how they stay great.  You see them doing a thorough job cleaning the kitchen when you come in before closing.  Breakfast, lunch, dinner, these guys don't f around with their consistency, unlike all the other similar joints nearby.   Breakfast burrito, Carne asada burrito, super nachos, bean cheese and rice burrito... I want to try other things, but my usual selections always leave me satisfied.  Also, green sauce - get it.
