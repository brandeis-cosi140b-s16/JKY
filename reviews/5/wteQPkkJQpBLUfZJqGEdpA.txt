Visiting Vegas and found Tacos El Gordo on Yelp. So happy that I did! Huge 2 dollar tacos, quesadillas and fries, (no burritos), your choice of cow head, tongue, brain, tripe, steak, or spicy pork. I'm not an expert on Mexican food but I've eaten my share- this is pretty authentic, huge portions, super cheap, and most important: incredibly delicious! They also sell Mexican soda flavors like Horchata. Ended up going back again and again. This will be a stop whenever I'm in Vegas from now on.
