A lot of choices for fast food Mexican in the valley, and this one has to be one of my favorites. The service is great, and the food never disappoints. A burrito is just a mixture of stuff in a tortilla. You need good ingredients, the proper amounts of each ingredient, and a tasty tortilla. Super Burrito generally nails all 3.
