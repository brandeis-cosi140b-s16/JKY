Prickly Pear's tortillas are definitely where its at . Obviously the name is synonymous  with fresh. I appreciate a clean place, so that is what drove me there. I had the special for that day, the shrimp tacos. Every part of these wonderful creations was perfect. I tried every sauce, and I recommend for those who can handle hot sauce, the yellow concoction. With a light garlic/pepper taste that packs a delightful punch, this salsa picante has the consistency of melted butter. The dessert that came with the meal was like some form of hybrid between flan and bread pudding, and delicious. I will be back.
