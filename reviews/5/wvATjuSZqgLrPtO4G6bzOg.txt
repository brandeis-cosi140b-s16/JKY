Food was ridiculous, best lengua tacos I've ever had. If you've never had lengua before but are feeling adventurous, this is place to experiment! The staff was super helpful, they have some off menu items available that they will gladly tell you about. I want to eat all the language tacos they have. I will be here again and again and again. Best Mexican food in Las Vegas in my humble opinion.
