Alejandro made me the most incredible huaracha (mexican flatbread topped with the goods...means sandal in Spanish)  The onions and cilantro were fresh as always.  Must get the carnitas on the weekends.   The only other place I saw huaraches was at Rick Bayless's Frontera fast food place at Macy's on State St.  Rick Bayless ain't got shit on Alejandro.   

He recommended all these fantastic Mexican places for me in Chicago.

As always if you are curious as to how carnitas tastes or the awesome tongue or pastor, he's usually very helpful with samples.  Treat him right and he'll take really good care of you.

The guac was the best I've ever had.  Even better than my own.  His ingredients are much fresher than what I can get...no fair.  Tons of yummy cilantro.

Best place on campus hands down.

I miss this place so much; one of the few things about school I miss.
