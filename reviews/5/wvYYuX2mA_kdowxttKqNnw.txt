Yum yum yum! Love the grilled chicken. Not greasy and full of flavor.

Fast food that's not really fast food. We got the family meal deal and every part of it was delicious. If the potatoes ARE boxed, then it sure as heck fooled me cause it was thick and tasted like home made mashed potatoes. Complete with salad and corn cobs too. We pounded that meal like it was the last one on earth. Well, for us Hawaiians, it was, at El Pollo Loco anyway. :)

The cinnamon rice drink was also delish! It was like drinking a churro. 

Great stuff. We'll definitely go back for more when we get back to the mainland.
