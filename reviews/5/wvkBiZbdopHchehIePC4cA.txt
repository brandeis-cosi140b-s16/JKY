I had just ordered the Asada fries and they taste amazing!!! The presentation looks great. The price for a small size is reasonable but it's good enough for me. I find this way more convenient than other places that serve a lot for 9 bucks. And I can never finish it. But now I have two size choices. Not only that, the taste is amazing! I'm definitely coming back here to try the whole menu! I wish I had gotten the names of the workers there. They were genuinely nice!
