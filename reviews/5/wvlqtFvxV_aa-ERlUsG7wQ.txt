La Perla is that rarest of wonders--a terrific mom-and-pop restaurant that is still owned and operated by the Pompa family after 60 years. They've expanded the building at least three times since 1948 to keep up with demand, and the parking lot is almost always full. It's a testament to their great food, fun atmosphere and friendly service. For overall experience, this is the best Mexican place in Phoenix. You can quibble about the tiny details--maybe the beans or tortillas are a little better at Carolina's--but if you're looking for the authentic Southwestern Mexican restaurant experience the way it used to be, La Perla is a must. Your chips (always fresh and crispy) come to the table with three amazingly flavorful salsas, their old-school cheese crisps are to die for,  and those cheese enchiladas...mmm. I should really have my cholesterol checked. Their margaritas are dynamite (and potent). Writing this review is actually making me a little hungry. 

Downsides? Well, like I said, this place has been there for 60 years. By some standards it could be viewed as a dive. Personally, I find that a plus, but if you prefer your restaurants all frou-frou and "Fresh Mex" with brand-new booths and upscale beige yuppie stucco decor, you'll want to go to Manuel's or something. Some of the older La Perla booths have got springs from a 1948 Studebaker concealed in 'em, so prepare to bounce.  And prepare to leave full and happy. This is the real deal.
