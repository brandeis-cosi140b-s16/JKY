The nighttime manager at this E Main location ROCKS AND is to be commended for customer service.  Reason: bought a rotten tamal from the Filibertos on N Power, but did not notice 'til I almost had almost reached the next Filibertos on E Main.  Even though each of these locations are managed by different people the manager on E Main made things right by letting trade in the rotten one for a fresh one.

I really see no reason to try the Filibertos on S Power again.  I don't care how new of a restaurant you have you should never sell something rotten.

BOTTOM LINE: If you're in the E Valley area and going to Filibertos go to the one at 64th and E Main.
