Absolutely the BEST Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas.  When I lived in Southern California I went all the time to their restaurant there and they don't disappoint.  Yes a bit more expensive than your typical Mexican restaurant but worth it.  THE BEST Carnitas I have tasted.  Plus a huge Tequila menu.  Enjoy!!!
