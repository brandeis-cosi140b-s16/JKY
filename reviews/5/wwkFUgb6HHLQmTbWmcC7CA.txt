I came here because of the article I read in a magazine. I ordered the $7.50 carne asada burrito that came with rice and beans. Loved the tortilla. The carne asada was good. I'd give it a 7 out of 10 and would come back again to have it. Rice was simple but had good flavor. Beans were good too. The salsa bar was full of many things. I tried the pico, the hot sauce and the chunky green salsa. Each was very good. The inside was extremely clean as was the restroom. Staff was very friendly and very helpful and cleared the table. I would definitely come back again.
