I sometimes convince myself that there are better Mexican restaurants in Phoenix, then I come here and the illusion is definately shattered. 

Except for the original Garcia's Las Avenidas's rice- Carolina's has the best of everything they do. 

I thought for a moment that the restauraunt Rito's had better tortillas, but then I bought a dozen. No way. My mom makes really good tortillas, but they are tied with Carolina's.

I've had the following:
Machaca- Melt in your mouth soft- perfect flavor, quality beef
Beans- Perfect
Rice - Very Good
Green Corn Tamale- My mouth just seriously watered thinking about it
Chicken Taco- Oh My
Beef Taco - Oh Oh My
Chorizo Con Huevos- Dang- Good
Cheese Tortilla - Dios Mio!
Tortillas- Every meal on earth should be eaten with Carolina's tortillas- no more forks, no more knives, just tortillas.

One thing- The Oaxaca burrito isn't good. It's the one thing I've even had from here that didn't knock me out.
