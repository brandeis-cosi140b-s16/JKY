I've eaten at many Chipotle locations many times, both in Tucson and Phoenix. This is easily my favorite location.

The cashier is friendly, the food service is prompt. The food is usually cooked well and portions are generous! The fajitas are a bit undercooked every now and then, but they make up for it in friendly customer service.
