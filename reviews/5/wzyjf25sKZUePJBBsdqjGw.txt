While visiting I needed something quick  to eat near the Cashman  Center.  So glad I found this place right off the corner of Las Vegas Blvd and bonanza. 1 pastor taco for $2 and bbq fajita  for $8. Stuffed  my face and had a smile for the rest of the day. $10 minimum for debit /credit cards. Really quick  service. Parking available next to the food truck at that tire shop.
