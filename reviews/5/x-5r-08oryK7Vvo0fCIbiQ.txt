My taste buds are still recovering after my experience eating here. I'm angry at myself for not checking this place out sooner. Now that I have, you bet I'll be dragging my friends out here to try it. 

First off, if it's your first time, they give you samples of pretty much everything. I think this is awesome, especially if you haven't tried anything there before.

The jerk chicken immediately was my favorite. The chicken was moist and it was spiced perfectly. The jade red chicken was also delicious as well.

You can make a combo with your choice of two meats (alone, in a burrito, or in a quesadilla), rice, and beans for like $9. The portions are huge and you definitely won't leave hungry.

I got the chicken fried rice, black beans, jerk chicken in a quesadilla, and the jade red chicken alone. I couldn't finish much of the rice and beans because I was so full from the delicious chicken. I'm salivating just thinking about it.

The location is in a weird spot. If you don't know what you are looking for, it can be really easy to miss.

I highly recommend checking this place out. I don't think you'll be disappointed.
