Wasn't too sure about the place to be honest. Thought it was going to be just your typical, run of the mill Mexican food but dayuuuuuum, this place is DELICIOUS!  I had the #2, 2 tacos, rice and beans. Fairly priced at about $7. I got the chicken and was not disappointed even though I'm not a fan of meat these days! The red sauce was spicy and just added in the tastiness of it all! Definitely try it out (even if the front lady is a bit mean).
