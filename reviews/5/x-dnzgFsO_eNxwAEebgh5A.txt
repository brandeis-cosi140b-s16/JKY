Phat Burrito is a great local spot with a unique vibe.  It's the anti-Chipotle.  If you are a chain restaurant whore, you won't appreciate this place.  The service is fast and friendly but they don't wear uniforms and are likely to call you 'dude' or 'bro' vs 'sir'.  At first glance, it's a dive.  Stick it out and let the atmosphere grow on you.  Personally, I enjoy the originality of the decor vs. Subway, Chipotle, or every other restaurant that looks the exact same no matter where you are.  

The trick to maximizing your experience here is to ask for exactly what you want.  Use the menu as a guide but then specify your preferences.  You wouldn't go to Chipotle, order a chicken bowl, then cross your fingers that it comes out exactly how you like it.  If you want them to add cilantro or go heavy on the cheese- tell them so they can accommodate you.  I'm a big fan and make it a point to frequent this spot whenever I'm in town.  There's literally no where else like it.
