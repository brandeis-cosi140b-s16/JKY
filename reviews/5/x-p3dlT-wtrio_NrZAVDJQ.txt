To all of you who didn't give this place five stars, I imagine you'll never do anything of note with your lives. And I don't say that in a small way. I think that there is obviously the magic of love here and since you can't see it, it will always be the missing ingredient in everything you ever do. 

Sure, the hours are not posted or stuck to and there's no signage and there are other issues. The music can get loud. The lighting is dark. wah!

I keep forgetting to get the owner's name but this is very clearly a person living her passion, using her bountiful skills, and trying to make the world better. That's worth celebrating even if the food was shitty. But it's so far from that... 

The food is spicy as fuck. But it's way tastier than it is spicy. And the ambiance is awesome. And that couch. Oh the couch. And the lighting. In the tables. I'm such a sucker for that shit. And the water is delicious. The only improvement would be booze.
