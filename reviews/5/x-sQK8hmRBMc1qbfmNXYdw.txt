The food is great, but Genesis (pronounced heh-neh-sis for you gringos) puts the food to shame. Tonight she is wearing sassy red lipstick that is TO DIE FOR OMG. Best bartender ever. Ask her for a tres amigos y gordo next time you're in. She won't make it for you, but she'll most likely flash you that bajillion watt smile of hers-a worthy consolation prize indeed.
