This restaurant is in a fantastic location right next to a park walk in downtown own Scottsdale. The restaurant itself is very colorful, and has a nice atmosphere. The food was fantastic, especially the pork tacos. Also, the price was very reasonable. Overall, I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anybody, even if you aren't s huge fan of Mexican food.
