This place used to be horrific. We'd stand there waiting to order and the order-taker guy would be having some long conversation with his friend at a table, completely ignoring us. Or he'd answer his cell phone in the middle of us telling him what we wanted to eat. It was nuts. However they recently(ish) came under new management and it's been FANTASTIC service since then. Super speedy fast, they get the order right, and they're ready and waiting for us to order the second we're in the door. We had stopped going there because it was a major ordeal just to get the guy to take our order (and then another 20 minutes for them to make us a Super Nachos) but we saw the big yellow sign out front saying "under new management" so we tried it again and...FIXED! The new owners know how to run a business.
