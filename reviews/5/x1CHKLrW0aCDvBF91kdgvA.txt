This place is amazing! Where do I start? Carlos O'Brien's was my first eat-out experience when I moved here and I have gone back many, many times since. It's a great place to meet and eat - they have a huge restaurant with plenty of seating. The food alone is a reason to go, but the staff is always friendly and the service is very quick. My favorite dish is the CHICKEN FONDIDO! If you like fried chicken, cheese and cream cheese THEN LOOK NO FURTHER because the Chicken Fondido is the end-all be-all of amazingness!
Granted that the food is not authentic Mexican, it is very interesting to combine Mexican and Irish food. Coming from a Spanish and Irish family, I felt quite at home looking at the menu and having to choose between corned beef and nachos.
And it gets even better when you consider the prices. For the over-the-top portions you receive, the prices are very agreeable. 
The atmosphere is clean, friendly and inviting. If you're on a date you can ask for a more intimate table and they will be happy to seat you somewhere you can kanoodle with your date.
Drinks from the bar are prompt and put together correctly. Never once have I had to send something back to be remade - even when I've ordered complicated mixed drinks.
A couple can go and have dinner, drinks and dessert for under $30.
I really, really enjoy this place and highly recommend it to everyone: single people, couples, families and friends!
