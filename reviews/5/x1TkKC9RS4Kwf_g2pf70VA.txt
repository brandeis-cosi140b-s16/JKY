After years of business trips to Vegas, I finally, FINALLY, found an authentic Mexican restaurant. While it is pretty much necessary to have a car to get to this restaurant from the strip, it's worth the short drive if you don't want a gringo nacho platter like you find on the strip. This is a family-owned restaurant with a fresh-made salsa bar and entrees that taste like they come from Mexico. I had awesome fish tacos for lunch, and the flan for dessert was superb! The restaurant is by no means fancy, and is in fact a casual spot within a strip mall area. If you've got a nudge for real Mexican food though, this is the place.
