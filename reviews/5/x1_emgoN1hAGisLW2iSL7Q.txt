So glad we stopped in this place.  The service was great.  And so was the food.  It was especially fresh.  We all ordered different dishes, and they were all great.  I can't wait to eat my leftovers tonight (couldn't eat it all at lunch).  Thank you yelpers for your good reviews which encouraged me to try it out.
