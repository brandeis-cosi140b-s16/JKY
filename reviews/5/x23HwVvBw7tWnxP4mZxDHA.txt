My girlfriend and i hit sammy's spot before our flight back to Baltimore this week.  We were SUPER impressed!!!   The food was excellent!  The chips and guac, the grilled chicken salad.  and.......   the margarita's were top notch.   Service was quick, friendly and informative.  Very relaxing environment. The only issue we had was that there was a table sat the whole time we were there in front of the merch area.  We wanted to get a closer look, but couldn't.   Price...  it's definitely pricey..  VERY pricey (1 salad, 1 order of nachos, 4 margaritas = $85)..  BUT...  it's a sit-down restaurant in an airport, so i expected that.
