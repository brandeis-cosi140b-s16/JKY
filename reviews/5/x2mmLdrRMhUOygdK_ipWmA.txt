I've never heard of this place until a week ago. I'm from California and was visiting some friends in Mesa, and they suggested that I try this place out. The next day I went there and ordered breakfast burritos for everyone. Let me start by saying that I wish there were places like this in California with the drive thru etc. The food was prepared fast considering what I ordered. The prices were cheaper than I'm used to paying for in Cali. Most importantly the breakfast burritos were huge and delicious! I especially like how they don't just stuff a huge amount of hash browns or potatoes in the burrito like they do over here. Open some more locations in California (Los Angeles area)!
