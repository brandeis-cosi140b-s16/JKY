Best tacos ever!!! My only issue here is deciding what I want.. Thursday the market is open late so it's a great place for a quick dinner. I've loved everything I had here and the owner is super nice! The chips are amazing, I can't help but get them. I love the tacos in every variety! The vegetarian potato taco is Soo good!
