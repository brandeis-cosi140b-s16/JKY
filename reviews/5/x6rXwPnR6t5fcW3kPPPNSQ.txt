My Dad gave me a Chili Relleno from here the other day! Wow! This is by far the best Chili Renello I've ever had. It was filled with a huge hunk of jack cheese that oozed out when I cut into the pepper. It was also covered in cheese, an excellent red sauce and pico! It was a huge portion too! I was in heaven.

I don't live on this side of town, but I'll be back soon to try some other items like the fish tacos.
