Ok, so where do I start...I am new to the valley, and was asking around about a good Mexican restaurant in the area. I think I had about five different people recommend this place called "Filiberto's". When I asked what this place was like, I got the same answer from each person, "dude, it's like Mexican fast food, but way better than taco bell!". Well me being from California, where authentic Mexican places are on every corner, I was sceptical to say the least. So on Oct 29, I finally decided to go check this place out for myself.
I ordered the #19-chicken burrito, chicken enchilada, rice, and beans (w/no tomatoes). It probably took four minutes from order time until I got my order, very fast. I was very pessimistic at this point about how the quality of this food was going to be. To my surprise,when I opened the box everything was very neat and presentable, and looked delish. 
 I started out by pouring some hot sauce on top of the whole meal and then I dug in. The burrito was big, but not intimidating, and the chicken was very moist. The burrito had a good mixture of rice,beans and chicken. The enchilada was smothered in sauce with lettuce and cheese on top, in a corn tortilla. It was very moist and the sauce they used was awesome. They gave me a large portion of re-fried beans with melted cheese on top. Last was the rice, normally I am not a big fan of Mexican style rice, but this rice was soooo good, not overpowered with spices, just right.
 Overall Filiberto's is an awesome joint, it's cheap,fast, and delicious. It's a no frills, authentic Mexican fast food spot, you cant really ask for much more. I'm glad I was advised to go to Filiberto's and I will definitely recommend it to other people.
