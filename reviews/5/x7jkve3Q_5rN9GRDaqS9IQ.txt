Love this tiny spot! Fits all my Mexican food needs: good salsa, good chips/tortillas, good beans. Truly delicious homestyle Mexican. Add onto that great and quick service plus super cheap prices... Oh and their iced tea with a hint of cinnamon is my favorite kind. El Bravo serves a similar style.

These kind of restaurants are why I'm happy to be a Phoenician.
