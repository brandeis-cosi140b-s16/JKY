I frequent Valle Luna as I am a fan of great Mexican food and I live in the area.  I recently had a simple misunderstanding with a take-out order.  When I brought it to the attention of the hostess she instantly became aggressive taking no accountability only making matters worse.  This started becoming an argument that I didn't want any part of...I had a delicious chicken chimichanga waiting for me and I would rather eat it than argue with a teenager about my order.  

...why am I giving this a 5 star review?

As the owner of a small business with employees I would want to know of issues regardless of size so I called the admin contact.  I know not everything can always go as smoothly as preferred and these are often the moments that you can really tell what a business or person is made of.  The next day and spoke with the owner, Janie with regard to the issue and was pleased.  I wasn't looking for anything, I just wanted the restaurant that I enjoy to continue to be great.  Janie, handled the issue reasonably and professionally and I would tell she had a great deal of concern for her establishments.  

Great food and a great commitment to customer service from the top down.
