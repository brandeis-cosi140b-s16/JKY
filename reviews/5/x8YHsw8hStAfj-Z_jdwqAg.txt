Updated and still great....I took a break from putting up Christmas decor.  I was in the mood for a torta so I decided to pop by.  Since my last visit, the patio has been expanded with some sun shades.  Art and the interior also have some bright updating done.   The staff is very friendly and helpful.  The guacamole is great and still a highlight for me.  I ordered the Carne Asada torta.  The food was out promptly and the music provides a great eclectic and urban feel.  Happy hour deals are great and include some food items.
