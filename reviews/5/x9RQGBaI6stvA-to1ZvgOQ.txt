Bumping this fab place up to the 5 stars it deserves! If you have a car please do not eat mexican on the strip ever again! Mundo is a close drive and is FAR better than Dos Caminos, El Segundo, etc, etc. Park in the Northern most lot in the World Market Center . Surface lot is easy !

Today for lunch I had the carnitas. I've been searching high and low for delicious carnitas in Vegas and now I've finally found them . By far the best I've ever had! Tender, succulent, just a hint of orange. PERFECT! Served with a beautiful tomato/habanero salad, onions, and avocado for $14. 

Don't waste your time on the strip, stop wasting money at Lindo - this is the place ! It's hip inside, service is amazing, and I can assuredly tell you it's the best Mexican food restaurant in Las Vegas!
