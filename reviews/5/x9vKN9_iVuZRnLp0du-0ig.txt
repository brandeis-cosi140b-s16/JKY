This Place is AMAZING!! From the Ambiance, to the food and drinks. This place is to die for. Jose and his staff did an awesome job with making us feel at home and apart of the family. Myself, my boyfriend and best friend really enjoyed ourselves! The Sangrias are so amazing and so delicious!! We are not from Las Vegas and was here on vacation from Los Angeles and we will be back and the next time we are here we will be sure to stop in with our friends to say hello and enjoy some great food!! You will most definitely see me again!
