So we were at work trying to figure out what to eat and passed over this place a couple of times, soooooooo happy we didnt. I got the Chinco fries and the Pastrami Boyger, it was the best lunch ive had. It was soooo good, they have a lot on the menu so I will have to return a few times just to be sure aha. The cashier and the cook were nice also. The establishment is a little small but I will definitely be returning.
