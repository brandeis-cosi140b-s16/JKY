I've been coming to Chino for YEARS!  I won't say how long cause it makes me feel old.  Tonight I brought in some first timers!  They loved it!  The service is always friendly, the price is amazing and the food is great.  I forgot to tell the newbies about the famous Volcano Cookies,... next time.  Just wished there was a Scottsdale location.
