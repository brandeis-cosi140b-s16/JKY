I've eaten here a lot! Their grilled chicken & carnitas tacos, burritos & family dinners are phenomenal & they don't skimp. The carnitas nachos are awesome & stay crispy, though they need to drain the carnitas a bit more as it's quite greasy. I wish they had a half order, however, as they are HUGE! The chile relleno is pretty good & the cheese enchilada is tasty but could use more sauce. The chicken quesadilla is fantastic too but gets pricey once you add sour cream & guac. Overall prices are cheap though. Their red mild or hot salsa is the best around! It's smooth w/a few tomato & onion chunks & fresh cilantro. I'm not much of a fan of the red or green sauce most places offer. The only thing I haven't liked is their taquitos or rolled tacos which are super cheap but are not your typical filling, it's some sort of flavored or sauced ground beef, almost chili like if I recall correctly. Service is good too! Drive thru is convenient!
