My husband and I ate at On the Border in Concord today for a late lunch/early dinner.  We always dine in the bar because of the atmosphere and vibe.  We had Neil for our waiter/bartender, and he is so personable.  Our food was delicious and our drinks were cold and satisfying.  He visited with us just enough to make us feel at home and stay longer for another beer! :)  Great place, great service, and great Neil
