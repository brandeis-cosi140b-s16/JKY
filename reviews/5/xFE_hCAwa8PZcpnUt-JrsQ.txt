A truly authentic Mexican restaurant with some of the finest tortillas around.  I don't live anywhere near Tolleson, but whenever I find myself in the area, I make it a point to stop here for a California burrito.  The tamales are excellent, as are the soups.  I've tried a half-dozen things from their menu so far, and I have been thoroughly impressed with every single item.  And the best part is that the cost is very reasonable.

If you enjoy trying new Mexican restaurants and find yourself in the Tolleson area at some point, you owe it to yourself to give Tamales Guadalajara a chance.  It's fantastic.
