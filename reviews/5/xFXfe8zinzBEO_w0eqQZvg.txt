We stopped here because it was literally the first place we came across after leaving the airport. I'm so glad we did. 

The food, drinks, and service were so good we ended up celebrating our engagement there. 

My fianc√©e had the carne asada. He's an incredibly picky eater and he loved it. The steak was perfect. Tender and tasty. I had a veggie combo. They were all excellent and had really great veggies cooked perfectly. Still crisp and flavorful. No pile of over cooked zucchini to be seen. I adored my food. We got the guacamole and it was super tasty, fresh, with good chips. I had an El Tambien drink and thoroughly enjoyed each sip. 

Every person there was so friendly! The guy who made our guacamole took pride in his work and had us taste it and make sure it was perfectly to our liking. Our server was friendly without being intrusive and chatted with us about our engagement. He apologized to us for the noisiness of a neighboring party. I was so impressed with the staff. I will absolutely go there again!
