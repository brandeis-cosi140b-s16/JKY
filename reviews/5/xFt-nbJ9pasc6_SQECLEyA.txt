First time there but definitely not the last. Read the reviews and thought we would give it a try. The food was delicious. I had the combo of relleno and enchilada and my hubby had the signature burro. We loved the food. The refrained beans were out of this world, rice was very good, and everything else was exceptional. 

The place is not fancy but with good food you don't need anything fancy. It's in a strip shopping center. Definitely worth a second & third & fourth, etc. trip
