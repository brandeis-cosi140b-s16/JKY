I LOVE Chipotle!! I eat it and dont feel guilty. I know the products are fresh and come from farms that dont inject a ton of antibiotics in the animals. It is a fast food chain, but comes without the nasty feeling of going into one. Have you tried their guacamole? It is the best! If you are really hungry get a burrito. If you are just a little hungry get a bowl. You can decide how many calories you want to consume when selecting what you want in your meal.
