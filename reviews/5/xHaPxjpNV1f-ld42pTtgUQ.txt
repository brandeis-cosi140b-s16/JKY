Three of us locals went to try a restaurant we had never been to before and came out wondering how come we didn't find this place before!  The service was impeccable...from the hostess to our waitress to the manager.  Everyone was friendly and helpful.  We ordered the guacomole that is prepared tableside and we practically licked the bowl.  The posole and kobe dog hit the spot on a chilly afternoon.  The manager, Michelle, stopped by our table and after some Facebook discussion, sent us three small avocado margeritas to taste.  OMG!  I can't wait to spread the word about this place and I know my boys will LOVE the kobe dog.  Can't wait to go again soon!
