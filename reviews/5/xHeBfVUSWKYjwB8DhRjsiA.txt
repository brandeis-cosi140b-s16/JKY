I live in California and I can honestly say I practically grew up there.. shit, I've been drinking there since forever.. the margaritas are wonderful! and the food is the best I've had in most places... ( even in mexico...) I wish we had one where i live... i'd be there everyday for happy hour... lol  seriously.
