Me and my boy saw the OPEN sign went into the restaurant at 9:30pm, welcomed by 3 staff members asked what time they close they told me 10. Ordered Kailua pig quesadilla and steak bowl. The tortilla of quesadilla got burnt they apologize and said they are gonna fix it so no problem. They even offered taster food so that my boy can start eating. Didn't feel rushed and loved the relaxing atmosphere because it wasn't so busy. When we finally got the food, the manager handed  it over in a to go container and took good care of us. She apologized for the wait. They provided great customer service and owned up to their mistake with sincere apology plus made up for their mistake to make things right. We will definitely be back.
