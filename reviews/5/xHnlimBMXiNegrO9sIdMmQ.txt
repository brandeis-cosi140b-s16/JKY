I went to this place for the first time with my son this week and then went with my son and daughter a few days later.  I can't wait to take my husband...    The food is so fresh and cooked to order. I have not tried the seafood but everything I have had was great.  Even my kids loved the food...   It is a husband and wife that own the place and they are such great people...  She is the server and he is the cook...It has been there for 11 years and when you eat the food you can understand why...     I love that it is right on Water Street where you can sit and watch the people go by..... If you are looking for some great fresh Mexican food and a reasonable price this is the place...
