Wow, interesting reviews. I had a great experience at Fuzzy's. Met a bunch of my friends there Saturday around 11AM or so before we  headed to the Badger game.   There were about 15 people there and we did not  have any service issues.   In fact, they kept our beer glasses full. :).  The girls really liked a drink called a Fuzzy Driver (or something like that).  
 
I had been to Fuzzy's before so I knew what to expect but was interested to see my Foodie friend's reactions.  They  thought the food was rock solid.   Great tasting, good variety, and great prices.   Just as I thought -  everyone really liked the fish tacos with feta (yum - writing this makes me want one right now).   Burritos were raved about as well.

Fuzzy's is winning me over.   Again- if you are looking for a high end meal - this is not your place.   If you are looking for really good fresh food at really good prices - this is your place.    

Damn- now I really want a taco.... Mouth is watering....
