This place is great! I'm surprised to see so many negative reviews, though if you read them they're pretty lame ie: someone said "I'm never coming back to this place because there was tomatoes in their carne asada burrito" what? That's your criteria for 1 star?

Having lived in San Diego, I have high expectations and the only two restaurants in Las Vegas that lived up to this have been this place and El taqueria el buen pastor--the taco truck over by cashman's field. The other places near here:
Alberto's 
Tacos de Tijuana 
Taco y taco 
Are overpriced too greasy and not that good. 

What I like:
-location near our house
-nice workers 
-open whenever we're needing it!
-Decent salsa bar: they have a nice red and my favorite the green. They have cucumbers and pickled carrots. 
1. The bean and cheese burrito for 2.5
2. The breakfast burrito with potatoes bacon and egg for 3.75.

We come here to watch soccer games and get our mex fix on. 

Hasta manana!
