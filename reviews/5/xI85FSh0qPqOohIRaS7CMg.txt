What a gem! Came in this am around 10:37, and they were only serving breakfast. But our waitress asked the cook if lunch could be served and yes it could! Whew! 
I had the BBQ chicken nachos and it was delicious! Very generous portion but not monstrous! Service was great, food was great! This is a must spot!
