We have lived within 2 blocks of this place for over 3 years and always seen the sign but never went in. We decided to try it a few months back and boy was it worth it (wishing we had walked through those doors earlier). We visit once if not twice a week. They  have a great burrito, street tacos are delish and the salsa is super hot red or green. Every Tuesday is $1 tacos so that's a must. Fridays they have chicken abondigas and that's another awesome meal. If your in Phoenix looking for an updated Mexican restaurant this is the place!
