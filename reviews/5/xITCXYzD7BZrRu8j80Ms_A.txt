Two Gals rules.  I remember many, many a trip to Boulder City as a child, mainly for Art in the Park and other events, and we would always stop at Two Gals for breakfast or lunch and it was always, and still is, one of my favorite things about going to Boulder.

The old-fashioned feel of it is quaint and homey, and everything there is just so fresh and actually cooked just for you.  The wait staff is friendly and the whole thing has such a small-town charm about it.

And the food is always amazing.  Their breakfasts are big and hearty, their quiches are basically gourmet and are pretty well known.  For lunch, they have sandwiches to tempt and sate any appetite along with other selections. 

Do yourself a favor the next time you go to Boulder:  Skip the A&W.  They have those in Vegas now.  Try Two Gals.  You'll thank me later.
