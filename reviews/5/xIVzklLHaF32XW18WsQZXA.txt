I have lived in Arizona near  Cave Creek my entire life. I have never been here before. The owner Bart is real friendly and is fun to talk to them. The food was amazing. I enjoyed their Navajo taco was made fresh and was very filling. The Navajo fried bread was good. If you want an authentic Arizona food this is the place!!!
