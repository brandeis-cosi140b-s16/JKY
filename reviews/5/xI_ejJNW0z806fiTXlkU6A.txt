And the academy award for best brunch in Vegas goes to the Border Grill in Mandalay Bay. Absolutely freaking knock-me-over amazing,,,,I kid you not!!!
With all the places I checked out in Vegas during my one week stay this was the place that impressed me the most. 

First off the patio is so cool overlooking the lazy river pool; one of the nicest pools in Vegas btw....perfect breeze, lovely day and fantastic service. 

It is an all you can eat and there is a long list of tapas from which to choose from. I tried about 3/4's of the list and each one that came out just got better and better. Far too many to mention just try them all you will not be disappointed. My faves were the empanadas, skirt steak and the potato tacos....wow!!! What a refreshing concept to the typical brunch. 

Check it out; it really was all that and much much more.
