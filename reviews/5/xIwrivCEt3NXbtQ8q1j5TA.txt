Guacamole with pomegranate seeds made table side is amazing!  Salad with dinner so good.  We were a walk in party of 5 and didn't have to wait too long while every table was filled.  Unique menu.  Three taco choices were ample and tasty.  Carmel Churros unbelievable dessert!
 Elegant Mexican dining.
