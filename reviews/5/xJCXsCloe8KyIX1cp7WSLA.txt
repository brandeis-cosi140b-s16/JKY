this place is awesome. let me start by saying i am mexican from los angeles who loves and appreciates great mexican food. i like most mexicans perfer spicy food or seafood for a hangover cure. so about four years ago i decided to find the perfect spot. i asked a few latino workers who work at the casinos. quite a few recommend this place.boy was i impressed. the menu is very large. great breakfast and mexican dinners. i perfer to stick with the seafood. the have great ceviche and shrimp cocktails.also i recommend the perfect hangover cure ,the micheladas and camarones en agua chile. the micheladas are basically beef with chili and tomato juice with lime. camarones agua chile are raw shrimp cooked in a spicy lime juice. these two things will really wake you up. when ever i am in las vegas i make sure to stop by. viva la sirena
