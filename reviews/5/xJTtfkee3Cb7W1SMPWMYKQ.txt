Had a friend in town staying at the Embassy Suites this week. Since there was a Garcia's in the hotel, we just decided to go there for lunch and catch up.  I hadn't dined at a Garcia's in years and I am always skeptical of hotel restaurant prices.  But I was pleasantly surprised at the reasonable prices for such large portions. And the food was delicious!!!  And our server Carla was just the sour cream on top of the enchilada!  Her service was outstanding!  I will definitely be back!!
