First time and we will be back!! I had the street tacos, 4 tacos with a large portion of rice and beans amazing.  My husband had a beef taco and tamale both were very good.  Salsa and chips delivered to our table as soon as we sat down and Luis our server was great!  Plus a large draft mug of beer was only $5.25!  They also have a fiesta hour 3pm-6pm with food and drink discounts. Overall great food and service!!
