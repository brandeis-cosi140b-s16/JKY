Absolute best nachos ever. The tortillas they use are also very good, tastes like my aunt's homemade! They also offer mango salsa, everything was delicious. 

The staff was courteous and the meals were reasonably priced. I'd definitely visit again, this isn't your local Filiberto's! 

I wish everyone would stop comparing them to Chipotle. This is Baja Mexican, and Chipotle is Americanized Mexican food. Two different things, that's like comparing Kansas City BBQ to Memphis BBQ, both good, but different.
