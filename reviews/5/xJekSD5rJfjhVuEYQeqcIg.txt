Burritos and the chips are amazingly awesome. Saw one customer that was complaining because the chef told him he could only accept cash at the moment and it was closed for a moment, the customer was also mad because his kids were hungry. To that customer, there are tons of places to elsewhere. If you were so concerned of your children being hungry, maybe take them somewhere else to eat instead of complaining and posting it on fb/yelp. Are you really that lazy to walk a block to find foods? Anyways, foods and service is awesome! Keep it up!!!
