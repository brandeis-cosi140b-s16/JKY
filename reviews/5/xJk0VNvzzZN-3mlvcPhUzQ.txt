This is a wonderful restaurant and I've been going here at least once a week for the last few years. Very friendly staff. The food is amazing. And there's a lot of things here that you won't find at Filiberto's or even Macayos. Very authentic dishes you can't get anywhere else. My favorites are the sopes and the tostada moreliana. If you love Mexican food, you will absolutely love this place. The Horchata and Jamaica is wonderful as well. And, they just added a dessert bar where you can get all kinds of ice cream, as well as strawberries and creme. Everyone I've ever brought here has loved it.
