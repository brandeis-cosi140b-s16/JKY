I came from Southern California, so I have different expectations for Mexican Fast Food.

Senor Taco is likely the best I have had.  The beans are haunting.  Tortillas good.  Shrimp burrito is excellente.  Chicken burrito is great.  It goes on and on.  

Great salsa bar, but could be a bit hot for someone from the Midwest.

This place blows away Nando's and any other Mexican restaurant in the East valley, except Tia Rosa's.
