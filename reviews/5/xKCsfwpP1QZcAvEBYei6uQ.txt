Do not let the building deceive you. This place is the BOMB for street tacos, authentic mom and pop food!! My bf had read about them in either the New Times or Phoenix Magazine. We decided to check them out and have been there 2 weekends in a row now. Small dining area and a small outside (but covered) dining area. The owner runs the front register (at least I think he is.) Very cool guy! I ordered 2 carne asada tacos, black beans and rice. Same for my bf.  Within a few minutes we had a tray with our food and a few extras. 2 sauces and one guac sauce. A small tray of sauteed onions, Serrano peppers that were sweet and delicious!! Now for the tacos, OMG they were insanely delicious! So good that I went back for 2 more and Ryan went back for another plus a cabeza taco. The meat was all tender, flavorful. We were talking with the owner about how I hadn't found a place out here in Phoenix with tacos like this since I lived out in Azusa California. The owner knew the place that I used to go to as he went there when he was in college out there. Small world! Also he brought me out some extra hot sauce that he doesn't give to just anyone. You have to ask for it. Smoky, spicy! So when we went in last Saturday, he asked me if I wanted the extra hot sauce again? My response "Bring it!" LOL. This place will have you craving tacos. Next on my list to try, their shrimp tacos. Check them out. I would highly recommend Tacos Atoyac!
