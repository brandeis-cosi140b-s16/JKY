A fine Mexican joint with good food, good prices, and a slightly hole in the wall interior.
They use Mexican cheese instead of jack or mozarella which gives their quesadilla and beans with cheese a delicious, authentic flavor.
Had some chorizo tacos and the meat was stellar.  Nice spice and the corn tortillas were cooked to perfection.  Highly recommend this place.  
If you're used to eating at Roberto's you will find this place is leagues better and with lower prices to boot.
