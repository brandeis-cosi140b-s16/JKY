We love this place have been going in here for years. The food, ambiance and staff are great. They have the best cheese crisp in town.. What's up with all the bad reviews is beyond me. A lot of people now days love complaing and trashing people behind a computer when they don't get their way about things. Go try it! You won't be dissapointed guaranteed..
