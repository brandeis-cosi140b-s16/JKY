I am a huge fan of Arriba Mexican Grill! If you like spicy this is the place for you!
When your seated they give you some of the best made fresh daily chips with 3 different types of dip (a spicy bean, a mild and a hot salsa). They have a great margarita selection ( the prickly pear is great as is the mango!) 

Now down to the food! They have a great selection of lunch specials that are pretty cheap (from 6.99  - 10.99) and have decent sized protons. They are served Monday through Friday from 11am - 4pm! 

The dinner protons are huge! And they have a huge menu! My favorite things there are the queso fundido (a great cheese dip, spicy but good!) the Poco Pollo Con Queso is to die for, as are the white sands chimichangas. I find the white sands to be a little spicy for me sometimes, so I usually switch out the spicy pork for the machaca or chicken. 

It's not only a great place for a family to dine, but it's also a great place to go and hang with friends.
