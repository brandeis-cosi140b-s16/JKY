As per our last visit, this place is still awesome! Came here on a Sun. around 4, it was happy hr. and they had a nice crowd going.  We sat at the bar, although the bartender was really busy, he got to us immediately and checked on us throughout our visit.  We shared the shrimp tostada bites and each had a drink, such a reasonable and tasty HH menu that doesn't break the bank! :)  We will be back when in Phx. again!
