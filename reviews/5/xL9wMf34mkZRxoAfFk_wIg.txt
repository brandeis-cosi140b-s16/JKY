Chipolte, where Love and Food are One....

Love.  That's the first thing that comes to mind when I think of Chipotle.  Not only the love that I have for this establishment and company as a whole, but the love that is put into each and every burrito I've ever eaten from Chipotle.

I've been to this particular Chipotle about three or four times, and I have never been let down.  I would also like to mention that about once every other week, my gf brings me carryout from Chipotle. Thanks hun!!  I have never had a sub-par meal or Chipotle experience.

My go to is the grilled steak burrito.  I've been to burrito joints all over this town, from Qdoba, to Johnny Burrito to Salsaritas, and I've yet to taste steak that is on the same level as Chipotle.  Its tender, juicy and full of flavor.  I usually like to go with the black beans and all the fixins they can pile into one monster burrito.  I must mention their guacamole.  I'm always sure to add guac to my burrito.  I will say that there is a slight up charge to add guac but their guac is filled with such greeny goodness that the up charge it totally irrelevant!  

Just about every time my gf and I go to Chipotle, we are sure to get an order of the chips and guac as a side item.  Not only are the chips always fresh and crisp, but you can never get to much of the guacamole from this place.  I mean do they fly the avocados in fresh daily from Mexico??  

The service is always great here at Chipotle.  They are always quick and efficient.  My order has always been made exactly as I've requested.  The actual inside of the establishment is always clean and tidy.

So I guess its all a matter of what you LOVE in life?  If you LOVE good, tasty, filling, food, then there's really only one place to go, one place to fall in LOVE with - CHIPOTLE!
