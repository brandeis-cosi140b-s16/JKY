Absolutely fantastic! Got tacos with lengua, cabeza, and all pastor and they were all perfect. So many places have mediocre lengua, but this was flavorful and moist. Same with the cabeza. Frankly, the al pastor was better than perfect; the marinade had a deep southwestern red chili flavor. It was a little too intense for my wife, but I loved it. Go here!
