I eat at Rubio's here and there but have never been to this location before. I loved the food as always and I was particularly impressed by the girl Bri who worked there. She was very happy and smiley while she was taking my order. I watched as she interacted with other guests (I have been in the restaurant business too) and I was impressed by how she handled herself and other guests. I think she is a great employee and I wanted to share that. I always love the salsa bar with chips! Yum!
