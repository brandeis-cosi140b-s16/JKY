This place is what mexican greasy pits are supposed to be - it's filiberto's-ish but a little more personal and seems almost like it's family run. 

Is it shiny new and clean? No. It's cheap mexican food, with awesome flavor and lots of good greasiness. Nobody is ever in there for lunch which is kind of nice because you can see them cook your food fresh and don't have to worry about how long meat has been sitting in a tin. I always get a carne asada taco and carnitas taco which are always awesome. My only negative is once my carne asada tacos had a little too much fat and gristle on them but eh for $2 each you only expect so much.
