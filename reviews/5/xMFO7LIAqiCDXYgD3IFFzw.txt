This Rubio's location is great! Service is friendly and fast, they always get my order right and the food is great! I have had multiple bad experiences at the Eastern and Serene location but this location has never disappointed. I recommend the Classic Steak Burrito Especial. It's not on the menu anymore but they will make it for you. It's delicious!
