Yay! A second First Review because Yelp deleted the one from the first day they were open when we ate here "because it lacks a firsthand customer experience." 

I guess my description AND PHOTOS of the meal somehow aren't good enough. Would the credit card receipt somehow prove it?

Here's why this place is authentic New Mexican Food:

1. The owners and kitchen staff are from Albuquerque.
2. She is a fellow Hatch-Head. If it's not from Hatch, New Mexico, then it's not "chile".
3. Christmas style ain't just for December
4. The enchiladas are topped with a fried egg...by default.
5. Very friendly and invited us to the soft opening "if we don't mind a few inevitable glitches while we get things figured out." 

We dined there on their opening night and found the food to be wonderful, authentic New Mexican cuisine. The owners are very friendly. The shop also has some items that I haven't seen available in Las Vegas.

My original review was much more detailed, but recreating that content for a site that doesn't bother to actually read before deleting them is not something I care to do right now.
