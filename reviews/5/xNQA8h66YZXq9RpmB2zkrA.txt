Let say for a moment, you could stuff your face with tacos and sushi.  Or Pollo chicharon with kimchee fried rice...at the same place.

AT THE SAME PLACE?!?  Yup. 

This joint, does exactly that. 

concept-5 stars.  Mexican and Japanese fused together? YES.
food-5 stars: FLAVOR EXPLOSIONS in your mouth? YES.  For detail, see below. 
decor:  5 stars: I felt like I was in some hip LA restaurant, complete with the plastics.
service: 5 stars: I never felt like I needed to find someone to fill my water or give me food. Props to everyone being attentive and gracious with the food suggestions.
drinks: 5 stars-I had a Tokyo mule, 'nuff said. 

We ordered, and it's recommended, you share a variety of plates. 
It's tapas/family style so, you'll want to order a variety of things to sample.

Our list: 
LUMP CRAB GUACAMOLE-fresh, seasoned well, and served with fried tortillas-YUMM. 
CHICHARRON DE POLLO-imagine spicy chicken tenders, but better. YUP.
KIMCHEE FRIED RICE-eggs, mushroom, and a kick. Paired well with beef. YES
ROLLO CHINGON-adobo, jalapeno, and a strawberry glaze.  Top seller, and pretty good. YUP.
VIETNAMESE STYLE "SHAKING BEEF"-filet mignon with an amazing serrano chile sauce-YES.

Everything was awesome, and I'm embarrassed to tell you that I wanted to order more. 

Highly recommend.  Not only for the food, but for the people watching.
