BEST Mexican taco shop I've ever been to!!! 

The staff is extremely friendly and generous! They pretty much remember you after the first time you visit. We went there almost every day when we visited for a week. Perfect for lunch on your way to the strip.... or on your way home at 3am (hangover prevention). :) 

The carne asada tacos are out-of-this-world! Flavorful beef, guacamole, onions and cilantro on their homemade corn tortillas. The quesadilla is also amazing!! Tried both in a corn torilla and flour tortilla - both equally delish! 

They also serve roasted peppers and green onions as a side with your taco or quesadilla. Not sure what to do with those but just ate it separately... they are soaked in butter and good! :)

Dont bother with fancy restaurants on the strip... try this place!!! :)
