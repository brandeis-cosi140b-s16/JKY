My husband and I just had a delicious late night meal after the Pirates game. We are from California, and pleased to find this great spot, a short walk from PNC Park. We asked for classic margaritas (not on the menu) and waiter said "no problem". Bartender delivered perfect margaritas. Baja fish tacos and pork al pastor tacos were excellent. Staff attentive and were very helpful getting us transport back to our hotel. Good, hip vibe and overall excellent experience!
