Been wanting to check this place out for awhile. The place is literally a shack but omg don't let that deter you from checking it out. 
I ordered the California burrito which had carne asada, guac, potatoes, and sour cream. With a side of chips and guac. People are super nice and the guac is super tasty. I would like a tub of just that with their paper thin chips. So addicting. 
Carne asada in the burro was Delish. Some of the best I've ever had and the burrito was full of it. 
Go check it out!! Sad they close at 2pm otherwise I would grab it for dinner on my way home from work.
