Do yourself a favor and go here for lunch. My friend had the torta and it looked amazing (she said it was delicious). I had the carne tacos and the meat was flavorful and plentiful. The salsa - delicious. The corn tortillas were perfect and the perfect vessel for the meat. I'm gonna get them again 

I had the strawberry guava luncharita and it was refreshing. It wasn't too sweet and perfect for a hot day. I got a refill. The staff was super nice. The establishment is wonderfully decorated, but small. So I wouldn't go during the rush unless you're getting it to go. It takes a while to get your food because it's made fresh to order and completely worth the wait. 

I looked around at other peoples' plates and everything looked wonderful. The dillas looked perfect. Next time I go, I'm getting one. Lastly, we ended our meal with churros...geezeeee creezeee. They came out hot. Bravo guys, bravo. 

Ya gotta go. For the love of all that is good in this world, go!
