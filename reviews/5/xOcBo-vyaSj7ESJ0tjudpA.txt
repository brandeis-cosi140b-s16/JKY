More proof that the hole in the wall joints are the best. My favorites are the Henegrade Chicken, and Pollo Diablo. Many different options for rice which are quite tasty. Combo platter will also include beans. May not be the prettiest place to eat in the valley, but you will leave with a smile on your face. My only frustration with them is that they won't sell me more snicker doodles (most of the time) to take home. When I worked on Scottsdale Road, a large group of people were willing to travel 8 miles both ways every week to eat there. My favorite place in town to eat. They were featured on the Food network last year if you need more proof.
