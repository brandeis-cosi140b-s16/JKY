Great atmosphere and simple, good Mexican food. Some reviews cite mediocre food, but I've always found my enchiladas perfectly cooked, my chile relleno nice and crisp, and the machaca in my chimichanga nothing but savory. 

You won't be blown away by the food, but it's all SOLID, and a step up from most burrito places or diner-style Mexican. The restaurant can be small and you can find yourself waiting 30 minutes for your order to come out during the lunch rush, but it's a breath of fresh air to walk into such a simple, unpretentious restaurant run by a woman and her mother.
