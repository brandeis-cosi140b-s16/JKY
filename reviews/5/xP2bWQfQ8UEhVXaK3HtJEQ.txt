This is great Mexican food at an affordable price and a great downtown Phoenix location.  The green chili pork chilaquiles and lime oregano roasted chicken are phenomenal.  Everything else I've had is great too, but that's the best so far!  Also a plus, where else can you get homemade flour tortillas in fast casual setting?  

I also appreciate the owner's hospitality. You can tell they put their heart into what they do by just placing your order or having a quick conversation about the food.  This is definitely a must-go location for eating in Phoenix.
