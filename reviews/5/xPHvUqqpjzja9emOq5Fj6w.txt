I have found my new favorite spot, it's been open about a month or two. Everything is made from scratch. Tasty chicken tacos, delicious burritos, quesadillas, etc. Grilled wings with homemade hot sauce, a generous salad with lots of fresh toppings and yummy cilantro ranch dressing. Fresh salsa bar with the best pico de gallo, can't get enough!

Prices are great too! I can easily afford to feed my family of six. Been coming here every week since they opened. Nice little family run business with great service. The owners, brothers Jose and Elio, are always happy to see me every time I walk in the door. Can't wait to bring my mom here for some authentic food next time she comes to visit.
