I stopped in for the first time late afternoon yesterday, and there was a steady stream of people coming in for take-out while I had the wet cheese enchiladas and three of the al pastor tacos.  I'm giving the place five stars based upon the flavors and recipes which are clearly fantastic.  The salsa bar has three different:  a tomatillo salsa, a red one, and a habanero sauce---all quite tasty.  The table tops were clean in this modest place and the people were friendly.  The cook was eating a mole dish that I will try next time.  
It's my opinion that a TV with the volume turned on inside a restaurant  (rather than say inside a bar) is a negative thing, but perhaps others like it on...  I'm sure I'll get more adventurous and try the unfamiliar menu items soon----I trust the people in the kitchen here.
