I've been here a couple of times. The food is good and fresh. Yes your order takes a few minutes but I think it's because it's fresh and made to order. They provide self serve chips and you can try the salsas that were also very tasty. Prices were good and contrary to what I've read in a couple of the reviews it was clean. It's a hole in the wall and the place is old but the food is very good along with reasonable prices. Definitely try the carnitas tacos, lots of meat and very authentic.
