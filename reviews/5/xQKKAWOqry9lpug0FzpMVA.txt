As a native Texan, I have high expectations for Mexican food. This restaurant exceeded my expectations. Tortilla chips were freshly fried, warm, and refilled 3 times. Salsa tasted of fresh tomatoes and cilantro with just the right amount of kick. I had a tamale as a side order and it was PERFECT. I also had a combination plate of 3 enchiladas (1 beef, 1 chicken, 1 cheese) and they were perfect as well. As an added bonus, there were about 10 entre choices for my vegetarian daughter. I am so happy that we took a chance and tried this place. It's the real deal!
