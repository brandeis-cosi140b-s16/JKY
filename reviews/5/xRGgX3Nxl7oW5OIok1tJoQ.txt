Can I just start by start by saying I am so happy I found this place! I just moved from CA and have been looking for a good seafood place and im 100% sure this is my new spot. The girls that work there are super friendly, great customer service, and there is live music playing some nights. The fish tacos are delicious the aguachiles are to die for! This is a place everybody should check out for sure.
