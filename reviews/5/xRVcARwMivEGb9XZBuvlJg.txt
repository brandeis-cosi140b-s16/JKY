We have been coming here since it opened and we are treated like family each and every time. To have a restaurant that has had the same employees over all of these years tells me something for John the owner. Now for the food they have a large menu and there are several favorites that I keep coming back for. The menudo is a family favorite and I think it is some of the best in the valley and I have been eating menudo for over 40 years. The margaritas are special treat, inexpensive and they taste great. The flavors in the Salpicon salad are craved at least twice a week and is delicious with any of the 3 options: chicken, beef, or shrimp!
