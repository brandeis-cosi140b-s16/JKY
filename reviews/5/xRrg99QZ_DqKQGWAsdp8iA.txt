I was excited for my first trip to Isabel's Amor.  The new restaurant looked sharp.  We sat on the patio on a beautiful Arizona day.  I was with friends and we all had one of their unique cocktails.  The drinks were classics with nice little twists to make them special.  We enjoyed them.  The food was very good.  I had the Carnitas.  I was impressed with the quality and preparation. I should mention the chips and salsa are addicting!  Perfect spot to meet friends for drinks/apps or take the family for dinner.  Go to this restaurant, you will enjoy your experience.
