Wow!! So happy we found this place! The first time we visited, the waiter recommended the chorizo fundido for an appetizer. Good call! It was delicious! My husband and I ordered the fajitas for two...again, excellent call! So much food! We had plenty for lunch the next day. My new favorite Mexican restaurant. Oh and service is great too!
