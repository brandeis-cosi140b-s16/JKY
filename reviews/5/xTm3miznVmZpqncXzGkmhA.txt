I have to say the guayaba & cheese empanadas are so so good. Food is also awesome. I'm from NYC and we can hardly find good spanish food here in Charlotte. Service was good and fast. Also tried colombian pan de bono was delicious & fresh. I had bistec a la caballo which was a huge plate (They serve plenty of food for $10). Also taste salvadoren pupusas which were ok, but ecuadorian bolones were delicious (try with black cofee) Overall food was excellent and I really recommend this restaurant. FYI: this restaurant does not only have mexican food (saw previous reviews). They have colombian, central american and ecuadorian Food (usually people get confused thinking that spanish food=mexican and that is totally incorrect). FYI: restaurant's name changed recently to "Las Americas".
