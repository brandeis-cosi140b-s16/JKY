I love this place! The ambiance of blaring music and Mexican soap operas on tv is awesome. The food was shockingly fresh for being in the middle of Arizona.  Couldn't be more authentic even if you were in Mazatlan. I had seafood served in a hollowed out young coconut. Not only delicious but the presentation was beautiful. It could have come out of one of Jean-George's kitchens in NYC. No Joke. That was the last thing I was expecting when I pulled up to this kinda run down little strip mall. Go. Enjoy.
