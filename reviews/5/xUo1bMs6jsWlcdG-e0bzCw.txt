Delicious food! I'm a picky eater and was able to find something on the menu. Came with a colleague and 2 of our clients from out of town - they loved it too!!! Isaac was awesome at the table-side guacamole making. He made half very mild and the other half spicy; Isaac even got all of us to fall in love with the ghost pepper salsa! The margaritas and basil-watermelon mojo to were awesome!! Overall: I'll be going back! Word to the wise: go early and/or make reservation.
