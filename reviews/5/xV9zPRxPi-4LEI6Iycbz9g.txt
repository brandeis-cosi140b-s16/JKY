The food was absolutely magnificent... Authentic Mexican cuisine.. The guacamole was out of this world.  We went for a party for 2 birthday dinner not knowing what to expect. We got a very nice surprise.   The service was delightful the facility clean. The margaritas were offered in top shelf high quality liquor and made perfectly. The atmosphere was wonderful and very family friendly. the only draw back is that it was a tad noisy   but not enough to down grade a star.  Bravo Casa Don Juan.
