I do not give 5 STARS. But we struck gold here. This is my second visit In a week, ( I live 20+ miles or so north east. But my friend Dan Z. Turned me into a junkie on the first go. So now I am like a pusher hooking up all my other victims as they are willing to follow. 

To be straight here "THEY EFFING NAILED IT" so they get a 5 star. There is no downfall 
The STREET CORN ( a must ) 
Great menu, local beers, extraordinary atmosphere. 
I hate to give secret places but Taco Guild should go viral 
"Cheers"!!!!!!!
