You drive past, you see this place.  The sign says Tacos Kissi, then you see it says tacos and sushi.  You think this is weird.  You drive past.  You have just made a huge mistake.
Do yourself a favor go in.  Eat some tacos, then try the sushi, cause, what the heck, right?
The sushi is delicious.  It is not traditional at all, start with the Kissi roll, then try the Mar Y Tierra.  Surf and turf all in one.
The tacos are incredible, all tortillas are made in house, and the meats are great.  My favorite is the tripas.  Crunchy yet soft.  The carne asada is also great.
Come back, try a torta.  
You will be back again, and again.
