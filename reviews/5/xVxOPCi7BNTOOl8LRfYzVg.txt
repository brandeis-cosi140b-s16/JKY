My mom used to take us to another El Pollo Loco (or else pillows local as auto correct keeps trying to rename it on my phone...) location when I was a kid. I never really liked it. My husband and I decided to give it a try last week and oh man... delicious and cheap. The perfect combination.

I think I'll eat here tonight! Try it!
