We were visiting my brother who lives 3 blocks from this place. I walked over to this place for coffee & was I surprised... I got my coffee & pan dulce, but also got 2 carne asada tacos. My husband "special" ordered  2 grilled chicken tacos with rice beans & eggs. I regret not snapping a picture of his amazing plate. My son wanted egg tacos so we requested another special order. 2 egg tacos with cheese. He ate it ALL!! It was a plate I would've cooked had I been home. The flavored in the food were so good & the price was affordable. Now if I can only relocate them 2 blocks from my house in CA!
