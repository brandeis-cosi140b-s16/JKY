Went to Vegas Thursday 4 December, parked the car and went straight to Tacos El Gordon on the strip and it was closed....we didn't see a sign about remodeling....anyone know what's going on????  Thankfully we live 3 miles from their Chula Vista location but we were really looking forward to our favorite tacos (adobado) while on our mini vacation.
