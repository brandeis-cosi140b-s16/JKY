I honestly love this place. I go here every other week with my step daughter and we have girls lunches. Tonight I went with my love and I have to say I was super dissatisfied.  I will give cafe rio 5 stars because overall this place is great and one bad night won't sway me.  I will be going back this weekend with my step daughter and hope that it's back on track and that tonight was just a miss. The staff tonight also seemed like they could care less about doing their jobs (a couple of the girls not the whole staff). Very disappointed. Jobs are hard to come by right now so I think a little more respect would be nice.
