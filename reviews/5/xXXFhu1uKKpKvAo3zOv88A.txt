This place is a new go-to lunch spot for myself and coworkers. It's fast with counter-style seating, the tacos are more traditional (think Las Palmas, less like Smoke) and well constructed, and the pricing is reasonable at three bucks a taco. 

Friendly staff, good food, great price - what's not to like?
