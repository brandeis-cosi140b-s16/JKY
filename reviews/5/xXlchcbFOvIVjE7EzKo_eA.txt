My girlfriend and found Rubio's because we were new to the area and were looking for a good Mexican place.  This was not it.  But... it's still amazing.

It's a chain, and a fast-food joint, so don't expect something else, but their food is really pretty spectacular for the price.  They have a bar full of different salsas and lemon slices and lime slices which is nice to add to your meal, but the food itself is really fresh and healthy-feeling.  I don't know if it's actually healthy because I'm not a doctor but I can tell you it 'feels' healthy.

I recommend the shrimp tacos.  Delicious.  That's all I can say.

Finally, another reviewer (Michelle N.) said there's a drive thru here.  There isn't.
