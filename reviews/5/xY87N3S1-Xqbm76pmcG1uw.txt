Casa Don Juan is on Main Street easy to find and free parking. My girlfriend and I came in today and LOVED it! Fresh food and refreshing drinks. Service was great and fast. Had the carnitas that the manager Joseluis recommended AMAZING!!! Defenitaly recommend it to anyone that likes great Authentic Mexican food.
