I had been to Julio G's before, but didn't remember it being this good. I got a combo plate with Chile Relleno, Cheese Enchilada, and a Chicken Taco. It was also served with rice and beans. The waiter brought over 5 plates, and we all figured he had food for two tables on his tray...but it was all for us. The rice and beans required their own seperate plates! I managed to eat it all and had a strawberry margarita as well. All very good and filling.
