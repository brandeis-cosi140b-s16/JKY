I have lived in the city of Pittsburgh for over 2 years now and have been on the search for the best AUTHENTIC Mexican restaurant... I FINALLY FOUND IT! This place has AMAZING dishes... I highly recommend the Super Burrito and the Old Mexico Enchilladas! Amazing! You MUST order the tableside guacamole... IT doesn't get any better! I love guac... and it is the BEST I have ever had... The prices are reasonable... Only downfalls are the lack of a liquor license... And the service could be a little better! But other than that... It's a MUST TRY!
