I'm glad Tijuana Flats is back in this area! I hated that the other locations closed a few years ago. 

I went in today and got the veggie burrito. It was just like I remembered from other locations. The food was fresh and tasty. I love the hot sauce bar. The hottest sauce, which contains jolokia pepper, was hot but didn't make me hiccup like some hot sauces do. 

Tijuana Flats is a bit more upscale than other TexMex restaurants like Moes or Qdoba. For one, you get your burrito served on a plate, not in a wrapper. You order at the register, but someone brings out your food and they come around to refill your drink. It's kind of mixture of a fast food place and dine-in restaurant.

Overall, it's a nice place for lunch. Cheery atmosphere and good food at a good price.
