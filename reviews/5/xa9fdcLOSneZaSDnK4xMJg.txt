I love Chipotle. I've been to quite a few of the locations around town and all have been fairly consistent, aside from one that is AWFUL (cough cough... by Metrocenter... cough cough) and now this one which was AMAZING!

Maybe it was a fluke, I don't know, but if every Chipotle's food tasted as good as this did, I believe the chain would become even more successful.

The flavors seemed more amped up than usual. Take the lime-cilantro rice for example. This is the FIRST time I have ever really tasted the lime! It wasn't overpowering, but gave the burrito a wonderfully tangy kick. That alone was probably the main reason it tasted so much better to me (and my roommate). The chicken also seemed like it might've had a tad bit more seasoning. I don't know but it was really awesome!

I sincerely hope that this is not a one-time occurrence. It was really delicious and has reawakened my craving of Chipotle! Good thing this location is fairly close to home!
