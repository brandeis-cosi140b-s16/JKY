We have eaten here probably 20 or so times over the past few years and i don't know why i have not reviewed it yet! 

This has our go-to place for Mexican food.  Every time we go i get their burritos because they are so damn good!  So much food and it tastes amazing!  

We always get the cheese dip for the chips and we devour them!  

The prices are awesome,  two huge meals for under 30 bucks?  Awww yeaaa!  

We have never had bad service and will be customers as long as they are around!
