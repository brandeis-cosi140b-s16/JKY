What a great find. Lots of salsas you never have seen before. Lots of menu choices & the margaritas are excellent. A great lesson to not judge a book by its cover! If you want a change to the traditional tex-mex, this is the place. It's also near the airport, so it was great to get something quick, delicious, and convenient.
