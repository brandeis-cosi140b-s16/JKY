This is by far my favorite Mexican restaurant in Phoenix. Actually, the world. Yes, the neighborhood is crazy by some people's accounts, but I guarantee the food makes up for it! The green chile here is awesome. Best breakfast in town, the Nana's Special rules!

We had our wedding catered by La Canasta. The food was awesome and the service was impeccable! Richard is the best!
