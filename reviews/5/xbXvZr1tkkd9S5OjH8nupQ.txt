I love this place. The red beef chili chimichanga is out of this world extraordinary. The meat is tender and juicy, the sauce is freakin-phenomenal and just writing this review is making my mouth water thinking about how good it is. 

My wife loves the chicken quesadilla. Its huge! The kids usually share it with a couple sides of rice. There are items on the kids menu but the girls prefer the quesadilla.

The service is great, always friendly and the food prep is quick. 

The whole family recommends this place if you are looking for GREAT Mexican food at very affordable prices. In a region thats known for its Mexican cuisine this place is a true gem.

Edit: Upgraded from 4 stars to 5 stars because I realized the other day that this is my favorite Gilbert restaurant. Its awesome!
