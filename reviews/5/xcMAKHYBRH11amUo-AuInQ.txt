Frank and Fina's Cocina has been my favorite restaurant since they were a quaint little place on Charleston. Now located in the southwest, it is the only place I will trek across town to dine on a regular basis.

One thing that makes this place outstanding is their accommodations for vegetarians. In addition to having an extensive vegetarian menu with everything from "Build Your Own Entree" (from a selection of tacos, tamales, and enchiladas) to SOYRIZO tacos, each day they have a new vegetarian special. If you ever see the Mexican Lasagna on the menu, get it! Think: enchiladas but with a more tomato based sauce and covered in mozzarella.

Also, I was pleased to see that their glorious sweet potato enchiladas (once a special item only) now have their own spot on the daily menu. Besides that, their complimentary chips and salsa (up to 2 per table, I believe) are always on point. Plus, as a self-proclaimed guacamole snob, I can say without a doubt that theirs is top notch--- chunky and fresh and delicious. While I'm usually too stuffed to even fathom dessert, I know they have several options, including a vegan cheesecake.

Another reason I adore this place is the service. I see the same crew nearly every time I go in (Frank himself often serving tables), and it helps make the place seem homey and comfortable, despite being a huge restaurant in a commercial area. One thing worth noting is that F&F's may not (easily) split your check if you're dining with a group, so be sure to plan in advance. Also, when they give you the check, I believe you need to walk it to the cashier by the door (rather than having your server pick it up/cash you out).

I can not rate this place higher and recommend it to everyone. It continues to be my favorite restaurant of all time, and I'll forever follow their delicious vegetarian-friendly delights.
