Best tacos I've ever had! Al pastor is amazing! Cooks are great! Fast and friendly but I can't say the same for the cashiers. They are not friendly and not helpful but I still eat here anyways cause I usually don't go back to a place if the whole staff isn't friendly but the cooks make up for it. Also the place is very clean. A must if you like street tacos!
