Have been their twice and the food is excellent..  The plates are huge.  Food came prompt with warm nachos and queso,  salsa  Verde or roja.  The baby even liked the beans.  I want to try their huge family meal.  Husband is scared of spicy but he had plenty options.  Bathrooms were clean and neat.  Loved it. Going back  soon
