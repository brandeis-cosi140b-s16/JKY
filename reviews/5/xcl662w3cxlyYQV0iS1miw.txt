Tonight we were hungry and wanted to try something new
Rubios interior is really cute and reminded me of Taco Cabana
The cashier really made our entire experience great
She helped us with menu options and she was very talkative
She made it fun and very helpful at the same time
She is a great employee
I wish I had gotten her name but she is a young lady
We really enjoyed the food that we got and I was very surprised
I also really liked the chili/salsa bar 
I love chili

I will return to Rubio's
