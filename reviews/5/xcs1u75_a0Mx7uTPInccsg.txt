I've fulfilled my fantasy of waking up completely disorientated the next morning in Vegas, craving a Chipotle steak burrito, and getting it!

Bottom Line: This is a legit Chipotle that is destined to make bank off hundreds of hungover and hungry Las Vegas tourists.

This opened right next to the McDonalds on the Strip and it was packed the morning we went (not surprising). It was just us boys with our Burritos on a lovely Vegas afternoon =).
