Always have to try out a Triple D spot when we are near one, so glad we did. Got there just before noon and there was just a short line. I got the Texas BBQ burger and loved it, I am not usually very adventurous when it comes to my food but ate it just the way it came with the chile pepper and slaw and wow I want it again.
