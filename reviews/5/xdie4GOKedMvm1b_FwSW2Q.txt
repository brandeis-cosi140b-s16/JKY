My dreams came true the day I found this place! Thanks for my pollo asado fries Gustavo!!

I recently moved here from San Diego and visiting this place was like taking a small trip back home. They have all the classics including California burritos and carne asadsa fries. 

Definitely try this place if you love delicious food. 

And for all of those who haven't tried traditional San Diego dirtyberto's-style mexican, you have to try this place. This is what we eat for breakfast, lunch and dinner in the 619!
