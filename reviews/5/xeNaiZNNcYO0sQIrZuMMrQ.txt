We came across this place just driving around to see what was in the neighboring area. This is the first place in a very long time that I love BOTH the beans and rice. My hubs had the carne asada and it was very flavorful. I had the crab enchiladas with the cream sauce and it was so delicious I almost licked the plate. Real crab, not imitation! The salsa and chips were plentiful. We couldn't believe how quickly the food came out! The service was great and everyone was so nice! We will definitely be back.
