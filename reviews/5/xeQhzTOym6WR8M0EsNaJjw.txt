How do I love thee? Let me count the ways!
1) Fabulous tacos....carne asada, fish! 
2) Homemade corn tortillas, soft,moist, delicate.
3) Homemade salsa, I could lick the bowl...oh yeah...I did! 
4) Chips fresh and hot.
5) Rice and refried beans are tasty, not just a plate filler.
6)  Great prices- Combos- $7 includes 2 tacos (your choice of meat) rice and beans or chips and salsa, and a drink.
7)  Friendly owner- I felt like family. The way she cooks...I wish I was!

I love thee to the depth and breadth my tummy can stretch! And Yes, I am leaving fat and happy and truly in love with Abuelas Tacos, you will be too!
