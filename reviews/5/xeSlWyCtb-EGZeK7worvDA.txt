My first visit to Cabo was this afternoon and I must say my visit was nothing less than spectacular. Their happy hour rivaled any local bar in town, $2 cazadores shots.. There must be a mistake. The food was amazing.. I enjoyed a 2 item combination that included the steak taco al carbon and chile relleno. The tacos were border line best I've ever had. And I'm not joking. The chile relleno was amazing as well. And I can't leave out Jenni the server, running around helping every single customer like it was her own. Our meal was by far the best we have had in town.
