As my husband told the waiter, "best f****** Mexican food I have ever had!" Not only was the food amazing so was the service. Upon arrival the door was opened for us as we walked up and we were seated immediately. Our waiter, Andrew, was very knowledgable and happened to make the most amazing Margaritas and Bellini we ever tasted. Another server even ran out into traffic to bring me the leftovers I had forgotten at the table. This place is on point!
