I am not sure why I haven't reviewed Rosita's yet!  This is always our go to for authentic Mexican food that doesn't disappoint. I love the chicken flautas or regular chicken tacos. Kids love the cheese enchiladas. And apparently they make their red chile with beef fresh daily with a wonderful recipe that is favorite of my husband's and the server's.  The chips and salsa are full of flavor, especially when you mix in some of the hot sauce.  The only thing I can think of that I don't like is the water... It's tap and tastes terrible. Thankfully they have Pepsi products and gigantic cups to feed my Mt Dew addiction.
