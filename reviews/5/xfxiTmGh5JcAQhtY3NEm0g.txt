Been coming here for the past couple of years now.  The building is in desperate need of a makeover, but the staff is friendly, the food is consistent and the margaritas are lovely.

Our server Pedro is spot on, personable and on his toes.  The front staff is great too, Ola is welcoming as can be.  The fabulous staff here is what keeps us coming back, keep up the good work guys!

(oh, and do a little redecorating!)
