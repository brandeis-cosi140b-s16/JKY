I stopped in here on a whim after reading so many good reviews. So glad i did! All of the food is amazing, ive been here a dozen or so times and have tried everything. Watermelon juice is so delicious and get it every time i go.  The Kissi roll is awesome, served warm with wonderful  orange sauce. Took my family in today and everyone loved their food. My grandmother feel in love with their  hottest salsa and was drinking it down - no joke. She convinced  the owner to sell her a pint. The place is awesome and very affordable.
