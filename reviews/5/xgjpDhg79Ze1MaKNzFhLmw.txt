VERY underrated place! Just driving by or walking past it looks like kinda dumpy or not so inviting if you will. Saw a deal on hooked for 95 cent tacos so I thought I'd give it a shot. Got 2 chicken tacos.... AMAZING! The chips and salsa that was brought out was also phenomenal! Sure, maize is good but this place stands right next to it and holds its own!
