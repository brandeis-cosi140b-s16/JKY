Absolutely delicious!  Came to a meeting and stopped by before for a quick bite and I will travel to Avondale for this authentic fresh Mexican food.  I had a carnita taco and a carne azada taco with cilantro onion and lime!  Yum! Best ever! My fav hole in the wall officially!  And YES! They have chiles torreados!
