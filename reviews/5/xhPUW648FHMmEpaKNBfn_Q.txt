Can't believe it's taken so long to visit El Gordo. Here's the rundown:

Yes it's greasy Mexican food. No, it cannot be good for you. Yes, the adobada fries are the best I've ever had. No, I am not sorry I ate them all (in my defense, half an order). 
It gets hectic inside so pay attention and move swiftly! 

I ordered the half order of adobada fries ($5) and they were more than enough. Good fry to meat ratio, and absolutely delicious!!

Yes, I will be returning. No, I will not bring you back a taco.
