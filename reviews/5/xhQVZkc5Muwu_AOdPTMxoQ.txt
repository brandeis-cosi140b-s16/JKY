The first time I went to KoMex, I thought maybe I made a mistake. The area and the exterior looked kind of iffy but when I got inside, it was packed!  So, I decided to stay and a friendly hostess showed me to my table.  I had the bulgogi, daeji and dak gogi tacos plus a side of bulgogi fries.  They were all flavorful.  The bulgogi fries can feed 2 very hungry peeps.  Imagine a pile of crispy golden fries topped with melted cheese, jalapenos, hot sauce and bulgogi...sweet, savory, spicy all in one. YUUUUMMMM!!!  

My next visits, I tried the calamari tacos (tender calamari, lightly breaded) and my KoMex favorite: bulgogi chimichanga.  It's incredibly cheesy, crispy, meaty and tasty.  It may be a bit oily but it's alright.  Just thinking about it is making me hungry.

Great service, amazing food at very affordable prices.  You get chips, salsa and guac for free.  At the end of your meal, you get fortune cookies and sliced oranges speared with little plastic swords.  It's Korean, it's Mexican...it's KoMex!!!
