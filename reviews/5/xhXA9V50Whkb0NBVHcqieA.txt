Wow! No really wow! I'm a green Chile aficionado and this has the best I've had in the valley. The fry bread was soft, fluffy snd fresh. My dining companions ate off the regular menu and cleaned their plates. The red enchilada sauce is bragworthy. Hearty portions and superb customer service. Worth the drive from Chandler.
