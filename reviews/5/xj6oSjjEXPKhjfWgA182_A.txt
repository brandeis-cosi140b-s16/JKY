So, the lady and I were in search of some Saturday night food and couldn't decide on what.  I had the brilliant idea to get on Groupon and was stuck in between two choices:  Rita's and another unnamed Phoenix establishment that we had already been to that is always solid never great.  Well, what the hell, let's give Rita's a shot.

Nice and conveniently located on 35th and the I-10, we find a spot and get in.  Order a few margaritas and they were great.  I'm not the world's biggest fan of the marg but Aaron knows how to hook it up.  Next, we ordered the table side Guac, I got the Playa Bonita, the lady got the Seafood enchiladas.  Everything was OUTSTANDING.  I tried her enchiladas and they were dynamite and I had about 4 different kinds of fish that were all cooked perfectly.

Service was outstanding, food was fantastic, there was absolutely no reason this place wasn't jam packed on a Saturday night.  I suggest you go support a local business that does things right.  I love Pappadeaux as much as the next guy and can say that Rita's stands just as tall next to them in service and food quality.   You won't get the white tablecloth but you will have an extra $50 in your pocket when you leave and be just as satisfied.
