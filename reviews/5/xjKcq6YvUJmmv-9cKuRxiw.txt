We came here on a Saturday afternoon after going to the gym and found this place nearby. he ordered his favorite the 2 gourmet taco combo. (gourmet grilled shrimp, bacon & herb. Damn thats good!) and the steak. which is ok. (my 2nd fav. taco is the veggie ..and believe it or not I'm a steak lover burt I also love me some poblano & portabello mushrooms taco. (in soCal it was called poblano & portabello but in LV its called "Veggie".  I went w/ the grilled grande bowl. only 550 if you ask for it w/no dressing. and its gorgeous!!! I asked for the dressing on teh side and if you dip your fork into the dressing b4 ea. bite- you get less calories!  I highly recommend this place.
