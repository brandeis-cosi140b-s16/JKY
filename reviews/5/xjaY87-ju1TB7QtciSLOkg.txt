After the new owners took over a few years back Rio Rico's has become one of our favorite Mexican food restaurants. The food is excellent, two staples of Mexican cuisine that too many get wrong are guacamole and beans. Rio Rico's has fresh, homemade beans and the guacamole is made  to order. My family and I have tried many of there dishes and have never been disappointed, their giant quesadilla with shredded beef, steak, or chicken is simple yet delicious every time.
