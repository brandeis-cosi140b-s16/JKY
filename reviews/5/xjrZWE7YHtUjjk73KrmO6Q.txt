Okay, it's an older restaurant and the decor is plain. But it's SUPER clean, the food is fresh, the portions are generous and the service is friendly and helpful. We eat here a couple of times a month for dinner. I always get the steak ranchero. It's like Mexican pepper steak and it's a spicy comfort food. Served with tortillas, rice and beans, it will fill you up for only $8. If you got the same thing anywhere else it would be twice as much. 
The chips are fresh, thick and homemade. They aren't super salty, which I love. The salsa bar is always super clean and homemade. I love the jalape√±os with carrots and onions and the garbanzo beans. My mom likes the cactus salad and cucumber salad. And I always get the hot salsa from the bar because the one they bring with the chips is pretty mild and I like some heat. Again, everything on the salsa bar is house made and delish!
Family run, they know us now which makes you feel like part of the family too. This isn't a taqueria, it's a family Mexican restaurant and the difference shows in the quality and care.
