I've been doing customer service in restaurants since I was 16 and I've given my share of outstanding customer service! An employee named Martha gave me and my friends outstanding customer service. Very cute very nice and very sincere about making sure everything at our table and our meal was perfect. She gave us ideas, told us what things were and how big and small they were and she even put out for in the to go container for us neatly!! :) She also had several other tables and was killing it! Very good employee! The place here is very clean and very beautiful! Thankyou for everything! We will be back very soon!
