This is REAL Mexican food.
Seriously the salsa tastes like they walked over to Mexico and had someone's grandma whip up a salsa from ingredients from her garden in the back yard and then they rush it over to your table!
It is that good!
Their portion sizes are huge for the price too...if you are planning on getting appis or dessert then maybe share an entre! Just saying! haha!

Soooo good!
I will be back again on my next trip for sure :)
