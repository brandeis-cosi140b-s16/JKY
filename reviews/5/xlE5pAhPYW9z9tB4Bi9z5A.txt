I come here at least once whenever I'm in town.  Great service.  Great food....well I just order the carne asada burrito every time and its great so I assume the rest of the dishes are just as good.  I ask for less rice, add lettuce and more veggies.  Haven't been to Chipotle since I discovered this place.
