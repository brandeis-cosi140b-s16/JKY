This a great place for some gourmet yet quick Mexican food. I'm a vegetarian and this is my go to Mexican spot. Great food, great service, and even better environment. Definitely got to check out the decor, it's so diff from other places I've seen. My favorite is the salad, not the jicama salad but  the only other one they have.
