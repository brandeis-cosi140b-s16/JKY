My fianc√© and I just happened upon Blanco Restaurant at Biltmore mall at Camelback. Jordyn was our server she was really friendly and service was fantastic. If you go there ask for her. The food was off the hook, we had fajitas, I had steak and shrimp and my honey had chicken and shrimp. Fresh homemade chips and an array of salsas, habanero being our favorite. They gave you such a generous portion of food, couldn't eat it all.
We highly recommend Blanco for a pleasurable dining experience in fact next time we come from California we will definitely come back as It is Now one of our favorite restaurants in Phoenix.
