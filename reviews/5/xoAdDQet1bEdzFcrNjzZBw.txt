Food is quite good. Service is usually on point as well. Mike is by far our favorite waiter, delivering a level of service that far exceeds the standard for restaurants in this price point.  

Salsa: 5 stars
Spinach con queso: 5 stars, must have app
Steak Tacos: 4 stars
Ground Beef Tacos: 5 stars
Chicken Firecracker: 4 stars 
Fish Tacos: 1 star (super bland to me)

My girlfriend gets the Enchilada stack and loves them.

Great food for Cave Creek area. Very cool decor and vibe. I stop by weekly.
