Wah Wah Wah, everyone's a food critic nowadays. Whatever, I think the food is good and if I don't like it, I simply won't return. Why waste your time telling the whole world that your beans were slightly warm or that the cheese wasn't totally melted the way you like. I think people should make their own meals at home if they think they deserve perfection.
