Outrageously good!!!!! I'm not going to say that its 5 star dining or anything but for the type of restaurant this is to me it gets 5 stars. I'm a big advocate of Chipotle and Panchero's kind of one up's them on every level, plus when you add queso like that to a burrito #BOOMSHAKALAKA it takes the burrito game up to a whole notha LEVEL!!!!! Another great factor is it's cheap and they always have some kind of deal going. Perfect meal for lunch or even a way better alternative for a family that wants to eat fast but doesn't want to have to get junk from a drive thru. I'm kind of a snob when it comes to ingredients and Panchero's does a good job to take care of their food so you can trust it. #THUMBSUP #HIGHFIVES all around and #GOODGAME Panchero's
