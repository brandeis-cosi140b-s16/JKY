I was excited to try this Top Chef Masters establishment, and I was not disappointed!

I am a Mexican food lover, and although this is not authentic - it's delicious. First, they give you a huge basket of crispy tasty tortilla chips with three different types of salsa. Perfect with the blanco margarita! I could have been fine on this alone.

I ordered the seasonal vegetable enchiladas, and my husband ordered the fish tacos. Both plates are exceptional. My enchiladas did not look like ordinary enchiladas. Instead, the tortillas were stacked with veggies and cheese between them. It reminded me of Mexican lasagna. I loved the fact that my enchiladas had roasted eggplant, zucchini, and brussell sprouts! My husband's fish tacos were crisp and fresh. He was quite delighted.

All in all, the service was friendly and pleasant. I would go back in a heartbeat!
