Couldn't be better! This is really the place to go for Breakfast burritos.  My family and I have been comming here a few times a month for years and rarely had a bad experience.   Today I had the sausage and egg breakfast burrito,  and it was stuffed full of fresh sausage, eggs and cheddar cheese.   I'm pretty sure they make their own flour tortillas,  because I've never had any that tasted like them.   I always ask for plenty of the Verde sauce on the side,  it's hot,  but Sooo good.   We have gone there a few times for the sauce alone! A great place to take out of towers for fast but awesome Mexican food.
