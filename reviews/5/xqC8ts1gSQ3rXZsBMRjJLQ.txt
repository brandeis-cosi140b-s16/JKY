Chef Paco offers authentic Mexican cuisine in a great atmosphere although it is loud sometimes.  located right next to sapphire so you may or may not see some extra eye candy.. guacamole made at table side is outstanding. if I could give it 4.5 stars I would as whenever I have been there they are short on staff and there is always an excuse from the server or bartender who has to come serve you. don't make excuses, hire more phuckin people and don't make me wait. the complimentary nachos and salsa are a good touch and the habanero is pretty good. bonus points for location but I would recommend heading here after you are next door as the ladies probably wont appreciate your not so heavenly bombs during a lap dance.
