I'm from New Mexico, so I know what I'm talking about when it comes to all things green chile.  This place is the business.  Giant smothered burritos, frito pies, sopapillas and honey, cheap ass drinks, tasty margaritas, and friendly ladies behind the counter.  Go.  Get your green chile on, get your drink on, and make friends.
