This Chipotle location definitely redeemed themselves since my last visit. I placed a carryout order and went straight to the front of the very long lunch rush line today. Stephanie prepared my order and I was very pleased that it was ready on time. I went home and my family and I were impressed by how well she made the burrito bowls. Usually when I do carryout it's just slopped together. Great job, Stephanie!
