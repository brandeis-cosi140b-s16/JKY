What stood out the most was the delicious food and the low-cost. But after frequenting this restaurant on my lunch break for the last three months, the consistency and customer service has been superior. Never had to wait longer than four minutes for my food. The cashier knows me personally and I recommend the enchilada w rice and beans.
