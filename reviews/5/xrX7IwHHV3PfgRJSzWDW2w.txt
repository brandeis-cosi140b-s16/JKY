This place is now a must every time I visit Vegas. $2 each for all that good stuff?! So worth it! This weekend was my first time and I had little expectations. It was confusing at first, but I got the hang of it. Each line has it's own meat, so pay attention to the signs. After a night of clubbing, it was crazy packed but moved fairly quickly. I loved it so much, I got some more the next night. Can't wait to make another visit, with a Fat Tuesday to accompany my meal.
