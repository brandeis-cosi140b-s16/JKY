First of all I'm Mexican...We(Brother, Mom, sister+3) came here in the summer of 09.  we could not get enough! I had the Carnitas(pork) Torta twice! let me tell you...most places leave most of the fat on the carnitas to the point where its just gross! not here! It was very lean for carnitas. The Shrimp cocktail was also very good!(this is nothing like your American cocktail) The hard shell chicken taco was very yummy too!

This is the first place I'm coming too next time I'm in Vegas, and the prices are good too!
