Drove by this place on the way back from a meeting. Checked it out on Yelp decided to give it a try, and I was not disappointed. They give you 3 different salsas and chips the minute you're seated at the table. All are very good. 

Tried the Pollo Fundido, as so many on Yelp had recommended it. It lived up to the reviews. I will say this, though, it is not a light lunch by any means. Eat this baby at noon, and you'll be snoozing by 2 PM in your chair at the office. 

Many things in the menu looked tasty. Wish I were in the area more often so I could try the rest.
