Holy Ricky Martin! Me gusto this restaurante! Seriously mis amigos y amigas. Entering Tradiciones is an elevating experiencia. Like entering Disneyland. Es imposible not to be muy feliz.. You get me papi? Waitresses in frilly dresses with big smiles on their caras bonitas. A dining room lleno de color, energia and muy clean. Like spotless. You get mi papi? Carnitas was tender and served with homemade tortillas...Dios Mio! Homemade. Thicker than the ones us gringos are used to. And mucho mejor. You get  mi papi? Fajitas, margaritas, watermelon juice, salsa and service all first rate. So, two thumbs up from this gringo and his novio latino. We we're both treated as las reinas that we are. I hope Tradiciones becomes a tradition of ours. You get mi papi?
