Love it. The salsa may not be the best but the Pollo Magnifico makes up for it. Order this dish people it is fantabulous! It is a deep fried chicken burro topped with jalapeno cream cheese (to die for) and tons of melted cheese. I order this dish every single time and although I know it is not good for my diet I cannot resist it.

The Pollo Magnifico never lets me down each time it is delicious and melts in my mouth!
