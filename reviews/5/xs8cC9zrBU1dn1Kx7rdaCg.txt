First time here earlier today 

It's so hard to find good restaurants in the east side but I found this place on Yelp and it had high reviews do I decided why not let's give it a try 

 this place is great everyone was so nice and helpful (I don't speak spanish lol) nor does my grandma 

They were very helpful with helping us make selections I usually eat the same thing but I saw somthing that sparked my interested I forgot the name but it had strawberry cream sauce which I thought was interestingâ€¼ I must say I wasn't disappointed it was super yummy 

I would totally go back I've never heard anyone recommend this place to me before but it totally needs more publicity!!!!
