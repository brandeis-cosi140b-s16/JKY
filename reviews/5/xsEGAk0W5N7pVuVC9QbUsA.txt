I'm a California native and a Mexican food addict so I was stoked to find this place. Keep in mind the cashier doesn't speak English so you have to work with her a little bit to get your order. For $10 I got the biggest torta I've ever seen and the tastiest lengua taco I've ever eaten. It reminded me of being back home. A truck set up, people just gather around and eat authentic food for cheap and hang around until they are done. Don't expect dining chairs if you've never been here. They provide the food, it's up to you to figure out where you're going to sit. Maybe it sounds weird but I really like stuff like that, especially when the food is worth it. Who knows what kind of person you might end up eating with, where they come from, what they do for a living. If you're shy you can always eat by yourself in your car of course. In just the small amount of time I was there I saw a lot of different kinds of people all just hanging out and eating together. Really did make me feel like I was back home which I enjoyed almost as much as the food. It is the first time I've had shredded lengua, usually its chopped wherever I get it. It was super juicy and super tender which lets me know they can cook. I'll order more of those for sure next time.
