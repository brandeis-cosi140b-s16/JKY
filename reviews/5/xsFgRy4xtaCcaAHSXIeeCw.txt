What can I say about Filibertos that others haven't said? Not much...except it's amazing food...I used to think that any Mexican food establishment that ended with a Berto of some kind was good, but clearly those places are just grasping at straws when they start to mimic Filibertos. Filibertos not only helps you with hunger pains, but it is still possible to feed a family of 3 for under $20.
