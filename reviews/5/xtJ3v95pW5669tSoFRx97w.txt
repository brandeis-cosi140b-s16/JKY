Decided to stop by with my boyfriend since it's a local spot and we were on our way to the movies. I was not disappointed! Not quite a Roberto's, although it is a Roberto's style just a tad bit better quality, quite a few more meat choices and street style tacos which are my favorite. The staff is super friendly and focused on how you want your food made.
We got the asada & chorizo tacos with the Windy City fries, yumm!
