For me, there are 2 things that keep me coming back to a restaurant.  The food of course and the service.  The food at Blanco fits my palate to a tee!  I have never been disappointed with any selection, but love the taco trio with short rib and the BBQ pork.  The Blood Orange Margarita is my favorite drink.  The service at Blanco is the best I have ever experienced at ANY restaurant.  From the Host/Hostess to the servers, these people are top notch.  Fox is a genius.
