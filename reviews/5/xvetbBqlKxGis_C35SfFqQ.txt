talk about great food and service!!! this place has got the best Mexican style sea food i've EVER had. The plates are authentic, delicious, and well priced. from the shrimp to the oysters, all dishes were super tasty plus the service was attentive and friendly. Consider leaving the strip if you are in the area and take the drive down to this spot. You will not regret it.
