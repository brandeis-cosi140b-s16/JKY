So we came here for our first time on "Tijuana Tuesdaze" and it was absolutely delicious. The place was packed, but the lines moved quick, table was ready, food came out in a good amount of time and the service was good. They have a hot sauce bar which you can try all these different types of hot sauces which is cool. Tacos were a big size, and tasted fresh all the way around, shells, meat, toppings etc. Definitely coming back to try there burritos, which I'm sure will be fantastic. Overall great experience, and definitely recommend
