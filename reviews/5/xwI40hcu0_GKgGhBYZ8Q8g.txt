Las Margaritas is known for its fantastic carnitas de puerco, which come in a huge portion size, garnished with such gastronomic delights as pickled red onions and guacamole. I've also really enjoyed most of the vegetarian menu, which is about the same size and selection as many other Mexican restaurants in town. The pollo poblano is wonderfully rich with mole sauce. If you're looking for a cheap dinner, the burrito supremo with either chicken or ground beef is the way to go; it's big and topped with tomatoes, cheese, and guacamole.

Lunch is cheap, delicious, and generous. It's the only time they offer the delicious avocado tostada. You can get the lunch specials on weekends, which more places should do.

The decor is bright, with an open-ductwork ceiling that has been painted the same yellow as the walls. Recently I noticed they've hung some sombreros from the ceiling in between the lights. The overall effect is festive and feels more open than it really is.

Portion sizes are downright majestic on many of the entrees. It's not the most authentic Mexican food around (for one thing, they use a lot of yellow cheese), but it's delicious and served by a friendly and attentive wait staff. They're quick to offer seemingly endless refills of the free chips, salsa, and a pico de gallo that I want to just eat up with a spoon all by itself.
