My husband and I eat here regularly... whenever one of us or anybody we know is craving some amazing Mexican food we come here.  The tortas are the best.  The food is always fresh and the people working there are super nice and helpful.  My husband had the chili Verde and said it was amazingly good with the just the right amount of heat. I especially love the salsa bar.  Again, everything is fresh and yummy!! Simply put it's some bomb ass Mexican food:)
