Okay, I had them at four stars due to liking some things but missing some of the Mucho Gusto items but they have shifted - still new items but some of the favorites from Mucho Gusto are back on the menu, like the gaucho steak and the chiles rellenos. I went with some friends from work after a training and we played Cards Against Humanities (they have several card and board games) over drinks and dinner. I also noticed the price point on items has come down as well so the cost is more in line with what it used to be. I think this is a good example of an eatery trying something new and then shifting back a bit to incorporate things that people missed but still having new items like the selection of cocktails and the larger wine list. On Thursday night they also had live acoustic music which was wonderful! I have to say, I'm much more inclined to start coming back to Revival on a regular basis after this experience and they were quite busy on Thursday night so I hope they are doing well.
