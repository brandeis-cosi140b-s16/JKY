Power packing selection of craft draft beers!  They offer 20 handles of fun, foamy goodness for your mouth.  Many of which really bring it in terms of ABV, so be careful because they can knock you on your butt in no time flat.  

The staff deliver fantastic, friendly service.  One night we were fortunate to sit down at the bar next to the manager, David, who is very friendly and eager to make sure that his guests have an outstanding experience on his watch.  

The food - this menu is small, but delicious and won't put a hurtin on your wallet.  They have a weekday happy hour and reverse happy hour that I've yet to try, but I'm highly looking forward to.  

In case ya didn't know, now ya know - it's locating in the old Firefly location.
