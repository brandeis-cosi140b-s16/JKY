We LOVE Don Ruben's!!  We have been eating here for years.  I have been using Yelp for a couple of years as well.  Tonight as we were sitting at Don's, as we call it, I said "they have the best chips and salsa"  then I said I'm going to go home and write a positive review on Yelp for them.  I have had or tried just about everything on the menu.  I am a fourth generation AZ. native, been eating Mexican food in Phx. area for years,  There are other good places, but we like Don Ruben's the best.  My favorites are #3, #9, #11 combinations plates, and the fish taco dinner, not Mexico style, but very good.  We have had a couple of occasions when we had  so so service, but only like twice in all the years.  Too Hot????  What??  That is what Mexican food is, Ooey, Gooey, Hot & Cheesy Goodness .  Delish!!!
