My friends and I found ourselves venturing for food in Mesa right before a concert. We had decided on the trip up to stop at Adrian's because it looked like a dive we'd love. When got there, Adrian's was closed (I think for good?), so it was back on the road for some impromptu decisions. 

As we were nearing Mesa Amphitheatre, one friend yelled out, "Turn left here!" And so we did as we pulled into the parking lot at Rolbertos. My first impression, perfect. Rolbertos is nothing but a very small building consisting of an order window and a kitchen with a small patio to the side, the quintessential dive. Their menu is off to the side by the street on what looks like a drive-thru menu board. They have combo plates, individual orders, sides, and drinks. Out of everything they had, 2 tacos stood out to me: the lengua and the cabeza. As a newbie in the Southwest, I had yet to try these two meats, and I knew that Rolbertos would be the first. 

The 4 of us ordered, and our dishes came out at the same time with a relatively short wait time. After we took our first bites, we all agreed that we made an awesome decision in stopping here. It was exactly what you would want from a place like this. Even though I've never had lengua or cabeza before, I knew that they were out of this world! Good thing I don't live in Mesa, or I would be eating here every day of the week!
