Stumbled upon this place accidentally. It's located in La Fiesta Shopping plaza (in the food court where the huge play gym is located- huge plus for those with kids)  and right across from Carowinds . When they say authentic they mean it. They had fresh salsa and guacamole out for tasting as well as two different types of tamales. I did not taste everything, was rushed but the guacamole was wonderful, fresh and perfectly balanced seasoning and cilantro for a super fresh taste.  They offer all the basics: tacos, burritos, quesadillas,sopas, fajitas, flautas, enchiladas, and more. Lunch menu offers full meals with drink included for 5.99 and aside from regular fountain drinks they have sweet tea and fresh fruit juices like melon, guyaba (guava), and horchata (rice milk). I had the Guava juice and it was perfect, not overly sweet and very fresh. The quesadilla I ordered came out great and I opted for rice and beans (meal normally comes with salad, rice and beans are 1.00 more). It was worth it the rice was excellent and if you like refried beans they were really good also. I'm definitely going again and do recommend for those who love Mexican and want authentic and *fresh*.
