Yessssss! This will be my next to go to place. Came on a Monday. Rainy weather kept us from sitting on their patio, but the $5 drinks kept us warm. Love the menu item names! Lots of 80s movie themes. Drinks - that's a pretty purse is the truth!!!! Got the Lunch appetizer special. 2 dips for $8. Got queso and guacamole, very good and fresh. Had 2 servers....they were both knowledgeable, Jonathan was our main server. We had 2 tacos: I had Uncle Buck and Long Duck Dong(great sauce). He had fat guy in a little coat and looking good louis. All good choices. Will return!
