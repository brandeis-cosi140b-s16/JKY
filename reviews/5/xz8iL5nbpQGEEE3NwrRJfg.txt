Yeah, that's right, count 'em: FIVE STARS. Chino deserves it, it's what your father wants for you, anyone who doesn't agree is a goddamn HATER and you don't need them in your life, etc.

Do people hear "fusion" and get all excited, thinking they're in for some fancy treats? Yes, it's REAL gritty, but just look at that spread of reviews and you can tell what's really going on in North Phoenix! Why would you re-review a place if you hated it the first time? 'Cause you're a HATER (Yes, I fully understand how the system works, and I do like that people decided to give Chino another chance, but I'm kind of on a rant here so please forgive me. Also, at Chino Bandido it's not quite a love-it-or-hate-it situation because that means the reviews would be 50/50, and that is obviously not the case), that's why! 

Order this combo: 8 & 10Q with BLK & JFR, and if you still think it's terrible then you HATE America and HATE Phoenix and I feel real sorry for you and your neglected taste buds.

plus there's Jenga, and snickerdoodles so...
