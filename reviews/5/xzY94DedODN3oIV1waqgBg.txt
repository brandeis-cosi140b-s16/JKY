Everything contributed to an all-around excellent experience. The building was surprisingly large but very welcoming, with wonderful pottery and murals. The staff were helpful and humorous. The salsa was relatively mild and quite chunky in the best sense of term. I ordered "The Firefighter", spicy steak in onions, chili sauce, etc., and it was flavorful, hearty, and delicious (yet not as spicy as I expected, though I am a native Arizonan who eats plenty of Mexican). Not to mention, if your meal comes with their fresh, thick flour tortillas, they can be refilled on request, and they even come in a colorful wicker basket. I would definitely return. I would also like to note that they were accommodating to a service dog, even though he didn't even have any bandana or identification.
