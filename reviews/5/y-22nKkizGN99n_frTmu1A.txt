Carne Asada is on point! I want some now just thinking about it. I live in Surprise and come all the way here just to eat there food. Tacos & burriots, BOMB! Something so simple done right. Just carne asada. They have other items and stuff but i just come here for the carna asada. Plate thats feeds about 3, $15. Think its a pound of carne asada and like 15 tortillas...Great value.
