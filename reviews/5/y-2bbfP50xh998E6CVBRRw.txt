I go here at least once a week. No matter what time you go there's always a long line but considering the quality of their food the line goes by fairly quickly. Wide array of choices and ordering is kind of hectic but all the employees are accommodating. The food is always delicious(kind of pricy but you get what you pay for). The place is always clean and it's very easy to take your food togo(trust me you'll want to)!
