We went at 4:30, which unfortunately is before the live music! (I don't know if it was every night, but as we were finishing, a mariachi band started playing).

One weird thing, either the seats at the booths were low, or the tables were high (or both...) but when I sat down the table was noticeably higher than a normal table...but I'm short.

This was some delicious food.  We got the tableside guacamole (made fresh, to order, pretty good, but no tomatoes) and it was quite an amount, more than most other sides of guacamole I've gotten.  We (me and three guys with appetites) didn't even finish it.  Of course, that may have had something to do with the HUGE portions that came our way.  One of the guys got fajitas (I think shrimp) and all his fixin's took up a full third of the table.

I got nachos with carne asada...mmmmmm.  A huge plate, piled high.  I think I only got through a third of it before collapsing.  After lunch (lunch at 4:30...this is what happens when you wake up at noon...) we went down to Fremont Street for a couple hours, and even nachos after fours hours sitting in a car were soooo goood....
