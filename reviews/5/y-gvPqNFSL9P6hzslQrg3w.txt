Awesome food!  My friend and I were visiting Las Vegas for business, we found Hussong's and had an absolute blast.  The margaritas and tacos were as delicious as the server said they would be. 

Service was friendly and very helpful.  Over all it was a great experience.  Wish we had one where I live.
