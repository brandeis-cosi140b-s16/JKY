Best tacos in Madison. Hands down.  It's a shame it's not that close to downtown (or the westside), or this place would rake it in.

Service is Qdoba/Chipotle style.  Other than the meat you ordered, there's no limit to what these guys will throw on the burrito/taco/etc.  Ask for a little, you get more than normal (no joke - be wary).  While 2 bucks per taco (6 for a burrito) might seem over the top at first, you'll find yourself full after just a few.

The food itself is delicious, spice is good, and it's a mess. Everything you'll grow to love.  Try the barbacoa, it's been simmering for 24+ hours by the time you get it.  The stuff melts.

The flatscreens with the spanish music videos seal the deal. You'll never go anywhere else again.
