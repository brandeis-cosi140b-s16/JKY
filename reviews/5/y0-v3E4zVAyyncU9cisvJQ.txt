Honestly it isnt 5 star quality, its prolly 4 -4 & 1/2.  But I gave it 5 for consistency, no matter what time it is or who's cooking.  Great burrito at 2:25 in the morning, only $6?  Sign me up! Where?  Juliobertos 28th street and thomas, thats where.  They dont fuck around! Ask for it this way(in this order) and you'll never leave unhappy.

Steak burrito with white cheese beans rice and pico.  Fuckin delicious at anytime of day...  And you know its true cause they just started that loyalty card not too long ago that I mentioned in my first review.  Ive already had 2 free meals and damn near close to my third already.in about a month...

Only 2 places I really go out to eat anymore(with any regularity at least), here and 2 hippies gnarly burger joint on 40th st and thomas(cheesesteak and chicken sandwiches kick ass there!)  Why go anywhere else when they dont want to give back to those who keep them in business? Juliobertos is the perfect 24 hour place to fall back on when nothing else is open!
