This place is awesome for happy hour.  You can get a dozen wings or a taco basket, add a  Mexican import beer, free chips and salsa plus bean dip. All this for $8.50. You can up the beer to a 32oz for just $1 more.  The food is very good, I was very happy and returned the next night to try it again.  They have a nice menu for happy hour, I have tried the wings and the taco basket, they were both excellent. Have to go back and try some of the others soon!
