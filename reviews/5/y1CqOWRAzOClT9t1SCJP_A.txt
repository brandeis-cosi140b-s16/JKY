This is the quintessential mom and pop shop. Stopped by for fish tacos to go on Sat, my second time, and was helped by the older couple who own the place. They were extremely nice people. After bragging to my wife about how huge and tasty the fish tacos were, she wanted me to go back the next day to get her one. I came back and was helped by their son, and had a nice chat with him too.  He offered me a taste of their braised beef and it was melt-in-your-mouth tender. (Have to wait until next time to get this, since I already pre-ordered). My wife, who doesn't particularly favor Mexican food, loved the fish tacos. 

Can't get a better taco or deal anywhere than this place, particularly the fish tacos. You should order on your way there since they make these to order and it takes at least 10 min to fry. This is a great little neighborhood treasure and a great family-owned, authentic taco spot.
