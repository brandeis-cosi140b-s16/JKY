Five stars for the delicious food.  Less for the interior but we don't really care about that when we are enjoying our food so much.  Their flour tortillas are the best ever (and I've made my own tho not as tasty as these),  We had tacos, tostadas, beans, and enchiladas and all were very good.  Don Jose's is one of the best values with great flavors.  Kudos to the chef!
