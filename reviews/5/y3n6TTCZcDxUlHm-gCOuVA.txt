Very good!  The El Pastor taco was our favorite though the chicken was great, too.  Our kids liked the rice a lot and ate most of it for us.  Even though my son spilled his lemonade when he got it, our server got a rag and mop and offered us a new table.  I didn't slow our meal down at all.

I would happily go back for those tacos and to try some of the other options that I was torn between...
