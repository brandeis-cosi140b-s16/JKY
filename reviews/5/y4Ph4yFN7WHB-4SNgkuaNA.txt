I just finished a huge bacon egg breakfast burrito & it was excellent. I normally would only be able to eat half of a burrito that size but it was so good I couldn't stop. It was stuffed with eggs with plenty of minced bacon & the best pico de gallo  & spicy mayo. It also has diced potatoes in it but I always order that on the side. My husband always gets the chorizo burrito which is also to die for. The chorizo is very moist & not overly greasy. It's stuffed with the same things as the bacon burrito. The burritos are $3.99 & well worth the price. Carl's Jr. & Jack In The Box have breakfast burritos for about the same price but are half the size & don't taste as fresh. The excellent breakfast tacos are $1.89, try them with the pico for extra flavor, although all of their salsas are delicious. The breakfast menu gives you the best bang for your buck. Big taste for such a little restaurant. There is only outdoor seating on a clean covered patio & you order at the window or you can drive through. Staff is very friendly too.
