This place is great! It reminds me of being in some cheap dive bar in Mexico but with people that speak English. Everyone is out of control and just having tons of fun! You can dance on the tables, the bar, the dance floor. The DJ plays great music. Its a wonderful place to go casual and have the time of your life.
