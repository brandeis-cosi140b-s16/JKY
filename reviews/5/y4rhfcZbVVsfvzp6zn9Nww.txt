I absolutely love this place. It's one of those rare gems that's open late and has excellent food and drinks.

The food is always consistent and it is available until 2am. My favorite dish is the green chili cheese crisp. It's basically a toasted tortilla that is topped with New Mexican Hatch Green Chilies, tomatoes, and cheese.

The Green Chilies are what make this cheese crisp so amazing. I've even eaten them with a fried egg on top for breakfast, but the eggs Benedict with Jalapeño hollandaise are also amazing. 

They also make blue corn enchiladas that have their amazing green chili sauce as well. One is filled with shrimp, the other chicken. Make sure if you get a salad to try the jalapeño ranch, it's awesome too.

Carlsbad has really cool seating outside with a giant water fountain that wraps around the restaurant and bridges that span over it. They also have a Bloody Mary bar on weekends and TVs outside for the football games.
