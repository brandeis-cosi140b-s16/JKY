Yes, El Norteno is a "hole in the wall".  In my experience, any really good mexican food I have had comes from a hole in the wall.  Think about it!  Anyway, I order the lunch special (take out) almost every Thursday - the chile relleno plate.  It is awesome and highly recommended.  Call ahead and place your order today, you won't be disappointed!
