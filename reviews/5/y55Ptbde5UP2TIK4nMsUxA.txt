Oh man... TAXOS EL GORDO ES EL REY!!!! I'm not sure which location this is for, I have been to the one that (if it still exists) was on Charleston, deep in the bowels of Las Vegas. You will find that Taxos El Gordo will touch you deep in your bowels too... with their amazing food. It is incredible to watch how fast they will throw together your taxos, as if you were back in the old country South of the E.U.A.

I suggest the taxos al pastor myself. But then again, I can't spell everything correctly. Masa, meat, onion, cilantro, muy muy!
