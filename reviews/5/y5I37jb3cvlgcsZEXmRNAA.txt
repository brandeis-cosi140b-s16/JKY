One of our favorite restaurant .you know when your order a taco its going to be a taco not some chef's idea of a taco. My favorites are the shredded beef. Fresh grated cheese, lettuce, tomatoes and savory beef, and yes the taco shell is freshly fried not one of the package kind. The prices are fair and don't break the bank account. It's a great family restaurant
