I wanted to pipe in and give a more favorable review of this place. I have loved going here for years!  I will agree that it is not for the authentic Mexican experience - but because they have a good variety of tasty food and drinks.  

I usually go to the Robinson location as it's near my office.  It's a lot more spacious than the Oakland location, which can feel a bit claustrophobic to me on a busy night.  (Though late nights there are fun with half-off food specials after 11...)

I like getting the chips with different dips.  The Yucatan Bean Dip is to die for, and the Dos Equis queso dip and fire-roasted tomato chipotle salsa are also great.  For entrees I usually go with the fish tacos or one of the quesadillas.

They have great lunch specials too.  I can get a huge quesadilla and a salad with their delicious lime-cilantro dressing for like $7!  Good Happy Hour specials, too, on margaritas and drafts.

Authenticity aside, I've been here a million times and I know I will be here a million more.
