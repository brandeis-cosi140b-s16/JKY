Ate lunch here today! Pleasantly surprised. The food was delicious and fresh and tasted authentic to me. (I have eaten in Mexico City, but I'm definitely no expert.) The restaurant was clean and the folks working were friendly and prompt. They have their own sauces, which is always a plus. It's a restaurant in a strip mall with an ordering counter, so it's nothing fancy, but I plan to come here again, and it has some of the better Mexican food I've ever eaten in the states. I'm giving 5 stars because it's definitely in the 5 star range for restaurants of its kind.
