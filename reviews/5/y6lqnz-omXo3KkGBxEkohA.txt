The original fish taco has a big hunk of meat. This ain't no wimpy Taco Bell taco. A la carte is priced at 2.79. But I suggest the combo at 6.49, which comes with two tacos, rice and beans and a drink. Hey, no need to tip. 

They have a clean salsa bar with about 8 different salsas. Sliced limes are set out too. Try their raspberry tea on tap. It's tasty. 

Our cashier Ramon had a smile. A lady's toddler dumped something on the floor and Ramon mopped it up and was like "no problem".

Outdoor seating is plentiful and each table is covered by a tiki umbrella.
