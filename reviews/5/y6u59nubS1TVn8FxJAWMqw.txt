No need to go all the way for Park Street for authentic mexican. Tucked in the sort-of-seedy strip behind the McDonalds, you can stay on the east side for real mexican.

This place has all the regulars, burritos, etc-- but it really shines in those double wrapped, cilantro and onion topped tacos, tortas, sopes, etc.

All types of meat (I love the lengua--tongue), but my coworker has gotten steak and chorizo. Very warm, very friendly (though the english isn't always there). Great spot for something different on the eastside.
