First off let me preface by the fact that I am extremely lazy and don't normally review places, no matter how good it is. With that being said I took the time out of my extremely unoccupied day to make this review. That is how awesome this place is!

I have been here twice now, and the first time I ordered the green chili pork and short rib enchiladas. The second time around I got both short rib. The short rib has an amazing flavor, it just pops in your mouth!

The cotija cheese and habenero lava sauce are both fantastic. This last time I even tried a side of the herbal ranch, which was, you guessed it, great! I also tried a side of their cornbread this time around and was glad I did. With actual corn and a hint of spiciness to it, it was a great addition.

To top off this great meal, they even have alcoholic beverages. Pacifico being my favorite, I got that my first time through. After which I realized he had a cream soda on tap, and boy do I love cream soda! So this time around I got the cream soda, and my wife asked if they made margaritas. Which they did, so she got one. A pink grapefruit Margarita is what they served her, and it was very delicious! A little too strong for my wife, but I didn't mind finishing off for her.

For under $30 for a family of three and one alcoholic beverage and one soda, I will gladly be coming back here on a regular basis! I highly recommend this to anyone in the area or even if you have to make a bit of a commute. Every Phoenician should try this place at least once. Unless it's on a night I choose to go, in that case, go a different night. Parking is very limited and I'd rather not park across the street... ;-)
