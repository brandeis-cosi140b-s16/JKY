I have heard about this place for years but never made it here until this year finally!!!! This place feels and looks like you've just gone to Mexico.  I order a molcajetes it came out still cooking, it was so good.  They have the best micheladas I have ever had!!!!! This place is definite worth the stop but next time I would stop there on the way to Vegas rather than on the way home.
