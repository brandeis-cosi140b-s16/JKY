I love Mexican food...but not just any Mexican food, I love Mexican food done with an American twist. Cafe Rio is the pinnacle of Mexican American food for me. I frequent this place at least once a week. You can't go wrong with the quesadillas, salads, or tostadas. Salads...what?! The salads are served on a delicious handmade tortilla and filled with rice, beans, a meat of your choice, pico de gallo, lettuce, and guacamole. My absolute favorite thing on the menu is the pork barbacoa. It is the perfect balance of savory and sweet. I could eat it by the pound, but usually I just get it on my tostada. The house dressing and the vinaigrette are both delicious choices for a salad or tostada. This place is fast and runs like a well oiled machine. They also have a punch card and after 10 punches you get a free meal! The best part is that you won't feel like you just ate fast food after you gorge yourself on the deliciousness that is Cafe Rio!
