We came here on a Friday night, and surprisingly , I had never been to this location before. What a nice surprise it was. 
The staff was so lovely and kind. It was nice and clean inside. 
Our server was very attentive to us as well as all his other customers. 
It was a Friday so no Meat. I got fish tacos, loved them. M got bean enchilada and Rice and beans.
I like Coffee with Mexican Food and the server made me a fresh pot. 
 I am looking forward to our next visit. I hope it is as great as last time.
