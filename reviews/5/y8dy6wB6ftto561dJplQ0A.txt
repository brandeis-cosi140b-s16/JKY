Our last night in LV before heading back to SoCal.

Mrs Crash wanted real mexican; no franchise allowed...but who can really tell in this franchise driven country?

Walking through the MGM we came upon this shining gem.

Amazing interior, waterfall and live fish tanks more reminiscent of an upmarket japanese restaurant than mexican.

Beautiful decor aside, it is all about the taste and we were not disappointed at all.

Fantastic salsas and flavoured salts were served while we pondered the menu. All had a tremendous burst of freshness and light, not all to our taste, but all definitely worth trying.

We were not exactly starving, so decided to share 3 'appetisers' (plus we are getting used to USA serving sizes). 

The standout dish was the goat - slow cooked and juicy and tender. Served simply with some flat bread - tip: add a little of the table-side-made gaucamole to it for a taste sensation.

So much better than any franchise (Chili, or El Torito for example) - If you're in LV and fancy Mexican then this is the place to be!!!
