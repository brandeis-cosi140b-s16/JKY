Best al pastor tacos this side of the border, I grew up in Mexico, and I gotta tell you, is really hard to find authentic Mexican flavor.  I followed the advice of yelpers in the search for the best place for tacos, it was right on, so juicy, tasty, I'm going back for more. 
It is a very short walk from Freemont, and I felt safe as well. Highly recommend!
