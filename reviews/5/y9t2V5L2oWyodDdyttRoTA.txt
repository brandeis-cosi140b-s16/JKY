Wow! How did I not know about this place? The tortillas and salsa here are freaking amazing(warm are mild and light... not like the heavy greasy-grainy chips most Mexican places in this hood serve). My friend and I had two baskets, while hilariously holding ourselves back! I noticed a couple people came in to get chips and salsa for takeout.

I had the carnitas(~$8, on special). They were perfectly portioned and the pork portion was authentic: chunks of roasted meat/ no gross puddles of fat--Neither dry-shredded nor blank. I'm now craving a second helping of carnitas, although I have dinner plans at a certain posh strip joint. 

My friend had one of their sizzling steak dishes--she commented literally 10 times how tender it was. Service was great. 

Their menu has just enough variety(I like it that way) and an easy-going ambiance(nice decor for a stip-mall-esque hole-in-the-wall). I checked out the bakery nearby and will definitely return for the delicious flan. Winner!
