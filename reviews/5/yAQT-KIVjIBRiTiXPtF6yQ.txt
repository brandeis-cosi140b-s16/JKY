Oh dear GOD! This place is so amazing. I seriously don't know how the lines aren't out the door and around the corner! My sister lives nearby and she demanded that we try it. Boy, was she right when she said it's like an orgasm in your mouth! Can you say QUALITY?!?! I feel like this is what I expected at Gallo Blanco but was disappointed. First of all, the tortillas are extremely fresh; considering they start with a ball of dough and flatten/cook it right on the grill in your face!! The three of us shared 4 tacos, 2 pork and 2 beef, half corn/half flour, with red AND green sauce; plus an enchillada with a fried egg on top!! I literally could not stop eating.  We somehow stopped ourselves from being super fatkids and took home some leftovers (portions are pretty generous). Still superb as a leftover btw. The staff was super nice, can't wait to come back!
