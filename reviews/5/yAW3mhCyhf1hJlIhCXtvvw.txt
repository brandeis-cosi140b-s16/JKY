This is a great mom and pop shop with great food.  I read some of the other reviews and the ones that gave it low stars are ridiculous.  They were expecting something that is clearly not how this shop operates.  Also, I think someone reviewed their ribs, which they do not have there and clearly mistook the Indian Village for The Horny Toad which is next door.  But, if you want good tacos, good people and a good environment, check this place out.  The owner is particularly hysterical.
