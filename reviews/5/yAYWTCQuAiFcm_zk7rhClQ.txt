I love this place, I have been coming here for 15 years.  I keep coming back because the food is consistently awesome  The green burro is the best and the salsa is chunky with just the right amount of heat.  Authentic and flavorful!  I always look forward to my bill because it comes with a cinnamon crisp!  

We've had them cater for several events and the food is always delicious. Great family run business.
