I would have never ever known about this place If it wasn't for finding it on yelp I had the Asada tacos they were absolutely fabulous the meet was perfect tortillas were nice and fresh toppings were nice and fresh they make their Salsa daily as I was sitting there eating my Carney tacos the couple next to me was raving about the fish tacos so I thought what hell For two dollars I should go ahead and try one one of the best fish tacos I've ever had a must try spot if you're in the area
