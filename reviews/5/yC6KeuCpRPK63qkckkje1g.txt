I am hard to please.  That said, I am always elated when I dine at Chipotle--any Chipotle.  And since I've been to this location a little more often than the others, I choose to review this one.  I am amazed at the quality of the meal--fresh ingredients, plenty of meat, clean interior--modernity at it's best.  The prices are ridiculous--six and change for a huge fresh-Mex burrito with steak or chicken or pork ... I just wanted to chime in on how much I appreciate them.
