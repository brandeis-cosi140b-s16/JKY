This would be a quintessential Vegas and Orange County casual chic dining experience. Hence, those are the only two locations Javier's is located in. 
Located at the Aria Hotel in Vegas, it's the perfect place to enjoy a meal and sip on delicious margaritas with an intimate feel. 

In addition to experiencing the ambience, the food here is exceptionally tasteful.  No complaints here. Although eating high priced Mexican food can be questionable in terms of how creative can you get with rice and beans ? Well Javier's demonstrates that.

I dinned here simply because it is Kobe Bryant's favorite restaurant. 
I was impressed with the ominous decor. The leather menu, leather tables, 3D like paintings, and all black everything made this place appealing.

The menu can be overwhelming since there too many items to mention but there is a large Sea Food portion on the menu. I ordered the Lobster Enchiladas and yes it was brilliant. Everything about the taste of the food was fresh and I assume it took time to make. The presentation of the food was ok, nothing to brag about. The portion was perfect and not to skimpy like most bougie restaurants. 

Javier's is also famous for their Guacamole and I can't agree more since I liked it alot ! 

You get what you pay for and the service was excellent !
Please plan and reserve accordingly since this place does get overly booked. 

I will definitely be returning soon :)
