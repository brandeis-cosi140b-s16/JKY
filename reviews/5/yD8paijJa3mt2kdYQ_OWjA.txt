I work in the mall, so I'm very frequent here. I order the #12 "Street Tacos". I always get steak with flour tortillas. These tacos are delicious every time. The meat is juicy and flavorful, not dry with no taste. The tortillas (flour) are soft and cooked to perfection, not dry and flakey. They have a good selection of salsas (Hot, Mild, Green, and Guac) with free chips with your meal. They have Mexican bottled Coke (yes, it tastes different) which is a plus. 

Service is nice and they make sure everything is up to their customer's satisfaction.
