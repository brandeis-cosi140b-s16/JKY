This place is really good if you're craving authentic Mexican food and are sick of Taco Bell (because Taco Bell sucks). It's a hole-in-the-wall that actually serves tripa and lengua, so you KNOW this place gets down!  It's cheap and family-owned, so the owners/waiters are very nice and attentive. Don't waste your time going to Roberto's...if you're in Henderson, try this place. They have weird hours but I think because of their location, they don't get much action.
