We enjoyed our meal and service was wonderful. I feel the other reviews are in error, as our experience was very positive. Street tacos were delicious and my husbands burrito was very good. Our server was attentive and friendly. Manager also visited our table and she gave our son plain chips for the guacamole we ordered with our  nachos, which we also enjoyed.
