One of the best Mexican food restaurants I ever have been to All my friends and family have gone here since early 80's, I live in Los Angeles now and miss the true real deal that El Norteno has. I have three place I consider the "best" and this one of the three. One of the Three are closed now sorry to say. When I visit Phoenix we always stop by for Lunch or Dinner. Wish that Los Angeles some how can pick up there flavors compared to Phoenix.
