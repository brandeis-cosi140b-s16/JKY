Its taco bell. 
That's all to be said about the food. 
However, this particular taco bell has THE friendliest staff of any fast food place I've been to. 
They are always upbeat, at first it's off putting because you are so accustomed to the person handing you your greasy food through the window being lackluster at best. Eventually you realize that they really are just this nice. I have never had someone roll their eyes or impatiently take my order. No, they are always happy to serve you. I've even had one fine gentlemen become concerned for my well being when I ordered a volcano burrito but no beverage. He wanted me to know it was very spicy. He continued to worry until I let him know I had a water bottle with me. 
Really. 
Nicest. People. Ever.
