GREAT FOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I never paid attention for this restaurant, but my friend invited me there, you never get disappointed on how great and tasty their food is! 

Their breakfast burritos are super wow! We ordered couple more stuff, try their carne asada! It's about fries and beef plate with some sour cream and something else; anyways it's f***ing delicious! 

& great service...
