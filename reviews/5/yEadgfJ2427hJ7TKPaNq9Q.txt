There's no better place for a great lunch hour! Shannon brings the sun to shine! 

The food is amazing. The staff is incredible and the patrons are the best in town.

Recommend them for all occasions.

Love Viviana, Jen, Bob, Chris, and of course my SHANNON!!! 

DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ANYWHERE ELSE!! 

must try their street tacos and fusion sauce ;)
