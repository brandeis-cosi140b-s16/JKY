Ahh, Roberto taco shop. And old trusty favorite.  This is what I love about Roberto's, no matter what time it is, breakfast lunch or even dinner, I know that my Carne asada fries are going to to be amazing and so yummy. The cure to any hangover if you haven't tried it yet will be the carne asada burrito. It's a Roberto's standard and a cure all. Happy eating at my favorite hole in the wall.
