Hibiscus margaritas...oh how I love you!! Haha 

So I was in Scottsdale last weekend, visiting friends and going to the Interpol concert Saturday night. My friend Chantage and I arrived in Scottsdale early afternoon and were immediately whisked away by our friends to Cien Agaves for margaritas and tacos. (I have the best friends in the world!) With so many margarita choices, yes, it was hard to narrow it down to one to start with. But the hibiscus is my favorite flower, so why not try a hibiscus margarita?? Yum, yum and more yum!! And they were in very generous glasses, too! I want one right now and it's only 11am! On the second margarita, we decided to order some tacos. Again, the choices...uh, I wanted them all! But I opted for the Dos Tacos Especial which was my choice of two tacos, beans and rice. I love mahi mahi, so that's what I ordered. Fabulousness, I tell ya! The mahi mahi was grilled to perfection, the beans were smoky and woody but the rice, eh, was okay. Not my favorite. The third hisbiscus margarita made up for it, though! My friends had seared ahi tuna tacos, lobster tacos and carnitas tacos which by the sounds of their 'mmm's and 'ohh's' I can tell you were just as awesome as my mahi mahi tacos!

Our bartender, Blair, was cute, friendly and funny. I hope he enjoyed serving us as much as we enjoyed him! We'll be back to see him (and try other tacos and margaritas) again soon...thanks, Blair! :)
