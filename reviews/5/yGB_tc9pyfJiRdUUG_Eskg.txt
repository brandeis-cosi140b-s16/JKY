So, I grew up in San Deigo and have a strong opinion of what Mexican food should taste like. I have been searching for a good carne asada burrito since I moved to Phoenix, to no avail. Based on reviews, I decided to give this place a try. 

First impression: small and simple= perfect!  The fancier the dining area, the less authentic the food tends to be. I place my order and the gentleman (I think the owner) was super friendly, attentive, and polite. I sat down to wait and the daughter (about 4) of the owner left her food and came to say hi. She is adorable. Loved the family feel. 

The food: Confession- I saw they also offered machaca burritos! After a strong internal struggle, I opted to try both the carne asada and machaca...just to 'sample' them. I tried the carne asada first- delicious!  None of that cheap rice filler other places in az tend to stuff in there and the meat had a great flavor. The tortillas were delicious as well. I stopped about halfway as I realized I had the machaca. Bit into that- very happy with the flavor. It didn't bring back memories of home, but it was delicious in its own right. I ended up not being able to stop and ate BOTH burritos, by myself, in one sitting. Very impressive feat for me. 

All in all, I was so happy with my experience and the food at Christina's. I will be sending everyone I know here, as well as returning frequently!  Thanks for making me miss home a little less!!
