My husband and I are regulars on Friday nights after work.  He always gets the wings and I usually try something different each time.  I've had just about everything on the Bar Bites menu now and the only thing that disappointed were the taquitos. My favorites are the pork carnitas tostados. Joey the bartender is fantastic. Always takes care of us to the point of starting our drinks the moment we walk in. Super great service and fun atmosphere. Wouldn't go anywhere else for our late night drink and snack.
