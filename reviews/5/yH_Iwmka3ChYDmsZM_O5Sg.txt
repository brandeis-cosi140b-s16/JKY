Had a long wait for a, flight so decided to give this place a try. Was not disappointed. The bacon wrapped shrimp were incredible. They serve you chips and salsa with a cup of warm beans that were really good. The food was really great. Service was quick and friendly. Will make this anytime Im in Vegas.
