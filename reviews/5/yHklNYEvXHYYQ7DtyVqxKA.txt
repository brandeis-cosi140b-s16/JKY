Fausto's is the absolute best place for Mexican food in Henderson. I go to Fausto's all the time, whether on the way home or just to suffice my ocassional late-night Mexican food craving. They do burrittos the way they're supposed to, and not surprisingly as I am a burritto lover, my favorite item on the menu is a buritto. So the next time you ever come around College and Horizon, be sure to stop by Fausto's and get my all-time favorite - the Nevada burrito. It's basically a California burritto, but packed with so much meat, sauce, and everything you love about a buritto done to near-perfection. Go to Fausto's now! But be prepared, sometimes there can be a line out the door!
