I love this place!  I don't care if it's touristy or not.  Since I always bring people from out of town, it's kinda neat.  Coming from the midwest, we don't have much like this to offer, as far as scenery and wild west style.  It's a great couple hour get-a-way from the city, and it's a fun fun drive.  The chilli is great in my opinion, and I'm pretty darn picky about chilli.  Cheese crisp with green chillies on it is damn good too!   Their bathrooms are pretty funny too :)
