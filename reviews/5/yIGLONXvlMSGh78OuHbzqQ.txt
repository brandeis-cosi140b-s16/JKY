stopped in at like 4.30 am for a burrito before catching a flight.  it's right around the corner from the car rental return for the airport.  and the gas in the parking lot is much cheaper than the station 1/2 mile away at the car rental return.  so get a yummy burrito and fill your gas tank as well.  
the burrito was delicous, btw...much better than i was expecting. 
ususally things i eat at 4.30am seem amazing b/c i am drunk...that's why i'm eating...but this was delicious and i was 100% sober.
