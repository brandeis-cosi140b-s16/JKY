I've been going to this establishment for the past five years! I literally walk there all the time since it's super close to my house. Just kidding! I've only walked there once because my car broke down lol. Anyways, their hot dogs are to die for! I've tried so many Sonoran hotdogs in AZ and none come close to Mr. Triny's! Their champurrado is the best Mexican hot drink to have during the winter time. I am not the only one obsessed with these hotdogs so it's my family! We love Don Triny. He is so nice and welcoming :) great service!
