The food is absolutely delicious and I love that much of it is locally grown and they are always conscious of their environmental impact. It's always so spotlessly clean and the staff is always friendly but depending on who is serving up the meat, your portion may vary. Sometimes I barely get any meat. I usually get the burrito but lately have been going for their soft shell tacos. I highly recommend the guacamole and chips. I get them often as an afternoon pick me up when working late. I don't usually eat there since the tables always seem to be taken but if you can get one the outdoor tables are nice.
