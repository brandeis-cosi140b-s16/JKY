I love coming here. The staff is always friendly, I usually go thru drive thru. Sometimes the monitor works and sometimes it doesnt. The staff typically has the order right and depending what day of the week it is your food is yummie. Sometimes it is burnt if its the younger crowd in the kitchen. But its quick service and if they get something in your order wrong they fix it quick. Kudos
