Best homestyle Mexican food in town. And YES, they do still have the Sunday morning porkchop, just like Zip did, and YES it is just as good. Same recipe, same cooks. The family goes over and above courteous. For your best bet, go for the real food- rellenos, enchiladas, the albondigas on wed is awesome, weekend menudo even better.
