Hands down the best Mexican food I have had in Arizona yet! I've been here for almost 10 years now and tried many Mexican restaurants. There are several good ones, but not as wonderful as this one!
There was 5 in our party, every single one of us loved our food. The two ladies working were on the ball. Never forgot anything we asked them. They were friendly and very fast!
The chips were fresh, thin, and warm. The salsa is not chunky with just the right flavor and heat. We kept asking for refills and they brought them with no hesitation.
I had the chile rellenos and it was amazing. The serving was huge, the egg was cooked just right! Most places over cook them, not Tony's! The green sauce was perfect! The beans are flavorful and creamy. I could go on and on. We will all be back!
