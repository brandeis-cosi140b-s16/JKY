Great & creative pizza, a very tasty specialty salad of shaved brussels sprouts and goat cheese plus some Jolly Pumpkin sours is a potent combination. The salad we ordered was the daily special so I can't speak as to its availability when you visit. We ordered the Forza pizza which came with excellent sausage, cherry tomatoes, and garlic. I felt like the ricotta probably took it into too rich territory but that's a pretty minor complaint.

Protip: you can get pizzas split into two flavors so you can try more stuff.
