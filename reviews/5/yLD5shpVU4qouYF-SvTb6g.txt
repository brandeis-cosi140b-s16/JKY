This was the biggest surprise of Mexican food I have had in a long time. Having been in Missouri for the last three years, good quick Mexican is nonexistent. I always crave good Mexican that isn't overpriced and dripping with grease. 

Let's start with the best part. This was the nicest Filiberto's I have ever seen. It is actually the nicest quick Mexican place you will ever see. They have you order for take out up front but it looked like you can sit and have a waiter. There is a full bar, tv's and a huge screen with a video game you could play. None of those is the norm for a Filiberto's. 

What was normal was the awesome food and decent prices. I can't ask for anything else. I had a California and my wife had a shrimp burrito. When I asked for more salsa they obliged quickly. I asked for a bunch. Maybe 4 of each is what I said. Then the server brought out at least 5-6 of each type in a bag. Over the top. 

I wish I had known about this Filiberto's before. I will come back to this Fili-B's.
