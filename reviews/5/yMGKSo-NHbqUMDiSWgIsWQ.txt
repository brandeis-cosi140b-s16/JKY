This has to be my favorite quick Mexican place!! We eat here multiple times a week. If only they had a stamp card ;)
We are creatures of habit and always get the Super Nachos, Quesadilla, and Taquitos. I think their Horchata is amazing and I LOVE their guacamole. 
They have a location in my home town and this one does not disappoint my aching tastebuds for that home-like memory. 5 stars all the way. Did I mention very kind service?
