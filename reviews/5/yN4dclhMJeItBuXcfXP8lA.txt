I'm a firm believer of rating business in the context of why you are going there. I typically come here for a quick lunch spot and it is by far one of my favorite places

- Food is fantastic and local and everything you could ask for. Spicy chicken burrito with great guac and the famous El Diablo sauce. So so so good. There is also such a variety of sides it's amazing. A cooler full of non fountain specialty drinks? A rack full of snacks etc. You can buy a Moonpie here!?! Love it.
- The story behind the burrito shop is amazing. Google it and look it up.
- The decor is more unique than any other place in Uptown
- Johnny is a character and will greet you at the cash register. You've probably heard. He likes cash, but he will still sell you a burrito if you don't have any. 

Highly highly recommended!
