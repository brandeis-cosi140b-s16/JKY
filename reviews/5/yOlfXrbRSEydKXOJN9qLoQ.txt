Matt is the absolute man. Not only is he a world class server he is extremely nice guy. We walked in 2 minutes before happy hour ended and he let us get happy hour (kudos). Also, the food here is great. If you get the chance try the street corn. Bomb. Anywho, try this place out and if you can, get Matt as a server.
