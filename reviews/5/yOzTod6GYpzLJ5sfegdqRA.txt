This is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants in town.
They have the usual/expected menu, tacos, burritos, enchiladas, etc., at really reasonable prices. In the years that I have been going there the food has always been delicious and everyone I have taken has been won over. 
The staff is friendly and attentive, I have always had really good service.
I can't say enough about La Canasta. This place is awesome.
Two things, though, the dining room closes at 7 pm and they don't do separate checks.
