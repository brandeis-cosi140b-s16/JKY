Great place! Super clean, friendly staff, and authentic fish tacos that make me feel like I'm on vacay in Mexico. I'd been to their Tempe location once, but it is too far to make the trip regularly. I'm a little nervous about how much I'll be eating here now that they opened this location in my hood.
