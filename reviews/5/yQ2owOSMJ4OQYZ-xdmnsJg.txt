Small Price, Phat Burrito

 Learning the streets in and around uptown Charlotte I finally got the nerve to go and eat at a restaurant I passed almost every day on the way to school. The old Aztec looking building on Camden Road sure has caught my eye more than once. In a place where skateboarders do their thing, paper is blowing on the ground, and a two lane road without a car in sight makes me wonder why anyone would eat here.

Pulling into a parking lot of no more than six spaces with everyone of them being occupied made me rethink that this trip could be one I'd remember. Parking on the street was no big deal assuming you live uptown and you do it every day anyways. When I walked through the door a screen of fog and heat hit me in the face like when your girlfriend slaps you because you changed her reality TV show to Sports Center. 

The craving for something in my tummy grew faster and faster as I was deciding what to eat. The BBQ Steak Burrito with a side of Chips and Salsa. Never in my mind would I have thought to put BBQ and Mexican together until I tried it. Playing on words, this burrito brought me joy of an unheard of quantity. The burrito was as life-size as my head and it was gone in minutes.
                      
$7.95 to fill me up is abnormal. When I am hungry, I eat and man can I eat. I had to flex my stomach muscles just to get is all down. Being a college student this is definitely quality food for a cheap price.
