I have never been here before. Don't know how, z tejas has been around awhile but I came in right before happy hour ended. my server Vanessa was awesome and scored me beer right before it ended. She was really friendly and provided great service. I ordered the street tacos which were quite tasty!! Then I switched up and went to the bar to watch the rest of the finals. Both bartenders were fun and cool (didn't catch their names though) ordered a cheese cake. Smart move because it was delicious. All in all a good time.
