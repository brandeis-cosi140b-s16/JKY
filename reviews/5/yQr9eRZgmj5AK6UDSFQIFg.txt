My boyfriend and I went here for the first time today. The food is great, and so is the service. However, if you don't like fried food, don't get the quesadillas. My boyfriend had the horchata, and he says it is the best that he has ever had. The horchata is sweet, but not sickly sweet, and it has strawberries and pecans in it.

The salsa bar is awesome. You receive complimentary chips, and you can choose as many salsas as you want.

The menu has a wide variety; there is something for everyone! Even vegetarians. The dogfish taco lives up to its reputation on Yelp.
