Delicious. Atmosphere divey. We were the only people speaking English and it was awesome. I saw a whole pile of cut avocados in the back - I had to try the guacamole... So worth it. I got three tacos-one each of spicy pork, pulled pork and shredded beef, with corn tortillas.  Loved all three but the spicy pork was my favorite. 

Overlook the location and the exterior! Your mouth will thank you!
