I've been eating Baja Fresh ever since the first restaurant opened in Newburry Park, CA. It's always delicious, even to this day and after all the corporate buyouts of the brand, ownership changes, etc. The recipes and food quality remain the same as they did all those years ago in the beginning, during the early 1990's. More specifically, this store in Las Vegas on West Lake Mead is my personal favorite, not just because it's now the closest to me since recently moving, but because of how incredible everything consistently tastes, the cleanliness of the restaurant itself, and the fantastic staff and service. Chipotle is great, but Baja is the original, and still the best!
