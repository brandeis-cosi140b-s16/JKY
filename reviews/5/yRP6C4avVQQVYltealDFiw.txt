Great food, service, and decor. I had some life changing chicken and waffles at a restaurant called the Burgundian in Seattle, and I would say these stack up well. The chicken was also much better than Lo-Lo's, and the sides are more unique, such as the cilantro in the coleslaw and the jalape√±o in the corn bread. Some of the dishes are on the pricy side for what you get, but the chicken and waffles is like two meals for me at least, and you're paying for more than just KFC on top of bisquick waffles. The chicken is seriously good, a bit of spice but incredibly moist. We got our food fast and all the staff were very nice.
