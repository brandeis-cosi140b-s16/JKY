I love Rubio's.. I am definitely in here a few times a month. Their fish tacos are some of my favorite I have ever had! I also really love their california bowl with chicken and the green sauce (although red is good too).. My ex always raved about the burritos.. Pretty much everything here is great. All fresh ingredients and you really can taste the difference. There is always the same cashier when I go in.. I cannot remember his name but he is very friendly and always keeps up even when it gets busy.
