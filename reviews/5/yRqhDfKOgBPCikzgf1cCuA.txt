Omar is the best!!!!! My friend and I come here probably more often than we should admit and every time we get the bean and cheese burrito and green salsa. It is by far, waaaaay better than Filbertos or any of the other mexican fast food places in Phoenix. And Omar is so friendly. The place looks kinda sketchy but you should definitely try it out anyways!
