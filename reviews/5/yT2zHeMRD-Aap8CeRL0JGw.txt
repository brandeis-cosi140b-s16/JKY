I absolutely love Cafe Rio. You really can't go wrong with any item on the menu. I usually get the chicken enchiladas or the chicken tacos with the homemade corn tortillas. Their prices are reasonable, they give you a lot of food, and they are fast. I try to make it here every time I'm back in Vegas.
