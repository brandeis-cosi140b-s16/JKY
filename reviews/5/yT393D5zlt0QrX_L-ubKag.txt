Mad Mex has THE BEST burritos I have ever had hands down. My first visit was sometime during the summer of 2005 and since then been a staple dining place until I moved to Chicago. 

Not only is the food delicious but the Big Azz Margaritas are awesome, especially if you're there while they have a special. 

I have a love/hate relationship with this location for the simple fact that it is always so crowded. I love the half price after 11 and the food is always excellent but you're often waiting a while for a table. 

Ive been to several other Mad Mex locations, and while they don't offer the half price special, the atmosphere seems more like a restaurant than a crowded bar. 

seriously awesome food. I can't wait to take a trip back to Pittsburgh and stuff myself with a burrito.
