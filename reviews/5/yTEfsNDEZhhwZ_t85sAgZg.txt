I have always driven past this place and finally stopped when my son was famished and I did not want to go to Culver's.  What a hidden gem! Greeted by the owner, the cook and counter person right when I walked in and the burger was excellent! Love to support a locally owned place who is doing food right! Try their Daily special- always creative and good. I am hooked!
