Taco Bell gets 3.5 stars and this place is only at 4?  COME ON PEOPLE...!  This is THE BEST Mexican restaurant in Pittsburgh.  

My wife and I were in Cancun 2 weeks ago and after an entire week of Mexican food we both had sworn it off for months... that is, until we were out at Excuses and decided to grab a bite to eat.  Fat Heads would have been the first choice but the wait can be crazy long.  Sake for sushi was my second choice but the wife wasn't in the mood.  El Toro was her suggestion.  

We were not disappointed.  We were met by what must be the owners' wife or the mother of the guys working there, she had a big smile, remembered us from visits past, asked if we would like our same table and immediately seated us and delivered ice water, chips & salsa.  Then she introduced our waiter and was off to seat other guests.  Our waiter- Mauricio or something- was very friendly, recommended a few specialties then gave us time to decide.  He even told us that margaritas & Coronas were half price and we ordered one of each.  The mega-margarita with the mini-corona is always Kim's fav and she loved it.  That drink is big enough to share but with Mauricio being 'quick on the draw' I never had an empty bottle in front of me.  

For dinner, we chose the Molcajete Fajitas- steak & chicken (we're not fans of chorizo) and they were delicious as usual.  The quality, service & portions have not changed since our first visit.

We will continue to be customers of El Toro because they deliver what we want- authentic Mexican, fair prices and excellent service.
