My favorite Mexican food in town. It looks like a hole in the wall from the outside in a sketchy part of town, but inside you are greeted by a courteous and friendly staff. Everything we have tried have been packed with flavor and was very reasonably priced. 

I have tried their al pastor burrito enchilada style, fresh chips and guacamole, and camarones ala diabla.I cannot decide which I liked best...oh yeah, I can... their FRIED ICE CREAM! It was perfect. On our most recent visit we sampled their flan which was also great. On our first visit we overheard a table near us raving about the food, and the woman who brought out the food simply said "We make it the way we would at home". I think that pretty much sums up the food.

This is our go to place for Mexican food, and whoever it was that compared this to Roberto's ought to have their head checked. I mean, I guess you can't beat the complementary side of e-coli at Roberto's.
