This Chipotle is still the best Chipotle I've found.. Hands Down! One thing that is completely different from the rest of them is how the customer service and the staff try to get to know you on a personal level. They remember their regulars, strike up conversation while being extremely friendly and always offer service with a sincere smile. One employee that we just love is Tiana. She's always so friendly, so happy and is always going above and beyond to make sure that everything is the way we like it. Tiana and her crew are the reason we keep coming back over and over again. Thanks Tiana!
