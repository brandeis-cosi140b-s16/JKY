Want real Mexican tacos hundreds of miles from the borders?  Want them at almost any hour?  Tacos El Gordo is as legit as they come for "Tijuana style" tacos.

After a 15 minute wait and $120 later, eight (8) of us had probably our best Vegas meal at 5:00AM after a night of wayyyyyy too much alcohol.  We had tacos de carne asada, adobada and my personal favorite...mulas.  They were all fantastic, and while the prices are a little high, you are on the strip and they are open until the wee hours of the morning.  I would gladly pay $3 a taco for carne asada deliciousness at those hours. 

I will say that the San Diego locations have disappointed me the past couple times I have been there, but this one hit the spot in so many good ways.  I will come back again and again, as any Vegas weekend with tacos in the morning hours is always a good night!
