I wanted to try something new and I found this place. The food was fantastic and I can't wait to go back to try something new from their very large menu. The staff was very friendly and the place was very clean. Their homemade horchata is mouthwatering. 
I recommend Tortas Paquime to anyone looking for a great place to eat and I look forward to returning.
