We've gotten takeout here before, but it was my first time for a sit-down meal.  GREAT!  No complaints, great food, pleasant service, reasonable prices, and a huge variety, some things I haven't seen on other Mexican menus before.  What's not to love?   This may be my go-to place for Mexican for awhile as I want to try so many things on the menu.
