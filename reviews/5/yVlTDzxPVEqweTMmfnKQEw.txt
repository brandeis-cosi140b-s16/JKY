We were in Phoenix on a mini vacation and luckily we found this place.  I had a chile verde burrito which was excellent, filled with lots of meat no fat or gristle like the ones back home in El Paso.  My girlfriend had some chicken tacos which she loved also.  Wish we had something like this back home.
