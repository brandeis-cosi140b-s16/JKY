This place is the spot!  One of the most beautiful restaurants on the strip.  There is a wall one one end, seems to be made out of wood, with skeletons all over it.  Beautiful.  Dimly lit, it's a nice escape from the Aria (not that the Aria is anything to escape from) but you totally feel like you are not in Las Vegas, like LA or NYC.

Our waitress recommended the Carnitas to me.  Wow, what a dish.  Huge portion of carnitas, a piece of rib, and all the sides including guac.  Very tender and not fatty at all, which is great.  Can't stand mexican restaurants that serve non lean meat.  I also tried my friend's skirt steak.  Very tender, almost to the point that it was soft like fast food Chinese beef.  Kinda freaked me out a little, buy hey, what can you do??

As a local, I always seem to have low expectations of strip restaurants.  But, I was totally surprised.  Prices are decent, but they are well below strip prices.  (Minus the carne asada for $50)  I am actually very curious to see what that tastes like.  But I am willing to pay more since the restaurant is so eye catching, yet subtle at the same time.

Top new date spot on the strip!  5 stars all the way.
