I work at the Venetian canal shoppes and have lunch here occasionally always at the bar they have an amazing staff all very helpful and warm right when you come in to the very end food is always done fast their bartenders are amazing! Always great conversations. Their appetizer flautas are to die for that's what I always have and by the end of my meal I'm always stuffed great fast lunch and I usually go under peak hours and even then it's quick! Definitely a great place to have lunch or dinner and a fun time either alone or with friends. They have happy hour from 3-6 and 9pm-close very convenient!
