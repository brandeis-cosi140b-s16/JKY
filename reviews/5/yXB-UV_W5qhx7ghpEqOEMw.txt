This place was awesome! The family took a Yelp leap of faith after caving some Mexican food and we were not disappointed.  It was tucked back in a half-vacant shopping center but had a steady stream of customers all night.  

All cooked to order, great selection of tacos (and everything else).  GUAC WAS FANTASTIC!! Their green salsa was really good too.  Good draft beer selection and really strong lineup of tequila.  

Our family of four was in and out of here for less than what Chipotle would run us and this was way fresher / better. This will definitely be or new Mexican place going forward!!!
