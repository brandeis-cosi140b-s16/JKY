My family and I were blown away by Chile Addiction. Not only was the food fantastic and the service warm and friendly, but when sopapillas were left out of our to go order by accident, they apologized up one side and down another then offered to have them delivered to our front door! Talk about incredible customer service!

We ordered stuffed sopapillas, chicken enchiladas, a beef taco and the green chile burger (I don't remember the super clever names, but loved reading through the menu!) and everything was delicious! We can't wait to dine in next time... as everything is always better in the restaurant.
