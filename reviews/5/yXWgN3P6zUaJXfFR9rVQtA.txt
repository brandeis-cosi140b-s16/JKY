Scored a seat at the bar and glad I did! Excellent food, fresh and full of flavor! I had some guac and the wagyu steak tacos, so good! Meat was tender and perfectly cooked, the toppings were creative and delicious. I love that there's more to the tacos then traditional toppings. An excellent creative menu with home made sauces, housemade chorizo...I can't wait to try the rest of the menu! And what made my experience even better was the open kitchen bar set up so I had the chance to watch the cooks in action which I love! Very energetic vibe from that crew, I had to take a picture :) I cant wait to come back to Pittsburg again, this will for sure be a regular stop for me!
