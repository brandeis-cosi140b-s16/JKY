Regular stop every Monday. The best part about this place:

Great, tasty Mexican food..made the way it should be made
FRESH ingredients, Papi grows his own veggies
Served quickly after the order, I have left the bar to go to talk to someone, came back 10 minutes later and the food was there

They have a great Happy Hour menu, and Christina serves some awesome concoctions from behind the bar. Never a bad drink.

Monday nights there is a FREE poker tournament there run by Dream Dealers, so its a 3 for 3.. great food, drinks and pretty girls to deal ya some poker fun!
