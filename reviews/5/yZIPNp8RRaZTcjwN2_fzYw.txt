Great thing about this place is that it is familiar. SOHOs Chef John is running this new gem and i believe its a great concept to having a place in las vegas that has sushi burritos. Ive had them before but nothing like this. So weve had the Redondo and the Rockport which is my fave it was so good i had to order 2. On the second one i even added shrimp tempura to like totally stuff the burrito. It was definitely worth it. I can see myself eating here at least once every couple weeks just because its a little far from my house. Other than that its so good!!!
