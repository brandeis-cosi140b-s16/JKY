Absolutely fabulous! This is a quaint restaurant tucked in the back of a shopping center, with a perfect sized outdoor patio. The food was ridiculously amazing! Started with the avocado bruschetta, huge chunks of fresh avocado with tomatoes and a kick of hot sauce on lightly toasted buttered bread. Flavor explosion! For my meal I had the al pastor tacos and a side of their house rice. The meat was tender and the veggies and salsa were fresh and crisp. The house rice was perfectly cooked with just the right amount of spices as well as chopped chopped chorizo embedded in between the tasty grains. Topped off the evening with a piece of their key lime pie, and I was in foodie heaven! Our waitress Erica was attentive, personable and very sweet. It made our dining experience at The Blind Pig exceptional. Highly recommend this restaurant and can not wait to go back!!
