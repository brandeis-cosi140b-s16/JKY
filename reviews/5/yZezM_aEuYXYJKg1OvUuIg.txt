I stopped in for lunch. Being that these are small plates and most people will want 1.5 to 2 plates it can be a little expensive for lunch. That said the food was excellent. I had the shrimp ceviche and realizing the small portion I also ordered the chicharrones. Both were excellent with great flavors. I have to go back and try the tacos. My other concern is that it wasn't busy, so please go. Also the location is horrible so you won't accidentally find it.
