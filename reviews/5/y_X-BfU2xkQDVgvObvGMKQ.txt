This location is much better than the mesa location! The salsa is very fresh and the bean dip hasn't been watered down with water in a pathetic attempt to stretch it. The food was hot and fresh, unlike the mesa location. I ordered the red Chile Colorado and my husband ordered the ultimate nachos. Both dishes were plentiful and delicious! My parents both ordered burritos and enchiladas which they raved about. Customer service at this location is superior compared to the mesa location also. The waiter was polite and seemed generally happy. I will be back again and again. But never will I ever make the mistake of going to the mesa location just because it's closer to home.
