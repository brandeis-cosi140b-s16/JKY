Really cannot say enough great things about this little taco shop on Chandler Blvd.   To say its a taco shop doesn't do it justice. We had a fish taco, carne asada taco and the el presidente burrito and they all were excellent. We also got the chips, salsa and guacamole but we also added a side of their green chili that was out of this world!!

The have the bomb cocktails too! We started with their black cherry mojitos and ended with a drink called "The Mail Order Bride" that literally was so good I could have drunk ten of them! 

Definitely my new fav Mexican food place!
