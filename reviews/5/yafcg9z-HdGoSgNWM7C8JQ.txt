I am a recent transplant to Pittsburgh from Chicago, which is a serious foodie city. I must say, though, that Casa Rasta has been one of the best places I have eaten in either city! As a vegetarian, I am used to most restaurants only having a couple options for me. However, the menu at Casa Rasta is amazing for vegetarians! For an appetizer we had the avocado fries and yuca chips, which were delicious. I am not usually a fan of avocado, but these were great. For our entrees we had the coconut tofu and potato flautas. Both were fantastic. The coconut tofu was a little spicy for my dinnermate, but I thought it was perfectly fine (he is a 0 spice kind of guy). We finished it off with a yummy chocolate-hazelnut cheesecake. I keep thinking about going back because there were so many other vegetarian options that sounded great that I wanted to try. The restaurant is very small and byob. If you go during normal dinner hours, be prepared for a short wait.
