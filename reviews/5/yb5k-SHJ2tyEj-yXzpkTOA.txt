This place is THE BEST! Cheap, tasty mexican food served out of a roach coach! Yes those dogs are awesome but what this one has that the carts don't are the vampiros. So bomb! Eat those grilled sonoran peppers and some habanero hot sauce and your doin it right! The owner is at this location a lot. He's a nice guy. Owns all the carts around the valley. Either you have to know where they are or ask him he'll tell you. Too bad they don't stay open after the bars it is perfect drunk food!
