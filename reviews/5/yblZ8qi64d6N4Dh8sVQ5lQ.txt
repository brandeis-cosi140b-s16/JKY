Go to robertos all the time and like this location so decided to give a good review. Its located inside the litle mini mart. Whenever I go the employees are always very nice and patient with me seeing as how I useually order about $30 worth of food off memory(dang my forgetfullness i.e. list) My order has never been once wrong which is very important due to hypersensitive eater towards onions in my family. So definately stop in if your craving some good tacos and the churros are worth a try :)
