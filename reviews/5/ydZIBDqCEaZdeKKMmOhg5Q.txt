I noticed Pancheros one day while I was driving, so my 8-year-old daughter and I checked it out Saturday night. We really liked the look of the place with lots of modern touches. The two working there that night, Thomas and Larissa (sorry if I spelled the names wrong!), were great! Thomas quickly greeted us as we came in, and was really helpful with it being our first time there. He had a great personality and was good with talking to my daughter and helping her with all of the options. She really liked watching the tortilla press!

Aside from the great service, we really liked the food as well! We ordered 2 chicken tacos, a cheese quesadilla, and a burrito with carnitas. Needless to say, with just the 2 of us, we took some to go...the burritos are HUGE!! It was actually the width of my daughter's shoulders...we measured!! haha

There were very few people in the restaurant while we were eating, so hopefully more people start trying it! We will definitely return!
