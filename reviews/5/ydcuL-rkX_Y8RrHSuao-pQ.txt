My wife and I recently tried Phab Phranks after reading reviews on yelp. All I can say is it was excellent from the food to the customer service. I tried the carne asada torte and it was delicious!! We loved it so much we went back the next day and I tried the chile relleno burrito and all I can say is YUMMY!!! I am telling all my friends, family and co workers about this gem in the desert!! Also reasonably priced for such quality!!
