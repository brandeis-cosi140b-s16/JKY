I almost didn't want to write this review because it seems to be a great hidden gem for Mexican food in CU. Every time I go there, we are seated promptly and it's never overcrowded, which is something I like about the place (if you've ever been to Dos Reales on a Friday night, you know what I mean). Lately, i've noticed it's popularity increasing significantly because there has been a lot more people in there with each trip I make. This leads me to believe that the great food, service and drinks are getting noticed, and I'm really happy about that. I really want this place to do well because it actually is really good.

I've been to Dos Reales, El Torro, Mas Amigos, and La Fiesta - and this beats them all. 

Every time I go, I order something different and have always been satisfied. The portions are good too. The chips and salsa are delicious and everyone at the table gets their own little salsa dish, which I love. The menu has a lot of dishes that you don't usually see, which is fun if you've gotten too familiar with the menus of other places in the area. And the prices are pretty much the same, if not slightly cheaper than other Mexican Restaurants.

And if you love Margaritas, then you'll love this place. They are strong, tasty, and thick! I would recommend asking for 2 straws. They are very dense and seem to last forever.

Also, the service here is top-notch. The wait staff is always, courteous, polite, and very helpful. And quick! I've never had to wait very long for a waiter, or my food. That may change as this place gets more popular, but I can't say that I would mind anyway. 

Five stars. My number one choice for Mexican.
