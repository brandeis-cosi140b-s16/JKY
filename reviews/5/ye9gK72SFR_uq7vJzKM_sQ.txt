One of the reasons why I love being Mexican we have some pretty bomb ass food! In this case "lonches" very traditional and common in Jalisco nothing compare to the ones out In Guadalajara but damn this is pretty close! It's a (hot) sandwich de pierna (pigs feet) very tender and soft. Made fresh to order and pretty darn good. Must try it.
