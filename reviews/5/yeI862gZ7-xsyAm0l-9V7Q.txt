I made reservations and arrived here with a large group of family in from out of town on a Friday night for a celebration, they had tables put together & had it set up very nice, in a very comfortable area. It was banquet style and we were allowed to bring in our own cake! We had such a wonderful private festival and the mariachi's stayed from one end of our table to the other! We would have paid a hefty price for banquet hall for the provisions we received it was A+ service! Oh yes, we all tipped them very well. They made it a picture perfect evening for us, it's nice to go somewhere that GREED is not on the menu!
