I love Roberto's and this one is right by my house, lucky for me it is one of the best ones I have been to. I tried Faustos (once), right across the street and it just does not compare to Roberto's. I am here at least once a week. Everything is good here; tamales, burritos, tacos. The refried beans are excellent, that's like the basis of judging a good mexican place, imho.
