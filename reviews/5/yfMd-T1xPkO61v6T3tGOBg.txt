Sunday brunch rules!

I don't know if you know this, but Cabo's has a Mexican sunday brunch for 12 dollars!  There is horchata and I think mango juice?  They have several pork, meat, and chicken dishes, fried fish, fried shrimp, french fries, rice pudding, pancakes, omlettes made to order, the list goes on.  The food is Fresh and Fantastic.
