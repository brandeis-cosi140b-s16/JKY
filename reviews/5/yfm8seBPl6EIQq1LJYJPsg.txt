My boyfriend and I have become regulars at this place because of how fun it is. It's casual, small, and the food is really tasty. I suggest the shrimp torta or the chicken tacos with rice and beans. Mmm-mmm. I'm considering going there now that I am writing this review!

It is a small place, so it may be ideal for groups of 4 or 5 or less. 

Don't be intimidated by the neighborhood/what it looks like outside, I'm sure you'll have a lot of fun at Los Picos! Happy eating!
