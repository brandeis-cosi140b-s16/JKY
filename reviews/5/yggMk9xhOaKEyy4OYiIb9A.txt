OK...I agree with Jessica M!! This place is AWESOME!!
I have been here multiple times with different parties and it has always been a hit! 
Lunch- Green Chili Stew and Lobster crescent  sandwich.
Dinner- YOU GOTTA TRY "Osso Bucco" it is a Pork Shank, (Not Lamb) on top of  a mound Jalapeno mashed potatoes. Guest we were with  had the 'Rack of Lamb' which they raved about! They're served separated, pick them up by the bone and eat like a plate of appetizers. 
Last time we were there, the 'Surf and Turf' was Rib eye and Marlin- WOW, I have never had Marlin before; this was prepared seared with a light crust- unbelievable! 
OH ya.. the serve a great 'after hours' menu from 10pm until 1am!!! 
If you are in Scottsdale, you have to stop by!
