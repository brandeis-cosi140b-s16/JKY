I was super hot from spending the past 4 hours on Camelback Mountain and I just wanted something light and fresh.  Rubio's delivered with the amazing Mango Habanero Mahi Mahi taco.  I just had one and it was filling enough post hike and just super fresh with the right amount of sweet from the mango and kick from the habanero.  My boyfriend enjoyed his, but says he will get the mango habanero next time - it was that good.
