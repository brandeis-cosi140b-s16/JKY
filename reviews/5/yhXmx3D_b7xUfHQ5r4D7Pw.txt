I love cocktail here. Enthusiastic bartender. Good place to make new friends. I love weekend condition when everyone sing, the good place for family  reunion  o coworkers meeting! Staffs in Mexican uniform look interesting. Even if I come alone, bartender always willing to chat with me when they're not too busy. About karaoke, customers can find song by themselves through internet, that's why I sang in Vietnamese and others customers they even courage me! I had so much fun here. Thanks
