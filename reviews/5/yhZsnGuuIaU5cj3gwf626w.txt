Dude. This is a solid place. Great surprise as I was getting my car worked on. I had a "Platillo" $9 with carnitas and corn tortillas, also came with rice, beans, grilled onions and choice of several fresh salsas (pico, tomatillo, corn, and a couple spicier harbanero options). The carnitas were flavorful, lean and moist. Guacamole was an extra 75 cents - totally worth it. 
Assembly line, so very quick. 

Sweet hochata with free refills. The fountain also had margaritas, frappes with other usuals. Bottled Mexican pops and cerveza also available. 

These guys take pride in their food and service. The dining area and restroom were clean and tidy. Do it.
