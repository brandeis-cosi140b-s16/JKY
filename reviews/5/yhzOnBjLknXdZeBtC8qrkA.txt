This place is MUCH better than the restaurants that were in its place before.  First of all, the complimentary chips come with 3 dips- 1 red salsa (roasted chipotle I believe), 1 green salsa (avocado and tomatillo- my fave!), and a simple bean dip.  All three are delicious!  I could have just that and a margarita and be set.  I ordered the chicken flautas with a side of guacamole.  The guacamole was simple (I hate when restaurants try to throw too much in there) and the flautas were crispy without being over done.  I drank a regular margarita and then I went ahead tried a coconut lime margarita since it sounded intriguing.  I was surprised at how good it was!  Not too sweet, but not bland either.  Surprisingly delicious!  I ate in the bar area and the food came out quickly.  The service and prices were great!
