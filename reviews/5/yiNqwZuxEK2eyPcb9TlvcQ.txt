This location and staff are wonderful.  The food prepared here was great.  I saw one individual wash his hands about seven times in the length of me at the end of the line to paying for our meal.  This location gets a lot of cater orders so be prepared to maybe wait a little longer than normal around lunch hours.  Otherwise it'll be smooth coasting.
