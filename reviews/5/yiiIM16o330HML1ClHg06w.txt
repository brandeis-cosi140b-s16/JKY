We had lunch here and we're quite pleased. Our server, Liz, greeted us promptly and brought water, chips, and a great warm salsa. They have a good selection of beers on tap and specialty margaritas. I had the chicken enchiladas with both red and green sauces. The  dark red was made with guarillo chillies a very special tasty sauce. My husband had a brisket torta also very good. His side dish was grilled potatoes and mine was charro beans. The sides were included. We each had a beer. The total came to$25 which we thought was fair for the quality. If you tried this place earlier and weren't pleased, give it another try! We'll try it for dinner next time.
