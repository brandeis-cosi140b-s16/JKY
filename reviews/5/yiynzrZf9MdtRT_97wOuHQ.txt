my girlfriend got a carne asada burrito here Sunday and I got to finish half of it.  sooooooooooooo yummy!!!  everything inside worked so well together, making my mouth very happy!

so I stopped there on my way home and got the ceviche (shrimp) tostada (only $3.50!!) and camerones ranchero (at $10.95 the most expensive thing on the menu).  
the ceviche was excellent!  a good sized serving, I would have been happy to pay $6-7 for it! 
the camerones ranchero was also a good sized serving with plenty of shrimp. very tasty.

they have a very large menu, including breakfast and desert items.  prices run pretty cheap.  burritos for $4.95 and tacos were around $1.50 each.

good + cheap + good portions + open 24/7 = 5 stars!
