I can't stop eating here.  The prices are cheap, the service is friendly and the food is OUTSTANDING.   All of their sauces are good, try them all.  This is traditional street food with some extras on the menu.  My favorites are the fish tacos, quesadilla with carna asada.  Don't skip on the horchata, possible the best in the Valley.   Do not be afraid of the exterior, once that taco hits your taste buds you will forget all about it.
