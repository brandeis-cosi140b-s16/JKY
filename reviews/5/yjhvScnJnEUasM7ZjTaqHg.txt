5 Stars for Roberto's on Flamingo and Rainbow!! We had a caterer scheduled for lunch today at work for Employee Appreciation Week who did a no call/no show, and I called Roberto's to see if they can make 90 tacos within a half hour.  They made three types of tacos within our requested time frame, packed them nicely and helped us load them in the car.  They were delicious! Thank you for saving the day!
