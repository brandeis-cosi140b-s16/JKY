somewhat similar to Filiberto's menu, but quality is much, much higher - went in for the first time today and a met a very satisfied customer who comes here a minimum of 4 times a week - owner is patient - she's also very nice & friendly - am planning on coming back often - I'm making it my goto Mex place (sorry Filiberto's) - in short, I strongly agree with the other very favorable Yelp reviews!
