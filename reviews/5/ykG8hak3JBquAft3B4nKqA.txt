For my boyfriend's birthday I wanted to find a great restaurant in Scottsdale that he hadn't been to, and that's nearly impossible. He loves Mexican and this was voted #1 in AZ. So I called a couple of weeks in advance for reservations and the chef said he would create a special coconut rum cake for the occasion (not a normal menu item). It was really wonderful tasting and the birthday boy was pleasantly surprised to see his favorite cake with beautiful decor and writing on it. 

We started at the tequila bar before dinner; La Hacienda has more than 200 tequila varieties so Evan had a margarita with a suggested tequila which was really smooth. I had the watermelon margarita off the menu which I also loved. We ordered the table side guacamole which rivaled the best guac I have tried, with fresh chips and salsa that is just the perfect amount of heat. Wow, this place sure does know their stuff. They also have a sampling of all 5 of their guacs which we will have to come back and try.

We were seated at our table and our guac was relocated for us, so we moved onto dinner. The Costilla des Res (beef short rib) entree and the crab enchiladas were both extraordinary. The Costilla you didn't even have to cut and they had a sweet glaze. The crab enchiladas were hearty and just as tasty.

To accompany the surprise cake we shared the flaming coffee which is literally a flaming tableside show with 1921 (Mexican spirit), coffee and lots of cinnamon; topped off with homemade whipped cream and chocolate shavings. I actually HATE hot alcohol but this was the first time I have been able to drink one. You couldn't taste a trace of alcohol. 

Including the custom cake, total bill between the bar and meal was $185 after tax and tip. Worth every penny.
