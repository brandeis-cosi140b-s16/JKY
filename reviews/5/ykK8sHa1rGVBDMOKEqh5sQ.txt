i love to eat and drink here. really good food, great prices, with super adorable, friendly waitstaff and bartenders who whip up delicious concoctions.   try the charred steak or salmon bowl with brown rice and stewed beans - half of it will fill you up. large portions, wonderful garden patio, and monday night's tacos are a steal. visited a couple dozen times, it's my favorite spot!
