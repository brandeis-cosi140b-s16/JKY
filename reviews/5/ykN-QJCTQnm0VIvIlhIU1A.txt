Rito's gots the Best Burritos, hands down!! 

I ordered the green on green burrito. It was soooo gooood!!! I feel like a stuffed burrito now. But these burritos are as good as they look, and the taste is like your over at Nana's house for some homemade real Mexican food!! This will be the spot I run to when I'm feeling a saucy, cheesy, flavorful burrito. 

The only thing I gotta say is, since the only spot to sit was outside on their patio with no shade, we kept dodging the neighborhood bee who kept stopping by at our table since we had open can sodas. Maybe next time we'll be smart like the other table sitting next to us and bring our own sodas, lids and all.
