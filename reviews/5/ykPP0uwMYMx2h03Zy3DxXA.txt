My wife and I had lunch at Las Glorias for the first time yesterday. Visiting this wonderful restaurant is like visiting Rocky Point Mexico, only the food is even better here!  I ordered the Camaron Relleno's (bacon wrapped shrimp) with cheese, and I have never had better. The meal came with refried beans and salad, and the shrimp were served on a bed of french fries.  My wife ordered the fresh shrimp cocktail with calamari, and it was fantastica!  The restaurant was very clean, the service was great, and the friendly owner (Ruth) even visited our table to be sure that we were happy with our meal.  The beautiful murals on the walls give the restaurant a nice Baja kinda feeling.  We can't wait to get back to Las Glorias and try some of the other dishes.
