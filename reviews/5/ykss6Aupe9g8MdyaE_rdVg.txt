I've been to the Cental Ave location a couple times and thought it was pretty good, but I had an awesome meal at my first visit at this new location so I thought I'd share.

I was very impressed with my meal and service at this location. It could very well be the best plate of mexican cuisine I've had. The staff was friendly in this new location which also brings quite a better parking situation and more seating than the Central Ave location.
