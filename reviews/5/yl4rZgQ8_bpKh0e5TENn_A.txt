I usually try to avoid eating at Gas Stations if I can at all avoid it. Usually the fair consists of greasy chips, slush puppies, and questionable hot dogs...not really my scene. So when Brian V. suggested we check out Roberto's in the Shell Station I was a bit concerned...apparently Guy Fieri speaks to him in his sleep and tells him where to go and what to do. 

Once inside my concern was replaced with extreme happiness. Wow, is this food great!!! Forest W. and I had cheese enchiladas...good quality cheese, delicious sauce, fluffy rice and amazing lard filled beans! Brian had the chimichanga and a carne asada taco. I stole some of his steak and it was tender, flavorful and just plain awesome. We were stuffed little piggies for about $25. It was seriously worth the trip out there and I am looking forward to going back for more!!!
