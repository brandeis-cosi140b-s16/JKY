I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place.  I was a little hesitant because I am picky about my food...and well, especially because I am Mexican and restaurant food is too gringo for me!  BUT-This place is insaaaaane.  The salsa was AWESOME.  Guacamole...AWESOME.  I am VERY particular about my rice because many restaurants cannot make rice that is acceptable.  Here at El Rico's?  AWESOME.  The beans are hands down phenomenal to boot.  I ordered the soft tacos and tamales and well, they reminded me of home.  

Incidentally, the wait on a weekend is a simple 20 or 30 minutes...but WORTH IT.  The staff is friendly and the patio divine.  

My advice:Give it a go.  If not...yay!  More for me and less of a wait!!
