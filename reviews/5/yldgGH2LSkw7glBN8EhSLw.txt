One of the best restaurants I have been to in a while! I was curious about this place. I am so glad I decided to stop in! The ambience in this restaurant is amazing, the food was delicious and the service was great! It was my first time here tonight and the owner greeted me an made me feel welcome! If you are wondering about New Mexican cuisine, this restaurant and bar is a must! I had the New Mexican Traditional burrito filled with carne adovado plate Chimanga style with red enchilada sauce over top with a side of pinto beans and calabacitas (Mexican squash and chiles salad). I was blown away by the flavor! There is a common misconception that New Mexican food is too hot, however I was pleasantly surprised at how the fresh ingredients and heat married to make such a great dish! The pinto beans on the side were fresh and I could tell that they had been cooked that day. For dessert I tried the fried ice cream and had to stop myself from finishing the entire portion! Be sure to try this place. I am definitely going back another night with my friends to experience the tequila bar, that's right, tequila bar! There is a huge wall and selection of tequilas! I highly recommend you try this place!
