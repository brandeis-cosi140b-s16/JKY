Just back from our second visit.  Serrano's is a wonderfully small, cheery, friendly, tasty neighborhood spot that would be really easy to miss in its otherwise seemingly abandoned shopping center. Do not, however, miss it: This place is the consummate local small business--the antithesis of the corporate, identical-from-coast-to-coast, mass-produced chain restaurant. It's a pleasure to be able to eat a delicious, inexpensive meal here while simultaneously knowing that you're truly supporting the local economy.
