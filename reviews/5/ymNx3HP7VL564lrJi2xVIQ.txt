This El Pollo Loco is always clean, with friendly customer service as well as fast and efficient. The food is always hot and delicious. The restrooms are clean and stocked. The wait for the food once it is ordered is very minimal. The workers take pride in their job as its not easy to work in fast food; too often they are given negative feed back instead of positive. I would recommend going to this location if in the area or if you live nearby, as you won't be disappointed. ****We usually order the family meal and it is so yummy. El Pollo Loco knows how to season their chicken :)
