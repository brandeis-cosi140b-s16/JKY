By far the best Mexican food in Charlotte! The prices are so reasonable and the portions are always on the more than you can eat in one sitting proportion. They make non menu listed items upon request with no issues. The best non menu item is the Tamale Deluxe plate. It comes with everything and cost next to nothing. You can dine in or eat outside, it is not formal and not fancy just simply awesomeness. See you there this evening!
