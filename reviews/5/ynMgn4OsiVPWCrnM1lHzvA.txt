I have been coming to Texanos since my freshman year at ASU, four years later I still love it! Its open 24/7 which is real convenient after late nights out on Mill. The staff is extremely nice and friendly also! I recommend the Carne Asada burrito (under 5 bucks) or the Juevos Ranchera. Much better then filabertos!
