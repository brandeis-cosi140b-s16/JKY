Yelp is becoming especially useful.  Traveling to Vegas can have one spending a lot of money on relatively mediocre food.  It is quite easy to make a lot of bad food choices on the Strip, and one can be outright clueless about what lies off of the Strip.  With Yelp though, I can actually find out about all of the amazing places in the city from people who actually live there.  I am indebted to locals for finding out about the Pinball Hall of Fame.  More so, I am indebted to them for finding out about Taqueria Los Parados which serves some of the best tacos I have ever had.  Seriously delicious!  

For a jaw dropping $3.85, I was able to have 3 tacos and freshly made horchata.  That horchata was just lovely.  The tacos, even more so with all of the supremely fresh ingredients which included diced onions, cilantro, fresh lime juice, and the like.  I had the carne asada, carnitas, and the lengua and was at a loss to say which one I liked the best.  The salsa bar included three different flavored salsas which were not too shy about the heat -- I was in heaven.  Be prepared to order in Spanish, and be prepared for an amazing meal at an incredible price.  Highly recommend.
