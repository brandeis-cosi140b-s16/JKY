Boy, do I miss the salsa here!!! Actually, I really miss all of the food here.
I didn't discover Azteca until my last year of college when I moved to the Northlake area.

This was a frequent dine-in and take-out spot for me. The salsa was always on point with lots of cilantro and onions. I actually try to base my own homemade salsa on the salsa here. It's just that good!

The cheese enchilada has always been good here as well as the beans.
Everything here just always tastes fresh.

They also have massive burritos I've seen my friends order.

This is one of my favorite restaurants overall in the Charlotte area. It's also less gringo than some of the places in University.
