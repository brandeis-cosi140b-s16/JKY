One of the best, upscale mexican food places in the city! Inventive and amazing flavors.  Went for lunch today and had the Cochinita pabil (sp?) torta and wife had the carne asada tacos with salad. Portions were generous and the service was good. If you want the same old same old, go to macayos for gringo sonoran food.
