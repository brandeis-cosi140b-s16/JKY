Sill love this place.  I had a pollo burrito and the pollo was amazing in taste and everything was prepared as requested.

I cannot say enough about this place, the food is awesome, the price is right and this is a place I will continue to support as often as possible.  I love it for a quick snack or a complete meal, either way its amazing.
