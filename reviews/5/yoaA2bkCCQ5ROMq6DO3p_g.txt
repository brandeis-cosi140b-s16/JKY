This is a terrific restaurant.  Good food and atmosphere.  Service is also good....especially Dan.  My only criticism is that the staff is not always clear on what items are vegetarian.  I've dined there on several occasions with vegetarians and the wait staff doesn't always know if items like rice or sauces are made with chicken stock.  Fortunately the manager is vegetarian and was very kind when rice, made with chicken stock, was served to a vegetarian diner.  Otherwise, I highly recommend Spotted Donkey!
