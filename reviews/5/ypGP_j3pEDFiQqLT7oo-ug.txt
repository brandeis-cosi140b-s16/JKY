It is tragic that Sabor closed. This was a gem. I'm heartbroken.

This is one of the best restaurants in Vegas.

That's a big thing to say but I mean it. If you don't eat here as often as you can, and if you love food, you are missing out on one of the most amazing gustatory experiences to be found in this city, and that includes all of those ridiculously priced restaurants on The Strip.

Yes, it might be far away from you, but wouldn't you drive for 20-30 minutes for one of the best meals of your entire life? Shouldn't you drive that far?

I've had lunch and dinner here. The only thing that didn't work for me was the "watermelon and pumpkin seed salad." But everything else was "curl your toes yummy!" The soups, the cactus salad, the scallops (OMFG), the mango shrimp (ditto), this is one of the foodgasm swoonilicious restaurants in Vegas. I could eat here every day, twice a day, and be happy.

Joel Robuchon has nothing on the chef at Sabor. (Hahaha! I think I'm serious!) Even if you don't like Mexican food, you've still got to go. It ain't your mama's Mexican food! And with the Yelp special, this place is a steal.

Be aware that they are currently only open for lunch on Fri/Sat.
