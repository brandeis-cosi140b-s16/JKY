I love this place! So good and such a variety! I always get the three taco combo- each is a little different and hits the spot! Plus they have amazing happy hour- $2 tacos & $1 chips- can't beat that! It's little corner restaurants like this that make a quick bite out so awesome! The staff is always super friendly too!
