This place has jumped to number one on my Phoenix taco list.  For real, OMG, we got a Groupon and decided to redeem it today.  The salsa bar... it's freaking amazing (strawberry, chipotle/pecan, cilantro crema, and many others).  Don't even get me started on the horchata.  I had NOTHING bad, or even average here, it was all amazing.  Cute, trendy/rustic decor, and the food is outstanding.  The mole was so smokey and rich and flavorful and the Mayan cochinita pibil taco was so tangy and tender.  Seriously, I ate until I literally could eat no more.  America's used to be my go-to for cheap tacos a la carte, but this place has edged firmly into first place.
