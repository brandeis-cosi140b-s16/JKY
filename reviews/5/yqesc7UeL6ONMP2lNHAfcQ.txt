Juan and his phenomenal staff catered our wedding for 125 guests with amazing, delicious Mexican and Asian food! The food was hot when the buffet line opened and the flavors just as good as in the restaurant. The food was so reasonably priced (under $2000) and all our guests raved about how good it was. The owner Juan is the most kind and patient man. He was easy to stay in touch with  and helped along the way, even helping to calm this nervous bride :) He was NEVER pushy about selling us what we didn't need or didn't want. He made sure to support us in all our decisions and helped us make sure there was more than enough food for our guests to enjoy. His staff was even willing to help cut all our cake for the reception. They go above and beyond any other restaurant in regard to affordability, flavor, kindness, and professionalism. I encourage any bride who want DELICIOUS, affordable food to call Juan and the international house of food, they made our wedding so special!!! Thanks to Juan and all your wonderful staff!!!! We can't thank you enough!!!
