I was so impressed with all the deliciousness that Gallo Blanco at the Clarendon offered!!! I loved everything that went into my mouth at this place--all the uniquely tasting foods and drinks sent my taste buds into a wild exotic splendor!    
Being a  vegetarian makes it challenging to find items that can satisfy besides the common veggies and salad... But WOW that corn on the cobb--I've never had corn that tasted so good--roasted with crumbled Mexican cheese and sprinkled with paprika...mmm mmm good! 
I also loved their guacamole with mandarin oranges, probably the best guacamole I've ever had in my life!!!
The Cheese Crisp... okay they warned me that this wasn't a typical cheese crisp-- it came out looking like a large orange crispy cheese cone!  With no tortilla!  Just cheese that was crisped w/ a side of delicious garlic aoli to dip it in!
The Manchego Salad--Very good... very different... very yum for a veggie head! The homemade ranch dressing was outstanding!
The Agua Fresca--Also outstanding!  I've never had water that tasted so good!  They told me they make different melon infused water fresh every day--what a treat!  I had the honeydew agua fresca and it was probably the most refreshing thing I've ever had!  I'm looking forward to trying the watermelon next!

I will most definitely be back to Gallo Blanco Cafe in the very near future!  This is my new favorite restaurant in Phoenix right now! I've already been sending many people there!  Looking forward to trying the veggie tacos next! 

Gallo Blanco had it all, awesome food, amazing staff and chill atmosphere... Five very big stars in my book!
