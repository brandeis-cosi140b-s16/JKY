If you have never been here THEN GET YOURSELF THERE NOW!!! parking is weird and very busy street but I would throw my truck in the middle of the street just to eat here. Not Dirt cheap but not at all pricey, and service is awesome!! Went with pastor and Carne asada tacos! chips and salsa were awesome too! Sad THAT ISN'T ANY RICE!! BUT GREAT BEANS! Then we grabbed one of America's corns to go...  awwww everything was awesome! the sweet taste of the Pastor was sooooo perfect. PASTOR FOR LIFE!!! AND there is a cool squirrel outside that they have yet to name!!!!
