CC Sizzle on a sopapilla was awesome.  Like a super flavorful puffy taco.  The wife had the chicken tacos and mentioned the fresh tasting corn tortillas.  We also got a cheese quesadilla and chips and salsa.  Everything was fantastic. 

Also, the guy and lady working there were super nice and polite the whole time, major points for that.  I'll be returning.
