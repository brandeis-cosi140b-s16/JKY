Had a great time first time eating here the hostess was very nice and sat us at the table. I love to see how management is so involved with the patrons. Sean the manager ask us how everything was and checked up on us. The service was excellent especially since I was a little nervous that it was going to be in a strip club when I saw the place. I loved the all you can taco special they have.
