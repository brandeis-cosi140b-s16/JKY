This was my first place going into this place, the guys I work with recommended it. Didn't take me long to find it, with its bright colored windows advertising $1 tacos and delicious burritos. I walked in and was greeted right away, they had a wide array of meats and freshly made Aqua fresca. I ordered the Cuban sandwich, and was very pleased by the size. I was able to watch the cook prepare it, from toasting the bread on the flat top stove to placing the eggs, cheese and variety of meats on the bread. It was like dinner and a show I guess in this case lunch and a show. When I got to take that first bite it was the most amazing thing ever, I got a perfect blend of everything. I will definitely be going back and will recommend friends try this amazing place out.
