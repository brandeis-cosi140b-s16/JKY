5 stars for a drive through Mexican food joint?? Eff yes.

 Basing this solely on the type of restaurant they are, Los Betos is pretty damn good (and affordable too). Monster burritos, cooked up and delivered in the drive through at record breaking pace along with some killer red salsa.

I love Los Betos for their quick and easy way of getting me a delicious breakfast burrito on the go when all you really want in the morning (or late at night - they're open 24 hours) is a tasty gut bomb that is Mexican fast food.
