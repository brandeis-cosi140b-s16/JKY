Seafood/Fish is a food I'm trying to eat more of.  I recently had family in town and a cousin of mine that lives here recommended this place to my brother-in-law.  So we drove to the Mariscos Las Islitas on North Pecos.  It is located in the Town Square shopping plaza.  I wasn't sure what to expect but since I was trying to discover seafood I figured what the heck.  

I was blown away not only by the portions but by how delicious the fish was.  I had the grilled salmon.  The menu confused me a bit.  I thought I had ordered something else but was so glad I got what I did.  The fish was tender and the grilled parts of the fish added that fresh grilled taste from a bbq grill.  It was accompanied with rice with veggies mixed in (sooo good) and with steamed vegetables.  I couldn't eat it all so I brought the rest home.  I have been craving more fish since then.  

The only thing I didn't care for was the guys (musicians) looking to perform while you ate.  Once you tell them no thank you they leave you alone.  Not a deal breaker to have them there I just don't care for it.  The prices may be a little intimidating.  I paid $15.00 for my grilled salmon.  While a bit on the pricey side for my range I was ok with it since I thoroughly enjoyed my meal.

The staff is super friendly. I can't wait to go back.
