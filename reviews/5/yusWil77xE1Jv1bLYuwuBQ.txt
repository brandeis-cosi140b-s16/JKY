This place is awesome!  Truly one of the best Seafood Mexican restaurants I have ever been to.  The ambience, food, customer service is all top notch.  I have been  at MPH over 5 times and always been impressed.  I have tried various dishes from fish, fajitas, and tacos.  They have great sauces and everything is homemade.  I highly recommend this establishment for a good meal and truly authetic.  A+ all across the board.
