We had the al pastor taco , tongue taco and carne asada quesadilla . The al pastor taco was very good, the best al pastor I've had yet.
        Carne  asada quesadilla  good grilled flavor and tender .    The tongue taco was very tender and moist but lacked flavor , maybe some seasoning would make it perfect, with the well stocked  condiment bar( salsas, jalape√±o , diced onion and cilantro and lime ) making your food taste the way you want it is not a problem . 
       Like a previous yelper said they call out your order # in Spanish and I figured no problem ,I can count to 10 in Spanish and since the restaurant  just opened and we were customer dos no problemo, wrong your # is your receipt # and it's five digits so I can see the problem if you don't speak Spanish . Food is cheap and very good my kind of place.
