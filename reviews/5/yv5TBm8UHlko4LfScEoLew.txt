I have been a fan of this place for over 5 years and I will keep coming back because the food is really tasty, and the service is quick!

This hole in the wall is the craziest fusion of mexican and chinese food you have ever seen. Jade Red Chicken Burrito?? Jerk Chicken tacos?? Your favorites Pork fried rice and white rice with black beans?! This place is always a conversation when I wear my shirt I bought there with their mascot a cartoon mexican bandit panda. Don't believe me? They have a solid stone version that stands 5 feet tall right in the restaurant. 

You can customize your dishes each time you come in and you aren't sure they have taste dishes so you can see what fusions you want to create. Their dinning area is long tables and family set smaller ones with plenty of chairs to go around. Paintings of Pandas and classic south western style covers the walls. Best part the staff is clean and quick even in the longest lines. And its always busy there.  Great place for families and friends to sit down enjoy food and have a complementary cookie for dessert.

Place is so great I just might go there today for lunch.
