I stumbled across this place based on a recommendation while in Phoenix with my softball team.

I can honestly say this was some of the best Mexican food I have had in years!!!!!  I will definitely be coming back here next visit.

I really can't say enough good about this place.  It was awesome!

They completely hooked us up too.  22 people ate, with multiple desserts and appetizers for only $250!!!  I couldn't believe how cheap this place was.
