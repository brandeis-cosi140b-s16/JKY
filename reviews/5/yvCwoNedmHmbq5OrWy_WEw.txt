So my girlfriend who is a sales rep for a cell phone company and calls on Apache Junction. She tells me about this little mexican joint that is off the hook. I'm thinking off the hook and AJ don't usually go together. Until now.

Los Tacos was worth the drive from South Phoenix. Let me start by saying it's hands down the cleanest mexican restaurant I've EVER seen. I thought they just opened but the owner said they've been open 3 years. 

The food is great and the carne asada was the best I've had in a long time. Excellent beef and chicken tacos especially the hard shells.

Overall, excellent food, great service from the owner. It's evident she cares about her customers. Los Tacos is a must try if you are in AJ or if you want to make a drive for  some great mexican food.
