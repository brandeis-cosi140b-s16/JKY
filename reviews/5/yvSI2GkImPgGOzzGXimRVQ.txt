Still my favorite burrito place! I love the steak burrito with their smoked chipotle Tabasco sauce. They are always making sure that the customer is happy. We were in this location last night and it was a bit slow, but nothing to complain about. The cashier apologized and gave us a buy one get one card. I will continue to go to places that care about the customer so much.
