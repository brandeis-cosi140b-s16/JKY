I am a fan! So I stopped by Mexquite the other day to try something new and what a treat! Me and my wife ordered the torta, a burrito, and a quesadilla (I know its alot) and they were all AMAZING.. The best part is we were able to crush a few beers with the meal and all of it was so cheap! Charlotte needs more places like this!! What a find!
