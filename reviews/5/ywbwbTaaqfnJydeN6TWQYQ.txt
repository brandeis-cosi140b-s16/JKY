This place was amazing! I saw this rated good here on Yelp and decided to give it a try. When we showed up it was a little hard to find hidden in this little shopping center, and it's appearance didn't make it looks too good, but the food was amazing. The service was so nice. The guys running it were helpful, kind, and enjoyed small talk. It was a great place to grab something quick to fill you up for days lol. Highly recommend If your looking for something quick and tasty!
