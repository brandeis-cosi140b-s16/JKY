I am very picky with my Mexican. I have to say that this is the best green chili bean and beef burrito I have ever eaten. The attention to detail and how they prepare than meat...  there's no fat or sinew in the meat. The seasoning of the meat and the beans are great and compliment the green chili sauce. The green chili sauce is simply the best green chili sauce I have ever eaten. Don't let the fact that it's a hole in the wall scare you away.
