This place is just amazing!!!! Their chorizo burrito is hands down the best in the Valley!!! The chicken flautas are hand rolled and awesome. The beans have the perfect amount of saltiness... And the rice is moist just like it should be. The tomatillo salsa is amazing with a great flavor...and the guacamole is sooooo good!!! You wi not be disappointed trying Camineros!!!!
