We are in Las Vegas from Lake Havasu City, Arizona for just two days & nites & know how to avoid the expensive & useless restaurants.  The Los Tacos sign stood out from the zip down Charleston & we popped a 'U'ie to give it a try.  We are astounded by the size of a 'junior' beef burrito!  We will try the Sahara location next trip!  Great beef burritos & the bride loves the bean burrito!  Great value, great service, clean place!  We recommend that in spite of order counter & drive through options, this is NOT really fast food but very good food!
