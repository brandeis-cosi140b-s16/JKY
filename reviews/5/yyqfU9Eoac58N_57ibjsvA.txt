I probably eat at Revo Burrito atleast once a month! This place is my favorite quick lunch spot! I have tried a couple different items on the menu and I'm always blown away but the flavor.  In addition to all their amazing menu items the creamy rice with corn is my favorite! Definately try the creamy rice with corn, and don't plan on sharing!
