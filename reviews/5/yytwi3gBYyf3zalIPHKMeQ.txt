In my humble opinion( Not really, after trying tons of Mexican restaurants), I think this restaurant is the best value considering taste, price, and authenticity. I really have tried tons of Mexican Restaurant, but when I am craving cheap and OUTSTANDING Mexican food, I always end up back at Los Molcajetes. What makes them so great? 
REAL MEXICAN FOOD. I am very picky about Mexican as I am Mexican and it takes a lot for me to go out and buy Food that I can otherwise have at home. The taste is exceptional, service is fantastic, and price is just great.  Me and my gf where there on Jan 1st and this what we had: 
has 
1) 6 oysters with Shrimp Ceviche 
2) Carne Asada Torta 
3) Wet Burrito with Salad
4) 2 Drinks
5) Chips and Salsa( twice) 
6) Cheese Cake Burrito 

TOTAL: 24 bucks! 

We will definitely stop by again sometime soon! 

Oh and THEY NOW TAKE Credit Cards!
