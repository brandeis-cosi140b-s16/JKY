While I've never been disappointed by any Rubio's location, this is by far my favorite.  The staff here is amazing.  They provide exceptional service and are always very helpful with any questions I may have.  The food is always good.  Perfect size portions (not too small or too big), great variety, and a great salsa bar. 

If you are looking for a good place to eat at a reasonable price, this is the place to go.
