There are many places in the valley and its surrounding cities to eat Mexican food; however, there is one and only La Canasta.

In the last two years the boyfriend and I have eaten at this restaurant location quite often. For the money, you get exactly what you pay for: a decent meal and generous portions.

The chips and salsa are ever-flowing and the salsa is some of the best I've tasted.

The wait staff are generally pleasant, attentive and very accommodating. Plus they frequently recall what you had during your previous visits. I recommend you try the Machaca dinner or my boyfriend's favorite dish, the number 5 lunch special.

There are multiple locations in the valley, but this one beats them all hands down.
