This is my favorite Mexican Grill, I can eat there everyday. Love their Margaritas, their salsa is out of this world, and I know salsa lol. My only complain is how fast the food comes out. I have talked to them so many times about that until I gave up and designed my own system to ordering. If you order a bar drink, soup and dinner, they all basically come out together. I understand it's a corporate restaurant and they like to flip their tables in appx 1/2 but gosh, if people can relax and order drinks and enjoy the evening they would make more money. Now I order the drinks period, when we're done drinking we order soup (their tortilla soup is a must) when they bring the soup we order the dinner.
