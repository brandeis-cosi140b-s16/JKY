We have just died and found our new favorite, heavenly hamburger joint.  Their standard burger is picture perfect and even more perfectly delicious. Stand sauce is the bomb. Their French fries are magnificent... And they make them in house of course :) if you're lucky and the heavens are Smiling down on you... you'll find a potato end that is fried up like a golden nugget in the mix. You can't help but smile while you eat!  The staff is so incredibly cheerful and pleasant... Making sure everything is clean and orderly around the small restaurant.  Even when it was busy, the staff seamlessly acknowledged every guest walking in and out, without skipping a beat for the existing patrons.  The patio is adorable and intimate. Bike racks in front for the neighborhood peeps like us, but a decent size parking lot out back for the rest. No fear if your in a hurry... They have drive thru !  Such a wonderful find in the neighborhood ! GO! RUN! EAT AT THE STAND !!!!  #yourewelcome
