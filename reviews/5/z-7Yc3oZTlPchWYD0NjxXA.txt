My coworkers favorite place to eat is Rubio's so I stopped in really quick to get a gift card. I think it was around 3pm on a Monday so it wasn't super busy and as soon as I walked in I was told hello and a few employees seemed to be multitasking. I was imeadiately helped with a pleasant smile, got my gc and ran out. It was just very nice to see everyone genuinely smiling. So many times, even at resturants where you are seated and served, employees always seem grumpy like I'm bothering them by being a patron there. Not the case with this Rubio's, even when I just ran in for a gift card. Thank you for being so nice, it's refreshing! :-)
