So my first visit to Container Park was oh-so-magical.  The fire-breathing praying mantis, the adult slide, the cozy feel.  Sit upstairs for a view - they'll bring the food up there. -:)

Their asada taco and margarita are the two things I keep coming back for.  They let their meat marinate in something oh-so-tasty and it's always so tender & flavorful.

It may be a little pricier than average but not only is it Downtown it's also in Container Park, so that doesn't really matter to me.  I get great food, great drinks and a great view.
