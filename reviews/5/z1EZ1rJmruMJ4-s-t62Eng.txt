My boyfriend and I are definitely huge fans of this restaurant.  This place is FANTASTIC!  Boyfriend and I have been here twice and each time, we order different entrees and everything was wonderful!  The last time I was there, I ordered the scallops.  They were delicious and just melted in my mouth. Boyfriend ordered the tacos.  I'm usually not a huge taco fan but I tried them and they were awesome!  The tacos had a little cilantro/lime kick to them and were really the best tasting tacos I've ever had.   I also had the New York strip steak the first time that I went and it was also cooked to perfection and really hit the spot. The service was also excellent.  

The restaurant design from the outside doesn't look inviting but the interior of the restaurant is beautiful. There are not a lot of cars parked both times we went but that's because they only opened in 2010 and not a lot of people know what kind of hidden gem this place really is. My only advice is don't not try this place just because you don't think the menu looks good or the outside doesn't look good. Just give it a try, you'll be pleasantly surprised....the food is EXCELLENT.
