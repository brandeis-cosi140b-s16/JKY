Amazing customer service !! the staffs are super friendly !
They have 2 sizes of burritos,regular or large and you can choose white,whole wheat or spinach tortillas.
I had the regular burrito with spinach tortillas and fire cracker chicken. They also have a diablo sauce for spicy lovers! It is savory and spot on ! 
The burrito is delicioso! The ingredients are very fresh unlike the franchise places. 
Awesome experience can't wait to go back !!!
