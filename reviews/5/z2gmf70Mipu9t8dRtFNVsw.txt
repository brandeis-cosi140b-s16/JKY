Love love love Zabas!! It's so deliciously fresh! I usually always get the fish tacos. Those are my absolute favorite! They are so yummy! Last night I tried the surf, turf, and cluck burrito bowl. It was so delicious too! It has shrimp, chicken, and steak in it with rice, avocado, lettuce, beans, salsa. I thought it was so fantastic! My husband always gets the surf, turf, and cluck burrito. The burritos are way too huge for me. Their about as big as my arm, lol. 
This is one of my favorite places to eat in town. Definitely a place to try if you're looking for a good little Mexican spot!
