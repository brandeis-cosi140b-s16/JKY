It's so funny reading all the reviews about del taco because...well IT'S DEL TACO! I'm stationed down in sierra vista where we only have taco bell....which SUCKS!!!!! and if any of you reading this knows where that is, no need to feel sorry for this guy because I will be moving up here in a few months. Literally everytime I visit Phoenix i stop at this del taco because it's close to where I stay. There food really must have crack in it because I can't stay away from this place everytime I come up.

Del taco in general is always clean. The staff is kinda slow at this one but it's Sunday and everyone is at brunch/church whatever lol.  All in all thank god for del taco, and there delicious big fat chicken tacos!!
