Come for brunch, and come hungry. AYCE brunch items for $35, and 15% discount for locals. And, it's all small plates, so you can order one of everything if there are a few of you. 

There is something for everyone: savory, sweet, boozy, whatever. I won't go item for item since the menu is constantly changing, but we had our post-wedding brunch here, and everyone left happy -- from foodies to folks who associate "Mexican food" with Chi-Chi's.

Sit outside by the pool. I haven't found a better brunch spot in Vegas. They were insanely helpful with the group for the wedding, and service is always on point.

They appear to have done away with their bacon bloody mary, which if true would be tragic, but I'm sure they can recommend a suitable substitute. For brunch, this gets my highest marks.
