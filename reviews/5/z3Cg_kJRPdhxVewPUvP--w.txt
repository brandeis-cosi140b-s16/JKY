Fantastic! Don't let the idea of shack turn you off, may look run down from the outside but the food and the employees are far from it. All the employees have an excellent energy about them. The red sauce is better then Los'. The California burrito is excellent with juicy freshly cooked steak. Will be back for round two for Connies favorite! Thanks shack.
