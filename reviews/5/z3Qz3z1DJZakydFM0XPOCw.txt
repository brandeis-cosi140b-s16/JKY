Love this place! Such a cool and unique atmosphere in a city full of Mexican restaurants. They have s great waiting area for when there is a rush, and provide chips and salsa for you while you wait. Drinks are pricey but FANTASTIC I got the cucumber mint fresca and it was amazing. My fianc√© got the strawberry fresca and he liked his as well. I would stick to ordering the tacos on the menu, the standard and crunchy fish were our groups favorites. Best appetizer is the guacamole, it's handmade and very tasty! I wasn't a huge fan of the salsa they give with the chips, but you can order a different kind for 2 dollars so it's not too bad. Service is usually very friendly and very low key which is nice. The valet parking truly is complementary which is nice in a city where parking sucks. We're more likely to visit the gilbert location since we are in the east valley but if we lived closer we would come back frequently for sure!
