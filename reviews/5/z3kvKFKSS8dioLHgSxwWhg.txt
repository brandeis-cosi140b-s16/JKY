My wife and I had visted border grill and tried a few of the items on the menu the ceviche was very tasty but my favorite item for sure was the beef brisket flautas probably would order them by themselves and nothing else they were that good! I forget the margarita that I had but it was delicious I would definitely recommend this restaurant to any of my friends visiting out of town who would like an atmosphere that is more intimate yet still right in the heart of the strip I will definitely be visiting again soon!
