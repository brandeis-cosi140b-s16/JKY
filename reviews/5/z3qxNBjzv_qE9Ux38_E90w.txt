Breakfast burritos top my list of omg cravings. First bite of the machaca breakfast burrito with potatoes and cheese made me pick up the phone and call my husband; he then endured five minutes of me telling him how much he would love it. Burrito was huge, tortilla sublime, guacamole salsa noms. Will be going there again.
