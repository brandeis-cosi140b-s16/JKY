I have been on a burrito bonanza as of late, and Burrito Drive is everything I want and more. It's a small, little location that can easily be overlooked by the great offerings of Willy Street, but this establishment doesn't need to please aesthetically. The food speaks for itself.

My go-to: the Sheh-meh-neh Burrito. At first, I was skeptical that sweet potato puree in a burrito would be a good idea, but I am now the biggest fan. The queso fresco and pickled veggies make this an odd-sounding burrito, but it's what you never knew you wanted Combine all that with the salsa, and I'm always happy.

I would say that Burrito Drive has the best burritos in Madison. If you're ever in the area and want a casual meal, or if you're thinking of a night in, this is the place for you.

Side note: All the burritos are good if you're not feeling that adventurous.
