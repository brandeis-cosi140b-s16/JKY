This place is awesome!  The food is always delicious and incredibly fresh.  Their chili rellenos are have a unique twist that really made them stand out for me.  The horchata is home made and very good.  Actually, everything appears to be home made right there when you order.  The service is always great, and the other reviewer was right - Paul (the guy at the counter) is really cute and very nice!
