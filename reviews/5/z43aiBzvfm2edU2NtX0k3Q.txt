Barrio Urbano is fabulous!  Had lunch there (today is their Day 3!) with two colleagues who had each made New Years resolutions to try new foods.  We all loved our lunches!   The atmosphere is funky and welcoming.   The menu is chef-driven and different from any other Mexican restaurant in the Valley.  The food is fresh, colorful, creative (who can resist "breakfast 'til 3?!!) and -- most of all -- delicious.  

Are you still reading this?? You should be on your way there already!!!!!  Enjoy!
