Originally, I am from San Diego and so I know some really fantastic Baja style Mexican food when I taste it (not just see it).  Now, I know that I now live in the Sonoran Mexican food area and I won't find my beloved Baja style easily in this state.  But, let me just say this...after trying about 10 places around Phoenix, I have finally found a place that is almost as delicious as SD style food!  Their Machaca burritos actually have scrambled egg mixed in just like back home and it isn't as greasy as Sonoran style.  I've also tried their chicken taquitos and they use white meat, which is delicious.  Their salsa bar has some of the best salsa I've tried around here...it isn't as chunky as Baja style salsa, but it tastes a lot better than some of the runny stuff I've had at places such as Popo's in Phoenix.  And what was that?!  Yep!  They have one of my all-time favs from back home...hot carrots!  Not only do they have them, but they taste almost exactly the same way they do in San Diego.  

Okay okay, so I kept talking about food in San Diego...but honestly, it took my husband and I 5 years of living here to finally locate a place that has delicious and authentic food that is both Baja style and Sonoran style.  Love it!  Thank you Senor Taco for being here.  No, seriously.
