Wow! I have finally found authentic mexican food in Las Vegas! This place is affordable. Service is quick! Waiter always had a smile on his face very good service. Best part of all the food was amazing. I was hesitant to try this place but I decided give it a try and it's 5 stars in my book! The only small complaint is at first smelt a bit of cig smoke since it is connected to a bar. However after getting your meal you forget all about it.

Can't wait to come back and try again!
