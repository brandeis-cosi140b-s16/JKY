I found this place a few weeks ago. My wife and I stopped in for lunch. We were both so excited to find a place with such good salsa and customer service under the same roof.  I liked it so much I had my company Christmas party there last night.  We had 23 guests and the service was amazing.  We were all talking about how well they took care of us. The food all came out hot and fresh.  I highly recommend this place.  I'll tell all my friends.  My new spot for Mexican food.
