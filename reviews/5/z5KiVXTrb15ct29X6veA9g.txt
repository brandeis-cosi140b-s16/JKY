Tacos Atoyac gets 5 stars based on food quality and value alone. This is *not* a 'bertos clone. The chef and owner obviously takes a lot of pride in this taco shop.

The fish taco is incredible. The carne asada and al pastor are both beyond reproach. The quesadillas are crunchy and covered in crema and avocado. The horchata is well-spiced and sweet without being cloying, and is made from scratch, in-house. The $8 fish special was a beautiful fillet, perfectly seared and served with rice and warm totrillas.

Absent is the obligatory basket of tortilla chips. At Atoyac you get a little basket of sauteed jalepenos and onion petals. I couldn't have been happier. I hate mowing through a metric ton of chips at a Mexican place just because they're there. Chips take up stomach space I'd rather fill with more al pastor. 

The ambiance is, to be fair, spartan. But I didn't have time to notice. The food was just that damn good.

If you are reading this between the hours of 10am and 9pm and it isn't Sunday, you should be driving to Tacos Atoyac. Not reading reviews.
