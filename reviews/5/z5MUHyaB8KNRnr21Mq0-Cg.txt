I am pretty sure that I have reviewed this place already, but I sort of feel like every time we go here I fall in love all over again!

I just ate the left overs from last night, because I couldn't manage to finish my plate after having one of the "Casa Margaritas" and enough chips to put me in a certain food coma... The left overs were just as good this morning as they were last night! DUH. 

This place has the best everything in town. No joke. 

Do yourself a favor, if you like spinach, get the Spinach Enchiladas dinner. 

And don't leave without trying the house margarita. On the rocks. With salt. 

Just do it.
