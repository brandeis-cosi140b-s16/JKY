I've been eating at Someburros since the early 90's in Tempe.  It has been great to see them open up more facilities in SE valley.. The big plus is the fact that their food is consistently delicious on all 4 sites.. My favorite is the Beef Chimi with Red Sauce.. You can't go wrong.. Oh, how can I forget.. Their chips and sauce are very addicting..
