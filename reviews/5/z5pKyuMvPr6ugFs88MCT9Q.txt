Big fan for Mexican at this price, especially in a local eatery. I've tried a whole bunch of different items on the menu, and my wife usually has chicken. It has been good every time. Love the chips and salsa. Love their variety of hot sauces. Love that I can walk there from my office. Very good food all around!
