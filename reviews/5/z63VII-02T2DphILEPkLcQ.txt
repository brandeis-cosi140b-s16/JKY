Just get the big ass margarita glass and thank me later. 

Really good food, and surprisingly one of the best margaritas I've had in a LONG time. I guess it shouldn't be too surprising as they have margarita history and whatnot all over their menu, but WELL DONE.

I also have to say, the service was AWESOME. Ill be back next time I'm in Vegas.
