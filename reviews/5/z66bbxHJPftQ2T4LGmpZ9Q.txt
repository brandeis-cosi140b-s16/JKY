The carne asada tacos are amazing! Being a taco freak, I have eaten them EVERYWHERE I can get them. 
 I am gluten free (celiac) and they are very careful not to cross contaminate.  Have never gotten sick as they are so careful!
 The portions are big, enough in one taco for two tortillas easily. 
 The green sauce is to die for, not too hot and not sour like some. 
We seriously eat here weekly now.
