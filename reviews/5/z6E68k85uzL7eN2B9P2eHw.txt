So here's the thing, authentic Mexican food is fresh, filling and really not that spicy. I don't understand that perception but what evs, this place is fantastic. They make the corn tortillas in house and there is nada on the tacos except onion, cilantro and a wedge of lime. Sorry, but that's exactly how it's supposed to be.   Delicious. Friendly service and a clean dining room. Can't ask for more for 5.99 lunch specials (add Flan for 1.99).  The decor is atypical for sure for American tastes but looked very similar to many restaurants in Mexico.  I'll be back!!
