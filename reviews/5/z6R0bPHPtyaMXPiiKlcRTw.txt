After coming home from California I thought I would never find tacos that would match the ones from a taco truck. I've been on a journey going place to place to satisfy my taco cravings. I went to places like Robertos, Amigos, and even Mexican cuisine restaurants. I was on the verge of giving up until I came across this cozy little beach-feel taco shop. The owners are super friendly and have to say THE BEST tacos in Vegas hands down. The tacos aren't the traditional Mexican tacos, more like island-inspired tacos. Fish tacos are to die for, but you also have to try the potato tacos. Sounds awkward but it's delicious. My favorite thing about the restaurant? They have over 30-40 different hot sauces ranging from mild to the adventurous super hot. 

Located pratically on the UNLV campus for convenience and the prices? it's cheap! 3 tacos and a drink is like 4.99$
If you're driving by this place make sure you stop by and try it!
