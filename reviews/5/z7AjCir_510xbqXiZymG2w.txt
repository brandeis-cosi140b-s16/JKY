I am quite aware that this is a chain Meican eatery, but I cannot get enough of it.  I'm a traditionalist and always order the crispy beef taco's with refried and rice.  The quality is there, the consistancy is there and always, the service is there.  If your lucky, a guy named "Philly" will deliver your food.  He is straight outta Mexico and for sure one of the happiest guys ever!  

Bonus: the fresh chips and salsa are free (regular salsa and hot, I like to mix) and the white queso dip is spot on.
