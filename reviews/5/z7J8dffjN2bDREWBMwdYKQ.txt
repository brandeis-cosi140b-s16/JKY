I use to eat at this restaurant all the time, and once they started construction on Independence I forgot all about it.  But yesterday I really wanted Mexican food really bad, and decided to return they upgraded the place a lot it looks a lot better than it use to look really nice and the staff are sweet.  The food wow the food was amazing, I had the fajita burrito and it was about as big as the big factory one they serve at Cheesecake factory.  Much cheaper version and really fantastic just awesome it was soo much food I had to get the rest to go, the plates were huge they didn't skimp on anything just awesome you should try it.
