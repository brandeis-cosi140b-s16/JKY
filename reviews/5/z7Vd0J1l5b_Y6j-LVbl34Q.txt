Visited for the first time today.  After telling the man at the counter it was our first visit, he explained the menu.  We ordered chicken tostadas with fresh avocado slices and a chicken burrito.  With drinks, are total came to $13.  Cheap date night for hubby and I...and the food was outstanding!!
