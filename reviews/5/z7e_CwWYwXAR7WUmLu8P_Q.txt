So I have to share with everyone about how much I love this place. For the area that it's located in, it is quite ghetto, I mean it is E. Fremont St. So you'll definitely have to get over that part of it. I am one of the pickiest people on the planet and you can see by all of my awful horrible ratings on yelp. I normally only leave good and bad comments with my experiences as there's rarely a grey area and everything is black and white. 

Their food is great!!!  Their enchiladas are my favorite. Wet burrito, asada fries, fish tacos, carnitas, nachos ... Are all really good. Substitutions are the only issue I have. I wish they would make more vegetarian items and substitutions. 

Definitely love this place!!!
