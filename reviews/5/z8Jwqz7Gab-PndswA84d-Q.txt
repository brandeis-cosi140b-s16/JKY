Delicious! WONDERFUL people! The couple own and run this restaurant. They are super nice. We went late on a Wednesday night and the place was empty. We tried the steak chicken and pork street tacos. The meat was moist and the tacos were soo full of meat and cilantro and onions it was hard to hold. I read the other reviews and I can only imagine they're getting better with time. We dined in and did not experience any of the of the complaints. It was a little slow but we sat there and watch him cook everything so any faster I figured it would be raw. Whatever they marinate the pork in is delicious. They serve the pork taco with pineapple on too which brings out the flavor.   They have a variety of salsa and we tried the hot and mild and both had good flavor. We will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu. I welcome them with open arms and belly to the area!
