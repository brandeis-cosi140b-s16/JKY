What can you say about a place thats been open in the same spot, owned by the same family for 33yrs and isn't going anywhere. I have been a loyal customer for 32 of those years. The food is unchanged and excellent, the Red Salsa which I am addicted to and still cannot get the recipe, makes me drive 70 miles round trip to buy a quart and fresh chips, I have had everything on the menu and my personal favorite is the Chorizo egg potato and cheese with three cups of salsa inside. I have taken friends and family when they visit and all love it, Every Christmas I have to send a gallon of salsa and 5 lbs of Chorizo to cousins in Missouri. Love this place.
