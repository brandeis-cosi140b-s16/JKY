They are awesome! Automatically bring out chips, salsa, hot salsa, and waters. Service is great and the food is amazing as well. Very reasonably priced, too! My husband and I went for lunch on a weekday. We had one bowl of chips, got two taco salads, one fountain drink, and one water. It was $20 even and we left full without even finishing our food.
