One a mission for tamales and we found this place.  It was much better than we have ever had in California, including Tiajuana with the exception of a place we tried a few days ago and that was mainly because their GREEN SAUCE was better but the Tamales pretty simple.  Chips are very homemade and fresh and we loved them and we got so full of them we took half our food to go.  BIG HINT:  ORDER THE SPECIAL MARGARITA THEY HAVE THERE IT HAS LIKE FIVE SHOTS OF ALOCHOL AND WE ALL GOT A BUZZ ON THE FIRST SIP.  GREAT VALUE
