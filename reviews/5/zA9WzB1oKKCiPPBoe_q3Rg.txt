My review is based upon our experience on having a large private party in the Caboose Party Area - it was AWESOME!  We were looking for a fun/casual/not JUST a bar but had a bar kind of place for our 20 year reunion.  The Caboose Party Area was PERFECT!  It has  a private entrance and enough space for a DJ, dancing, photo booth, tables, mingling and space to break off into more intimate groups - either outside or just inside the indoor bar area.  The food provided was yummy and the drinks were priced right & good!  The service we received was stellar - from the beginning to the end.  I had several people come up to me telling me what a GREAT place this was and how much more fun this was than their reunion or that they were going to suggest this as a location for an upcoming reunion.  We also used The Courtyard by Marriot Downtown Tempe as our hotel base - so people could do the drunk walk home.  ;)  My only wish was that Macayo's stayed open after midnight.  The party had to roll over to Mill. :)

Oh!  On a side note - Their blackened Ahi Tacos are KILLER!
