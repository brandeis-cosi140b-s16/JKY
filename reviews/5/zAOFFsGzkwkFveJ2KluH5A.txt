Really cute new restaurant hiding in this shopping center.  Fantastic service and great prices.  They have empanadas and tamales packaged to go or you can dine in. We split 3 empanadas (pumpkin was our favorite) and a veggie burrito, coming to about $10.  Cecy, the owner, was very kind and welcoming, patiently going over the menu and making suggestions.  They also cater.  

The food was great.  We will most definitely return for more empanadas!

Be sure to sign up for their frequent visitor program, belly!  This store is impressively high-tech with all kinds of ipads and gadgets, so you can sign up right at the register.  The rewards are great-who in their right mind would not want a free tamale?!?  Please visit Cornflower, they are delightful and their food is great!
