I actually had my wedding reception here. AMAZING! We reserved the patio during a poolside Pepper concert and people kept trying to get through to the patio to crash our open bar and food, so they had to bad ass chicks bouncing for us. The food was amazing and they couldn't have been more accommodating. AND it was still cheaper than any wedding I've ever been to. It was a blast and I couldn't give this place enough kudos for making my day so special
