Best kept secret! I have lived 8 miles from here for years!! And never knew about this place. Today is my birthday and I was craving a Mexican Seafood restaurant. So I did a search on Yelp to help me decide where to go. That's how I found Mariscos Sinaloa. My boyfriend and I walked in. We were greeted by the staff. It was seat yourself so I chose a corner booth. A friendly waitress (wish I knew her name, she wore glasses and had a big smile all the time) immediately brought over chips & salsa and took our drink order. When she delivered our drinks I told her it was our first time there. She had a big smile on her face and welcomed us (again). Since a lot of the menu was in Spanish she helped us understand and explained some of the selections on the menu. She did it with enthusiasm which made us feel appreciated as guests. I love queso dip but did not see it on the menu. So I just took a stab at it and asked her if they had queso dip. She said they did but it was not on the menu. I was pleasantly surprised. The queso dip was very good and creamy. My boyfriend ordered the Camerones Baconera. He really enjoyed it. I sampled it and wouldn't mind ordering it for myself next time we come. Big plump shrimp swimming in a creamy, spicy, chipotle type sauce.  I ordered the Molcajetes. OMG!! Entr√©e big enough for 2. It had grilled octopus, carne asada, bacon wrapped shrimp, grilled green onions, cheese stuffed pepper, and grilled chicken in a spicy sauce sizzling in a hot clay-type pot. I was not disappointed!! I was not able to finish and had to ask for a to-go container. I saw a smile on boyfriend's face when I asked for the to go box. He was probably thinking that he is getting the leftovers....NOPE!! Not this time, My Love, I'm gonna savor this myself tonight!!! We will definitely come back!! Why? The food was delicious but the waitress with the glasses and friendly smile made our experience there FANTASTIC!!
