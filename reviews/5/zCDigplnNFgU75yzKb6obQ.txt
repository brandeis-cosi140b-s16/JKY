Imagine the best possible taqueria, but take away homemade aguas frescas and put it an old Wendy's building.  Then you're basically left with tacos el gordo.  

Fresh homemade tortillas, good variety of meats, and sopes so big they stack a tostada on top so you can hold it together.  Free grilled peppers and friendly staff.  None of the meats were the best I had, but they were consistently very good.
