This location is perfectly set right on the outskirts of San Tan Village. The price is right on point it fills me up and most of the time I have leftovers. It's pretty healthy as well. My boyfriend and I like going right after a workout for all the protein. Gotta love chicken, steak, barbacoa, and pork. This location never fails to give us great portion sizes and they always give us plain rice upon request! Fantastic grub, good service and did I mention they serve Margaritas!!! Woop woop
