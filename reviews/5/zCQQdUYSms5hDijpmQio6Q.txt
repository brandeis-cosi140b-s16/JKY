I read empanadas and knew I had to try this place out.  Corn Flower is a quaint little spot with inside and outside seating.  Very clean, well lit and inviting.  A cold case holds numerous tasty morsels that come in the forms of burritos and empanadas.  We were greeted by the chef this evening with a gigantic smile, 3 frosted shot glasses and a pitcher full of beautifully creamy and smooth Horchata.  Ohhhhh, it was good!  We ordered a myriad of food so that we could share and experience all the Corn Flower has to offer.  The tamales were fresh and flavorful but the spotlight of the table was definitely the green chile enchilada.  It's not the typical shaped log of boring shredded dry meat with mounds of melted plastic cheese and lackluster sauce.  This was terrific!  It was slightly spicy, moist, fork tender...we will definitely be back for more of that dish! The chips and salsa were pretty typical, a bit more crunchy and 'corny' than most.  The sweet empanadas were a highlight as well, a great ending to our meal.  We ordered the pineapple with French vanilla sauce, Nutella and lemon.  The pineapple one was my favorite, with the lemon a very close second.  No disrespect to the Nutella but it lacked a but of zip..maybe adding a little chile would liven it up!   We bought the $10 for $15 deal, even with that our meal was relatively inexpensive, $32 total for 3 adults.  The soups sounded amazing, that is definitely on my to order list next go round.  I believe it was the owner, or manager that came and talked with us, very friendly and asked if we 'Yelped' very often.  Of course we do!  Good job Corn Flower, we will be back to try out some more of your tasty offerings, you did not disappoint!,,
