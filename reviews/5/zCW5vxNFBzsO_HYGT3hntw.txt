Excellent food. I think I am going to have to go there once I complete this review. Place is very clean and extremely welcoming. The staff are very friendly and efficient. Food is well priced and very pleasing to the taste buds. The burritos are fantastic especially with steak and the burrito bols are great too. Oh and you get get beer here and margaritas too . I am absolutely in love with this place and can't get enough. Chipotle can get crowded on the weekends and during lunch hours but you can still go in and and get your food in under 15 minutes.
