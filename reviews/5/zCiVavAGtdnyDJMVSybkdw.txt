Dropped by here for lunch and we are so glad we did! 

Hometown dogs has a mom n pop feel to it and it is a small restaurant.
Jr and Tee, the owners were amazing and made the experience worthwhile! The service could make this place five stars but let's talk about the food.
I ordered a combo dog with chili, nacho cheese, and jalapenos with a side of the green chili pie. For $6.99 it was unbelievable! The hot dog was great, chili was great, and the toppings enhanced the whole thing (what does nacho cheese not enhance??) The green chili pie was green chili pork covered fritos with onions and cheese and was also delicious! Where else are you going to find a green chili pie as a side?? Someone said it before but I'll say it again, the sides here are AWESOME. 
My sister got  mushroom and swiss dog and also liked it a lot. She got the frito pie and ate it even though she doesn't like chili. That's how good it is! There are also tons of different options that all look amazing so we will definitely be back. (and a punch card to motivate us)

Their dogs are really good and have a nice snap to them and are super filling. For $16 total, you can't beat it! They also have award winning salsa that we will also be back to try out.
