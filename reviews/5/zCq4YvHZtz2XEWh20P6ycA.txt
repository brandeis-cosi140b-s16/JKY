Dust off your Spanish and stroll in for some great Mexican Street Food! This place has it all and make sure you get there early so you can try their special items before the run out!

It can be a bit noisy (very loud) if they have the tunes cranking, but hey thats Mexico for ya, not a bad thing, to me it makes the experience ever more authentic.

The prices are very reasonable and the staff is friendly, this is nothing fancy, so don't expect some type of chain taco joint. Its the real deal coming from someone who is in Mexico every month!
