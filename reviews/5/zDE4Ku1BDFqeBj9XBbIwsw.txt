One of the best Mexican Restaurants in AZ. BEST BEAN DIP EVAR!!!! I don't know how they do it but I have seriously considered bribing someone to give me the dam recipe! The texture is nice, cheesy, and I love that they put tons of onions in it. I am a huge onion fan. The more onion, the better! Their salsa is great too. Very chunky, flavorful, and of course, lots of onions. Chips are crispy and they give you plenty. I only order one thing when I go to Serrano's.... Its the crunchy pork taco's. Shredded pork with spices, nice and greasy with lots of lettuce, tomatoes and their great salsa. Their rice and beans are good too but I always just get two pork taco's ala carte. The service is always speedy, yet friendly. Oh and did I mention that they have terrific fried ice cream??? One of my all time favorite desserts. Go here if you want cheap, tasty, quick Mexican food goodness!
