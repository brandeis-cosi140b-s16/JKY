Stopped in last night to grab some carryout and as it was my first time, I didn't know what to expect.  Not only did the food exceed my expectations but this might now be my "go-to" spot for Madison Taqueria fare (El Pastor is my favorite).  The restaurant itself is well decorated, clean, and has a welcoming waitstaff.  The menu was extensive but I focused in on the tacos.  I tried the carnitas (special for the day), barbacoa (also a special) and the pastor.  Top with onion and cilantro and stuffed generously with meat, they were all excellent.  The pastor was some of the best I tried.  Not only was the food excellent and reasonable, they have an incredible salsa bar.  With no signs telling me what each was, I sampled 4.  They were outstanding-one with a creamy avocado base, another that definitely had chipotle peppers, and another that was almost straight guajillo peppers (and among the spiciest).

I definitely recommend this restaurant and I will absolutely be back.
