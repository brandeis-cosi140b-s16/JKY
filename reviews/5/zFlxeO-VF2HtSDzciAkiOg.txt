Ok, I've been here twice now and am totally loving it. 

First time was for dinner, and we tried everything on the menu.  The tacos are the street variety, that is they are soft corn tortillas. The tortillas are fresh made in-house and are AMAZING! 
The other things on the dinner menu are awesome, but the tacos and ceviche stand out the most. 
Dessert of flan (slightly firmer texture than expected, but very smooth) and tres leches were also amazing. 
They have an excellent drink selection as well. 

Second trip: brunch 
We started with the fruit plate, a very good selection of a variety of fruits and yogurt. I ordered the chorizo skillet, a very large portion of eggs, cheese and chorizo (spicy). It was awesome, and while I hopped to box up half of it, I ended up eating it all. Others tried all of the other brunch options. No complaints and many compliments. 

I'll also add that the coffee is excellent: I enjoyed it black. 

Peyton et al have done it again! Expect to see a lot more check-ins from me.
