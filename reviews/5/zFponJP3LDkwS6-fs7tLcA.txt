I am usually not a fan of Mexican food because I grew up picky and then when I acquired a taste for it, my hubby burnt me out on it since it's his favorite kind. But everyone else trumped me tonight, so this is where we ended up. I was SO pleasantly surprised! The food is fresh and flavorful and delicious! The staff are very nice. I will be happy to come back here. The food even made me cry. ;) (it's a bit spicy but worth it)
