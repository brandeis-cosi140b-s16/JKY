Having had terrible experiences at Hawaiian food places here in Las Vegas, such as L&L, I was admittedly hesitant to try another.  To my surprise, the staff at Braddah's was extremely friendly and their food surpassed my expectations tremendously.  The young woman at the counter, Kelly I believe, did a great job checking on me during my meal and even the cook in the back with the face piercings also came out to check on me! Great experience! I will be back soon!
