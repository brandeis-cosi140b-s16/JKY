This was a great find. I eat a LOT of tortilla chips, and theirs (free) were some of the best I've ever had. Hot, crispy, and strong enough to hold a hearty amount of salsa (also free), guacamole, and taco fillings. Speaking of tacos, I had the tacos barbacoa, pastor, and alambre. I'd never had the last one, and all were delicious. Most tacos are $1.85 each, and I probably could have been satisfied with just two (in addition to the chips and guac). I usually eat a lot, so that's saying something. I ended with sopapillas drizzled with strawberry syrup, which were also excellent, although I don't have a lot to compare them to.

My beer was served with a frosted mug, which was a nice touch.

Don't be put off by the huge sign in the front window warning that nobody is allowed in wearing masks or hoodies!
