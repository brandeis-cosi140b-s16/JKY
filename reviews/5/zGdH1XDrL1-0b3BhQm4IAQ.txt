This is the best Baja Mexican food I've had since leaving southern Cali. Reasonable, fresh, clean, friendly and fast. All the Mexican favorites cooked to perfection. Small store with 6 tables inside along with outside seating. They keep their sauces fresh by keeping them refrigerated and issuing them with each order. I'm fighting this from becoming my favorite staple. When they say "Los Favoritos", they mean it!
