How could a person from Ohio find and be back to Maria's so many times he wants to write a nice review? That's an interesting story. Let's just say it has something to do with the proximity to the Airport and a friend who runs me over to this place between intentionally scheduled long layovers... so we can see each other for a few minutes and eat here.

I believe I've hit the five meal mark at Marias in the past year... every time tasty. Every time good service... and that hug on New Year's day from our favorite server was just one component of a great getaway. I've taken quite a liking to this place. The food's pretty darned good, the margaritas just what you need before take-off and the staff? Awesome.

It's one of those small family owned places I seek when I want great Mexican food. Kudos to my friend for turning me on to this place - I really love coming here.

PS: DO NOT EXPECT UPSCALE IN ANY WAY. Kick back.
