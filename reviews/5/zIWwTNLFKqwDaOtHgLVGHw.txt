First:  If you want cheesy, saucy, greasy Tex-Mex, this is not the place for you.  If you want light, simple, authentic Mexican food, you've come to the right place.

Second:  Tienda Los Gemelos does not show up on a Google Maps search for "restaurants," because it is tagged as a "Mexican Goods Store."  And that's true -- it's a little Mexican grocery store -- but in the back, they're hiding a spacious, clean dining room, with televisions and table service.  And they're open on Mondays, contrary to an older review here.  And they take credit cards.

The food:  I ordered a steak taco, taco al pastor, steak tostada and chicken quesadilla.  The tacos are simple -- meat, onions and cilantro in a soft-fried tortilla.  The quesadilla is deep-fried, and has chicken, lettuce and crumbly queso fresco cheese.  The tostada has meat, lettuce, tomato, mayonnaise, queso fresco and slices of avacado. And the mayo actually works.

The pastor was the clear winner -- juicy, flavorful, delicious.  The steak was tasty but didn't pack the flavor like their pastor.  The chicken was cooked well, and tender, but not seasoned in any noticeable way.  All the meats tasted like quality cuts, though, and they provide two sauces and a salsa to dress up your entrees, as well as plenty of lime wedges for lime juice.

Drinks:  Grab 'em from the cooler, pay for 'em when you pay for your meal.  The opener's hanging from the cooler door.  If you have an ounce of observational skills, it's super-easy to figure out.

And all of that food, with a Mexican Coca-Cola, was less than $13.00.
