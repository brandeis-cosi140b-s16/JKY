What a great find. We had been up on Mt Charleston in the morning and looking for somewhere to get breakfast em before hitting red rock canyon. This place was perfect. A nicely prepared burrito with fresh tortilla and freshly made chips with salsa. Not your at a dads breakfast but hey, we were on East Coast time so more like lunch for us. A very tasty and filling breakfast!
