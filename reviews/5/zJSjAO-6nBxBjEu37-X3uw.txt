Oh my gosh, the chimi w/ baja is the best ever!  You also get it with beans and rice, they are both awesome. Enough for 2 to eat. The sauce they serve on the chimi is so good and the chicken inside is so flavorful.  I try to stay away from fried foods, but this will have to be the exception.  I have also had the green chili burro and my husband likes the combo plates.  Everything was really good. This is now my favorite mexican restaurant.  Still like Carolina's for eating fast food, but this place is a winner.  We have been here 4 times now, once just to try the deserts because we never have any room.  We had deep fried ice cream, churros, and the flan.  They were all as good as it gets.  The churros is a little hard to eat (it is crispy) with the ice cream, but worth the effort.  I was born in NJ, my parents were raised in NYC, but I have been eating mexican food for over 40 years.  My favorite foods are hot and spicy and this place fits the bill for me.  They have a side with a bar that I believe will be opening soon.

We have been back often.  We visit about twice a month now.  We also went in one night just to try the deserts. The flan and churros were a hit.
