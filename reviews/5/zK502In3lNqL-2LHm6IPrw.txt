This is the place.  Now known as La Rosita. The grocery selection is fine, great hot sauce selection BUT go on a Saturday or Sunday when you can order freshly prepared taqueria food as good as any I've ever had, and I lived on Milwaukee's south side most of my life. 

The carnitas are terrific, just had to say it.  I bounce from the torta with your choice of meat (and bear in mind this is a butcher shop, so they make their own barbacoa and carnitas and marinated chicken, lengua, etc), to huaraches when you can get them, to just a simple soft taco.  This is the real deal, no Taco Bell Doritos taco here.  At $1.75 a taco, and they're huge, wow.  Oh, and the salsas they make are great, the red has a mighty nice zip.  

Oh, final word - house made chorizo.  Holy crap.  OK, that was five words, but it's unlike any I've had before.  Complex, perfectly spiced, a slight hint of cinnamon, not greasy, simply great.  You can order it on to-go food at the taqueria on weekends, or by the pound in their butcher shop (raw).  I use half, freeze half.
