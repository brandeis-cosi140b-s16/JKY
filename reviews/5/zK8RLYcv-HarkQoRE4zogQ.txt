5 stars for the guacamole alone. Seriously, it was amazing.

My expectations for Gallo Blanco were high, based on my fellow Yelpers' reviews, and I'm so happy that all of my expectations were met. The food was simple, fresh, and unbelievably delicious. For the service I might only give 4 stars, but I think the evening was just busy.

My friends and I shared the guacamole appetizer, and I really cannot rave about it enough. It is made to order and you can taste its freshness. I loved the huge chunks of avocado. It was so good that we ate it with forks once we'd run out of chips. For dinner, I had two tacos and a side of beans. One seasonal veggie taco (green cauliflower with zucchini, mushrooms, onions and pico de gallo) and one cephalopod taco (octopus). The veggies were marinated and cooked to perfection, and I was delightfully surprised with the octopus. Taking a risk and eating something different really paid off. The beans were topped with cotija and were neither too salty nor too runny. My friends had the house salad, pork taco, Pico Rico Burger, and Veggie torta and were just as pleased as I was. I spent $8 on my entree - it's hard to beat that price for such good food. Once you factor in the appetizer, drinks and tip, I spent $20 total. Not bad...not bad at all.

The restaurant was loud and it was hard to hear at times, but it was a Saturday night, so I'm not going to hold it against them. A waiter could have spilt hot water all over me (he didn't) and I would still give this place 5 stars. I loved it and can't wait to go back to try their breakfast.
