I visited this establishment with my family on 12/5/15.  This was our first time coming here, and I could not be more pleased.  The hostess was pleasant, the wait staff was efficient, polite, and friendly.  Our head waiter Juan was engaging and assisted with any questions we had.  He was also very good with my son.  I ordered off the combination plates: pick 3.  You can pick ANY 3 items from the entire combination numbers.  I chose a chicken taco, chicken chimi, and a cheese enchilada.  The platter comes with rice and refried bean, but you can order vegetarian beans/no cholesterol beans instead.  The other adult chose 3 item combo too and decided on: chicken chimi, cheese enchilada, and chili relleno.  My son got a children's plate: beef taco with rice and beans.  The meal came out pippin' hot, looked fresh, and was a large portion.  The vegetarian beans were incredible!!  It was almost like a soup.  All of us were not able to finish our meals, and shared a fried ice cream.  The major different to their fried ice cream was instead of individual corn flakes on the ice cream, the flakes were grounded up.  The edible bowl was cinnamon delicious.  I would definitely come back here.
