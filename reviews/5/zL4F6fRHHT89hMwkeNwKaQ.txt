This location is by far the best of chipotle!!!! The staff is all super friendly, they make work fun! I have been here a few times and tonight was awesome as always! One employee in particular (I didn't catch her name, but I wish I did so I could give her a shout out!) was super energetic and joking with everyone. If they didn't have a smile on their face approaching the counter, they did after their encounter with her! 

The food is delicious as always.... My favorite oddly enough is their chips and salsa! They have, by far, the BEST chips. YUMMMMMM!
