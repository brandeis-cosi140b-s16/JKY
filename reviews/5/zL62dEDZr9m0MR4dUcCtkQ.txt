Once again I was "wowed" by the service at MY local Cafe Rio.  Even though I didn't go to the gym today like I normally do before I visit, I ordered double fire grilled chicken on my salad.  AWESOME!!!  You know you go a lot when they remember exactly how you like different dishes.  Service, food, location all equal a great adventure.  A local favorite and recommended to everyone I meet that are new to the area.
