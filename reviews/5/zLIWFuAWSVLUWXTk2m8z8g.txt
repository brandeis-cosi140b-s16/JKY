Spousal Unit has insisted we come here just about every other day since they re-opened!  Its is BETTER every time, these guys are definitely shooting up the learning curve and refining their offerings as the kitchen staff gets comfortable back in that little area where the magic happens.  My current favs are the Bean Tostado (beans are fresh, smooth, creamy and don't seem to have any, er, side-effects if you know what I  mean!) and a crunchy shredded beef taco.  The shredded lettuce is fresh and crispy, good amount of shredded cheese and the Salsa has its Perky Personality back.  Good Work guys!
