Indian Village is located in the heart of Cave Creek and offers a unique blend of Southwestern and Mexican cuisine. 

Their Indian Fry Bread is incredible and offers a much needed reprieve during the months leading up to the state fair. More importantly, their food is a bargain offering large portions for low prices. 

The owner is almost always there and is quite the character. Him and staff are kind and offer a welcoming environment each and every time. I've only eaten here a few times and he already recognizes me by name. Definitely THE place to eat whenever you are passing through Cave Creek.
