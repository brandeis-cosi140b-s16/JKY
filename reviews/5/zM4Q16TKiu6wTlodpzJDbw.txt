This is THE place for carne asada burritos and get it loaded.  You'll discover the reason for the long lunch lines after biting into one.  

Everything is fresh and juicy, seriously, keep the burrito wrapped up until the last bite or you'll be wearing it.  I haven't tried anything else for fear of it not being as good as the burrito.  I like that they offer a junior burrito size which is typically filling for lunch.

Personally, I've never been for dinner but have heard various complaints from others about the food during this time.  So, go at lunch time, the food is the freshest and unless you like waiting for your food and a place to sit, get there before noon.
