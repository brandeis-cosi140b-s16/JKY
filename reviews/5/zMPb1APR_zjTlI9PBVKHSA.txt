Listen yelp friends, I've been to the proverbial Kansas City BBQ mountain top many times. Plates of ribs have been  handed to me at Jack Stack and Arthur Bryant's- and I did indulge. In fact, I didn't think anyone could smoke ribs on par with our mid west friends...until I went to Jalapeno Bucks. You see, it takes a LOT of time and very low heat in order to penetrate ribs in a way that leaves a deep smoke layer with a beautiful "bark" on the outside. This bark is what defines a very good meat smoking process- you know you did it right when the meat is fall-off-the-bone moist and delicate, but is contained by a smokey, mildly crunchy, almost pie-crust exterior, dusted with a hint of house sauce. Too much sauce and the house is covering something up. Too little sauce and you're not experiencing enough of the house ingenuity. Well, Jalapeno Bucks DOES IT RIGHT. Their ribs are exceptionally well done- first rate. They are less barky than a KC joint, but more smokey. They have struck a perfect balance between delicate, and punch-you-in-the-face. Dip them into the house's sauce and MAN, you got yourself a great plate of ribs! The only downside is they only make them for Saturday consumption, and they sell out fast. So, order them specially or come early.
