Barrio Queen is an excellent little place right in the center of Scottsdale's shopping district!  When I went, It was my first visit and I wasn't sure what I wanted to try.  I asked the waitress--her name was emily---to surprise me.  She brought me three excellent tacos (street tacos style).  I can't remember which she brought but they were so good, i had her surprise me with three more!    The food and service is excellent here!
