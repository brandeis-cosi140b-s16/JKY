Very friendly and family owned restaurant... everyone was pleasant here, greeted me, answered my questions, brought us plenty of coffee refills, napkins, picked up our plates... even though it's a walk up and order your food kinda place. 

My mother and I loved the food here.  She had the chorizo breakfast burrito and I had the taco plate.  The meat is seasoned well and tasted fresh. The Spanish style rice and grilled jalapenos really stand out.
It's pretty inexpensive at the moment.. so that was a huge plus although we kept adding on food.

I hope this place makes it through its first year, it's a very casual walk up and order your food restaurant, kind of like a Roberts.. but much nicer! Authentic Mexican food. 

I will be going back.. very often!
