Went there a couple weeks ago with a friend from out of town. They had a TON of TVs to watch the NBA Finals game and the World Cup matches in any direction. (Since we're sports fans, it was perfect!)

The owner came out to speak to us on several occasions to check on how things were going and make menu recommendations. Food was great. I had the carne asada and my friend had a torta that was so generous in portion size that he took half of it home. Have been back a couple times since and it's been a consistently good time.

We were told about the management change and the owner seems like he's eager to receive input to make things customer focused, as well as a spot for locals to truly enjoy. I think he's on the right track...and I'll keep bringing my friends back!
