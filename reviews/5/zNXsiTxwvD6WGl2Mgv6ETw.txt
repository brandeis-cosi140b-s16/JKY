All I know is that they make the best al pastor burritos and tacos in Phoenix. They are just sweet enough, just savory enough and I always want 50 more of them. 

When it's sunny and not smoldering hot outside, the picnic tables out front are a great place to have lunch. Parking can get to be tricky when it's busy but you can go next door and thrift shop it up while you wait for your food to be ready.
