The best Mexican food I've ever had! And I love Mexican food. Was traveling through Charlotte and came across this place. Had the chicken tostadas. Liked that it was grilled chicken and not the nasty shredded chicken Mexican places usually serve. I was just sad that I couldn't take my leftovers with me cause they would have gone bad before I made it back home to SC. Also sad I couldn't test out a margarita! It was a quick lunch stop en route back to SC. Very similar to the Mexican food found in Arizona/southwest. I'll definitely be stopping here again on my next trip to Charlotte!
