Excellent Mexican food has finally arrived in NW Las Vegas.  One of the standards I gauge a Mexican restaurant by is if they make their own homemade flour tortillas. Well Mi Tierra does! The chips and salsa are delicious and are accompanied by a bean dip. I had the carnitas entree plate and it was amazing! Authentic tasting. A full menu also serving breakfast and lunch specials. Great service and clean place. I hope this place sticks around!
