Stopped here with the intention of doing some serious people watching.   Asked the hostess for a table for two facing the strip and she obliged with two seats looking directly over the strip.

We ordered a pitcher of pear margarita, and although I am not a huge margarita fan, this concoction was good and I certainly had my share.   We also ordered the appetizer sampler.  The sampler was the perfect amount of food and it was good (as good as bar food gets).

Our server was happy, attentive, and did a wonderful job.   The prices are a bit on the high side but considering the view and the environment it was worth the price of admission. I forgot to mention that they had a live band playing.

If you are in Vegas and want to people watch day or night this is an excellent location.
