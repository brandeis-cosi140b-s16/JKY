This is my 2nd time coming here and both times I have had some of the best tacos I have ever had in my life.. And I've had some delicious tacos from around the valley. The staff is very welcoming and warm, Samantha even took a few mins out of her busy day to talk with me about the history of this great establishment. This is by no means the fanciest taco shop in town, but you can taste the passion in the recipes. Be prepared for a little bit of a line and little seating options during lunch, which lets be honest, is usually a great sign of a business. I highly recommend stopping by when you are around here.
