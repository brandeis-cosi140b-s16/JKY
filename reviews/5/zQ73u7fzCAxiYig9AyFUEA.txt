This location has come a long way! The service used to be really bad. In fact I'd say that a lot of the employees used to be very rude and made my visits uncomfortable. However I've noticed that slowly a lot of those employees are no longer working there. Within the past month I've been promptly greeted when I enter the restaurant and each employee along the line has been very courteous to me. This location gets extremely busy. I have walked in a number of times to find the line out the front door. However as someone else mentioned, they do a great job getting people through the line as quickly as possible. They've always done a good job getting people through, but before it seemed like the pressure was too much for some employees. Apparently their is a new manager and things seem to be improving now. It is one my favorite Chipotle locations at this time.
