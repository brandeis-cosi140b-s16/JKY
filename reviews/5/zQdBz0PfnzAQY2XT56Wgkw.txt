Stopped in with my kiddo for a quick dinner after a hectic day, and had an excellent experience. The food was well prepared, fresh, and tasty! Even if the food HAD been sub-par, I would still have been satisfied. The staff went out of their way to be friendly, patient, and went above and beyond when I had a moment of crisis.

Food issues come and go in the fast food business, but there truly is no substitute for quality service. Luckily, this Chipotle location has the best of both worlds!
