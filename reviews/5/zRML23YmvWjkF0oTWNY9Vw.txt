My favorite restaurant ever! My husband and I grew up by Luna and have been coming here forever (he has been coming since he was a little kid, me since about 16).  

They have a great bar & happy hour. My favorite thing is the happy hour Mexican pizza (sub black beans for the meat). NFL Sundays and Sunday Fundays are also a favorite. They also have Wednesday Family Night and other specials. The staff (especially in the bar!) is fabulous and always make us feel welcome!
