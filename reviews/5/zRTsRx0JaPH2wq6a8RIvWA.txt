This place is amazing...and it's in the airport! I stopped to wait for a delayed flight...thought is have some chips and salsa with a beer. First of all, they have an incredible selection of margaritas on the menu so I ordered one. Fantastic choice. The I caved in and ordered Cochinita Pibil. It's a pork roast that is seasoned, paired with chiles and sour oranges and then wrapped in banana leaves and roasted slow overnight. You cannot imagine. 

It was plated with squash, some mashed potato and several corn tortillas. Boom. You're done. An amazing dish, full of flavor and so tender. Delicious. With the margarita it was perfection!
