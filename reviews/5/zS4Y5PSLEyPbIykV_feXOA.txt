I really enjoyed the food, service and ambiance here.  I ordered a glass of Malbec, it was good, and the red cobb salad also good.  Although I would have left out the sliced tomatoes because they were hot house tomatoes and I felt they took away from the salad.  The entire staff was friendly.  My server had on way too much perfume, to the point that it was a distraction.  I don't think food and perfume go together.  

I was going to get some food to go for my lunch the next day.  When I realized they used Styrofoam take out containers I cancelled my order.  Styrofoam is the worst option you can use for food.  It's not good for the planet and I thinks it's irresponsible to use it.

If I'm ever passing through town again I would come back.
