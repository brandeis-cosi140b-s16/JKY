Went to their grand opening event last night 11/24. This place went all out for the public..

Service was friendly and on spot.

Chicken and steak street tacos were awesome. 

Ribs were well flavored.

Chicken wings were awesome.

Tuna tartar bites were on point. 

Margaritas were excellent...delicious and just enough zing.

Midori sour shooters? Bring em on.

Quite a nice grand opening...and the 3 salsas were excellent as well as the guacamole. Left stuffed, satisfied and will be back. 

I'll keep a look out for some happy hour special deals as the food was excellent. I'm glad a place like that is so close...definitely check them out. I see why people talked them up downtown.
