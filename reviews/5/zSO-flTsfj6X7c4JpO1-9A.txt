Love Raquel the Host. we call for reservations and even thought it was not busy she saved us a both. My girl and I asked her what favorite app is and Raquel said you have to try the Coconut shrimp so we did and guess what its addicting. For entrees try the Pollo fundido, and the Chimy. :-)  love this place Noah & Steph.
