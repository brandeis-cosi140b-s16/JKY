after a pool party, we were starving and since i had heard so many great things about this place from co-workers...Paquime would have to be tried!

i think it's a local chain. the store manager told us they have 4 other locations in the valley. but they make everything you eat in house. the ice cream, the baked goods...everything! we were excited to try their fish tacos. 

they have a few selections for non-meat eaters and will make most items with fish instead of meat. there are a couple of fish/meatless dishes as well. the menu is simple, but extensive. and everything looks/sounds delicious. our latest kick is no sugar and very little/no carbs....which is too bad because their baked goods and ice cream and palettas looked amazing. 

i had the fish tostada. it was about 5 bucks but came loaded with avocado, fish, and queso fresca. i'm never sure how to eat a tostado, except with a fork and knife. in any case, it was delicious. with the added verde and rojo chile and a few jalapenos.....man oh man was i in "street food" heaven.

i tasted the wife's fish tacos, which i should've gotten. they came in 3's and although loaded...didn't simply crumble apart when handled. the taste was amazing and luckily we adhere to the "20 minute and full" mantra, because we could've ordered another 3!

a great "mexican street food" restaurant without going down to the west side or rocky point!
