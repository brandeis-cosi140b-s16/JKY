Chipotle, I love you. I feel guilty and rush to your defense when others pt you in the fast food groupie. You are much more than that. I crave you and will happily enjoy your delicacies 7 days a week. You give me a lot of options and I appreciate that. Your recent brown rice option, well words can't do it justice. No one gets me the way you do is all I can say. In a time where everything is coming from far off lands loaded with antibiotics and hormones, you give me guilt free beef and produce that is local. Thank you. I heart you.
