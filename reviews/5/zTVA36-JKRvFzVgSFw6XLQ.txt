Totally surprised! NOT your typical greasy taco spot! So fresh and yummy.. Hand made tortillas, need I say more! I had a fish taco and a shrimp tostada.. Flavorful fresh and delicious! The salsas were good.. Just the right amount of heat. Refreshing horchata and Jamaica drinks not overly sweet like many other Mexican restaurants taste like they make that in house too.. Overall great experience will definitely bring my family back!
