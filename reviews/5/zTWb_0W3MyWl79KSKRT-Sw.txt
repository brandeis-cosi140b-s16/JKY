I've been going to Raul & Theresa's (on MC85) for 20 years, long before all the renovations, etc. This location has all the old gang there as the old one will be changing ownership.  So good to see Stella and Gloria.  The food and service are always top notch - and the salsa and guacamole...mmmmmmmmmm!!
