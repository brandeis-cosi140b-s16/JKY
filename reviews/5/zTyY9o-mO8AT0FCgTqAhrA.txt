You can't go wrong with this place! Everything we had was delicious, from the tejas trio (salsa, guac & queso), to margaritas. 

We had the barbacoa enchiladas and the diablo pasta and added shrimp. I couldn't stop eating my pasta! 

They also give every table home made skillet cornbread with what seemed to be fresh butter. Completely obsessed with that. 

I wish we lived here do we could enjoy this place more often!
