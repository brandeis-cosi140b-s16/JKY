Update because I have an obsession with Carlito's Burritos now. 

Since having Carlito's many moons ago I have since been back quite a few times regularly, at least once a week, maybe missing a week in between a few times. But this has definitely become a go-to establishment for me now. I must admit, I think it had replaced my Chipotle cravings! Chipotle is completely different from this place though.

First off always get the calabacitas in whatever you order, if you don't then you might as well go somewhere else - they are the point of this place. The green/red chili sauces are also phenomenal, but the calabacitas are what you come here for. I always get them in my burritos (my natural go-to). I have had the steak (tender, often charred just a bit), the chicken, and of course, the best, the adovada pork. 

You have the option to get your burrito smothered, which I have done once, but never again. It is not my thing, but others may like this option. The green chili sauce has a KICK and the red is pleasantly spicy. 

The service is always good and the employees are nice. The place is small, so be prepared to wiggle through tables and possibly not be able to eat in the restaurant if it's packed. I suggest eating at the small bar area if you are alone or only with another person. This way you get to watch the cooks because the kitchen is completely open and you can see everything getting cooked and served up.

This is awesome New Mexican cuisine. Don't miss out on this place.
