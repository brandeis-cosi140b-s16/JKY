Must admit, the ceviche here the THE BEST EVERRR . came here for breakfast twice and was pleased both times. got pretty faded too, even tho they have pretty basic beer, corona, negra modelo, and dos x, $4.50 each. mariachi and ppl sellin flowers on sat morning, got pretty crowded and loud but was a pretty good spot to start off the day.
