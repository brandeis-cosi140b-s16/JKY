This place is deeeeelicious!!
The salsa is spicy & perfect, the tortillas are the best I've had, everything on the menu is so good!
My two favorites are a green chile burrito with beans & cheese or the super nachos.
I hope to try the Mesa location soon & I hope its as good!! :)
The only thing I wish is that it was a little cheaper, but I guess you get what you pay for.
