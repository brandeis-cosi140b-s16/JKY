Staying in Las Vegas for the week, and had a hankering for some authentic tacos. I jumped on Yelp, and found the location right off the strip. Unfortunately, after a little bit of running around, it was discovered that the place had just closed down. Much to my surprise, this location is not too far from the strip. 

The food was pretty dang good, the tortillas homemade, the green salsa had a perfect amount of kick. If you are looking for an authentic Mexican tacos, comparable to something from East LA, this is your place.
