The BEST service we have had in a very long time.  The server was polite, funny, and knew the menu extremely well.  I was asking about a menu item having pork in it, and he extrapolated and asked if I eat vegetarian, which I do, so he told me about the meat stock in the green sauce.  I am so grateful for people like that.

The food was very tasty and fresh and the portions were large, while the prices were good.  The chips and salsas were made in house and were muy delicioso.

The owner talked to us and told us his brother handles the menu and that they have the very popular fry bread as a special right now, but we didn't order it so I can't tell you how it tastes.  I think he also said the menu is Sonoran style.  He was very friendly.

The mural on the wall was exceptional, but the interior still lacks some ambiance.

We will definately be returning.
