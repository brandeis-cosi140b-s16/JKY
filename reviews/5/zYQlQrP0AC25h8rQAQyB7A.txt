SO yummy! We came here for breakfast and to say it was good is an understatement. The food was very, very fresh and it was clearly made from scratch. We will definitely be back to try out the cocktails and dinner options. Worth noting- they modified a dish to make it vegetarian for us...and it was fantastic.
