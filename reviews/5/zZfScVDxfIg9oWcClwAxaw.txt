If you are like me and live close by ...  lucky you! This is the best Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas (as evidenced by the clientele -gringos are rarely seen here). If you live clear across town somewhere ... Trust me ... It is worth the drive. I lived a mere mile away for nearly ten years before I tried this place for the first time and I am kicking myself for not trying it sooner!
