How can you go wrong with Chipotle?! I've always enjoyed this place and their fast, quick service. I use the Chipotle app during lunch hour to avoid the lines. Order on your app, choose to pay at the store and go straight to the register. However, sometimes I do visit this location spur of the moment. Not only is their staff fast and friendly but the food has always been excellent. I prefer the burrito bowls and tacos. I would consider Chipotle inexpensive but some may argue with me on that. However, I think you get what you pay for and at Chipotle they definitely serve some goodness! I always recommend Chipotle especially this location's service. Order all four salsas to give your burrito that extra kick!
