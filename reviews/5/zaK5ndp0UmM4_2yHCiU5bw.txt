One of my favorite restaurants. The health-conscience "lite" menu is freaking awesome. Everything is reasonably priced and the bar is great for watching sports. Outside area is cool, too. Don't listen to other reviewers. Drop what you're doing and eat here. Show up a bit early if you want to get a good TV-viewing spot in the bar. While it is plenty big, it is also popular--so it fills up about 15-30 minutes before game time.
