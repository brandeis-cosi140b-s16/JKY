Why didn't I go here for my anniversary date. This place serves amazingly delicious food with no GMO's and it's all hormone free. As for the ambiance and service it was amazing. Amber was our waitress and she was very hospitable and kept us taken care of. Definitely coming back. The desert was amazing. Fried ice cream and flan. YUMMY!!! I highly recommend this place for any occasion.
