I really enjoy going to Spanish Fly on Sundays. They have an awesome mimosa deal from 11am-2pm unlimited mimosas for only $10! It's definitely worth it. Every time my friends and I go, we always ask for JJ. She is awesome and always comes around to fill drinks before we even ask. I have eaten the chicken quesadilla there with grilled veggies. It's to die for! Definitely worth checking out. I highly recommend it if you are tired of not being able to sit anywhere and being too crowded at the new beach club, Maya. If you want a chill afternoon with cool people then I'd recommend bringing your suit and hanging out at Spanish Fly.
