The food and service were great. We ate at 2 other Mexican restaurants on this trip and felt as though this was the first that knew how to make spicy salsa. We had the green chili burro enchilada style and the chicken chimichanga enchilada style, both were awesome. The chips were warm and tasted homemade. The michelada was good. 

The only complaint I have is that when we pulled up at 6:55 on a Thursday night we were the only ones in the parking lot and it felt like we could possibly be in a shifty neighborhood. That feeling went away as soon as we entered the clearly family owned establishment and were greeted by the most gracious hosts who both spoke perfect English (which is important for those of is who know zero Spanish).
