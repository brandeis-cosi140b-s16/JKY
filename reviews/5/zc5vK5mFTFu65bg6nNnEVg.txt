The salsa was delicious and super fresh! The chips were nice and warm. The manager was on it! He was not only checking up on his employees he was helping out! Our server Joe was great, even though he was in a hurry he checked on us regularly. The dinner portions were slightly smaller than expected, but my husband and I liked our pollo especial fundido, and chicken chimi with fundido sauce (even though the fundido was much spicier than expected since we're used to garcia's fundido). My mother in law was not impressed with the chile rellenos as she thought it needed cheese. Didn't try the drinks or desserts this time but will definitely be back!
