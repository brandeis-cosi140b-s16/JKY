Johnny's is still great after all of these years. The line can be long, but it moves very quickly. My favorite are the tamales on Tuesdays and Fridays. Johnny and his staff are super-friendly. You can tell he treats them right because many of them have been there for years, I work at the other end of Tryon St. from his building, and I walk by at least two of the chain burrito places to go to Johnny's.
