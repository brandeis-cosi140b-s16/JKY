This is one of the main locations I come too. Very friendly staff. Went there today and line was decent, the guy at the start of the line was very nice. The lady towards the end seemed in a big hurry. Dined in, at the end of the meal while I was talking to my friend a sweet staff member stopped by and offered to take our trash. First time that has happened, but thought it was nice of her.
