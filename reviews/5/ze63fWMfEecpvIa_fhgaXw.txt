I tried this restaurant one day for lunch with the bf since I work at the hospital down the road, and oh it was worth it. I got the carnitas green chile burrito and my bf got the signature burrito with chicken. They were both good and the salsas were tasty (along with the all you can eat chips). I love the staff there, everyone was so warm and inviting. The people walking around clearing the tables were also polite, they even offered to refil our drinks even though it is a self serve kind of place. Based on service and quality of food, I give this establishment 5 stars! Will definitely return soon.

p.s. we could only eat half of our burritos, we took it home and ate it for dinner the next day, and it was really good (i added some sriracha or cholula to every bite!).
