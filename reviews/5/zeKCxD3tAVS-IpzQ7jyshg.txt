I saw a photo from this place on YelpLV on Instagram and I had to go for lunch. I was also intrigued by the name... I wanted to know what Chicago tacos were all about! It was kind of hard to find because they have yet to place an updated sign up. The place looks like your typical hole in the wall, very clean though. They have a large menu with a ton of options but it is not at all overwhelming. I was greeted by two friendly faces who explained the story behind the name and that they've been open for only two months. The man behind the grill seemed super confident saying they're style is totally different from any other taco spot out here.. Bring it buddy!
I ordered the small chicken and barbacoa Windy City fries for $5.99 a piece which were more than enough for a single person each. I got really excited  when I saw him scooping Guac out of a small bowl like he made it just for my dishes. 
I took it home with some sauces and everything was so amazingly fresh.. The fries stayed crispy, everything was full of flavor. They really focus on every detail that goes into their dishes. The sauces are extremely potent, which is great because I like it hot!
I got full before I could finish my fries. I feel like I got more than enough bang for my buck. And I can definitely see myself craving more trips to Chicago Style Taco Shop in the near future!
