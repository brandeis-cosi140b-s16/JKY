1400th review! Why eat at El Pollo Loco when you can eat at the less crazy (And infinitely tastier) El Pollo Picante? This little restaurant in the midst of a strip mall serves up a delicious charcoal grilled chicken. When you step in the grilled aroma pleasantly surrounds you and you can see the cool grill set up they have in house. The menu is simple, which allows them to excel at what they do best- carne asada and pollo asado. I got a half chicken meal to go with rice and beans ($8.08). While I waited for my meal I took a seat and admired the spotlessly clean surroundings and small fridge with various bottled sodas. There is also a soda fountain behind the counter. 

My meal was packaged in a few minutes and I was quickly out the door. The chicken was a hearty size, and I probably only ate about 1/2 portion of my meal for lunch. The sides and salsa were a generous portion in to go cups. The flavors of everything were great. Excellently seasoned, and well balanced. Everything went well with each other. In addition to the chicken, salsa, and sides, a generous portion of warm corn tortillas, pickled onions, a slice of lime, and roasted jalapeño was included. I especially loved the roasted jalapeño, which was perfectly grilled with a spicy kick.

Service was friendly with a smile. Definitely a great place for grilled chicken. I'll have to come here next time to try the carne asada!
