Dude, Chipotle is the booombbbb. Started eating this stuff in LA when I'd spot Ozzy Osbourne eating there, so I thought it must be pretty good if he'll eat this kind of fast food. Plus, I used to eat this all the time on my "student budget" when I lived at UCLA, so I'm really, really happy that they have one in downtown Pittsburgh...feels like home. Also, I love that you can order online and just pick it up in 10 minutes to skip those long lines. Secret revealed!!!! Okay, not a secret, just a tip. But, even if you're in those long lines, it moves pretty fast.
