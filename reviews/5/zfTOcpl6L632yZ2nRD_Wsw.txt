You always remember your first.  Cabo Fish Taco was the first restaurant that I tried in NODA and it remains my favorite.  It was even my choice for a birthday dinner with friends.  

Cabo Fish Taco has a New York City restaurant type feel, but it's bigger than most NYC restaurants that are squarely tucked into buildings.   The restaurant is very casual (like most of NODA), and I like that the menu is kind of upscale/gourmet Baja Mexican.  

It was here that I also tried my very first fish taco.  I had to -- it was in the name!  I went with the Cabo Fish Taco on the menu.  It was good...but nowhere near as good as what I've continued to order during following visits: the Honey Wasabi Tuna Burrito (without the mushrooms, as I'm not a fan of fungi).  So much flavor is involved, it's sinful.  Plus, the portions are so large that I usually end up bringing half of it home (after eating lots of chips and salsa, too, of course!) and having it for lunch or dinner the next day.  

I've brought several out-of-town friends and family to Cabo Fish Taco and they've all been impressed by the simple look of the restaurant, but the surprisingly bountiful gourmet choices on the menu.
