4.5- This place is fun, relaxed, colorful, and warm.  The d√©cor is super energetic with retro and Latin flair and you can't help but laugh!  That's why I took my Grandma there for her birthday dinner with family.  Everybody loved it.  We forgot to make reservations but were seated quickly.  We walked through the restaurant pointing and ooing and sat outside under huge trees, string lights and giant metal tulips.  We were very comfortable and though it was packed, it wasn't too loud, so we could carry on normal conversation, and feel we had enough space.  I'm not a drinker but tasted a sangria and a margarita other people ordered, both very good, tasted fresh and yummy.  Service was extremely fast!  I guess it doesn't take long to whip up enchiladas, burritos, and steak tacos but wow!  We also had a lot of little requests for the waiter but before we thought twice, he was back with what we wanted.  I heard mixed reviews of the food but I can't say anything bad- it was hot, fresh, mouth watering, my steak was super tender, and it all sat well with us.  I was born and raised in LA.  This is good Tex Mex.  The best ever?  No, but I still love it :)  I think this place got everything right.  Would a home cooked meal from mom (or grandma) that takes 24 hours to prep for and slow cook taste even more amazing?  Of course, but for restaurant food and THE PRICE, we were all very happy.   They even brought my grandma a free dessert after dinner because I told the waiter it was her birthday!  One thing though: I wish they had put a candle in it, that would have made it even more perfect!   Welcome to Charlotte, Chuy's!  Keep it up!!
