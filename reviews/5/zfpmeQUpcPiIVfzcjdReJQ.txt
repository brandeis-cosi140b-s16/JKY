Was walking the dog yesterday on Carson st., and right around 23rd or so, just past Cupka's same side of the road, saw a street standing sign "Taqueria".

This will draw me in like a cracker to a pig roast.

Just go here.  I don't have time at this point to really do a critical essay on exactly how great this place is.  Go here for lunch.  Get the barbacoa, or the carne asada tacos or burrito.  The meat is perfect.   I mean, seriously, perfect.

And it is run by the owners.  The guy who whips up the food is nice and talkative, and a good speak.  I assume his wife is behind the register.  She is just fine, as far as, she rings you up and takes your money.  

Seriously. Seriously...   BEST taqueria, taquirea, taco, street taco, in Pittsburgh.  (I did all that for the benefit of the search engines).

I am not kidding.  I am posting pictures later.  BEST BEST BEST.
