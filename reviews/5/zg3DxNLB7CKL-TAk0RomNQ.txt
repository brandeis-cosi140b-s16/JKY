Best wiener I've put in my mouth in a LONG time!  Ordered a Sonoran dog with everything and a carne asada burrito with everything.  Both were SO delicious.   The salsa bar has everything that you would want for fixings...including cucumbers, pickled red onions, radishes, my fave avocado salsa, and all the other salsas.  Fresh grilled chiles also on the line...they were grilling the chile out back.  The line was long but it went super fast, and the food came out even faster.  We barely sat down at our table when our number was called.  This is def a new favorite.  Plenty of order takers - the register in the middle was cash only, all the others took credit/debit.  Thanks for coming from Tucson - we would welcome more locations in the valley!
