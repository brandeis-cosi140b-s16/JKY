This is probably my 10th time coming here. I was greeted at the door from all the staff.... Literally "welcome to chipotle!!!!!!" Well this is different, they are taking the subway greeting approach which I don't mind. The staff was nice and urgent since I had 8 people following behind me. The tables were clean and the food was amazing! I got the salad yum.
