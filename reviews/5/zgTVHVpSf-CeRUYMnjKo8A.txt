I have been to Lindo Michoacan on previous occasions and had pleasant dining experiences, but I was never really blown away by the food. On this most recent visit, I came with Groupon in hand and I have to say it made me a believer.

I ordered the Chuletas de Cerdo Estilo. These pork chops were perfection. The flavors were on point and they were cooked well. Many places overcook pork chops, but these were moist and flavorful. My fella ordered the two burrito combination plate. He chose the green chile pork with beans and a red chile beef burrito. The green chile burrito was addictive. The flavors were absolutely delightful. They danced in my mouth and made me eat quite a bit more than I should have. Next time I'm ordering this dish with both two green chile burritos instead of just the one.

The prices are reasonable considering what you get. I can't believe I've finally found a good Mexican restaurant in town by revisiting a place I had written off in the past! Service was friendly and beyond efficient. We never had a glass go half empty and our chips and dips were always filled to the brim.
