The view is gorgeous- white sangria is delicious, warm chips and salsa were soo good. Does it get much better?
I went yesterday for my birthday, our server was excellent and brought me a free shot to celebrate. I left completely stuffed! The chicken fajitas were incredible! I definitely had a food baby when I put on my dress to go out that night...
