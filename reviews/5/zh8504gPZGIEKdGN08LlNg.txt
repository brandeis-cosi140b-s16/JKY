I brought my girlfriend of 3 years here for dinner the other night .  She is not one for trying new things but I have to say by the end of the meal she was looking forward to our next dinner date there.  The waiter was so patient and tour guided her through the entire menu to ensure that she picked an item that she would love .  I know they were busy at the time but we felt like we were his only concern in the world .  I have and always will be a big fan of Manny's .
