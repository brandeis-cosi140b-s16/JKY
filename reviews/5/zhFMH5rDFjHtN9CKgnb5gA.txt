Fantastic and fast service. The staff are very friendly at this location. Now that wet live back in this area, this will be out main location. My favorite part at this location during this visit was the fresh cucumbers on the salsa bar. My boys live the carne asada burritos and the bacon and egg breakfast burrito. Personally, I am a #4 all the way, no matter the location, 2 shredded beef tacos with rice and beans...YUMMY!
