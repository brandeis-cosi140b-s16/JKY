Definitely a place I would recommend. We've only ate here twice but each time it has been delicious! The portions are great & I never leave unsatisfied. It has definitely been one of my favorite places to grab lunch since we moved to Arizona a few weeks ago. Even my Nana who doesn't particularly like Mexican food enjoyed her meal. Great service & good food, what more could you ask for?
