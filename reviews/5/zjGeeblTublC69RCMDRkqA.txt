I usually only post negative reviews, but our last trip to this location was outstanding from a service perspective.  The cashier was very helpful in making sure my daughter's quesadilla did not have the spicy sauce as requested, then came by the table after we started eating to ask if we needed hot sauce or a drink refill.  Oh yeah...and our order was right for the third visit in a row!
