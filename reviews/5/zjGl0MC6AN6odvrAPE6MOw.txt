It was the middle of the day and I was on my way to get a burrito from Chipotle when at the corner of my eye I spotted this place close by which looked sad and empty from the outside so I decided to give it a shot instead. In no way do I regret my decision; it's great for a quick delicious Mexican dish or perfect for takeout orders. But what I recommend most and others will testify as well in that "Tortas El Tri" has the best tasting tortas of this side of west Phoenix.
