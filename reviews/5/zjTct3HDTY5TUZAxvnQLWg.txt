Great carefully thought out food, i'd definitely call this cuisine. We had the bar menu, really good pricing. All tacos are amazing! If you're vegetarian the mushroom taco is amazing!!! The cod taco for non meat eaters too! All the tacos are bomb! Raw fish food is respectable and fresh. Shishito peppers are verrry good. Guacamole was just ok, too lemony and sum stale chips in the basket. The calamari is really really good, comes over greens and fresh peas, just ask
For the chilli sauce on the side, as mine came drenched and was toooo sweet, it'd be perfect otherwise! Service impeccable, great atmosphere, fun decor down to the fake tree! Well done Sumomaya!!!
