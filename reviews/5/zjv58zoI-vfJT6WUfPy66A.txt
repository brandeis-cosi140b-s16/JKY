We go here for dinner about 1-2 times a month and decided to have our wedding rehearsal dinner here a couple weeks ago.  There were about 30 of us.  We were impressed, and didn't expect everything to run as smoothly as it did.  Not only was the food fantastic, but the service was exceptional.  Amanda took great care of us, she knew exactly when drinks and food needed to be refilled without reminders.  The tinga tacos were delicious and the chocolate churro tower was amazing!
