My boyfriend discovered the place after it opened outside of Lee's Liquor. We have a meal there AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK!

Nate Dog... truly fantastic! I will never do just ketchup and mustard again.
Chicken and beef and pork tacos are all divine. I can't get enough. I have to order one of them each time we go. Sweet but with a nice spicy kick that gets your mouth going.
Crazy Sweet Dough - best desert food I've had in a long time. Reminds me of some sort of wonderful carnival food (without the screaming children and gross person behind the counter).
The Not So Fries? Addicting. 

He also does "weekly specials" so make sure you hit up HANSHIK TACO on Facebook or Twitter. Last week was the "Halloweiner" and this week he had a special of coconut dusted hot wings and red curry dipping sauce.  TO DIE FOR. 

PLUS - The owner is a super rad super laid back guy who loves to chat it up while he's making our food to order. I've had to wait a while for my food before but I'm the type of person that will come again and again if you make my wait and my experience worthwhile. HANSHIK TACO certainly does that 

Check him out! And bring your friends! And then bring more of your friends!
