Out of all the small local asadero / taqueria in the downtown Phoenix area we have tried, we continue to return! They have consistent, quality and authentic Mexican food! The service is always friendly and fast. Do not be deceived by the look, or the lack of parking, the food and service (bilingual) is worth a stop.
