What a great experience that my friend and I had tonight at the Corn Flower.  The staff was superb and friendly and the food was excellent.  The green chile chicken enchilada was so good I could have licked the plate clean!!  I went with a friend and since it was our first time we tried a little of everything - empanadas, tamale, tacquitos, chips/salsa/guac, and peach cake.  I definitely will be back for more!!!!
