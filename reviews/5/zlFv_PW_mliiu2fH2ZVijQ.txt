FISH TACOS! FISH TACOS! FISH! TACOS! Lol
Came today to try them as recommended by my husband and OH. MY. GAWD! To die for! So delicious! Very flavorful! I loved them! The lady working the counter (1 of the owners possibly?) was very friendly and made us feel very welcome. The cook even came from the back to greet us as well. She asked in the middle of the meal if we needed anything and how everything was tasting. Great food. Great customer service. A little pricey but man those tacos were so worth it. And they even have churros!
