I've seen many food places come into this location and not do well cause of the poor food quality and many other issues but this place is different. The staff is always extremely helpful and polite, the prices are truly unbeatable and all the prices on food are including tax which makes things alot simpler. I wanted to give this place a try regardless of the food quality simply cause of how polite and kind the people running it treated me. Later on i found out that the food is very good, I'd even say some of the best authentic mexican food I've had in a while here in vegas. I highly recommend giving this place a try.
