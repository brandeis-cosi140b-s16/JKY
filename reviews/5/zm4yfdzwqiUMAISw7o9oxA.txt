Lived in AZ my whole life. Easily some of the best Mexican food I've ever experienced.  A father and his sons sitting near us -- we heard one of the sons repeatedly saying "this is the best damn torta I've ever had!"  I had the best damn asada torta, too.  The misses loved her street tacos: cochinita, pastor, and asada.  Very reasonable prices, clean, comfortable atmosphere, and some damn good food. One of our new go-to restaurants.
