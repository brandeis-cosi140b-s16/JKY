My two friends and I are big sushi fans. I have to admit we were skeptical about a Mexican Sushi place. Well, the rolls were very good, very fresh, and well made. We each ordered a couple rolls and shared, all of them were really good. We also tried the Mexican food, a taco and a burrito and both were very good. The carne asada was awesome and our waitress suggested the adobado sauce on the carne asada. It was darn good.

Our waitress Selena was very friendly and provided excellent service. We are really looking forward to going back.

I would highly recommend this place to anyone!
