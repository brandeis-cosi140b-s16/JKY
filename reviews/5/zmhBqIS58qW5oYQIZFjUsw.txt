This place is amazing!  Hands down best Mexican food and it's located in a little 'tiendita'  Go on the weekends and when they have delicious carnitas.  You have not tasted carnitas until you have tried theirs.  Ask for a sample, they will give you a little hunk for free.  And even the tongue here is amazing.  

Blows away El Torro, Dos, Amigos and all the other places on campus.  Make sure you wash it down with a Jarrito...preferably Tamarind.  Trust these west coast people, they know their stuff!
