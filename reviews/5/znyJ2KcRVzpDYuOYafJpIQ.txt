This place is awesome! It's tucked into a little industrial strip mall behind the Fresh n' Easy at Baseline and Kyrene, so it is a little hard to find. Once you get here however, the trip is so worth it. The place is small, but jamming on karaoke nights (Tuesday and Friday). The food is restaurant quality! Five of us had plain nachos, enchiladas, carnitas tacos, and a carnitas quesadilla, and we were stuffed by the time we left. That combined with the Dos Equis on tap, and the friendly staff and regulars, and we were sold! Definitely going to be visiting this little bar frequently.
