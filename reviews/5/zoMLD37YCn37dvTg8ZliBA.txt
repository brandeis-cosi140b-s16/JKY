I have been coming to Ramiro's since last October when a friend of mine said, hey lets grab a breakfast burrito! OMG! it was so good! Packed full of yummy goodness to the point that I have been back many times just for the breakfast burritos alone. Fast track to their nachos, regular burritos, tacos, you name it, I have tried it and it was delicious. Like Ashley said, this place isn't a "Berto's" by any means, they are better! I have and will continue to come back for more!
