So my boyfriend and I weren't on our side of town and we were craving some good mexican food. Did a search and found El Frescos Cocina. A bit hard to find, but something good doesn't always come easy right!? Is what we were thinking. From entering we noticed a lot of sugar skulls and day of the dead art and figures in the restaurant which I thought was pretty neat, and different. After looking over the menu, my boyfriend and I decided to just get  chicken, and carne asada tortas. By our surprise, each one was deliciously seasoned/marinated and full of flavor. My boyfriend said, that had to have been the best carne asada he's ever had. After finishing our plates, we thought, if the chicken and asada tortas were delicious, we could only imagine the rest of their dishes. After speaking with the owner and the chef... They have so much passion for what they have created and that is why it shows through their dishes. Will definitely be back, with friends!!
