I had a layover in Phoenix and was looking for four thinks: a Starbucks mug, a Suns t-shirt, something to eat and a beer.  If you were hoping I could accomplish all four goals at Los Taquitos, I'm sorry to disappoint you. 

I ordered an AZ style carne asada burrito and it was the shit! It came complete with rice, beans and two sauces. All of it was outstanding and provided the base I'll need for a night in Vegas. I washed it all down with a tasty Hop Street beer. I couldn't have asked for a better airport stop. Well, unless they had Suns shirts. But alas, they did not.
