A-MA-ZING. LOVED the complimentary ceviche! we ordered the fish taco platter (5 stars) and burrito (3 stars, this is a SEAFOOD place folks). i would come here again when i visit phx next time. it's only 4 ish miles from the airport and there's a gas station right next to the restaurant! we filled up our rental and drove off, stomachs full of happiness.
