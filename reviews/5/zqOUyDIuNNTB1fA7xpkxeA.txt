Amazingly good Mexican food!  I had the shrimp cocktail and the Asada burrito. The shrimp cocktail was extremely fresh tasting for the being in the desert. The Asada burrito was fantastic. Some of the best marinated steak I've had in a Mexican restaurant.  I'm pretty sure the owner is cooking the food so that's always a plus.  Clean bathrooms and dining area. Yummy food!  Will be back.
