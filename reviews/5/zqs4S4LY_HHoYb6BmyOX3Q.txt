Excellent customer service at this location every time I come. This pparticular time the boy at the window suggested if I would like no sour cream on the extra two grillers that I got and I didn't even know they came with sour cream but he noticed that I didn't want sour cream on my other item so he kind of reminded me to not get sour cream so I thought that was pretty cool and thanks for that because my husband totally wouldn't have ate it if it had sour cream :)
