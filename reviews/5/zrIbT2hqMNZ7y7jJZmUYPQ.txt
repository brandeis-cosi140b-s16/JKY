Visiting from San Diego and a friend took me here and I loved it!  Such a cool atmosphere being that it was an old and beautiful church!  Just had a couple tacos (curry snapper and the lamb) which were very good along with a couple beers but the best was the service!  Candice really made the experience great and I would definitely recommend her if you go in!  She was SO fun and very engaging, clinching the experience! Well done Candice, we thought you were fantastic!
