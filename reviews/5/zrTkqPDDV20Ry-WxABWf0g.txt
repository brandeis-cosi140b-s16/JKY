When it comes to Don Pedro, I definitely enjoy my time. The staff was friendly, the food was delicious and the layout of the place was very relax and chill. This place is definitely a great to come and get a nice meal at a good price. I originally came because me and a coworker were watching a soccer game before heading to work and from the moment I arrived they were always helpful and simply ready for all of our orders. I had the queso dip which was perfect in every aspect. The texture, taste and thickness were simply all on point. Plus, I ordered two mai thais and although strong in alcohol, it was still good. Anyway, I had some fish tacos and let me tell you, although the tacos were small, everything else will get you full. A lot of fish bits, a lot of rice and lots of black beans, I have to say you will end up taking some home. I will have to recommend this place to anyone looking for some good Mexican Food in the University area and you have to stop by so you can get your grub on.
