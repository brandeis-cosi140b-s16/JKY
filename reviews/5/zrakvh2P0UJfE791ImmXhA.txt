OH. MY. PIZZA.

I went with a friend one night and even though it was jam packed, we were seated right away.  Our server promptly greeted us and was very enthuastic.  We ordered a couple of beers and two pizzas: the Carbonara and the Forza.  

And let me tell you... this was some of the best pizza that I have ever consumed.  The Carbonara has mozzarella, mushrooms, bacon, scallions, and three soft cooked eggs.  Sound gross? Well, shame on you! It was so delicious.  The egg yolks were an amazing addition to the pizza.  

The Forza had gouda on it, which I think should be reason enough to visit Sal's and to try this pizza.  It was so savory and delicious.  

I can't wait until I can go back and try more pizza.  

Some people don't dig the space because it is very small and can be cramped when there are a lot of people eating, but honestly, I didn't care at all.  I was way too busy jamming pizza into my mouth to even notice that anyone else was in the room.
