So here you are...  reading this review. What you should be doing is DRIVING THERE  FOR FISH TACOS... NOW!!!! :)

Folks, this is some good eating. I also got the spicy carne asada burro. delicioso! 

If you plan on eating there, go around 11:15ish.. If not, you might want to consider taking it to go. 

One more thing. Someone stated that the wait is worth it, and I totally agree. No, it wasn't fast food per say, but I was in and out in 45 minutes grinning from ear to ear. See you every week from now on Atoyac!
