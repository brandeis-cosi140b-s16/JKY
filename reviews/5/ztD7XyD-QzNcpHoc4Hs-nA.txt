It's been said already:

These are the best tamales you will ever taste.

Dona Maria's been hanging around downtown since 1980 on the corner of Charleston and Las Vegas Boulevard.  It's not the most visited of areas, especially for dining, and Dona Maria's has been here and packed for almost 30 years.  They recently opened another restaurant in Summerlin so you won't have to drive your nice car downtown (wasn't that sweet?)  The reason why it's done so well are the tamales.  They are out of this world.  They come in pork, chicken and cheese with expertly crafted sauces.  The rest of the menu is great as well - just good Mexican food - but really, people come here for the tamales.
