Who would have thought you could find a fresh, amazing tasting, Al Pastor all-meat burrito and carnitas tacos at a quarter after 1 in the morning?
Great salsa bar, too.
This squeaky-clean restaurant is a real stand out, considering the slightly sketchy location.
If I didn't live 400 miles away, I'd eat here five times a week!
This is the best Mexican fast-food I've ever eaten and, I live on the stuff!
Will definitely be back, there is a lot more on the menu I have got to try.
