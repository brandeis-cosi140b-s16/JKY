The food is good and yes if people look at the outside and get turn off for not being up to par then this is not your place. It's like the old saying never judge a book by its cover. I recommend trying something different. Don't go in there ordering a breakfast burrito and expect to be the best you ever tasted. Go outside the box and try a new food.
