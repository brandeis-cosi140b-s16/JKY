Best FISH TACO EVER! For fast easy and cheap Mexican this is your place! I have never had a bad experience here. I know it doesn't look like much but it's great! Ok. It's not super authentic but, it's enough to hit the spot! The portions are huge and everything is made fresh to order. The tacos and the enchiladas are the best and they have a lot of great specials on Tuesdays! A for sure Mexican takeout to try! Enjoy!!!!
