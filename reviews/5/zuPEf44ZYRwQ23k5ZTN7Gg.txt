Update: The Chile Verde Nachos are probably the best nachos I have ever eaten.

They. 
Are. 
Amazing! 

Thoroughly enjoyed every single thing we've had here. 

Mulitas are awesome and the new menu additions like nachos and sopes frigging rock! The mole poblano enchiladas are a little bit of heaven. Quite a deal at $6.50, too. 

Cemitas son Muy bueno! A meal and a half right there! Zippy, too!
