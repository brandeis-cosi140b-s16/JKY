I'm not crazy about seafood.  Maybe because I've never had it serve so well.  I was a little put off when we went into San Diego Bay and, having read the menu cover to cover, finding no no chicken or beef plates.  I decided I would suck it up and have a shrimp dish.  Of all the creatures of sea, shrimp are probably the least offensive to me.  I ordered the shrimp molcajete, based mostly on the menu picture.  I looked like a basic stew.  When came to the table was a surprise.  The molcajete, which is a bowl carved from stone, had been heated in the oven and the stew poured into that.  The stew was still bubbling vigorously when it arrived at the table.  The dish was shrimp, of course, served in a stew of tomato, cheese, chiles, and spices.  The base may have been like a shrimp bisque, but I couldn't really tell.  It was fantastic.  I told the waitress it was the best thing I'd had in a long time.  My mom had a similar shrimp stew.  It was substantially more cheesy than mine, and with less fire, but very good as well.  Other items I noted on the menu: marlin tacos, octopus, whole red snapper.
