Cabo Fish Taco is not only delicious, but eccentric and affordable.  This is a "must" for Charlotteans and their visitors.  If you haven't experienced a fish taco from Cabo Fish Taco you need to grab a friend and go and check it out this week!  Be aware that the atmosphere is fun, lively and quite loud, not a quiet or dull dinner.  Yum, yum!
