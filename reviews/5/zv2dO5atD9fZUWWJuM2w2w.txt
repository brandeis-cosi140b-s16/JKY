This place got crowded as heck around 6pm when I came in. 
I stayed at the hotel for several days so I tried a couple things off the menu. 
I tried: Naco Torta, breakfast burrito, Pica Rico burger, guacamole, shrimp taco, and the Funkin' Gonuts Coconut Dunkelweizen beer. 

If you only get one thing at this restaurant, get the Funkin' Gonuts Coconut beer. It was so good and so unique that I asked the bartender to take a picture of the beer tap handle with my cellphone because I wanted to remember the name when I got back home in Los Angeles. I found out that the company that makes this beer has been in business for only a couple months and distributes only in Arizona. Can't rave enough about the beer, so good. 

The Pica Rico was also super delicious especially because of the grilled pepper inside. It went nicely with the beer. 

Guacamole was okay for me actually. The shrimp taco was also good, but I tried better. And the Naco Torta was excellent when you try it with the eggs done over easy. Lastly, don't get the breakfast burrito. That was a definite miss for me.
