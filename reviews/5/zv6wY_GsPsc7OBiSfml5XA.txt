So glad I finally managed to resist the temptation of the In-N-Out across the street, because Juan's was an incredible experience. 

The food is clearly great. We ordered the chicken fajitas - they were juicy, flavorful, and the spectacle of the flames made them even more enjoyable. (One other thing to note: one order was requested to be well done, and the other wasn't; the restaurant did an excellent job of cooking those two and they even came out at the same time). The free soup was good, too. I was definitely a big fan of the salsa since it didn't have huge chunks in it and it also had a little kick. 

But, the main selling point of this place was the customer service. Every staff member we interacted with was kind and attentive, bringing the sides/condiments we needed with no wait. We never even had to ask for water refills or extra tortillas; they were always on top of things. Everyone seemed genuinely interested in how our experience was, as well.

Just as we thought it couldn't get any better, our waiter returned with a complimentary churro dessert to commorate our first visit! It was an extremely kind gesture - this place really knows how to lure in customers and keep them coming! Make sure you visit this place if you're looking to be treated well and eat the most delicious fajitas on this side of town.
