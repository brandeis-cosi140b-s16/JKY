Date Attended: 10/28/14 (Carryout)

Item Ordered: Santa Fe Salad, Side Salad with Chicken, Steak Salad, House Guacamole Salad, Nachos (3 orders), Pork Wings, Short Ribs (2 orders)

Price : $102 (ridiculously low prices)

Service: The staff was very helpful staggering the time when items came out so they could be loaded in the car. Everything was labeled correctly and all no items were missing in any of the orders.  

Atmosphere: Pretty basic inside. All tables and no booths. The bar had a small amount of tequila options.

Food Quality: This is where they SHINED. The food was fricking amazing, the price was even better, and the portions were insane. When ordering the nachos, make sure that 2-3 people are sharing them. Nobody that ordered nachos were able to finish the entire dish. I've never seen an entree with two actual short ribs for this price. We are still trying to figure out why the food is so good, so cheap, and portions are so large.

Overall Experience: Of the 8 people that ordered all reviews were 4.5-5 star with 5 star the majority.
