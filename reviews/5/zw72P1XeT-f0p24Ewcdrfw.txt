I have been eating here for years. This is real Mexican food. Let me give you a couple of pointers...  Taqueria means Taco Stand. So order tacos!  They have had real soft corn tortilla tacos since they opened. I find it interesting that lots of restaurants are adding these to their menu now. I like the steak tacos they best. Tacos asada!
Also... They have margaritas now!
