This place is awesome! The staff greets you right away & seem real genuine! They explained all the menu choices & even offered us some samples of the meat choices. 
Very nice staff - excellent food - I'm craving this place right now - back to Vegas real soon!!!
Pinball Hall of Fame + Tacos Tijuana = Heaven :))))
See you soon!
