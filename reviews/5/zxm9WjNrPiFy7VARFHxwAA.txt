Very impressed with the food and the owner's (Jolene Manning) drive to provide both great food and a great eating experience.  Impressive menu and while the Red Burger, Green Chili Cheeseburger, and Chicken Taco were tasty (in that order) the best dish by far was the Sloppi Jo; and not a traditional Sloppy Jo in any way!  Pulled pork, a sunny side up egg with a sprinkle of pepper powder, red chile sauce, and pickled onions served on a flour tortilla.  Simply outstanding!!  I had the Sloppi Jo, the Red Burger, and the Green Chili Cheeseburger along with a Mandarin orange soda and for dessert a vanilla tres leche cupcake that required a fork to eat (not huge but a fork needed).  Also a chocolate cupcake with cream cheese topping and then a bit of chocolate sauce.  Finally, the chili peppers on the food, that the food was cooked in, or soaked in are from Hatch, NM and add an additional taste that really makes the meal(s).
