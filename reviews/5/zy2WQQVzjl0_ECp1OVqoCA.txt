This review is 4-1/2 stars.  Our server, Justin is AWESOME!!!!!  He made the visit a blast and a fellow server that chimed in here and there.  =)  Even the food runner had fun conversations with us.

I was on the my way home, then I get a text.  HH?  On a Friday night, after being locked in a room for 9 hours to work a project.  HELL to the yes (borrowing from Glee).  I walked in and found L & M all happy from HH specials.  The table was 3/4 full of food and drinks.  I had to join in on ordering food....

CATFISH BEIGNETS:  My favies!  Fried light and spices just right.

CAST-IRON SKILLET DUMPLINGS:  chcken and shrimp filled, the skillet get the dumpling skin to have that pan fried crispiness.  

FLAT TOP GRILLED QUESADILLA:  Quesadilla - Nothing special

CHILE PORK TOSTADAS:  These are yummy.  Each clumpy of yummy pork on their crispy tostadas. 

BLACKENED CATFISH TACOS:  It was more a roll than a taco.  It was ok.
