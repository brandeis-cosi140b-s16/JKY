I've eaten here several times now & the chile rellenos are always perfect! The owner is super friendly & remembered me after the first visit. I had my carnitas taco made into a tostada today & it was to die for, though you do need to eat it quick before the center gets soggy. They need to put that option on the menu! They also deliver. LOVE this place!
