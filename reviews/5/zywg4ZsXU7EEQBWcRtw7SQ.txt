Abuelos was great! Was here with my boyfriend and have enchiladas and queso and they were both amazing! Had the firecracker shrimp and that was the best!!! Felicia was our server and she was awesome! Her suggestions were not only helpful but delicious! Also had the margarita that come in martini glass made with 1800. Best margarita I have ever had! And it comes with a shaker that is equivalent to two full martini glasses!! Definitely coming back!! Sun thru Friday $3 off all drinks too!!
