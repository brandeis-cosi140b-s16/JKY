A friend recommended this place while exploring the Queen city, no disappointments. 
Its open till 2am, so its perfect for a late dinner. As appetizers, I shared the chips and queso and guacamole. Amazing. Our tacos were served timely in a big plate, which made it easier to share also. Our bartender Karl, made some of the best Margaritas we've had. Outstanding service by staff overall. The decoration is appealing. Good background music also :)
