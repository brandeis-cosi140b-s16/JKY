.My friend Megan flew in from Boston and invited all of her friends to Calico Jack's. When we got there they gave my boyfriend a hard time about his sneakers so we talked to the manager and he let us in. They were also charging a 5$ cover that night which I think is ridiculous. I would never pay money to get into a bar like Calico Jack's so we all left and gave Saddle Ranch our business. I really liked this bar when it first opened but over time the crowd has gone downhill and the doormen are out of control!
