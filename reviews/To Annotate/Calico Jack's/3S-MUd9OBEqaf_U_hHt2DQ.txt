a bunch of us friends came to calico's for a night out , even mix of gals and guys. When we came to the door to get in they didn't let a friend in because his boots were Timberland and the security told us those were "gangster" boots. WTF who says that really, they did not allow my friend in so in turn all 12 of us left to saddle ranch where we spent our money ,and had an awesome time. Stereotyping is what happens at Calico jacks....shame on you...
