I went here for Cinco de Mayo, hearing a lot about it in advertisements. Bad idea!! There was a good crowd and limited seating. My group took a seat next to a couple of other groups and we struck up a conversation. We all ordered food and drinks separately. By the time the waitress brought us our one bottled beer, I had already gone up to the bar, got a drink and drank it. We also ordered all you can eat tacos since she suggested it to us. She returned 40 min. later to tell us they weren't doing it anymore, so we ordered nachos with no tomatoes. It ended up having tomatoes on it, but she couldn't be found, so we scrapped them off. It turns out that the couple next to use had a the same $10 off coupon as us. When we got our separate bills, the waitress said she couldn't use the coupons because we were at the same table. We weren't even at a table. We were on random benches and didn't even know the other group originally. The waitress took our coupons before we got our food and never said anything about not being able to use them then. She brought back her manager who could care less and was extremely RUDE and wouldn't listen. They ended up calling over security and the cops and kicked us out over a coupon that they couldn't apply?!? They then took our barely eaten food that we paid for and threw it all out without asking, when we were waiting to get a box! This place will not last. The group across from us said they were never coming back and it was the WORST service they've ever had. Poor management and rude waitstaff, especially Christina. DO NOT GO HERE!
