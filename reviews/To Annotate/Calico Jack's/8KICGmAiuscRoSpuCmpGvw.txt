A friend and I stopped by for happy hour/dinner. We were seated and ordered the margaritas on special. We ordered a quesadilla (on special) and hot wings. After getting the drinks I asked for chips and salsa (yes...I had to ASK for chips and salsa at a Mexican restaurant). 

The quesadilla and wings were delivered with the chips (yes....it took that long to get the chips). Chips were okay. The wings and quesadilla were tasty...but the salsa and guacamole that came with the quesadilla were really bland...no flavor at all. I ordered a Negra Modelo and waited...and waited...and waited. We were literally the only table in the place but were kept waiting over and over again. 

Our server finally got to pouring my beer and then let me know that the tap was empty and asked if I wanted something else. I didn't....by this time I was over half way done with my meal and opted for a non-alcoholic beverage. The exec chef stopped by to ask how everything was. My friend let him know the salsa was bland and had no flavor. The chef explained that he had heard that before...that he was redoing the menu and that he was going to redo the salsa but he needed to go through what they had. So....you have a Mexican restaurant, you get complaints about the salsa and you want to go through what you have before you make it right? How much salsa do you have in back that you have to go through? 

The topper to our experience is when the bill came. We were charged for the beer we never got and $2 for cheese sauce (no...we didn't order cheese sauce or our wings or quesadilla). We let the manager know because our server was MIA again. He removed the items and our server came with a new check, saying "sorry...I'm a re***d"...how offensive is that?!? We won't be back.
