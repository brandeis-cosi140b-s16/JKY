Came in on a quiet Saturday afternoon. Server was prompt and friendly. However, about 10 minutes into our meal, ROACHES crawling on the walls. We were sitting against the wall and my boyfriend looks up and sees two ROACHES crawling along the base of the sitting wall and one on the wall. He got up and informed the server. As I was standing there waiting for the manager to come out I see a couple more coming out of the corner. Clearly an infest. Well the manager never came out to apologize. The server told us our meal was on them and if we wanted to stick around and finish our food we could move tables. No thank you! Lost my appetite in a major way!!! Also, what a coward the manager was by not coming out and even apologizing for the incident. Will never, ever return! Food consumer beware!!!
