Stopped in here on Sunday afternoon before the Harlem Globetrotters game at Jobing.com Arena. The place was pretty much empty (not a good sign). I liked the look of the place when we walked in, but service was slow and the staff seemed very inexperienced and uninterested. It was also eerily quiet... The food was nothing spectacular or even worth mentioning really - but I will give them a couple points for their chips. Too bad Westgate has so many chains and so little "real local flavor".
