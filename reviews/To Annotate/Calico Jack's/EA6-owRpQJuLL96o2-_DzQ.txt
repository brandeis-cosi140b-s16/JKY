Arrived to no one manning the place. So grabbed menus and sat down. 2 other couples here and 5 filthy dirty food strewn tables. Only sat down due to a buy one get one free entree coupon from a Entertainment book. Must also say up front this is way over priced. 

Wife ordered a Margarita which turned out very nice. My Dr Pepper no ice came out a Coke with ice. 

We wanted the queso dip for $5. In order to get it you must buy the Chips and Salsa for $4 then add on the queso for another $5. So $9 for queso. It has no flavor at all. The salsa taste like hunts tomatoe sauce from a can watered down . So no free chips and salsa first off and you get completely ripped off for the salsa and queso dip. It's true value is $0. Don't eat here.

My wife ordered Caritas Buro and I the Shrimp Fajitas. The Buro has more lettace and what looks like leeks than meat. It was served a bit too cold. My Cajun shrimp fajitas were 0 star. No Cajun seasoning. Tasted like boiled shrimp that were fried. 70% of the veggies were burnt. Got 10 medium shrimp for $20. 3 had tails 1 had the digestive track still in it. So the food is Not seasoned at all and is not prepped properly at all. Eat here at your own risk. We shall never return to such a nasty place.
