You get what you get.

Over played music which was ok to listen to 3 years ago, and even then it was annoying. Everybody seems to be trying find meaning in the bottom of the patron bottle, but here it is ill flavored vodka and crass rum. 

Bothersome promoters, the treacherous bosoms of a money tip hungry bartender defines the motion of this ocean. I got nothing against them, but I am not trying to spend many minutes in places of this level. 
Most often, i was looking at the time wishing the time to leave was not now, but back then. I would recommend this place for one reason, the 2 dollar drinks...and with such cheap drink specials you will understand the reason why they have to dangle carrots to their patrons to pull heads in the bar.

cough.... sorry...i just smelled my own smugness. Oh well....
No worries...everybody has to switch it up.
