I should've read the reviews before ordering food at this place.  After Monday night football, I ordered the Carne Asada taco and my friend ordered the chicken burrito.  It was the worst mexican food we've ever had. We felt stomach discomfort instantly.   I'm 100% sure we're going to pay for it tomorrow morning.  If you visit this place, order beer and chips...if you order the food on their menu, it's on you.
