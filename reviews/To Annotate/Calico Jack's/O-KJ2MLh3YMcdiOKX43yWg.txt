Upon entry, my co-workers and I were a bit skeptical as the place was nearly empty at 1:30pm and there was not a hostess.  Eventually a girl from the kitchen yelled for us to sit anywhere we wanted.  The lunch menu is extremely limited; another 'red flag'. The salsa was really good; the chips were soggy.  Ordered the quesadilla with no meat; which was VERY good! The waitress was friendly, but a bit in over her head.
