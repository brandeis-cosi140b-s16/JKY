NHL hockey night at Jobing.com arena means restaurants are doing crazy business.   With added patrons one would expect management to increased staffing   I've been to a couple of the arena area restaurants in the daytime and they are empty. So, if it's football or hockey there will be a lot of people so be a manager 

I probably would give it a 3 but the service was slow because they were  understaffed.  Draft Coors light not very cold.  Food was forgettable , which means average.  But the main reason I will eschew this place was the restroom attendant.  It is a small bathroom, real small.  It was creepy, very creepy.  Female friend said same in the ladies room.  I've been in really nice expensive restaurants with huge bathrooms with attendants.      I still think needing someone to have to hand you a paper towel is superfluous anywhere.  But at Calico  Jacks  it was worse than superfluous, it was pretentious. I will go back to the Saddlehouse where they trust you to pee without a supervisor.
