I have never written a review before but since this place was so TERRIBLE, I felt like a review was needed. Shortly after getting out of a football game across the street, our group walked in to what felt like 100 degree weather. There was no AC except for a couple ceiling fans; it felt as if I was actually eating my meal in Mexico... When we asked for chips and salsa, they were out of salsa and brought us guacamole instead, which they then charged us for without notice. Last but not least the chips were stale, the food was horrible!!!!!  the beer was hot, the service was AWEFUL and it cost about 90 dollars for three people to eat. I wish I could give this establishment -5 stars. DO NOT EAT HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
