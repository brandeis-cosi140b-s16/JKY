HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!! 
Absolute worst Mexican food.  If I could give negative stars on this review I would.  
I hosted a private party here with a taco bar for my son's graduation.  The food was terrible and the set up was even worse.  The plates had dried food debris all over them, the table cloths were stained and dirty, the service was sub par.  I had to hunt down someone several times to refill chips for the "chips & salsa" I was charged $30 for.  They only supplied limited tortillas for the taco bar and never brought more.  For a party of 26 the total bill came to $760...this included a mandatory 23% gratuity that was definitely not earned!  I emailed them afterwards to express my disappointment and they didn't even have the courtesy to respond.
I recommend you steer clear of this place.
