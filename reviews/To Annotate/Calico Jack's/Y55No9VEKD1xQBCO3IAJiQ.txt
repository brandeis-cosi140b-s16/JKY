DON'T WASTE MONEY!!! The "hostess" was in short shorts and I thought she was a customer!! Service was slow and inadequate-we waited too long to GIVE our order. Then too long for check to get to us! I ordered the "mini" thingys and they were bland. The dipping sauce did help with taste. Hubby says wings were not cooked enough. He did bring them home so we can cook them more. Then there are no "to go" boxes and the rest of our (mediocre) wings had to be wrapped in tin foil. Tried to pay with Discover, nope, another minus!! The bartender WAS trying to help our server as he asked to bring more iced tea and HE checked on us couple times. The only reason we stopped is we were at the stadium for an event and Calico Jacks has Buzztime.  Sorry, not worth it. We'll go to our usual watering hole next time.

YOU SO NEED "RESTAURANT IMPOSSIBLE"!!!!
