First time going here before the Coyotes game.  Service was decent, however the food was terrible and overpriced.  Worst mexican food I've ever had.  Also there was a golf video game next to our table that was randomly making noise.  Asked about turning it off or down and they said there was nothing they could do.  Didn't offer to move us or anything.  Not going back here.
