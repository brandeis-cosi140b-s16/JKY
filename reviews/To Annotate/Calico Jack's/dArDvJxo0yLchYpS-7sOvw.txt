Worst Mexican food I can remember eating and/or paying...hoping somebody that runs this place is aware of how terribly bad they are...we seriously debated walking out on our 90$ bill because first of all 3 ppl 90$ is f*#king ridiculous for the food they served and because our server could not have been more worthless...this establishment is a JOKE
