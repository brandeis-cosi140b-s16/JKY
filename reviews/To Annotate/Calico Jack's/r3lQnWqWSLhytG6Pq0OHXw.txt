I don't know where to begin.  We were there on a Wednesday night at 6ish. The place was empty and  we sat outside on the patio.  It was happy hour so we ordered 2 appetizers( cheesy tots and 7 layer dip), which were the best part of the whole meal.  Here's where the night goes down hill....out come our meals and 2 of our party of 5 ordered steak fajitas, and the server brought chicken.  No problem she made a mistake, she takes it back the rest of us eat our meals, thinking that the fajitas will be out shortly...wrong!  We. Are now done and still no fajita, but out come fajitas to another table.  At this point the waitress has started to act like we don't exist.  It's now 7:40 and no fajitas.  Another waiter sees we are stairing at the door and asks if we are ok or need anything, and we explain.  Finally out come fajitas.  Our waitress drops them off and disappears again. The manager does come over and comps the fajitas and offers us a round of drinks! Sweet!  It's now 8:15 and we would like to leave but can't find someone for the bill.  Flag down our waitress and she gets the bill.  Wanna guess?  It's not right.  1 fajita not compted, sides of stuff we ordered but never got, apps not half off ( because we had been there for so long) it was not happy hour. Needless to say the bill had to be changed 3 times, at one point the waitress tried to snatch it out of my husbands hand.   The whole thing was a hot mess.  I had a hard time putting 1 star but the patio is a great place and the appetizers were pretty good.
