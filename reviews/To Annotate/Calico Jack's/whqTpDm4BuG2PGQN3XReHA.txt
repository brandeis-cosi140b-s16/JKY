I honestly loved this place until last night. My friends and I were sitting on a bench in front of the place after leaving my friend asked how do we enter the Halloween costume contest? And the bouncers response was you are too drunk to enter? I thought the comment was rude and uncalled for so I said are you serious? And was upset because all we asked was a question. If he didn't know the answer he could have just walked away. Then everyone of his coworkers took his side and when we got loud they called the police/security and they didn't even listen to our side of the story. Long story short I will never go there again. I won't be disrespected and give money to people who don't give a fuck.
