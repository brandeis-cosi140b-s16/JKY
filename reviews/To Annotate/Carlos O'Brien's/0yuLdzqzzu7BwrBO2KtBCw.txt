I ripped Carlos a new taquito hole three winters ago, but today's experience was much improved, and I've never been so pleased to add an update. 

The hostess led us towards an "upstairs"  booth, but quickly recognized that my elderly mom doesnt walk that well, and offered "lower level" seating instead.  We didnt take it, but I cant tell you what a good impression it makes when the first person who greets you "gets it". Someone who anticipates needs rather than waits for you to explain them. 

Our server was good too. Pleasant, but not overly familiar or chatty, and absolutely efficient. No mistakes.   

My favorite (and least expected) discovery was what I think they call a "Healthy Menu" or something.  Shrimp Macho (ok, stop laughing)  had six good sized shrimp,  shells removed, quite nicely seasoned and pretty well cooked.  It was $7.95 with standard mexican combo sides. I thought it was a very good value, and if the sides were better, an outstanding one. 

Lunch for two, which includes a big basket of chips, was $20 before tip.

Why only three stars, when my apoplectic rant (see below) bestowed two? Well, the chips and salsa are pretty bad. The drinks come in those awful little plastic "glasses" that hide dirt and god knows what. The back of the booths provide zero back support. It's just not a five, or even four, star place. 

But today's third star represents a wholesale change in at least one customer's opinion of Carlos.  It will probably never be my favorite spot, but I previously railed that no one here "gave a shit."  That's obviously changed and is worthy of mention.
