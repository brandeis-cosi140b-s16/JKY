This isn't my favorite Mexican Place in the Phoenix area BUT it's Good!  I love their Tacos, Cheese Enchiladas, Chimi's and their Greenchili.   My friend and I love to order their quesadilla with Green Chili inside...  Their chips are always fresh and the salsa's are good too (I like to mix them together).  They have some tasty Margarita's as well.  I would recommend anyone to go to this restaurant.  On top of great food the service is also good!
