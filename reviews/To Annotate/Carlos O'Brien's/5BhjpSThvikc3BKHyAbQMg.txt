Called in a catering order for my son's birthday party. Couldn't have been easier. Dave took my order and was very thorough to ensure I understood exactly what was included and how it would be delivered. He called on the day to confirm details and arrived right on time. I couldn't have asked for better service.  

The food was good, too. We had mini tacos, flautas, plus green corn tamales and pollo fundido. Everything was hot, flavorful. Came with generous amounts of chips, salsa, rice and beans. I ordered black beans instead of refried and they were awesome, too! I ordered a bit extra and my family loved taking home some leftovers. 

 I considered a couple of different options for Mexican food catering and prices were pretty comparable. So glad I chose Carlos, as the food and service were terrific.  Dinner was just as good as when we visit the restaurant -- YUM!
