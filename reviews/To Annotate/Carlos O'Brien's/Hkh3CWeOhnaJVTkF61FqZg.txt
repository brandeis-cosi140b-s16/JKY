This has got to be the best Mexican Restaurant in Phoenix that I've ever eaten at.

Then again, it's really the only Mexican Restaurant that I've ever eaten at in Phoenix in the last 20 years.

I'm from Sacramento, and it really beats any Mexican food that we've got up there. Proximity might have a lot to do with it, but I really appreciated the food. The portions were plentiful, the food was top notch and spicy, but the service really needed to improve. 

I was waiting for a doggie bag and a box for 20 minutes.

Otherwise, I'd recommend it heartily.
