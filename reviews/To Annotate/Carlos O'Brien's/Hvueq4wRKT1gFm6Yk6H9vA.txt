I've been going to Carlos O'Brien's since I was a child. It's one of the finest mexican food establishments in the valley!

I admit that I am in a perpetual rut with regards to their dishes; I never eat anything but chimichangas!

However, my mother always has the pollo fundido, which I've also tried; it's AMAZING!

I love their salsa as well.

I've been going for 20 years, I'm not stopping any time soon!
