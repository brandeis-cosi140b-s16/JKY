Carlos O'briens is a solid 3 stars. The service is hardly ever bad, but it is hardly ever amazing either.

The food is decent. They do have the best Pollo Fundido ever which really sums up the trick, it is bland white people mexican food; which is not an insult. Nor is it necessarily a compliment.

They are a good go to place for a sunday lunch, but if someone is visiting from out of town, you probably want to take them somewhere else.
