I was visiting the Phoenix area on business and tried out Carlos O'Brien's, which really doesn't sound like a Mexican restaurant. 

The food and service were both excellent. And the portions were enough to fill me up after a full of activity. The salmon was well done, as were the beans and rice.

If I ever visit Arizona again I will definitely make a stop at Carlos O'Brien's.
