We just moved in the area and were looking forward in having our Friday Family dinners here. Waited 20 minutes for our waitress. No apology nothing just asked us for our drinks and were we ready to order. Dinner wasn't bad but nothing great... 11.95 for my meal with no rice and beans... $50 later for the three of us kinda made it sting a little more... so I informed the hostess of my concerns, she gave the I will let the manager know answer... So since the food is ok but the service is most likely the norm. I don't think I will be back.. I can do fast food for that kind of service....
I don't think I can give a star due to the service but yelp forces me to.
