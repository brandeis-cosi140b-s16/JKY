I love this place!! I live down the street so I'm there at least once every couple of weeks, more if I had a bad day at work! The food isn't the best, but the carnitas dinner and con carne dinner is delicious!! The service in the bar area is amazing!! Definitely worth trying for happy hour or anytime actually...They treat you like family and we always end up making new friends. There are a lot of regulars that go so it creates a nice friendly environment. I highly recommend this place!
