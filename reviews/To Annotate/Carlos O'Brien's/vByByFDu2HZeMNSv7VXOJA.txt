My husband and I ate at Carlos O'Brien's last night; to our dismay, the food was inedible.  It was a disappointing evening since we do not go out to dinner very often since the recession.

I ordered the Carlos Carnitas Dinner.  The pork tasted dried, rubbery, and days old.  Between us, we ate three bites of it and put it aside.  My husband's dinner, Pollo Fundido, was not any better.  The pollo fundido was over salted and made with poor quality ingredients; the chicken appeared to have come from a can versus fresh, and the cheese tasted processed versus real.  We only ate a couple of bites of it and sadly called it a night, going home to eat bowls of cereal for dinner instead.
