Whever I'm in Phoenix visiting familia, I request that we go to get some "Mexican" comida. I've had their food since I was an adolescente and I can honestly say the food hasn't changed. I still get my customary pollo chimi, with sauce on the side so it doesn't get soggy. Muy bueno! The chips/salsa at Mexican places can reel me in faster than a sugar daddy with a helicopter and Carlos knows his chips and salsa.
