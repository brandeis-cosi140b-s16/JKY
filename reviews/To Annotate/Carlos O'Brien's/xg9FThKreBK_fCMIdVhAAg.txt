This is not the place it used to be.  We ordered a cheese crisp and it came out limp and not very hot.  Waitress had another cooked and this time the bottom layer tasted like a cracker.  So disappointed.  Next we had the queso dip which was amazing. Portion was just smaller.  Chips were also amazing.
Then to our favorite Pollo Fundido.  And the shells were dark brown and over cooked.  Used to have a wonderful cream cheese on top with cheese and that was even just a little.  Inside was dry.

So disappointing.  We have been going here for 30 years and now I am not sure we will every go back.  Not sure what they did to the food that used to be so great!11
