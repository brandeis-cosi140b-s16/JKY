Visited this place right after checking in to the hotel right across the street for a conference. I was STARVING! A co-worker and I love Mexican food, so we decided to give this place a shot. We were greeted by a hostess, showed to our table, and not long after, the waitress came and got our drink and food order. We had to ask twice for chips and salsa. Salsa was a bit chunky...more like pico, and I don't care for chunks of tomato, so that turned me off. I ordered the chicken deep fried tacos. I really wasn't impressed. No flavor. The tortilla wasn't crispy enough. Not a good meat to veggie to tortilla ratio. Rice and beans were good though. Our flight had been delayed and it was pretty late, so when we were ready for our check, our waitress was no where to be found. I'm not sure that I'll ever try this place again if I'm ever back this way...
