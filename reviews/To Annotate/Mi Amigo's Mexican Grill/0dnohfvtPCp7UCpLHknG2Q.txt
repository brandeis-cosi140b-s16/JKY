*This is really a 2.5 star restaurant but it gets the benefit of the doubt for being the only Mexican restaurant in reasonable walking distance from my work downtown, can't believe there aren't more Mexican restaurants centered downtown*

I have only eaten here for lunch - they have decent chips and salsa (mix the regular salsa with their separate hot sauce salsa) and their lunch prices are probably average...slightly on the high side for Mexican lunch, in my opinion.

They have a blue margarita for $2.50...it's pretty sweet (not my favorite), but good value for a drink.  

Service is usually good, typically they are attentive with drinks, chips, and bringing the bill.  

If you remember the Matador downtown, this is a step down in all aspects of a resaurant except for maybe speed of service where it's a tie.

All in all - this is Phoenix, AZ.  You should not settle for mediocre Mexican food at above average prices, but for lack of options, this is an acceptable option.
