It's a casual spot with great happy hour prices. I had the margarita for only $2.50. Get it frozen or on ice. The food was pretty standard for a casual family joint. Nothing spectacular but it wasn't bad. Don't expect super authentic Mexican food, just something to fill your tummy while you enjoy happy hour.
The space was nice and bright. Comfortable space and seating. Servers and host were friendly.
