2.5/5 potential

i think they have good ideas. or maybe i ordered the wrong thing. i got this chicken parmesan type dish, only made mexican style. it came with a well cooked spaghetti in a bright cilantro pesto, the the chicken was sauced with chipotle rather than marinara. then it came with a small side salad and avocado. pretty decent, no?

problem is the chicken wasn't well cooked, it was kinda burnt and dry, the pasta was a little too salty, etc. i also tried a taco and it was greasy and the shell was kinda stale. 

anyways, i think the ideas here are good, just need better execution.
