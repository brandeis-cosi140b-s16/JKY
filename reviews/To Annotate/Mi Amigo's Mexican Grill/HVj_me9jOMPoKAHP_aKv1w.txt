The service here is what gets it 3 stars.  However, the food itself is kind of mehh.  I had the chimichanga and it was slightly over fried.  It came with rice and beans, which were also slightly disappointing.

The dessert was phenomenal, though.  Fried ice cream and flan.  The flan was amazing, the fried ice cream came in vanilla caramel chocolate and strawberry.  Very, very good.  The prices are also decent and again, the service is amazing.
