Headed here for a quick dinner at the bar after a long day. My food came out quick, and was decent as far as Mexican food goes. However, the service was really slow and poor overall. The place was nearly empty with servers running around to help ghosts and the bartender going to take orders at booths....It took me less than 20 minutes to get my food and eat but I had to wait another 20 just to pay up and leave the restaurant!
