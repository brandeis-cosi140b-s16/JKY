Very pleasant surprise! They use lard for only a couple of items and you can get them without lard. The salsa and veggies were bomb. The tortilla my burrito was wrapped in was fresh and wad easily cut through. Our server was attentive, quick, and appeared happy. I couldn't leave this place without yelping. From this experience, I think it deserves it.
