I really don't have much to say about this place. I didn't hate it, but didn't love it. 

I do have to say that if you can get in before 6 PM to take advantage of their happy hour pricing, do it. The margarita's I ordered were okay, but not worth the $7.25 a piece I paid for them. 

I ordered the tortilla soup and the crispy shredded beef taco (a la carte). The soup was so-so. A little salty and way too many kernels of corn for my taste. Of course one kernel of corn is too many for me.  And for the tortillas, there was none in the soup. They gave me little crispy shreds to dump in. Eh....

As for the taco. It was good, and the size was perfect for me. But one could argue that it wasn't big enough for the price you pay for it. 

Finally the service was okay. The waitress was very nice and attentive. The food did come out super quick. 

So yeah...that's about it.
