The weather was muy caliente.  Mi padre y mi esposa were mucho thirsty and in need of cervezas frias! This place quenched our thirst and sated our hunger pangs as well with their grande chips y salsa which were muy delicioso! And it was happy hour to boot, which was good because our cervezas cost us fewer pesos! Muy bueno! I glanced at the menu, and it was overwhelmingly huge with lots to choose from.  But since our primary reason for stopping was to cool off on a hot Phoenix afternoon, we'll have to come back at a later date to try the food.
