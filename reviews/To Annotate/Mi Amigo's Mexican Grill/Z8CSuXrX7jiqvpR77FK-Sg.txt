Heading to catch a flick at The Arizona Center. Decided to checked out Mi Amigo's. To start with, it took about 5 minutes before anyone bother to talk to us. Once we did get to order, we opted to share the tortilla soup and the chicken fajitas. The tortilla soup was really bad. It tasted like a mix of chili powder and salt. We ended up sending it back. The chicken fajitas were actually ok, but not great. 

The real downer was the service. Waitstaff appeared to be fairly apathetic about the place. Limited interested in actually taking our order, bringing out food, etc..

Overall, there are much better choices. You should look elsewhere if you are hungry for Mexican food.
