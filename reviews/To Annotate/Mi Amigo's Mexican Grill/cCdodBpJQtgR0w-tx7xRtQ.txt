Your basic Mexican restaurant.  Frankly, it would be a disappointment as a destination in and of itself, but it is a nice alternative for downtown Phoenix business luncheons or meeting friends before a Diamondback/Suns game. It would also work well for parents of the burgeoning number of ASU students downtown. You could meet junior at the Arizona Center without having to embarrass him/her with your presence on campus. 

The restaurant has ample seating capacity for when events nearby bring in the crowds.  Seating outside is limited.  Service on this Saturday was slow, which seems to be a common occurrence. Chips and salsa were served promptly.  The chips are of the light white corn variety, but suffer from a stale mass produced quality.  The salsa was good, but our table requested an alternative sauce with a bit more zest.  It was much tastier and had almost an enchilada sauce quality.  

Food served was uniformly consistent.  Not spectacular, but nothing to complain about.  We had an assortment of tacos and enchiladas.  The happiest diners at our table were the two youngsters who ordered cheese crisps from the kid's menu.

Not a Mexican restaurant to get excited about given the many alternatives around Phoenix, but a decent offering with lots of seating capacity in an area where restaurants tend to have no customers or too many to handle.
