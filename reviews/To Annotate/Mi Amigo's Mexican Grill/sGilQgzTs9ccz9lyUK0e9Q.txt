I had the fish taco platter.  It was good and had both green and purple cabbage.  The tacos came with white rice and black beans (which I love).  I found the salsa hotter than I expected.  The tea was fresh and cold.  

The only thing I would have improved is to have more flavorful fish.  It was a bit bland.  Overall an A-OK place to eat.
