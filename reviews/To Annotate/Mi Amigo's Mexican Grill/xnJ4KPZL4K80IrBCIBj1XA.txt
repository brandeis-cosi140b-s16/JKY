went there for a working lunch with the marketing department. ordered a salad. started eating, it was okay- tasted like a crappy hooters chicken salad. THEN I NOTICED... a small pearly yellow orange bean looking thing in the salad. i poked it with my fork and then lifted it to my nose to smell it. IT WAS A CHEWED UP PEACH JELLY BELLY JELLYBEAN! IN MY SALAD! i was disgusted. told the waiter, showed it to him and he LAUGHED, as if that was a funny joke between buddies. 

can you picture the fat lady in the back mixing up my salad and a chewed up jellybean from her bag falls into my plate and she just keeps going or doesn't notice?!?! i had to actually request that the salad be taken off of my bill - they were still going to charge me for it.

they offered nothing else, no manager came over to talk to me, nothing... as if it was just another customer complaint. lol NEVER GOING BACK THERE!
