When you check in, you get free salsa and chips. I mentioned to the owner that the spicier the better so he said he had a salsa for me.  Spicy with lots of flavors. Count me in!  When it came, it didn't disappoint in the spicy factor.  It did its job. Yummy. As for the chips though, those were nothing special. 
I got two soft tacos - chicken and carnitas. Both pretty decent. For a quick meal and personable service, I'd say this is pretty good.  3 1/2 stars worthy.
