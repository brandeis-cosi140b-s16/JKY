Pretty gosh darn delicious. All of our food was inhaled quickly. The Pico de Gallo was yummy as was the food. I had the chimicanga which was yummy and piping hot all the way through. 
$4.50 margarita was refreshing. Loved that they served it to me in an actual glass with a salt rim. They obviously know what's important in life.
I'm pretty sure the owner took our order. He was such a nice guy and easy to talk to, if only for the few minutes while ordering. 
We waited about 10 minutes for our food (besides the chips and salsa) which felt much longer than I had expected for this place but it was worth it.
