Anthem is buzzing about this place.  It's good, but to be honest, I think the food at Pinanat Nueva was just as good or bettter, and not at a 45 mnute wait.

I got the carne asada, and I had high hopes for it.  It was somewhat anemic, not the asada I was used to.  Asada is grilled, there was no grilling involved.
