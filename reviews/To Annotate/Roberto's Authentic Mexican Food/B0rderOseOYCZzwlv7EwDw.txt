I'm finding it very hard to conjure up good memories about mexican food...

"whats your favorite mexican restaurant?"

**shruggs**

Honestly, with all my visits to Filibertos, Alibertos, Rolibertos, Polibertos, On the Boarder, Chevy's, Arriba's, Nana's, La Parilla Sueza, El Encanto, etc, I cannot say I preffer any of them over the other.  They all mesh together into some big gooey memory of mexican mediocrity.  I mean I like mexican food, I really do, but I guess I've never had a preference to where I have it...

Until now....

I experienced the El Pastor (pork) dish, which had been marinated in a red chile sauce, and was served with rice, refried beans, some pico and a huge ,fresh, HOT flour tortilla.  Delish.  Even my 5 year old who hates ANYTHING that may be remotely caliente was duped into eating some of this... she declared it muy delicioso aswell, but was rather pissed about being tricked into eating mildly spicy food. 

I want nacho's next time.  

Yes its in a gas station.  So what?  Put your big boy pants on and get you some mexi-luvin.
