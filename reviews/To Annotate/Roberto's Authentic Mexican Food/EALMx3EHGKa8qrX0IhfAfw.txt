Not impressed.  Small portions and I would say less than "authentic" tasting.  This is more like a fast-food Mexican place, and the people that work there act like they are working in a fast-food place.  Not friendly at all.  Counter ordering and get your own drinks.  I would not recommend -- there are so many better places.
