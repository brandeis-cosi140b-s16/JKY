So we came in as a buddy said you have to try this place the El pastor rocks! I said ok Ill try it. Wow not good!

First off I have to give them a 4 for service. Would have got a 5 but I had to ask for my chips after waiting 5 min. I mean really I have to wait then remind you to give them to me. First Fail!

Got our food and I was not impressed at all when it came to the meat. NO I mean NO flavor in the El Pastor. I mean really Guy Fieri Has been here. This was horrible. How can any one say its good. My partner ordered chicken. it was OK until she got a large BONE! I mean really a bone!!!!  The manager could only say "Oh we try and check for that but oh so sorry" This was all you could say? I mean pay for our meal make it better dont change the subject and talk about the kids. FAIL! You own this place and want people to return? Not like this you wont. You fail here and BAD!

I will never come back here or recommend any one eating here!
