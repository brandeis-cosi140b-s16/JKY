The first time we came here I just had a bean tostada and a taco, and regretted my choice. It was pretty standard Mexican fare, and maybe even a little below average as their shredded cheddar cheese has a really odd texture, like maybe it has been frozen and thawed a couple of times or something. On the advice of a friend, we tried it again and this time got the Burrito el Pastore, the supreme nachos, and a Mexican pizza. The el Pastore and Nachos were underwhelming, but the Mexican Pizza was really good. I'd go back for that, but won't waste time with everything else next time.
