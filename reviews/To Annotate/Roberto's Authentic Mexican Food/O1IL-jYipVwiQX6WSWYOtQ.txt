After the typical "where do you want to go eat" and the "I dunno...where do YOU wanna go eat?" my hubby and I frequently engage in, we decided to go try out Roberto's Authentic Mexican food restaurant.  It's in a strip mall, so not fancy, but that's okay.  It was crowded on a week night--a good sign.  People eating in and picking up take out--a good sign.  We opted to eat out on the patio, which was a nice option.  The food was not bad.  Hubby is from Texas, so he loves good carnitas but wasn't particularly impressed.  His comment was "not much flavor."  I had a chimichanga which was also not bad.  It would have been better with more than a smear of guacamole and sour cream though.  We also were not told you had to buy salsa and chips so we sat outside waiting for someone to bring us some chips and salsa.  I finally asked a waitress passing by if chips and salsa were extra and she said yes.  Would have been nice to know.  Anyway, not bad...not great.  Just my opinion!
