I love this place!  I don't know how I lived in Anthem for the past 6 months without knowing of its existence, but I am so glad that I discovered it.

The service is fantastic.  Such great people - I love that it is family run and that they are closed on Sundays.  Don't forget to check in on the yelp app - free chips and salsa! 

My absolute favorite item is the Mexican pizza.  Don't let the higher price point sway you.  It is worth every penny of the $12.95 and definitely feeds 2-3.  The California burrito and Horchata are also deeeeeelicious.  

I'm excited to return, and think I'll have to swing by for a breakfast burrito soon.
