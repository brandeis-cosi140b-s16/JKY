What an amazing place !! The food is crazy good !! I've tried something new with each visit and everything I've ever had is super delicious !! It's authentic, flavorful, and I crave it constantly. What's even better is- THEY DELIVER !! So, even if I'm too lazy or just not feeling well, they'll come to me. I highly recommend checking this place out. You won't be sorry - fair warning - it's addicting !! Family owned - family run and the food is made with love -- CHECK IT OUT !!
