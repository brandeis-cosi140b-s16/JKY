I just don't get the love for this place...

Okay, so they were on DD and D w/ Guy Fieri...

Either their food was better when they were in the gas station, or Guy was having an off day.

We have tried Roberto's a half dozen times since moving to Anthem, and ask ourselves every time "why did we come back here?".  

We have tried breakfast, lunch, and dinner.   

In 30 years of eating and enjoying chorizo and egg burritos for breakfast, this is the only place where better than half the burrito ended up in the trash.  I've eaten chorizo from New Mexico to California; from Nogales to Flagstaff, and I have never had such bad chorizo.  The flavor was odd and very un-appealing, not sure if it was past it's prime or just bad.  The tortilla was almost hard enough to drive nails.

We have tried the famous carne asada for both lunch and dinner.  I will say it was tasty, but not earth shattering.  I have had better at several of the "bertos" restaurants.  Rice and beans are so-so, not bad, not great.  Red chile??? thin and bland; and again, that thick hard tortilla.

I will agree w/ many other Yelpers that the service is good.  No complaints there.  I just can't say that the food is good, which is why I go out to eat in the first place.
