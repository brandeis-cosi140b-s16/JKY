There is not one thing I dont like Roberto's, the owners are great, the service is great, the location is like 45 seconds from my house, they deliver, and the food is awesome! My one and only complaint is that they could put more cheese and gauc on the chips cheese and gauc! Other then that, it is sooo good! My husband always gets the Al pastor burrito, it is great, a little spicy for me cause Im a wimp but really good flavors. There is also an Al pastor plate, with bean and rice if the tortilla is too much for you because they are HUGE. The kids meal are simple and my boys love the bean and cheese burritos or the quesadillas, not much to say there! The taquitos are yum and the Mexican Pizza could literally feed a fam of 4 by itself. Its made on one of huge tortillas and is no joke. I havent tried anything I didnt like, seating can be touch and go, but they do a great job with call ahead, take out, and delivery so we always go that route, unless I want a margarita! Its pretty cheap, like $4 for the chips and cheese and maybe $5 or $6 for the huge burrito. If you try any of the burritos, you wont be disappointed!
