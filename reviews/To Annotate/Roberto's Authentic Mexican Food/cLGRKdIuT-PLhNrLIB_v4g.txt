I haven't been since they were in the old location.  Have to be honest and say that I was a little disappointed.   Seems like the prices went up and the quality down.  Had my favorite, 3 al pastor tacos, and paid over $10 for those plus a drink.   Meat was dry, not as good as I remember.   Place looks better than the gas station, but not worth it for me any more.  Guess that's progress for you. :(
