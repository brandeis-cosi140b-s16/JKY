I'm most recently from south Texas and I've had trouble finding Mexican food as good as what i used to get. Roberto's is the closest thing I've found in our community and I'm glad we have it.

I you're a fan of nachos, you have to order theirs. 
Their portions are huge and their food reasonably priced.
They have a cute outdoor seating area and I often see people chilling out there, sipping on what appear to be yummy margaritas.

Their service is great. The man whom I believe to be the owner is so nice! He is so appreciative of each and every customer and seems like a really humble and thankful dude. And don't you love supporting restaurants with people like this?
