Who would have thought the most amazing mexican food would come from inside a Shell gas station?  Seriously, it is so good.  I used to go to this place i North Hollywood that was family run, and had the most amazing food.  I missed it so much, and here it is again!  This is the cleanest gas station I have ever been to. The restaurant is against one wall, and offers tables and table service as well.  The carne asada is to die for.  And, for those who love it (I am not quite that brave) they serve menudo on Saturdays now, as well as Sundays.  What other gas station has been on "Diners, Drive-ins,  and Dives'" Yummy!
