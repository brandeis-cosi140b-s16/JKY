When we travel, we map out Guy Fieri's diners, drive-inns and dives.  Roberto's being our 89th  Triple D Is one of the best that we have gone too. The food is off the hook!  You have to try the Al Pastor we got the taco's , but I am sure anyway you get it you will not be disappointed .The beans the rice ..omg my mouth is watering as I write this back in California.. I love love Mexican food and truly this is the best We ever had. But the best part of being at Roberto's was being so welcomed by Roger and his family. ..Maria who makes her homemade margaritas were the best.  We can't wait to go back to AZ to go have the best Mexican food ever.
