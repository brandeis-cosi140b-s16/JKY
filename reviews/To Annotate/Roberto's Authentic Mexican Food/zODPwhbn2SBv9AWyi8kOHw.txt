Great habanero salsa, (you have to ask for the spicy stuff), and they sell it to go by the jar!  Very good Mexican food made to order.  Chili rellenos are excellent, and beans and rice are better than most places.  Lots of meat on the soft tacos, pork is amazing.  Gringo setting, but good solid food.
