Ok I was looking for some fish tacos and came across this place. If you are looking for fish tacos  than look no  further. Because pretty much that is all they sell. Well that and shrimp. They do also have chicken. Everything is lightly battered.  I got the the shrimp/fish combo tacos. Damn! So good. They have a great salsa/fixing bar that you can load up on the tacos. The  only down side is that they only have fries, no chips? Which is why I took one star off. The guys who own it are great and will give you the 411 on what to try at the salsa bar. Cheap and and the tacos are big. I get two of them and am stuffed.
