This place has great fish tacos.  The tacos come plain, however their salsa bar has lots of toppings available. I especially liked their Chipotle sauce. The review that says the portions are small,  I don't know what they're referring to. The tortilla is a regular size corn tortilla,  and it is FILLED with delicious fried fish. 

The restaurant is small and clean.  The owner I believe is very friendly and attentive.  Just the service alone makes you want to return again.
