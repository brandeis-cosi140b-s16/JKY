Wonderful and refreshing to find such good good north of the border - normally I need to be in Cabo or Rocky point to get such good fish and shrimp tacos - not anymore.  Service was great and helpful with recommendations for the salsa bar pairings - enjoyed to the shrimp corn quesadilla and a couple of full tacos - light breaking flaky and moist fish - a lite cabbage slaw with a bit of their tartar to finish it off - fantastic!!!!!
