My experience wasn't bad, just not up to the hype of all the other reviews. I tried the shrimp, fish, campechana and machaca tacos. The shrimp tacos were the best and the little station filled with fresh toppings was great. It was a bummer that my machaca tacos had a lot of little bones in it, and the horchata drink tasted powdery and sour. I also came at a time when the restaurant wasn't busy, but the floor and some tables were dirty. The smell of fried food also lingered in my hair and clothes when I left lol! Again, the experience wasn't bad, but I don't think I will visit again...I still prefer Americas Taco Shop.
