Having a house in Ensenada Mexico we would always look forward to the fish tacos there. This place hands down has the best fish tacos for AZ. Fresh fish and shrimp. Salsa and condiment bar was nice and clean. I stopped in on Tuesday for buy two get one taco free deal. I got the fish,shrimp and the "governador" a quesadilla with shrimp and fish. I paid a little extra for the governador but worth it. Each taco has plenty,they aren't stingy here. Nice owners too.  You won't be disappointed. We will frequent more often.  buenos los tacos. Gracias.
