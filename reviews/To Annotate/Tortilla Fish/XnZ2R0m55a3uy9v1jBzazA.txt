We just ate at Tortilla Fish today for the first time. All the positive reviews are correct, as it is the best fish taco place in town (and PHX metro for that matter). We tried the steamed fish and the breaded fish and they were both great. The fries were perfect as well. All the condiments are fresh and home made, and the fried jalapenos are super yummy. Our counter person was polite and knowledgeable, and made us feel welcome. We could tell by the steady stream of customers that we found a real gem. Everything is fresh and good and we will certainly be back!
