My wife and I just left Tortilla Fish and we were both impressed. We each had 2 tacos, fries and drinks. The food was very good and tasty. The salsa bar was well stocked with fresh items. The staff was pleasant and helpful and ready to please. Noticed on the menu they have fish and fries, which we will try on our next trip.
