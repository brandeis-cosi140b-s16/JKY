UPDATE #2: OK.... I'm really impressed now. The owner responded to my recent update regarding the ventilation system at the restaurant. He assured me that the ventilation system has been fixed. I haven't been back yet, but other coworkers confirmed that there was no lingering odor when they lunched there on Friday. I'm going to give this place four stars again because the owner seems to be a gentleman who cares about his customers and their experience at his restaurant. I will be back on Wednesday for lunch and I'm really looking forward to it!
