The food here is delicious! I love Mexican and seafood, so this place is right up my alley. They make everything fresh. The salsa bar lets you customize your order.

I had the 3 for 2 Tuesday special. The shrimp taco was the best, followed by the fish machaca, then the Campechana. The menu is small, but that's because they focus on one area and do it very well.

Service was very friendly. The room is small without being cramped. The restaurant is clean and not heavily decorated.

I will be back, and I am telling my friends to check it out.
