I stopped by here on my way home.  I like fish tacos and make them myself.  These are very very good. Simple delicious fish tacos, you add your toppings.  Cant get better than this unless you are in San Diego, at the beach, sippin on a beer.  Not 5 stars only because I dont believe in 5-out-of-5 for anything. Always leave room for improvement!
