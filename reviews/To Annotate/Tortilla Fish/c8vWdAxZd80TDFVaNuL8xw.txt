I work in the area and never pack my lunch. I had seen Tortilla Fish but never paid much attention because the suite it inhabits seemed like a black hole for previous businesses. Someone brought in a meal from this place and I took a little piece of fish from his plate and it piqued my curiosity. 

Later that week I came through to try it out. The first thing I noticed was the clean and tranquil lobby. They like to jam Buena Vista Social Club and Juanes, which isn't too overbearing and plays on the atmosphere well.

I ordered the full taco meal, which include two tacos filled with shrimp, fish, and peppers. I watched them batter the shrimp and fish and was already stoked to inhale my meal. Additionally, they have a salsa bar and there are more than a number of combinations. 

Long story short, the tacos were tight and the fries were addicting (add lime!). I will definitely be back and I hope they continue to keep serving their meals at the bar they have set for themselves.
