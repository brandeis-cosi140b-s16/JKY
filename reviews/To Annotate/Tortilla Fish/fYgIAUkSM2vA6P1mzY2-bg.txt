Fish is Alaskan Pollack and fried in a rice oil so they are not greasy at all!  They have a great season stand with cabbage and all of the fixings. A variety of sauces but must tries are their cilantro and homemade ranch from scratch with veggies and all. Small place to sit 20-30 but I will definitely put this one on my frequent list. A great Lenten Season option too!
