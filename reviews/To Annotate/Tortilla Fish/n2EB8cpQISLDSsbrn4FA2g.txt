The portions are small even though in the pictures they look kinda big because the tortillas itself are teeny tiny. You will spend twice as much as you thought you would originally because it is not as filling. For the same money, I can have a FEAST at Cheesecake factory. Just sayin...

Also, it seems they use garbanzo bean flour as the batter for the fish and shrimp and it leaves a weird after taste in your mouth.

I do like the different sauce and pico de gallo options they have. The service also is very friendly.
