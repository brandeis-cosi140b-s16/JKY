Tortilla Fish is phenomenal! This is a healthy substitute to your average Subway sandwich.... But three times better! They offer steamed vegetables and grilled fish for the real health freaks like me. The interior is a fresh blue, with beautiful photography of Mexican shores. They provide quick service, excellent staff, and warm smiles! I highly recommend stopping in here to taste real, authentic fresh fish with natural ingredients! Treat your body & life to some limes, cilantro & spice!
