This is no upscale Roy's, it's a simple taco shop. But the one thing they've got that Roy's hasn't got...Fish tacos! And great fish tacos at that!  I was visiting from Washington state and was craving fish tacos. I Yelped and found this place just two blocks from where I was parked. GREAT staff! Reasonably priced and great tasting fish and shrimp tacos. Just what I was craving. My family gets into town at the end of the week and we'll be back...more than once, I'm sure! Oh, and a great salsa bar too! Be sure to try mixing the avacado, cilantro and Chipotle sauces together...AMAZING!!
