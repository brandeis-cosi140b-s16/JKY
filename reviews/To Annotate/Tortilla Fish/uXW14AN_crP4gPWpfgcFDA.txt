I tried this place on a whim for a quick lunch and WOW I am so glad I did!  The manager was so friendly and helpful.  He asked if it was my first time, welcomed me, and made menu recommendations.  The food arrived quickly, and the manager made suggestions for how to dress the fish machaca tacos at their incredible condiment bar.  I followed his recommendations to the letter and the results were INCREDIBLE.  The food quality reminded me of something much higher end, yet my entire bill was less than $10!  Service 5 stars, Food 5 stars, Value 5 stars!!
