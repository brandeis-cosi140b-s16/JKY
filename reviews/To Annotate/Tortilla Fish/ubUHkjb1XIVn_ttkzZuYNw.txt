Some of the best fish tacos I have ever had. The fish itself is very tasty (almost has a kind of Cajun seasoning) but the toppings are one of the highlights of the dining experience. They have a great selection of house made salsas, sauces, and other toppings for whatever taco you choose. Currently only offering corn tortillas but I have been told flour tortillas are coming soon. Staff is friendly and helpful. They do a buy 2 get 1 free deal on Tuesdays and the place is small so you may not find a table at lunchtime on Tuesdays! I rarely give out 5 stars but this is one of my favorite places for lunch so it's worth it...and worth you giving Tortilla Fish a try as well!
