Thanks again yelp for this gem! Being out of state is hard to come by great food. Thanks to reviews i decided to back track my commute and check it out. 

Combo #1- 2 tacos, fries and a drink.  My tacos were campechana (mixed fish and shrimp). The fries were crispy and seasoned perfectly.  I might say they are the best fries I've ever had!

Omg one of the BEST tacos (fish/shrimp) i have EVER had. The fish and shrimp were deliciously battered and chopped in pieces. The fixings were the best especially mixing the chipotle, cilantro and avocado sauce.

Wow, so good!!! Ok, i need to stop reviewimg and eat. My tummy is happy!!!
