The atmosphere of this restaurant is very nice the restaurant was also clean I didn't like the food at first but I'm going to give this place a second chance cuz everybody deserves a second chance.  I didn't realize it was a build your own taco that's why they have a salsa bar with avocado cilantro salsa Pico. Otherwise the restaurant seems clean the cashier was friendly and the place was busy. All good signs that it's a good restaurant to try
