I have to give these guys some stars for being the best burrito I have ever had at an airport.  Nice people, speedy service.  I was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked my chicken and artichoke heart burrito.  It was so hot, I had to wait a while before I inhaled it at my gate.  How often can you say that about airport food?
