I know airport food is SKY.....HIGH but at least have some GOOD customer service. Jackie the cashier has the WORST........attitude EVER! BAD enough her English is NOT that clear and she's treating me like I got a HEARING problem! The burrito with 5 pieces of OVER COOKED DRIED STEAK was the NASTIEST. SPENDING ALMOST $15.00 on a terrible burrito with a AWFUL person working the money part hurts....!
