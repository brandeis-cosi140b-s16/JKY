If I could give this place no stars, I would. It is located inside the airport and I was desperate for food before my flight back home.  I knew food would not be served on my flight and I didn't have time for breakfast before heading to the airport.  Once I got to my gate, I didn't see any other close options and I like burritos so I went for it.

Yuck, yuck, yuck!  The chicken burrito I ordered had rice, beans, and no flavor.  Even adding their salsas to the burrito could not save it.  I have no idea what process they use to remove flavor from food, but they should stop it.

I paid $12 for this thing plus a drink, which isn't a bad price considering I was trapped in an airport, but I felt ripped off after tasting it.  I ended up throwing the burrito away.  At least my Diet Coke was good.

Maybe Chipotle, Freebirds, Mission Burrito and any other restaurant that sells a burrito has spoiled me.  Maybe the quality is better at locations not in the airport.  Maybe they should all be shut down.  I don't know.  I just know I will never eat at any 360 Gourmet Burrito again.  I would suggest looking for another place at the airport to eat, or just starve.
