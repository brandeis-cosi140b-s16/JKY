Is anybody ever REALLY excited about being stuck eating airport food?  The options are extremely limited, most are unhealthy, and the prices are always significantly higher than you'd find elsewhere with a significantly lower quality of food served.

So imagine my surprise when I discovered a 360 Gourmet Burrito shop during a recent 2 hour layover at the McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas, Nevada.  I'd actually eaten at a 360 Gourmet Burrito restaurant in San Ramon, California (Near San Francisco) and really enjoyed to food there, so I entered this restaurant with high hopes  in spite of their two star Yelp rating with over 60 reviews which would normally have caused me to steer clear.

I decided to switch it up and try one of their bowls, and chose the curry bowl with steak that comes sauteed with veggies over rice.  I can't say that it was the best curry bowl I've ever had, but it was still far better than a lot of airport food I've endured.  The steak was not overcooked, the rice was fresh, not starting to dry as if it had been sitting around, and the quantity given was decent.  It was far better than fast food would have been, yet not quite up to my memory of the other 360 Gourmet Burrito location I visited.  

All in all, I don't regret having eaten here and would probably do it again if stuck on another layover here.  Better than your average fast airport food.  There wasn't really anywhere inside you could sit down to eat your food, but my plan was to take it back to the gate to eat so that wasn't really an issue for me.
