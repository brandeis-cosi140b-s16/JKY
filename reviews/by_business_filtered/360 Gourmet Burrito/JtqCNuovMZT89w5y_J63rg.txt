The food is horrible. I had a wheat breakfast burrito and could only eat a couple of bites. Had to stop because it felt like powder eggs, old cheese and stale tortilla. The only thing good was quick serviceand a salsa bar. Don't fall for the clean look and display, a greasy diner would at least taste better. Einstein bros bagel right next to it, trust name brands while traveling.
