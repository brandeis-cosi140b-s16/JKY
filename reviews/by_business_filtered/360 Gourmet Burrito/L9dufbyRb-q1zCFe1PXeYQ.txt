Good burritos. I chose the chicken, Cajun style. Definitely a spicy one, my lips were burning on top of the sunburn I got here in Vegas.

It is off at the end of one of the 'B' gate terminals but worth the walk if you're in B or C.

The help could have been a little more friendly. Otherwise, for airport options, this is probably a good choice.
