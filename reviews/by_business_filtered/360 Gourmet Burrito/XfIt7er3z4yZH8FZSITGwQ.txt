5 stars for this place based on its location - in an airport.  Compared to anything else available at McCarran (and virtually any other airport, for that matter), this place really lives up to the adjective in its name.

You know you picked the right refueling station when you walk into the restaurant and smell the closest thing to ambrosia i can imagine - garlic and onions being freshly sauteed.  This is the best part of the place.  Everything tastes like it was cooked to order instead of assembled to order.

The tortillas are chewy and fresh tasting; spanish rice is deliciously seasoned.  There's a variety of interesting flavors - curry, cajun, lemon-garlic - and a wealth of vegetables - spinach, mushrooms, peppers, onions, tomatos.

Salsa bar gets the job done.

The only knock on this place is that it isn't open 24 hours.
