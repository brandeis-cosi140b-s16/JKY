Located inside the Las Vegas airport, 360 Gourmet Burrito is refreshing. One of the worst things in the world about traveling is the lack of decent, healthy food in airports. There is nothing worse than getting off an ugly early morning flight covered with that airport funk feeling, and having to choose between McDonald's and Chili's Express for lunch. 

Luckily, in Vegas you have options. At least in the C gates (I think).

The menu is very unique and has lots of options - asian, curry, mexican, meat, really the combinations are endless. The staff was refreshingly (for an airport) friendly, and helpful. When I tried to order a curry veggie wrap, the guy actually said he wouldn't recommend it because it would be soggy - go with the burrito instead. 

I listened to his advice and was glad - the wrap was amazing, and I was stuffed, ready to take a nap on my second flight. 

If you have a layover, it is worth it to search this place out, believe me.
