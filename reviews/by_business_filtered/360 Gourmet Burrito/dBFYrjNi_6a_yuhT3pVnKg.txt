Absolutely terrible. The Health Service should be contacted.  Rotting lettuce in my wrap was disgusting. Even if the food had been sanitary the portions were micro sized and the prices were macro sized--$15 for a drink and wrap. If you are stuck in this terminal walk 25 feet to Bagel Bakery or wait for the peanuts on Southwest!
