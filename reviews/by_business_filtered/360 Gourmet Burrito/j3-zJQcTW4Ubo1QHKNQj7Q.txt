I was doing the low carb thing and was struggling to find suitable food at our airport. The burrito bowl at 360 *seemed* like a decent option. The prices were ridiculous, but I'm ok with this at an airport. I was bummed the food was so awful, however. The meat was tasteless, the toppings were bland, and overall it was very sad. I enjoy dishes like this at Cafe Rio, Chipotle, or Zabas but this place was far, far worse. You expect bad food at the airport but even for airport food this was disappointing.
