Shame on you, guys! Terrible service! No seats. i asked cup for water. girl said they have cup for ice. and water i can get in the bathroom. do you wanna drink water from the bathrooms sink? burrito was small and expensive. but the worst part it didn't have any taste. i asked about some sauce or ketchup. they sent me to the Einstein bros. bagels bar next door. Really?
