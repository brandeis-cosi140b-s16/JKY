Of course, within an airport, all the prices are inflated, especially this place. They don't even have water for you. At least when I asked for water, they handed me a cup. They said that the water is located outside in a water fountain. Who doesn't provide water at their restaurant? 

I had their chips and salsa as a snack. It was okay, but after getting the chips and salsa combo, I realized I paid for the salsa that I could have gotten free at their little salsa stand behind me. Oh well. I do not know whether they have multiple locations at McCarran, but the one I went to was located in Terminal B.
