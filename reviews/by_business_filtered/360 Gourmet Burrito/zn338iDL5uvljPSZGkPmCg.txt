Hey, when you get up at 5 am to catch a flight out to the bay area.......most times you won't have a chance to grab a bite to eat your hotel.
This is where airport food comes into play.........

Gang, when you deal with airport food.......you know very well you will be rolling the dice! 

First hand...........the food will be expensive, and usually it's lousy! But hey, you have the option of not buying it.........it's either expensive lousy food, or you can eat air! 

For me, I like expensive lousy airport food when you're hungry. In fact, I've eaten my share of airport food though the years...........as my job had taken me all over the U.S., so I've sort of gotten accustomed to expensive lousy airport food.

While I was waiting to catch my flight to San Jose the other day, I spotted a joint called - "360 Gourmet Burrito".

What can I say, two words which caught my eye.........

1. Gourmet - Bing, Bing, Bing, Bing! Gourmet leads me to believe it's gourmet food (but who am I kidding!)

2. Burrito - I love Mexican food, so burrito.........especially a breakfast burrito sounded good to me.

And what did I get gang?

I got an EXPENSIVE LOUSY burrito! Lol! 

All kidding aside..........it was maybe a 1/2 star above a lousy burrito! Good for at least a 3 1/2 star rating.
At best, the food was just average.........but this place was a lot better than the other airport dumps I've been to in Las Vegas like - Auntie Anne's, or Baja Fresh!

For $15.00 bucks, I got a burrito, & two cups of coffee. 

I must say.........the coffee was really good,..........only because this place did not make coffee. They sell you the cup, and you go across the way to another business called Einstein's Bros. Bagel to get your coffee. 

And I gotta say.......MAN! They make some really good coffee! I'm impressed, as it's in the airport too!
