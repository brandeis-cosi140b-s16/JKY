Loved this place! Super friendly staff -- definitely felt like I'd wandered into someone's kitchen.

Come here for the tortillas if for nothing else -- we watched someone in the back making them and it certainly made all the difference. We tried the grilled chicken and the asada tacos and both were great. Be sure to try out both the green and red salsas!
