They made their tortillas fresh and thick which are nice to see.  

A bunch of us came by after whacking some golf balls at the range and we took up the entire middle dining area. I think there were 16 of us all together and we basically put some tables together and made one giant table to accommodate us which was also nice.

I ordered the two asada tacos with rice, beans, and fountain drink combo.  It was good but nothing really stood out except for the tortillas. There were nice chunks of steak but not a lot of flavor. The refried beans and rice were also very basic.  They did 4 or 5 different hot sauces.

I like there pineapple and fruit drinks that were next to the fountain drinks selection. Which I drank a lot of because I was very thirsty and they were delicious.

You might notice a few deals for this place. 1 free charro with a purchase of a combo when checking in with Yelp app, which I passed on at the end, filled with drink. $5 for $10 Groupon which I also passed on.

They have weekends specials for menudo and 2 other items, I am a fan of menudo.

When making your tacos, burritos, etc you have a choice of asada, chicken, shrimp, tongue, barbacoa, chicharones, and maybe 1 or 2 more meats.
