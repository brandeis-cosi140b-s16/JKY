I was a bit skeptical in trying out this place. I can be very hard to please when it comes to food. I remember someone recommending Tacos El Gordo to me and to my dismay, they were the nastiest tacos I have ever tasted. I threw my whole order away and walked out. So when I stepped foot inside this joint, I was hoping I wouldn't have to do the same.

I ordered the asada quesadilla combo and  my husband ordered the asada tacos. We additionally ordered one shrimp taco, fish taco, and a side of fresh guacamole. All the food was very appetizing and full of flavor with the exception of the guacamole. It was too bland for my liking but I shouldn't knock down a star for that.

Overall we were very satisfied with our order. We will be coming back again to try out the other items on the menu. The food did not disappoint and the homemade tortillas were a plus!
