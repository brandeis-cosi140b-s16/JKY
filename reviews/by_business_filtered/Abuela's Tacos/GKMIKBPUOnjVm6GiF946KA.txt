As I was searching for a chicharon burrito today I happened to run into this little hole in the wall... great and friendly service.... Although there pork was not chicharones I will come back... slightly deceptive but on a good note I will return... love the fact that older ladies were cooking my food... makes me feel like I'm at home... good job ladies!!
