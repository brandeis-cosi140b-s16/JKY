I got the tacos combo... I was low key shocked of how good this place is. I was saying to people being from So. California, I have yet to find a good Mexican restaurant. All that has changed seriously the food was so good my plate was clean. The tortillas was light and fluffy. They make them or at least press them in house. The Carne asada was on point. The beans and rice were so delicious as well. The hotess was extremely nice. Also, ordering the combo I got a free churro, I don't know what's in it...its gone. I will travel pass all the other Mexican restaurants to eat here.
