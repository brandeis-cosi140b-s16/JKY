On this side of town where decent food places are few and far between, Abuela's stands out as a total gem.  We went for a terribly decadent lunch choice that involved the asada fries and a steak quesadilla.  The fries were as great as it gets - huge portion, fresh guac, fresh pico.  The quesadilla was also wonderful with it's fresh tortilla.  The staff were older ladies, very friendly.  I can't wait to go back.
