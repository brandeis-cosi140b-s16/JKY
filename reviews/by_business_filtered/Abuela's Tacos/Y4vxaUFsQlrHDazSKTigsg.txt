OK, the parentals came up from Southern Cal for a visit on the way up to Salt Lake. They wanted something quick to eat but not fast food (you know, the Taco Bell / Burger King crap). I recommended Abuelas since its down the street from the house. They said OK. 

(Now just a primer here -- My dad is a semi-quasi professional chef (has pro training but just uses it at the house) and a very finicky palate - junk food just doesn't cut it. My mom likes the finer things in life but will eat Taco Bell and such if forced)

So we arrive on Taco Tuesday around 3p, a few people inside. Pops was kind of thrown off by the walk up and order from the counter (as he is a menu and full catering type), but the lady by the counter was extremely friendly and had Dad communicating. Mom was in awe that the gal in the back was actually hand pressing home made tortillas. The order was 2 carne asada burrito plates (me & pops) and mom gets 2 carne asada tacos, chips/salsa & side of guac.

Mom's easy, plows into the tacos. Loves it. Loves the pico salsa that comes with the chips, liked the green hot sauce but didn't care for the red thicker hot sauce. Guac was good, real avocados but not much else, no problem. Roasted pepper devoured. 

Dad kinda picks at the plate at first and I think, ut oh. Then he says the beans and meat are very good and well seasoned. Hurray I didn't disappoint the pops. Ate everything but the grilled green onion (I stole that). Didn't care for the rice and chips much, but as he says, those are fillers and he thought the chip salsa was good but a tad too much salt. Overall - he was impressed and said he would return if/when they come back out. After 2 hours ago of Abuela's dining and chatting about stuff & life, it turned out to be a real pleasant afternoon. Thanks Abuela's.
