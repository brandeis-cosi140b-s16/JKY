Although, it's all the way on the east side - a pretty good haul for me, I've been here a couple times with my son for carne asada burritos.  Great flavor all the way around.  

The only reason I'm not giving more stars is because the asada was really tough and gristly -- both times.  They use cheap meat.

Great horchata & great salsa!!
