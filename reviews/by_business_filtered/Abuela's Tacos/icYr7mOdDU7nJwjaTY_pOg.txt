I'm giving this place three out of five stars because I tired five of their tacos and I liked three of them. 

Since it was my first time eating here, I ordered an Asada taco, a fish taco, one chicken, one barbacoa and one chicharron verde taco. First, the ones I liked. The beef asada taco was amazing. The chicken was good. My favorite was the chicharron verde (although it's spicy so not everyone may like it, but I LOVE spicy. Bring it on!) 

The woman who took my order said they're known for the barbacoa. I wasn't impressed with it. It was bland, like it needed salt and pepper. The fish was also disappointing: pre-cooked and oily with really thick batter and very little fish.

Despite the two so-so tacos, I'll definitely be back. I was particularly impressed by watching them make the tortillas for the tacos right in front of me.
