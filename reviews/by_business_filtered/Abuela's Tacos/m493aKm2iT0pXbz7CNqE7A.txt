As soon as you walk in the place is remarkably clean. The interior is simplistic but nice and not tacky like a lot taco shop tend to look on the east side. 
The menus is easy to understand and makes it easy to order: the slideshows with photos makes everything look extremely appetizing.
You definitely get your money's worth. 
The tortillas are handmade for the tacos and the enchilada sauce taste homemade!
The brand don't taste like canned decried beans! 
Truly delicious! 
Coming back and bring everybody and their mommas here :)
