I was a bit apprehensive trying this... Sometimes I get fooled by Yelp reviews.... Not this time... It was refreshingly outstanding... Service was very good and the place is clean and near my house. I ordered the Asada enchilada combo with green sauce... Had a nice kick to it and was delicious!! I am picky about food but this place absolutely rang the bell for me.
The rice and beans are normally a throw away... Not this time... I slicked the plate clean! Do a check in and get a free churro.  Like Arnold said, "I'll be back"
My only reason for 4 stars vs 5 is that the plastic utensils are worthless.... They cannot even cut the enchilada...
