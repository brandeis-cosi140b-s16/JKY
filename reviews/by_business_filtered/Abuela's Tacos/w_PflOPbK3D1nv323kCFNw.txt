This place is the best tacos I have had in town! Very affordable with great customer service. Tried the carne asada fries,the pork and chicken tacos as well as the flan and all of it was delicious! Also had the horchata which was good too. Would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a great taco at a great price!
