My Family came out to Las Vegas for vacation staying off the strip. I searched for restaurants and the name Abuelas (Grama ) caught my attention. After 4 days in Vegas this was our best place we ate at for TRUE Mexican Tacos. They make fresh corn tortillas for the tacos with authentic taste. The asada was made right and the chicharron verde fabulous. Try the flan before leaving. The ladies are real Abuelas making the food. You want to know the real deal, come to Abuelas.
