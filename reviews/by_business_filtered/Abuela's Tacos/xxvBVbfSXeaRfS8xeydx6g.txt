Every time I've been to this location I've tried something different to see if I really like it, but it's always average. Nothing different from other Mexican restaurants. Last time I went I had the breakfast burrito..which won't get again it wasn't horrible but there are better things than that. Customer service was good the lady at the counter was patient while I decided what to order. The salsa was far from spicy just adds a little bit of flavor.
