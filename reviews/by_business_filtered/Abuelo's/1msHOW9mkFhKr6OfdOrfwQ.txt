If you're looking for Authentic Mexican, this is not your place. But if you're looking for great Mexican-inspired food, this is you're place. Although, a chain, I would consider Abuelos one step up from On The Border, Chevy's, Macayo's or any other Tex Mex chain. The atmosphere and interior alone are more sophisicated. The salsa chips are very addicting. The salsa has a smooth smoky flavor. Also, the enchaladas and steak combo makes a great meal. I always ask for no seasoning or light seasoning on the steak because it's a little spicy. The enchaladas are flawless. And you must try the Papas con Chile! These are mash potatoes kicked up with cheese and peppers.
