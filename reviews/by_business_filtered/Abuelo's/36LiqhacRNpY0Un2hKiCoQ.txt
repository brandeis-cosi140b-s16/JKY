My wife and I have lived in the Phoenix area for a year now. We have visited several Mexican restaurants and have found the food betwenn average to poor. Then in August we moved to the Peoria and discovered this restaurant.  The atmosphere was very nice and the place looked clean and well kept. The hostesses were friendly and made us feel welcome. The waitress and her busser was very attentive and made sure that our dining experience was pleasurable.  We ordered the Fajitas for two combo with Bacon wrapped shrimp. Needless to say that the flavor of this was outstanding. Thus far this has ranked the best Mexican restaurant in the metro area thus far for us.
