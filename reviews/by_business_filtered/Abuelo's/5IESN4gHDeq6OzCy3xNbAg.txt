Excellent Mexican restaurant!  My parents live in AZ, and took my sister and I here over the holidays for the happy hour.  The specials are awesome.  Each couple can order (lunch, I assume) entrees and an appetizer for $18 or something.  The sangria swirl was perfect--and not too pricey!  Cannot wait to get back to AZ just to go to this place.  : )
