Just came back from my first dining experience here, and it could not have been better.  Jon was our server and he was about as friendly and attentive as he could be.  My eldest son has always shied away from Mexican food, but he agreed to go tonight.  He ordered the chicken fajitas and gave it a thumbs up.  Thumbs up from him and me on the margaritas as well.  My youngest and I both had the Grande Burrito and we loved it.  We will definitely come back!
