Abuelos is one of my favorite Mexican places in town for the food! I've tried a few different dishes & my favorites are the Durango burrito, Chicken enchiladas, & the Spinach enchiladas. The papas con chile & rice are delicious sides which I opt to get every time (instead of the beans).

They have lunch prices for these items which are very affordable & the portions are pretty large too. The dinner prices are only a little bit higher with slightly larger portions, still worth the cost.

If you're really hungry (or going to share a dish), then the fajita options are great because they're really big & super tasty too! Their margaritas are strong and make for the perfect start to the meal. The salsas they offer with the chips are different than they typical ones. There's a light green one that tastes sweet to start off with but definitely has a kick to it. They also have a regular mild salsa & a hotter one.

I will agree with some of the other reviewers that the service is kind of off sometimes. We've gone during lunch time and they've tried to seat us in a corner table when there are much better tables open and it's not even busy. I'll always ask them to seat us in the middle section up-front now, which is sometimes received with a snarky comment but other times, no comment. I've been opting to get things to-go more often now for this reason.
