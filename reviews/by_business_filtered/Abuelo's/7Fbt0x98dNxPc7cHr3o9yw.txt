Ouch, we visited in February and I realized  we were here once before but apparently I did not write a review. I know when the food is good because I forget to take pictures, hehe, both times I only had pics of the chips and salsa.
I came visit 2 more times and the food has always been good. Service has been from OK to great. Place is roomy and nice. Great for a business lunch or dinner. They have been flexible with the sides and accommodating for low carb requests.
