After  a year in the West Valley, this is by far the best mexican restaurant we've found.  We've had friendly, good service and very tasty food.  But one major complaint - they make the sweetest margaritas I've ever tasted.  And I didn't think margaritas were supposed to be sweet.  Next time, I'll follow another reviewer and order beer!
