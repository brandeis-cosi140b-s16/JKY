I haven't been here in 4 years, never a big fan of the food. We went yesterday for lunch & it was awesome! Got seated immediately, the service was great & the food was delicious. Found out they have revamped the menu (now serve pork!!!) & a new chef has put together some good dishes. Great atmosphere, beautiful restaurant & great food at a fair price. Highly recommend this place
