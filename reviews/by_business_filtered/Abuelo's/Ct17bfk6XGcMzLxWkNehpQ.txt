Excellent food and service!!! Everyone at our table raved about everything! I ordered the beef shreded taco and cheese enchilada which was very tasty. My mom was particularly excited about sopapilla's saying they were authentic to the ones she ate growing up in Texas. I had a bite of someone else's flan and had to stop myself from eating it all!
