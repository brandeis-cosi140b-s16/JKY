This was good when it first opened but is now indistinguishable from the Americanized greasy spoon Mexican fare that you get everywhere else in Phoenix. 

Prices are okay, chips and salsa are included (and the chips are served warm) and the portions are enormous. But the food isn't particularly interesting, relying too heavily on fat and carbs and not enough on interesting flavors.

Every time I go, want Abuelo's to be a classy Mexican restaurant that distinguishes itself through a refined Mexican palate not a substitute for Macayo's.
