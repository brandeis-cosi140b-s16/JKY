Really really good Mexican/Tex Mex food! If you're a vegetarian like me, I recommend the veggie fajitas...they come with plenty of vegetables and DELICIOUS tortillas. They also come with a cilantro lime rice that is nothing short of amazing. The first time we went here McKenzie was our server and she was awesome. She knew the menu, knew what a vegan was, and provided us with prompt, efficient service. The second time I went here the server (don't remember his name) was just ok. He didn't seem too knowledgeable with the menu and had to check on several items. 

I'll definitely be back though as the veggie fajitas are really tasty!
