We went in on a busy Friday night and had about a 20 minute wait. Once we were seated the server came over and took our drink order right away. He then brought out chips, salsa and our drinks. He didn't come back for our order for quite some time. I was already done with my margarita by the time he did come back. 
Once we placed our order our food came within a decent amount of time. I liked that they gave us three types of salsa with our chips. They were all good and the chips were really good. We also ordered the avocado cream sauce. I really liked it. We also had jalape√±o cheddar bites and a steak fajita chimichanga with the specialty potatoes. The potatoes were delicious! I could have just had those. 
I am giving 3 stars based on the slow service and small weak margarita.
