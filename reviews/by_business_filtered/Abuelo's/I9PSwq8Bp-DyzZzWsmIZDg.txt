One star is a bit harsh. 

So was the service.


So was the food.


So was the environment and atmosphere.

Look, here is the deal, this place used to be great but time has clearly taken a quick toll on Abuelos.  What my family experienced the evening we stopped in was unforgivable.  We arrived later than usual for dinner so I know they were still recovering from their first large seating, but bottom line, the restaurant was a disaster.  Dirty tables, messy floors, and enough crying kids to make it really feel like a Dennys on Swap-Meet day. 

Wait, that is not fair to Dennys.

Anyways, the server forgot the appetizer order.  Completely.  

The food for the main dish came out lukewarm at best.  I thought Fajitas came out sizzling and snapping?  Nope, not this evening.  

Drinks were not refilled EVER.

This whole deal was a miss.  The manager never came around to even ask how the meal was...lucky for him or her.

Anyways, this was crappy enough that we even thought of writing a letter, but after this disaster who would want to even go back.  NEVER AGAIN.
