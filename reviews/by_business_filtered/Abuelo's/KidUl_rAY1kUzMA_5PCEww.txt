Love their happy hour in the bar! They have three different kinds of salsa, the green one is the best. They also have a dip trio but they are very spicy! The margaritas during happy hour are a big fishbowl style and very delicious. The enchiladas plate with a sample of all of them is a lot of food and very flavorful, full enchiladas. A go to for good Mexican food in the west valley!
