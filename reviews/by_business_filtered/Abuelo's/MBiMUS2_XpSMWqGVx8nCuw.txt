They named it Abuelos for a reason! Authentic mexican good straight out of your grandparents kitchen. 

It was wonderful, but the portions are HUGE. Share with your significant other, friend, random person sitting next to you or even that mariachi boy over there singing his heart away. 

Love the decor also.   Estaba buenismo! Gracias por la comida, Abuelos!
