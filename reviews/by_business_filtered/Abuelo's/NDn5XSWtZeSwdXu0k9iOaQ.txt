I recently went to Abuelos with my wife for a date night before hitting the movies across the street. We were seated promptly. 

I enjoyed my 4 enchilada plate. I've never had an avocado enchilada before.  I mixed up the other enchiladas with pork and beef with various sauces on top. The beans and rice were good and reminded me of what I'm used to in certain place ins California. 

My wife had steak/shrimp fajitas. She enjoyed her meal. The only complain was the small amount of cheese, sour cream, etc that comes with the plate.  The steak was juice and tender and the shrimp was cooked nicely.

Our food came out quickly, as we ordered and hot.

The server was attentive.to our need, refills and also returned the check in a timely manner 

Was this the best mexican fare I've had, no, but I definitely think the food is above average.

The inside wasn't what I normally think of at a Mexican place. Had a nice ambiance and atmosphere that I've grown accustomed to at most mexican places I've gone to throughout the US.

Overall, I was happy with the meal and experience and will be back again.
