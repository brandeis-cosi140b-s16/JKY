This is the best Mexican restaurant chain in AZ. They always have provided good quality food, proportions and prices. My favorite thing to order there is the Grande Plate Three enchiladas, one beef, one cheese, and one sour cream chicken, chile relleno, tamale, crispy beef taco, and guacamole and beans/papas. Get the "papas" versus the beans they are crudely mashed with spices and skins. They also have great drinks and the margaritas are pretty good. The atmosphere feels like upscale dining with great architecture, art, music and professional wait staff.
