Been here twice and still the same thing . It's an overrated restaurant for mexican food. Not to be negative, but the salsa's for the chips are not a home made salsa. Salsa's are made in a blender so watery . Lemonade , I thought it was a natural made with lemons. Its made from Powder Lemonade .... c'mon ! Iv'e been to Family owned mexican restaurants and very good homemade flavors. Yes , there are some dishes that have good flavor don't get me wrong. But , I been to better places. Place is nice , flashy and spiffy.... the food not to impressive just imitation americanized mexican food. Bit pricey , I'll just stick to appetizers just to say I went to Abuelo's.

PS. Goerge... Im not getting info from nowhere about the Salsa.... I got it from the Waiter just to clear that up...
