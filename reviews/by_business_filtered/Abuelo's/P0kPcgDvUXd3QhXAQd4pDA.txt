Great place for lunch...Eat at the bar please?  Be prepared, great ambiance, but usually an older crowd.  I like the bar since the servers are older and more polite and know what food is good to order.  

I would give it a 4 star, but 2 visits resulted in poor service from servers.  I get great service at the bar however?  Note sometimes Costco has a gift card $79.99 for $100 worth of food!  If you plan on visiting this place more then a few times stop at Costco and get that gift card.
