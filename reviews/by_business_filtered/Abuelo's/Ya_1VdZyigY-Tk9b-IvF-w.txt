My husband and I decided to go to Abuelos for lunch last week since were in that part of town.  The hostess was very nice and seated us immediately.  All seemed well until our server came to out table.  You could just tell he didn't want to be there.  He asked us what we wanted to drink, then tossed out napkins to us.  My napkin slid to the other end of the table.  Then he just walked away.  My husband and I just looked at each other wondering if maybe we were reading something more than it really was into it.  But then he came back and asked if we were ready to order.  We told him we needed a minute and he just turned his back and walked away without saying anything.  I was ready to go.  
My husband suggested we sit at the bar because the bartender was really cool.  We walked over to the hostess and she could tell something was wrong and asked if there was something wrong.  When we told her she seemed genuinely concerned; she apologized and told us she would get the manager.  We sat at one of the table by the bar and the bartender came over immediately and greeted us.  He is a spirited guy!  We felt right at home.  We ordered drinks and our entrees.  
The manager came over to out table to talk to us.  He also apologized for our experience and thanked us for staying.  He gave us the Abuelos dip sampler.  I had never had that before.  It was delicious.  The chili and cheese was my favorite and my husband's was the avocado cream.  I had the steak fajitas and my husband had the fajitas tacos.  They were both really good.
So although we got terrible service from our initial server who shouldn't be a server if he doesn't like being around people, the rest of our experience made up for it.  I always appreciate when the management team shows that they are willing to earn our business back!
