I LOVE the look of Abuelos and the fun ceiling just brings everything together. 

Abuelos was one of my first jobs when I was 16. It was not my cup of tea working there and quit 3 weeks later! After that I only went in 1 maybe 2 times a year. I never hated their food, it just wasn't first choice to go and eat. 

So, about a year ago my boyfriend and I was next door waiting for a movie when we decided we needed food so we searched happy hours all around the area and decided to walk over to Abuelos. We were so happy about the prices and the happy hour food was great.

I love that they bring warm chips and different varieties of salsa. The main reason I love to come here are for their amazing sangria swirls! If you ever go to Abuelos, this is a must have! 

We now go in so often that we know most of the bartenders and servers. :)
