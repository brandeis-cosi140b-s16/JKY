We had a decent meal during our visit to this location while in town on vacation.   I have to say upon seeing their menu, with its photos and reading reviews, I was pretty excited to try it...and it was o.k.

My son's both ordered shrimp fajitas, which I won't question...ordering seafood in the middle of the desert.  One ordered the Yucatan version which was to have a barbeque sauce on the shrimp-seemed like plain shrimp to me.

I had the rib eye and enchiladas (cheese and onion) and it was good-side choices were interesting, in getting a green chile and having many options.  My wife ordered a combo plate so she could get a chile releno and said it was good.

Chips and salsa were o.k.  Chips were thin and the salsas were runny, although the verde one tasted good with the pineapple flavor.   

The wait wasn't bad for a Saturday evening and the atmosphere was odd-kind of looked like what you'd expect for an Italian or Greek restaurant in terms of décor and tables were very close together, but who am I kidding, I don't base my food opinions on décor!
