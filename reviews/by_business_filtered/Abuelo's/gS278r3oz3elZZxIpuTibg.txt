We rely on Abuelo's for good reliable meals.  Most often, we have lunch here.  The service is quick and courteous and the luncheon portions are very good.  Today I asked about the barramundi (fish which we enjoyed in Australia) which we enjoyed some time ago.  Alas, it was a seasonal offering.  If you see it on the menu, give it a try.  

It is interesting that people complain to us about chain restaurants.  We enjoy the certainty of having meals that we know we will enjoy.  That is not to say that we do not venture to other venues.  We do and when we find a treasure, we will tell you.
