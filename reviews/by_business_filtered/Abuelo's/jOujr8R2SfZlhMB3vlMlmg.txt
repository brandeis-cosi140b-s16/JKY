Wow zero stars.. Again same story we had a gift card from Christmas and decided to try it before we saw a movie at Harkins. 

We popped in at 330 pm and were seated immediately by our server. She was really nice and took good care of us. This review is on the food and alcohol.
 
I ordered a $5 Carona draft and it came out in this huge 10 pound glass and was Luke warm! NOT GOOD

I then decided to order a "hand shaken" 1800 margarita. ($9.50) after drinking half I had to flag down waitress and ask if there was any alcohol  in here ! 2nd mistake! She then brings me back another one on the house and it was soooo strong.

Besides alcohol I ordered a #1 enchilada special and rice,beans, and 2 flavors of different enchiladas and wow it was the grossest Mexican food I have ever had. No flavor at all

Again also a #2 same thing 2 different flavors of enchiladas and again no flavor and very bland.

And for the final straw... They brought us 3 different flavors of salsa before our meal ( sry at the end of review) THE WORST SALSA EVER TASTED!!!! 1 Red salsa tasted like straight BBQ sauce, another red was straight water, and the green was really sweet..

Overall never again..
