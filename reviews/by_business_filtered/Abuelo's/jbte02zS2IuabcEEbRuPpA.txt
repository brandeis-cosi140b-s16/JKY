Enjoyed the lunch. Husband had a salad & they put a hot pepper on as garnish without telling him. Rather burned his tongue & lips. Tho other than that the salad was excellent. Took granddaughters and they enjoyed too. First time we ever used a pay at the table machine. Girls had fun paying the bill and reviewing the service. Which was very good.
