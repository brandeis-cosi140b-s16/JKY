I use to come here all the time 5 years ago and it was wonderful! Today, I experienced the worst food and service I've ever had. The food tasted like it was a frozen meal, and the beans were as if they had been rosarita refried beans just put in the microwave! Not a single item tasted good, and our server seemed as if he was angry or annoyed with us from the minute we sat down. The hostesses didn't greet us, and sat us down without a word. The weirdest part was that they weren't even busy! The place was practically empty for a Saturday afternoon, so there was no excuse for the poor service. My boyfriend and I are always great tippers, but today was the exception and we only left the minimum 15%. The only reason for one star is that the atmosphere is very nice, and it is the only thing that I enjoyed.
