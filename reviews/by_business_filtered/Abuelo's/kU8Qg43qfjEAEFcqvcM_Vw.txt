First visit here and loved the ambiance of the place right off. Very nice inside.
This was a lunch visit and had very prompt and efficient greeting, seating, and service.
  I had a chile relleno/ enchilada combo which was excellent.....beans and rice ----also excellent. Much better fare than macayos or garcias. 
  Also the best flan I've ever had. Definitely would and will return soon.
