My wife and I visited this restaurant twice while on vacation in January, 2015. The restaurant was busy, but we were seated right away both times. It is one of the fanciest Mexican restaurants that I have ever visited, but attire is casual. Though busy, it was not very noisy. Once seated we were presented with 3 salsas (green, mild red, hot red) with thin tortilla chips and all were very good. The supersized margaritas were especially tasty. Our entress consisted of the beef and cheese enchilada and Tilapia Veracruz. Both dishes were very good and had good sides to accompany them. We did not do dessert. Overall Abuelo's presents an upscale Mexican restaurant atmosphere with very good food, good service, and the ability to check out via a computer at your table. I would recommend it
