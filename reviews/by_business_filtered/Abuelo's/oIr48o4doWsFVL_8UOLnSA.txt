First time going here in years and this restaurant did not disappoint. We were greeted and shown to our seats with no wait. The mushroom appetizer was delicious and all of our entr√©es were on point. Our server was around long enough to serve us and stayed on top of our drinks but also allowed us to enjoy our evening uninterupted. He was wonderful. The establishment itself was very nicely appointed and the fining room was beautiful. There is nothing i would change about my experience today. I'm looking forward to a return visit in the future.
