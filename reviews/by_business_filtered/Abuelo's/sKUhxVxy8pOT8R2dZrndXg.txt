Yes this is a chain Mexican Restaurant.  But I find it better than South of the Border or other such fare.  It seems a step ahead of the other chains.  

There seems to be a bit more inspiration with the dishes then the typical beef enchilada en red sauce.

For example Spinach enchiladas or bacon wrapped shrimp.  Or even the salsa choices are bit different.  

We went with a party of 6 On Sunday lunch.   No problem getting seated, though they were busy.  I have to admit our waitress while very nice was a bit slow on the take.  would constantly bring me a new iced tea, but never removed the empty glasses.  At one point we bussed our own table to prepare to make room for the entrees.  Oh yeah, one of our entrees did not show up with the rest.  It took about 15 minutes for the kitchen to get that one steak out.  Credit to the manager who took it off our bill.  

We paid with $25 gift cards bought at Costco for $20 each.  Worked very easily.

there is more than enough food per person.  No one even thought of ordering dessert. 

In the past we have had the Margaritas and they were not as sweet as some places sell, which for us was a big plus.  though they tasted just like the Kirkland Costco 'Golden Margaritas" (which we buy and love).

All in all, for a group with more Conservatives Mexican food tastes, this is a safe bet.  Way too much to choose from, which means everyone will get something they will like.  

As for the wife and I, we continue our quest for more authentic more adventurous Mexican food in Phoenix.
