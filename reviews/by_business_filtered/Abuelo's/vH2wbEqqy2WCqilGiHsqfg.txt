My cousin and his wife swear by this place but being the Yelper that I am I was a bit apprehensive about eating here so I had a small meal at home before joining them here for dinner. I ordered the layered dip and a carafe of Sangria. I personally feasted on chips, salsa and dip which were wonderful. My cuzzo and the wife ordered fajitas and a chicken chimi .They also consumed two pitchers of margaritas which is probably why they enjoyed the food so much. Any who,  I actually had a bite of the chimi and the fajitas and it was ok-nothing mouth watering or succulent here. It was average. All in all this a pretty cool environment for chips, salsa and a drink. Will I return? Absolutely, and I will have chips, salsa, a pitcher of margarita and a carafe of Sangria with the girls...
