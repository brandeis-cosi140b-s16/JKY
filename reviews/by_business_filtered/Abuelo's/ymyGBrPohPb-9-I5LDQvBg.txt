Abuelo's restaurant in Peoria has become our favorite in the area.  We've never had a bad meal or poor service.  (Which is pretty remarkable.)

The main reason we love it so much is the food.  Oh my gosh, they have the most delicious Mexican food.  My husband loves the Chili Rellenos they serve.   A Chili Relleno consists of a stuffed, roasted, fresh poblano pepper (a mild chili pepper named after the city of Puebla), and he always gets the rice and beans with it.  

I like a number of items they serve.  My favorite is the bacon-wrapped shrimp, but it is a bit on the expensive side, so I don't order it too often, however, it is soooooo very good.  

We both enjoy the complimentary chips and salsa because they are also fresh, crisp and come with 3 types of salsa.  

I can't say much for the paintings on the walls, except that they are very different.  Have yet to decide if I like or dislike them.  They are eye-catching as the artist painted with a unique perspective.  

Portions of food are large, which my husband loves.  He always ends up eating what I can't finish. 

The food is most likely fattening, but the great taste makes eating there a special occasion.  Like I said, it has become my favorite places to eat out in the Sun City/Peoria/Glendale area.
