I stopped in here before 6pm on a Tuesday to grab dinner with my cousin.  We were promptly seated, but not offered a seat in the bar area offering happy hour specials.  When we asked about happy hour they told us we could move over a table and we'd be in the proper section.  We opted to sit at the bar.  

Once at the bar we each ordered a happy hour drink special and guacamole to start. That's about the last we saw of our bartender.  There were only 3 other people at the bar, and the restaurant was empty, but the service was unapologetically slow.  We had to flag down the bartender to order after he had left us for over half an hour with our guacamole and empty drinks.  He never came around to ask for our dinner order-we had to ask him to take it.  The bar is not large, but the bartender spent all of his time on the opposite side with his back to us doing prep work. 

The food is good, but it's not worth waiting out poor service for.
