So I've been here two more times since my previous review and I think, unfortunately, this is going to be my LAST review of this place and the last time I ever come here.

Agave and I came out to a rough start when it first opened many years ago and it seems that it has reached its pinnacle a year ago and it's down hill.  Very quickly.

My wife and I visited on a Thursday night to make use of a Groupon that I purchased a month ago.  I called and made a reservation for 8:45pm and that went off without a hitch.

When I got there, it went downhill from there.

It was like they only had one waiter for the ENTIRE restaurant.  We waited forever for our drinks, our chip refills, our order.

Rock Lobster Guacamole for an appetizer to complement the chips was good.  The chips ran out and we waited 10 minutes for more.

Our main entrees were OK.  Refills never happened.  After waiting patiently for 30 minutes for our waiter to return, we went and talked to an employee - who was the hostess (hopping around merrily and fraternizing with her friends) while service just went down, down dooooown hill.

Well, we were talking to the hostest saying our waiter was nowhere to be found and she condescendingly says "he's been helping you!  He's at your table."  (and he wasn't.)  Then when we walked back to the table I saw her giving my wife a very dirty look.

I'm done with this place.  Agave needs to seriously look at how they're treating their customers.  It is a shame that this restaurant is taking up space in Summerlin when a restaurant that cares to give customer service and EARN their money could be here instead.

Arrived at 8:45pm.  Got our check at 9:55pm.  Be prepared to waste an entire night if you dare venture here.
