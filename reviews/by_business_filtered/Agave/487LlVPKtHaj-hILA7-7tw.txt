This place is really good -- I just changed it to 5 stars.  First, the ambiance is amazing.  Inside and outside, it just feels cool, like you're in a good casino lounge.  Second, the food is delicious.  They serve a full menu during the day, and a late night menu after 9pm, I believe.  They do stay open all night, I believe, so we usually go in when everything else is closed.  The duck quesadilla is really good, as is the carne asada burrito.

But the drinks are where Agave really stands out.  They have a list of specialty margaritas which run around $10 and are well worth it -- top shelf tequilas with unique flavors.  Personally, I almost always get the Tlaquepaque margarita (Casa Noble Crystal, fresh raspberries, Cointreau and fresh lime).  They also have a large tequila menu, and you can do a sampler of three tequilas for $12.

Everytime I go here with my friends, we say how we should go here more often.  Hopefully we'll live up to that this time.
