Second time here in a four year span.  This time was with a large group for a birthday party.  Once again, the food a bit pricey for Mexican.  Although service was 4.5 Stars.  Bar tender was quick to get my tequila abd our wait staff at the dinner table was excellent and attentive.

The food was good overall.  The salsa was actually good.  Im guessing it was homemade.

But for a group of 12 people, the average ppp was $30 before tip.  No dessert included.  It did include pitchers of beer.

I think because its in the heart of Summerlin, you pay more.  I think of many other Mexican / SW places in the area which would be slightly better food and lower prices.
