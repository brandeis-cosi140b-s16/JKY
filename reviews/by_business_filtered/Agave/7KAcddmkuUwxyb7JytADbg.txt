Decided to try Agave for lunch one day as I was in the area and had heard good things about it.

I ordered carne asada/steak tacos.  The steak was very tough/chewy and fatty - very low quality meat, and not well prepared.  Very hard to eat and left much of the meal untouched.  Service was also unmemorable, as wait staff did not check on why the meal was half eaten to inquire if there was an issue.

Was expecting much better and was disappointed, particularly as this place is presented as contemporary and a higher end option.  Food and service quality just were not there.  Better options exist for quality and well prepared mexican cuisine in the valley.
