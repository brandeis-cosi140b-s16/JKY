Good spot for a fun fancy date night! Or  good spot to have premium tequilas with friends. They have a crazy happy hour which is from 4:02pm - 6:37 and after 10pm for $2 tacos, $2 modelo beers and $5 100% blue agave margaritas. Thats a effin deal right there!

As for my visit there...I was taking my boyfriend out for an early birthday dinner and the place was amazing inside. They has brightly colored walls of magenta and a squah orange color and had star lantens hanging from the ceilings. Impressive, I thought, but our server was mostly M.I.A. the entire night and we had to flag him down every time we passed him. 
I had the chilie verde soup, which was to die for. The combination of spice and tangy flavors was perfect. I also ordered the talapia with pesto rice, which was just ok. I though that the talapia could have had a little more seasoning or flavor to it. As for my boyfriend, he ordered a combination plate of tacos: fish, rock shrimp, and potato.  He's mexican so he's extremely picky about his tacos and the only thing that killed it for him was the coleslaw that came on all the tacos. But when he took the slaw off the tacos, he was satisfied.  
The experience could have been better with a bit more attentive service, but their happy hour seems like a deal, so I gotta check it out again.
