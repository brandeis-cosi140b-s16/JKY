We didn't plan on dining at Agave, but a bellman in a hotel recommended it and we decided to give it a try. It was a fantastic find for lunch. The rock shrimp chile relleno was out of this world tasty as were the chicken tinga tacos. The salsa trio delivered to the table with the chips were also quite delicious. Service was friendly and prompt. The outdoor patio was quite nice on a sunny February day. All in all, this is a restaurant we would return to on a future trip to Vegas.
