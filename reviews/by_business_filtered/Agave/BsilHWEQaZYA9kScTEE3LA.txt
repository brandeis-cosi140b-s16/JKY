I went to Agave for lunch yesterday with my husband and two friends in town from L.A.  I LOVE the ambience of this Mexican restaurant and all of the rock en espanol they play takes me back to the days of spending time at Tijuanas in Irvine, CA on Saturday nights.  But I digress....
The wait staff wasn't very attentive for an otherwise slow day at this venue, but the food was great.  I had the blue corn chicken enchiladas and a margarita.  No matter when you go, Agave never seems to have a full house and it makes me wonder how they keep the place going.  It's still a favorite of ours, though, and the bar layout is great for late night drinks with chips and salsa.  If you are ever in the Boca Park area, check it out.
