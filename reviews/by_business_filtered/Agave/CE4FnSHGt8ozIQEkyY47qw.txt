All I can say is WOW!!
We experienced the WORST service ever here!
We came here celebrating a family members birthday and had a large group. 
20 people
They provided us with 1 server who also had other tables to serve. What?!?!?!
Yeah one server.. with 1 person helping her. Needless to say everything was super slow and not right. 
Several people had to ask multiple times for simple water refills. We finally just asked if we could have a couple of pitchers of water placed on the table so that we could help ourselves. We were told they couldnt do that. 
So you're saying that you're too busy to get us water yourselves and you're unable to allow us to help ourselves. Interesting. 
Again She was one person so almost EVERYONES order was wrong when it made it to the table. 
Besides that she was so overwhelmed that she actually forgot to take the order of several  people at the table until AFTER the majority of us had received our food! 
It was a cluster all around. 
The food wasn't the worst but the service was so bad that I couldnt even upgrade their star based on the food. Besides I had the shrimp tacos and they werent that stellar. I actually prefer the shrimp tacos from Cafe Rio! 
You get more of the shrimp taste at CR than at Agave, their batter if very crunchy and actually overwhelms the shrimp.. .
Dah well. Now I know !!
