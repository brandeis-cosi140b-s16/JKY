Look, I understand people being upset because a burrito may cost you $15 or even that Agave's food is a tad more Americanized than the super authentic Mexican food you were expecting but to give them 1 or 2 stars for those reasons alone is quite absurd. 

I've been here twice so far and while I haven't been able to try everything on the menu yet, the few items I have eaten were simply delish! I too was there on Xmas and when I was there it was full of people and they were actually understaffed so service was a little slow but they still managed pretty well - food was on our table within 30 minutes. That just gave me more time to drink some of their swell Tequila offerings. Yes, it's also a fabulous Tequila bar that goes far beyond the standard bottle of Patron. While they do carry around 30 brands of Tequila I wish they would expand this even more to include some boutique brands, some newer brands, and even a few well established brands that they don't carry. That would really complete the full Tequila experience. Some of those brands I mention would be Scorpion Mezcal, El Agave Artesanal, Fina Estampa, 3 Amigos, Nocaut, Crotalo, Fidencio Mezcal, Karma, and Tres Agaves among others. Sorry, I'm a bit of a Tequila snob. 

All in all I've found this to be a great restaurant with good food, drinks, and service but can be a little on the pricey side but definitely worth more than 1 star.
