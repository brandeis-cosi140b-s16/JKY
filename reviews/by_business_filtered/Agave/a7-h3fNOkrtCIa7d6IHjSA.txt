I have eaten here before and had the crispy shrimp tacos and loved them but...
This review is for Happy Hour only.

The place is beautiful both inside and out. Free chips and salsa is always nice, the salsa was okay, nothing special.
They have 4 different tacos (chicken, beef, pork, and lamb) to choose from for 2$ each. $5 Blue Agave Margaritas and $2 Modelo beer. The margarita was good, probably a tad on the weak side but I still liked it. I  got a beef and a chicken taco. I love that they make their own tortillas, but thats as far as I can say I loved. They were both very different, but they also had so much going on, with the sauces they use. A friend got the lamb and she is from Mexico and said it was spicy.

The worst part of the night was our service (Rob), unattentive, if you didn't flag him down, he wouldn't even look your way to see if you needed anything. They forgot about my tacos, everyone else had eaten and I was still waiting. At the end we were trying to figure out how much each of us owed, and we asked him how much do they charge for a soda...he looked at us like we just asked him the meaning of life...he ran away. We guesstamated as to not frazzle him anymore. I didn't think it was that busy.
