This place is really hit or miss, I either have an amazing meal or it's way off. First time I ordered the tamales it was heaven and the next time it was bland and dry. I never know what to expect, but thankfully this last visit was wonderful and the food was delicious! I really love the look of the restaurant and the margaritas are magnificent. For the most part this is one of my favorite mexican restaurants if your lucky enough to catch the "good" cook!
