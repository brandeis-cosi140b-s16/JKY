So I was coming here once a month or so maybe more, however after Happy Hour Disaster I will not be back.  I went to Happy Hour and asked if they could do a veggie taco instead of a meat one.  They seriously delivered a tortilla with peppers in it.  Thats it! No cheese, salsa, sour cream just some sorry peppers.  Then boy wonder manager starts telling me the about the bulk price of meat.  Really Timberlake knock off you think I care?  If you dont do veggie taco then dont do them.  Maybe a mea culpa would be, we dont do veggie tacos but let me take 2 bucks off the potato tacos we actually make.  Say goodbye to my 140 dollars a month, too bad because I like your food. I always recommend Agave to hungry rock climbers as it is close to Red Rock, but no more.
