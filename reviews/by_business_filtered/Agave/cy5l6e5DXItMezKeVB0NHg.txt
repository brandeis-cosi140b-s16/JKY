My God in Heaven the Habe√±ro salsa is so good but so damn hot. I usually eat 2-3 bowls of it pre and post meal. It has such a great taste but wow is it hot. It leaves your mouth flaming hot for about an hour after eating it.

If you are a chili-head like me I highly recommend it but beware it's for real.
