Ok, I give the place three stars fairly reluctantly, but there just seems to be too much holding back what imo could be a five star slam dunk. If we could give half stars 2.5 for sure.

Ambiance: The decor is awesome.  The place is well lit, the walls are brightly colored, the space is very open, and the patios are excellent.

Happy Hour: I would really rather pay normal price than have those broke tacos.   The tacos are two small tortillas, a little bit of meat, and some onions. Both times the tacos were not even warmed up.  

Service: Once again, on and off.  While it's not the waiters fault per se`, we've had an hour wait for the food there more than once. One time we didn't get chips/water until the appetizers came, other times immediately. When it was immediate, there were much more people in there, so I cannot blame it on coming at a busy time.

Food: Flavors tend to be kind of bland and it's not too adventurous a menu. The Salsa variety is very good though. It is a little pricey for what you get,,, but you probably won't find anything you don't like...

However, I've probably been there more than nearly every Mexican restaurant in town. Like an old flame you can't quite shake, even when you know there's better ones for you.  I give three stars for the environment because it is a fun place to be in and the food is always serviceable if not spectacular.
