I don't go here for late night or the bar/gaming experience.
We take our child and find this restaurant fun and family friendly (there are almost always a few other families with kids there).
The food is great, the chips and salsas are delish and burritos are a notch above.  
We've tried different things and have had no complaints, the flavors linger in your mouth and you can taste the difference in the high quality ingredients.
