I came here with my family back in August, and coming nearly fresh back from a multiple-month stay in Mexico City, my standards were high.

My blue corn chicken enchilada was made with dyed white corn!! Blue food coloring, instead of authentic, more expensive, blue cornmeal! I won't get into the bodily functions that made me realize this the next day, but suffice to say this was the ultimate insult, and an outright lie on the menu.

That said, the waiter was friendly, they had Dos Equis Amber on tap, which is a plus, and the decor was Mexican themed, yet modern and chill. Based on first impressions, they were doing a good job.

However, the food here is extremely average, and slightly overpriced.
