I HAVE HAD MULTIPLE DINNERS LUNCHES AT AGAVE SINCE ITS OPENING AROUND 2005. Given the fact that this place has a very high turnover you never seem to get the same server or service. This is why I will have to give this place a 3 star. Mainly because of its service staff and the volatility of the service provided. Food is good providing that there was no turnover in the kitchen. EX. Our server on our last trip accdentally gave our food to the table next to us. So we had to wait an additional 30 minutes for their short falling.
