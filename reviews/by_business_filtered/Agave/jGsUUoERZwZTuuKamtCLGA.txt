I love good Mexican food and this place knows how to make it. The ambiance takes you south of the border as soon as you step inside. The tequila tasting is fun and they always have local specials on the weekends for free margaritas. I've gone on romantic dates and hung out with large groups of friends there. The patio is perfect on summer nights (tables could be bigger) but the fire is great. I go here all the time and recommend it to everyone!
