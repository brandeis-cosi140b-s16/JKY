I had used a Groupon that I bought and had always wanted to try this place and when I saw a Groupon I bought it. I will say this was such a great experience. The food was amazing, much better than I expected, best I have had for gourmet Mexican. We had the Rib Taquitos for appetizer and they were great, I wish I had some right now. My boyfriend and I ordered to meals to split, the Filet Minion fajitas (to die for) and the Chicken Blue Corn Enchiladas (so delicious). I also like the 3 different salsa dips they first start you off with and tortillas. The service at first was great, it did get a little busy and our server was busy and forgot to check in on us but when we got our food the enchiladas were lukewam warm so when we asked for them to be heated they came right out and said they are making a new dish for us. When we go the dish, hot and amazing, the temperature of the food made all the difference and I am glad I asked for them to be heated because I would have rated the dish at a 3 out of 5 and now I rate 5 out of 5. I love the ambiance of the place, modern and the circle dining is inviting. The outside seating is comfortable and cozy. Overall both my boyfriend and I will be back when we crave Mexican, just went 3 days ago and could go again now. 
I highly recommend trying this place.
