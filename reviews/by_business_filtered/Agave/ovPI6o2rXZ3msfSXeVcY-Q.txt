We've been to Agave a few times since it opened.  It's not the best mexican restaurant in town, but it's better than most.  We've always had good service, and we've always enjoyed the food.  It is pricey, though, so the food and service should be good.  Last night we sat on the patio, right beside one of their gaslog kivas.  We like how th patio is below grade, so you can't see the parking lot.  It is probably the best restaurant patio on the west side.  We were immediately served complimentary chips and salsa, but the chips were stale.  We didn't complain until we decided to order quacamole, which was delicious, and fresher chips were brought without complaint.  Our server had too many tables, but she worked hard and took good care of us.  Agave needs to step up and get cloth dinner napkins.  The pitiful, cheap paper ones they use are inferior to most fast food places.  We've always enjoyed the decor at Agave, and we still do.  Nice place, nice patio.  Go and enjoy!
