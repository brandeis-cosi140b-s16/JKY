We've visited this place a few times in the past, but this will be about our last recent visit.

We came here for dinner and we were immediately seated, even though the place seemed pretty busy.

The mood of this place at night would be good to take a date to at night.  I find it very cozy and intimate. 

Lets dive straight to the food we ordered.

The chips and salsa are standard.  There were two salsas and a bean dip and they are very good.  This is a main reason why we come here sometimes.  It is a tasty freebie.

For an appetizer, my wife was on a huge ceviche kick so we decided to go with that first.  We got the Shrimp Ceviche which has shrimp with fresh lime, cucumber, cilantro, jalape√±os and avocado.  We eat these with tortilla chips and treat it like a special salsa.  It is insanely delicious and highly recommended.

For the main course, my better half chose the Crispy Rock Shrimp Tacos.  These tacos are buttermilk soaked rock shrimp spiced in beer batter, cabbage slaw and fresh lime.  She enjoyed it and I snuck a bite in as well.  Not bad.

I chose the Fresh Fish Tacos - grilled-spiced tilapia with poblano pepper slaw, salsa fresca and fresh lime.  I really need to try other items here, but this is such a safe and satisfying choice that I tend to stick with it.  

Now lets get to the dessert - fried ice cream.  Pretty standard for a Mexican restaurant but good nonetheless.

The main meal required a little bit of patients from us, but we weren't in a hurry so it wasn't a big deal.

The food is good and so is the service.  Our server was very friendly and professional.  This place is good for the occasional visit when we need to mix up from our usual places.

One note: for some reason, and I don't know if it's just me, but I feel like jeans and a button up shirt is almost the lowest you can go here.  T-Shirt and shorts here make me feel uncomfortable as the atmosphere is definitely a looker.
