Great Mexican food, but the strongest margaritas you will ever have in your life. Apparently, the staff takes the leftover lime juice/tequila mix from the night before and adds it to the next day's batch of drinks. Therefore, letting the tequila intensify in flavor overnight and yielding a much, much stronger drink the next day.
