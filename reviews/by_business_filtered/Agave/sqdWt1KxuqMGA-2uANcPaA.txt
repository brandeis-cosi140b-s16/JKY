This place was a great experience. We bought a groupon to eat here and stopped before we went to the Red Rock Casino. This is a classy place. Wonderful ambiance and decor. Our server was really nice and helpful with menu suggestions. The tequila list is great and there is a lot to choose from. The margaritas are good and so is the food!  I recommend this place.
