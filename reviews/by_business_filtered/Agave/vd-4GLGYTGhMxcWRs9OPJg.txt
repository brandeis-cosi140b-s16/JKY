We loved the taste, the portions were certainly enough to get full on, and the ambiance was upscale enough for a special occasion without making you feel that a suit and tie was necessary. Expect a wait at popular times, like you would get at any decent restuarant.  I thought the prices were fair, its not a discount taco barn. Overall, very enjoyable. Groupon got us there the first time, and we've been back.
