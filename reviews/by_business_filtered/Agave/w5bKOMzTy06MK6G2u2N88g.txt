This place has a great vegetarian selection!   I get so bored with cheese enchiladas and bean burritos... this place has a very good selection like potato and poblano mushroom tacos!  YUMM!!  A little pricier than most Mexican restaurants, but the atmosphere makes it worth it.  You won't feel out of place in jeans and you won't feel out of place if you are dressed up.  Great happy hour specials too!  I also love the drink ware!!!  Where can I buy some???
