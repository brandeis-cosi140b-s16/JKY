When I lived in Summerlin/Las Vegas this is where you would find me...out on the patio with friends, some icy Negra Modelos and margaritas and any of the items off the menu.
I have never had a bad meal or experience here - don't understand what some of these reviews are about.
After dark it gets great, with the firepits lit up out on the patio...a great way to wallow away the evening listening to some Alejandro Sanz, Laura Pausini, or whatever else they're playing on the sound system.
