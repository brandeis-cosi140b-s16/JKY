Truly an amazing place!!!

I am from out of town and held my wedding reception there. from the very beginning patrick was so helpful in helping me coordinate the whole affair. he was attentive and easy to work with. 

the food itself was great!.... my guests couldn't stop talking about the Mayan chicken tamale and the guacamole. we had the rock shrimp chile relleno, blue corn chicken enchiladas and the beef fajitas. it was great!

lastly, almost everyone of my guests commented on their amazing service. they couldn't believe how nice and accommodating the staff was..

overall, i would go here again and you should too!
