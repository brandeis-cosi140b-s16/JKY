This place should be named America's disappointment shop instead. When we arrived I had high expectations of this place. The menu looked promising. I had my wife and child with me we both got burritos and al pastor quesadilla and when it came to ordering some soft drinks their options weren't very expansive or inexpensive. Finally the burritos (al pastor) arrived and when I saw the size of the burrito I was super annoyed for the 24 dollars I just spent it should of been the size of a small dog. Needless to say I will not be coming back to America's disappointment shop. The reason for 2 stars was because the meat itself was delicious but it's not worth it. Sorry.
