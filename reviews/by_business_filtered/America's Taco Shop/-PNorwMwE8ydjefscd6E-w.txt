Ok - so five stars? You ask . . .really for a small taco shop with a small menu? But here is why - I think that inexpensive eats are hard to find - especially ones that are worth eating at. But this is the place - I have tried a wide range of items on their menu - and this morning I ventured to America's for a little breakfast burrito. Everything is always great!! Also - not over done or over complicated - just good simple food. Enough said!
