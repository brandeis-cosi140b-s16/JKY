We have eaten at the 7th location and lost our minds at how great the food was. Found it from some vlogger's post on his quest for perfect taco. And they were perfect!

We moved and now this location is closer. Finally had time to try it tonight. 

Another reviewer has it correct, a sterile environment. You could tell me I was in a Subway, and I'd believe you. The table layout is awkward and we couldn't find a comfortable place to relax. Opted for the bar seating. 

I don't often order fountain drinks... their way cool machine looks great, but the mix is off. My soda was not flat, but just tasted funky. 

It took forever to get our food. A regular burrito al pastor, a taco al pastor and a carne asana taco. Not the most complex things to slap together. 

The burrito, the $6 burrito, was smaller then a Taco Bell bean and cheese burro. The two tacos, cheaper than burro we're both bigger. The meat in all three was cold. I'm talking chilly. No, it was not from the cold topping, it was flat out, against health code cold! 

Took two bite of burro and realized it was half gone, felt stupid. So, got the guts to go back to register and ask for something else. The cashier had nothing but excuses. "We portion control" "Meat is cold from the toppings" "Do you have your receipt?" I guess because it took 20 minutes to get food, they could have forgotten we were recently up there....

Then asked if I wanted something else or money back. I opted for money back. No offer of a substitute on the house. No apology. 

Finally, one of the employees came out to inquire about our little food complaint. He did ask if we wanted something else, or a taco for the road. He offered an explanation (another excuse or explanation....) they were training a new person, that's why it was cold. Okay. Whatever. 

Sooooo very disappointing. Not America's best. Sad sad sad.
