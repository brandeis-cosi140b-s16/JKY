My entire family has become a fan of this place, and for the most part, I'm a fan as well.  The Carne torta is the best I've had in Phoenix, and the vampiro tacos are awfully pleasant and every satisfying.  They tend to have some fun stuff on the menu such as their shrimp ceviche or coffee/horchata mix, and they have some nice specials on weekends, and loads of Mexican beer (bleccch!) and o.k. margaritas.  They fall a bit flat on their side dishes, I certainly expected something better than what I got for "America's Corn"...not nearly as tasty as you would expect it to be.
Overall, 3.5 - 4 stars for the food.

They score 5 stars from me for the appearance of the place...the character and theme is decidedly local and doesn't feel overly contrived, which is the usual downfall for a place like this or a chain competitor (such as 2 - 2.5 star joints like Rubio's or Tacos Del Mar).  Solid four star service.

For a family of four, expect to drop 25-30$.  Not bad for some pretty good and relatively authentic tacos and burros...enjoy!
