I was rather skeptical about this place upon arriving.  The menu is quite small, not leaving many options.  (Especially since I wasn't in the mood for Mexican - I was brought here by friends).  

I decided to go for the Pastor tacos, and placed my order.  They informed me that tacos were on special and that by ordering 1 more taco, I would actually be paying less.  I did, and got a carne asada taco as well.  They were freaking delicious!  We also got the ceviche and guacamole and salsa, all equally as good.  If you are looking for unique drink, try the cochata.  (horchata mixed with coffee)  it has quite an interesting texture, but was good.

It was a bit pricey, but I think if I had just stuck with the tacos, and skipped all the extras it would have been quite reasonable.  Enjoy!
