Get the carne asada torta! It's just perfect! The telera bread (the traditional bread used to make a torta for those of you that don't know) is toasted to perfection!  For me, that is a must when having a torta!  Their carne asada is tender and flavorful and topped with jalape√±os and avocado, lettuce and tomato. 

My friend ordered the carne asada tacos and to be honest, this was the quietest dinner we had shared in a long time.  The food was so good we forgot the other one was there!  

We ordered a side of refried beans that was the ideal size for sharing and they were creamy and super tasty.  

Do yourself a favor and order a horchata...but be warned, that when you order a large, it's not just any large....it's a L-A-R-G-E.  :-) 

Can't wait to go back and try some more items on their menu! :-)
