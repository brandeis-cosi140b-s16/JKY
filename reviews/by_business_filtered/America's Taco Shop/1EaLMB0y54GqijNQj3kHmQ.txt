Just visited America's again tonight for my third visit.  I'd say it's time for a review:

I love this place.  This corner spot has run through so many restaurants and finally they have one that is going to stick!  I've always gone on Thursday nights so I can't say what it's like on other nights or days of the week.  I've run into friends each time I've ventured in for my hour-long stay.  I've also chatted up perfect strangers - frankly, that's not so unusual for me though so I won't go on.  Suffice it to say it's a friendly neighborhood joint.  Tonight's special was Burro de pastor.  A marinated and grilled pork with guacamole, pineapple, cilantro and other tasty bits.  My 3 year old, 5 year old and 45 year old husband loved them.  We also had the Vampiro which was delicious too.  A corn tortilla with the pastor pork, guacamole & caramelized onions mmmmm.  Kids also order the fail-safe quesadilla.  It's good - how bad can cheese in a flour tortilla be?  Thing is, I don't want to order quesadillas for my kids.  The last time I was there we had the carne asada--my husband and I both love it, the kids didn't love it.  The pastor is ideal for them though, a little sweet and a lot of savory.

The staff are all very friendly and helpful.

Enjoy it
