I don't know. I definitely have friends that would name their first born children America and Taco after this place but I just don't get it. It was ok. I got two tacos, one carne asada and one pastor. They were good. But that's it, they were good. They were also small. And they were also expensive. $2.50ish each and I definitely could have eaten 4 (and I'm not a big person)

It's just middle of the road to me, I'd never go out of my way to eat there but I'd never complain about going there if that's where my friends were headed either.
