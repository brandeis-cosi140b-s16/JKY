This place is excellent!

They use ranchera carne asada... way better quality meat than most shops. Get the EXTRA LARGE carne asada burrito. The regular size is too small. 

Price wise, America's is going to be expensive compared to the cheap burrito places. But they make up for it in quality. 

The "Best carne asada in Phoenix" is not at this place... It's at my house! haha.

Good place to catch lunch. Don't expect to be blown away... but it's enjoyable.
