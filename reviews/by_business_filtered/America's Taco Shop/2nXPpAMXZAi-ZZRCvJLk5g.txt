This is my daughter's favorite bean and cheese burrito EVER! I really love the carne asada, and the Al Pastor is also quite good. During happy hour, I can feed my daughter before play practice for $1.08, and she LOVES it. Great deal, simple good food. Highly recommend if that is what you are looking for.
