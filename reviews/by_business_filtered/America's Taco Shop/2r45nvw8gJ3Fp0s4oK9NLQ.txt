Driving around looking for a mexican place to grab a quick lunch!!! Ja! there it was a small and rustic Taco place! They only offer carne asada and al pastor in many different ways but there are all great! It was perfect! they even sell beers... awesome! The carne asada had an amazing good flavor... Al pastor wasn't my favorite but very tasty too! Their margaritas aren't strong enough I guess because is a draft one! Very nice place! I'll recommend this place for a quick lunch!
