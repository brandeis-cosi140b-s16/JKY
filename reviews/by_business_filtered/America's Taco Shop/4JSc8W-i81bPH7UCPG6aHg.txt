I went here for lunch on a weekday so it wasn't that crowded, and parking was not an issue in the dirt lot everyone raves about. Tacos were pretty good: I had one chicken, carne asada, and pork. The last 2 were the best. Their guacamole was tasty. Cashier and the other guy walking around (manager or owner?) were friendly and checked on us a few times. There is a large back patio area so if you want to enjoy some tacos outside before it heats up, check this place out.
