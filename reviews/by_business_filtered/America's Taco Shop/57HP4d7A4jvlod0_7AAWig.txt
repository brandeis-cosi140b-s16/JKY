I love this place!! I have to come here every time I visit Phoenix.  I am not usually a big fan of Bean & Cheese burritos, but that is what I always order here, something about their beans is so different and so delicious!  I also love the chips and salsa and their iced tea.  If you are in Phoenix, they have several locations, you should definitely check it out.
