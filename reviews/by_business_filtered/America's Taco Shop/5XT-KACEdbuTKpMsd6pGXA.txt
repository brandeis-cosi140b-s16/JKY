Having eaten here MANY times, I'm now ready to call it as I see it. The food is good, but overpriced. The portions are small and the worst thing is that the people who run this place have a seething unspoken negative attitude toward gringo customers that they cannot or will not conceal. It's as if they're doing you a favor by taking your order and giving you the food. No one but the high school kids they hire ever smiles here! They sometimes make an excellent batch of ceviche on Fridays, but be sure to get it in a bowl instead of a taco or tostada or else they will short you on the amount. To me, Bad attitudes toward customers are unacceptable. I will not be back again.
