The food was not tasty at all. I ordered a carne asada quesadilla reg size, it was a good portion but it's got a funny taste. I understand you're not gonna like everything on the menu but I tried to find something basic. I did not enjoy it. What I did enjoy was the fact that there was a girl walking around asking the customers how their meal was. When she got to me she could see I was not pleased. Immediately told her manager and they gave me a full refund and replaced my meal with something else, even though I didn't enjoy that either. I went with the grilled chicken salad, I think the guacamole they use is just not good at all and it's overpowering the rest of the dish. So for the food it would be 1 star but because of the excellent service I give them 3 stars. I will not be back, but if you want good service this is the place to go.
