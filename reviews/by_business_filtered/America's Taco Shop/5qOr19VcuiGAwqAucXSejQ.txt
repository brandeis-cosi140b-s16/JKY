This is a fun little place for tacos and light Mexican fare. I had the ceviche and my husband had some tacos. The carne asada is some of the best I've had in the area. The ceviche was delicious. It wasn't overdone and loaded with unnecessary ingredients. Simplicity dominates the small menu at America's Taco Shop and the focus on quality is evident in the food. The best part is probably the price. Everything is so cheap! If you want a light lunch then you could get out of there for around four bucks but if you're really hungry drop a ten and unhinge your jaw. The hot sauce was also quite good. Very smokey and spicy. Great beer specials on the weekend!

The restaurant is small but they have nice little patio with misters. Perfect place to stop for lunch downtown. I'm excited to go back when I'm hungrier. Their burritos looked delicious.
