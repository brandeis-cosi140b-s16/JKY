Its really great to have ATS right by my house now! We had the vampiros al pastor, chicken tacos, chips and salsa and a bean and cheese burrito. All fabulous. Ice tea was also great. But, the thing i love about it here is the incredibly friendly service. I specifically asked her name because she was just so damn nice. She brought us mire chips without asking, checked on us a couple of times just because she was passing by and really knew the menu which was helpful to my friends that had never eaten here. So, thank you Sage. It makes a delicious meal even better when someone like you goes above and beyond.
