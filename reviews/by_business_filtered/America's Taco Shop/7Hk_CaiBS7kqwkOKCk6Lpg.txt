A colleague and I went to ATS yesterday for lunch and again were very pleased with the meal. Now I am not a small appetite and it may be because the food is super good but the only downfall is the size of the tacos. However we both got the Taco Tuesday deal which you can't beat. The Carne was well marinated and cooked to perfection. The place is small so if you happen to go there on a hot summer day during a lunch rush you may not have the best experience however we sat outside on the patio and enjoyed a great lunch. This is one of my top go to spots for Carne Asada in Phoenix.  My colleague had been there before and got the Torta and said it was awesome as well!
