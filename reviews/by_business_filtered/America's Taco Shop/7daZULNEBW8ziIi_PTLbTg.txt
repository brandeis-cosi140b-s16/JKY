What an absolute disgrace of an establishment. But what was I expecting going to a place called "America's Taco Shop"?

As soon as you walk into this place it smells like crap. The entrance is right next to the bathroom, but even the dining area isn't far enough to suppress the smell of feces permeating from the bathroom.  We were already determined to try out the tacos at this place, so we gave it a shot anyways. 

Originally, we had seen the sign for $1 tacos during happy hour. Just so happens to be that we were there at happy hour. However, the person taking our order informed us that only tacos al pastore (pork tacos) were available. Thanks for mentioning that on the sign. Still though, I was determined to give it a try as my significant other hesitated.

We decided on the carne asada burrito, its almost impossible to mess this up, right? Wrong, unfortunately this place messed it up real bad. First, the food is mediocre. Compared to a place like Filibertos, which doesn't have special food but rather generous portions for a fair price, this place is an absolute rip-off. I probably should have read Larry's review before hitting this place up.

I could have bought FOUR of these burritos at $6.50 a piece, and it still wouldn't beat Filiberto's or Chipotle. In fact, if you gave me FOUR burritos from here for the price of $6.50, then I'd STILL go to Chipotle or Filiberto's. Anyway you do the math, it just doesn't add up. Portions are too small, place smells like crap, and food is mediocre at best.
