I've been to this restaurant three times now.  Some of the food is good, most is merely so-so. Given the prices, it should all be great.

Carne asada is the best thing they have to offer. It's much more tender than I've found it at most restaurants, but other recipes have more flavor. Served as a torta with pickled jalapeno slices it's really fantastic. Pastor is okay, but lacks any distinct flavor. Mine was a little chewy. A chicken option would've been nice, but I understand that the restaurant wants to stick to its specialties. I'm glad that there is a lard-free bean burro for those who don't eat red meat or pork.

As for sides and such: Aguas frescas are terrible.  The horchata is chalky and the jamaica is cloyingly sweet. Flan has way too much caramel and no real texture, it isn't creamy and it doesn't have the consistency of a cheese flan either. Tastes like it came from a package. Skip all of these.

Tortas and burros run about $6, drinks and sides are at least $3. I don't think there's any way to justify a $3 bottle of coke, and the portions are pretty small for the prices. The carne torta gets a definite thumbs up, but I can't recommend this place on the basis of one dish.
