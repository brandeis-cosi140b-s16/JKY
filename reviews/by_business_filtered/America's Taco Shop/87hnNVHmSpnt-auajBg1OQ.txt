What is it with thin, almost meatless burritos in this valley? Attending a meeting nearby I caught this place on a drive-by and decided to try it. I was thrilled to find an Al Pastor option! ...except when the burrito arrived I had to hunt and dig to find the Al Pastor. It was all tortilla and some sort of green veggie mixture.  I would love to say that the Al Pastor made up for it but I could barely taste any... The accompanying salsa was sweet... yuck!

You'd think a burrito place near the University would be a slam dunk, but I don't even think a strong case of the late night munchies would find this place even remotely satisfying. Bleh!
