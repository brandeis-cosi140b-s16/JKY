I am a bit biased against Mexican food, as I am not a fan for greasy/cheesy food. I have had some horrendous experience with a lard-dripping chicken burrito before in a place-shall-not-be-named. But as a general preference, I like my Mexican food "light."

For lunch, this place is just madly busy. I was just 5 minute late and there were 20 people between me and the rest of the party. The chicken taco I got was light -- a good thing! Friends loved the bean and cheese burrito, and the bean is white bean -- another good thing! Overall, cute place, good food.
