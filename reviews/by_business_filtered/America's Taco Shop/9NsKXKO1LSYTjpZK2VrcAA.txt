One of my absolute fave places to sit out on the patio and enjoy a cold bottle of Mexican coca cola and some carne asada! 

I've had the torta, I've had the tacos, I've had the pastor.  All of these are stellar!

This last time, I finally tried the Elote! A cob of sweet corn covered in crema and queso! I can't explain how delicious this is...it is beyond words!

Taco Tuesday is now Taco-Elote Tuesday!  

Never have I ever...been disappointed at America's!!!!
