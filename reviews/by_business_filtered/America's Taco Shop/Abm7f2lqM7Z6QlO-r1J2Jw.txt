You know when you have a habit of being a repeat customer, when they ask "where have you been?"  I can honestly say I stop in here a lot!  This isn't a fancy place but the food will be awesome.  They have a huge patio and now they have add a ping pong table.  This is a great place for friends and family to come together and have a great meal.  

Bean and Cheese Burrito, America's Way.  Everyone must try this!!  Best burrito I've had (sorry grandma).  Add an order of chips and salsa and your order is complete.  

ATS has the friendliest staff and is the best place to grab a bite.  Hike, bike, run or walk to ATS soon!
