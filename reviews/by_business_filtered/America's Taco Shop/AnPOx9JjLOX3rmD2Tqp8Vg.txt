Meh

Staff and service were just fine.

Salsas were small in  portion and bordering on tasteless.  

Carne asade xl burrito was ok.  Considering the reputation, I was expecting some really flavorful meat.  Nope, it was good, but completely forgettable.  I did enjoy the lack of greasiness in the food though.  I'll come back, but I don't understand why it's so highly rated unless every other place is just that bad.
