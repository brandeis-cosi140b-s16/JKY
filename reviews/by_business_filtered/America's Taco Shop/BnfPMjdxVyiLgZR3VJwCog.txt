Found this restaurant searching on the yelp web page and I'm glad I did! I came here with a co worker and we enjoyed the food.

I got a carne asada burro which was pretty good. The tortilla was warm and delicious and the pico inside was also great. The only thing I wish was a little different was larger chunks of meat, which is probably a personal preference. 

What was really delicious was the Horchata. Oh man, so so so good. I want to go back here again (secretly for the horchata) but would try something else, just to experience something different.

Overall, I would definitely recommend America's Taco Shop. Good food at very reasonable prices.
