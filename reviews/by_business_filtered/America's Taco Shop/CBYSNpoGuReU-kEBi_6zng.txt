This restaurant was a favorite but its gone downhill a bit. We love to get the quattro with chips, salsa, and guacamole. The bean burritos are still the best in town. We are now vegetarians but when we ate mest we loved the carne asado tacos, but they changed the meat and it just isn't the same. OK with us since we don't eat them anymore. This is good fast food.
