This is the first and last visit to this location.  I've been to the other locations and have always had a great experience.  We showed up at 12:45 and the signature El-Pastor was still raw - the ETA was around 2pm which is a joke considering when people eat lunch.  Service was VERY slow, we had to send back a quesadilla because it barely had any cheese and the tortilla was barely heated up.  The place was not clean or organized with a lot of dirty tables and stuff on floors.

This is not a good representation of this specific chain/franchise.  Always have a great experience at other locations.
