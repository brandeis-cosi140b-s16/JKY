Craving for some tacos so we went to this America's Taco Shop the other day for lunch.  They have three locations now and they seem to be doing well since there were a lot of folks dining here when we arrived.  The restaurant is quaint, very clean and nicely decorated with a few TV's.  They have a very patio for dining with friends, whether permitting of course. 

Service ~ you walk in, up to the counter and place your order.  The folks working here are friendly and accommodating.  They do a lot of carry out in addition to their dine in. 

Food ~ We had their Carne Asada Tacos, Al Pastor Burritos, some shrimp ceviche since it was on a Saturday and their chips and salsa with guacamole.  The carne asada was diced rather than pulled so it had a different texture than what I am used to.  It tasted ok and with a little of their salsa and a lite squeeze on the lime my tacos went from ok to very good.  The al pastor buro had a good balance of spice with grilled pineapples and plenty of cilantro, lettuce and salsa, It was also ok to good.  The salsa and chips were really tasty but their guac was not something I would order again.  The shrimp ceviche was very disappointing since I'm a huge fan of ceviche.  Bits of diced cucumber, onion, tomato with diced shrimp?  It was more of a salsa with a little shrimp added.  The beer was excellent!!

They have a nice patio so it's a great place to dine for lunch or dinner next time you are craving some tacos!
