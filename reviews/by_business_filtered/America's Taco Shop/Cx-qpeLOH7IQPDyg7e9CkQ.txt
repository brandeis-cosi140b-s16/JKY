Nothing makes me happier than to see that this terrible establishment has finally closed!! This review is about a year after the fact, but what the heck.. America's Taco Shop was responsible for one of the worst 72hr periods of my life. I made the mistake of eating here after class and became deathly ill. So sick in fact that I was taken to the hospital and treated for "Staph Food Poisoning" which specifically comes from food that has been allowed to gather bacteria in an unsanitary kitchen environment and from food that is being kept well below the required temperatures.15lbs of vomit and $1000s later i was released back society. Considering this shit shack has now become a local chain I will take any means necessary to avoid their toxic food and meal preparation practices. Unless you want to see exactly how much vomit can come from your body... i suggest you do the same.
