I'm a big fan of ATS, but I'm always sticker shocked at how expensive it is when everything adds up, and it takes quite a while to get the food.  It's good, but with the zillion other taco places around, I think I'd rather try out a new place.  Maybe if they run a deal on Groupon, Living Social, or Voice I'd head there again.
