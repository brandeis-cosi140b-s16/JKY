I've seen this place before in Tempe so I was dying to give it a try....oh no, now I have another fast food guilty pleasure :)   Me and my friend both thought the guac was amazing and couldn't stop eating it.. one of the workers even brought us extra chips free of charge and refilled our drinks (did I mention this is a fast food restaurant?).  I had the carne asada torte and it was sooo good.. I keep dreaming about it.. I'll have to go back sooner then later..like tomorrow.
