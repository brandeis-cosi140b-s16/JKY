I just ate there and I was expecting many different kinds of Tacos. They have 2 and they are meat or meat. The tortilla was cold, the meat was lukewarm and was not freshly cooked. The carne asada was chewy and disgusting and my stomach now hurts. This place is just terrible. My friend who only eats chicken has 2 choices and went for the bean and cheese burrito which was just bad and bland. My carne asada tacos were bland too. Finally it smells like paint thinner in there. Just terrible.
