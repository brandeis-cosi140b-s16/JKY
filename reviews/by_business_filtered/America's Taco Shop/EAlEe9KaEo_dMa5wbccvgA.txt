On a referral write-up we read in a well received Phoenix Food publication, my Fiance & I put America's Taco Shop on our list of 'must visits,' as we both absolutely LOVE great Mexican Food. Consequently, after some time lapse from the date of reading the esteemed recommendation of this Shop having 'THE GREATEST CARNE ASADA in the Valley,' we FINALLY visited and experienced their food last night for dinner.  We ordered 2 Carne Asada Burritos (regular size) and 2 Carne Asada Tacos, just as they are prepared, unmodified.  The tacos are without a doubt good.  However, they are standard Asada street tacos in size and with garnishing.  Outside of happy hour times, these Asada tacos are sold at $2.35 each, not at all a good value, however, during happy hour, they're only $1.00 a piece, which is appropriate, relative to what one receives in portion.  The burritos, when ordered in the regular size, can easily be referred to and identified as a junior sized burrito, which will set you back about $6.00 a piece...This is UNHEARD of in the Valley, where GREAT MEXICAN FOOD abounds and is generally offered at a very good value.  Not the case here.  Food was good, but certainly NOT THE GREATEST CARNE ASADA in the Valley...Not even marginally.  Needless to say, my Fiance and I were equally disappointed with our findings.  Therefore, we will not return nor recommend America's Taco Shop as a 'must visit' Asada stop to any of our friends or colleagues; UNLESS one finds themselves in an unusual bind and it's happy hour time...Then buy all means, take your dollar bills and order the Asada tacos and a Margarita then call it an afternoon.  Should you be looking for a REAL MEXICAN FOOD experience with highly anticipated supreme flavors and substantial portions, do yourself a favor and pass on this place.
