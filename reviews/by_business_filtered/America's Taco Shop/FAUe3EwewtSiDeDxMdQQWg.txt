In a sea of great Mexican restaurants, I've always found it difficult to find a great taco shop like the kind you can find in Mexico or even southern California. Maybe I'm not looking in the right places here in Phoenix...but, along came America's and man do I dig their grub and their vibe. I've ben eating here regularly (at both locations) since they have opened and have yet to have a poor experience. 

The taco's are great and my wife swears by their bean burrito. Fire up a Pacifico on the patio and life is good. Very good. Best Carne Asada in town? My vote is yes.
