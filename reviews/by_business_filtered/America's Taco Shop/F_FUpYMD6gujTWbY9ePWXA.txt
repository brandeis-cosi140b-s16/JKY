I don't eat meat so this review may not be helpful to everyone.

Chips & guacamole- seemed like equal parts avocado and equal parts tomato.....not crazy about tomato. The chips were good.

Veggie quesadilla- I use the word veggie loosely. Lettuce, barely "caramelized" onions, cheese and guacamole. It came with a salsa that lacked heat and personality. No bell pepper. No mushrooms. No cilantro. 

Dining experience- outdoor area was pleasant.

My husband ordered 3 carne asada tacos because they are "The best in town". Tacos were skimpy on the meat which was fine with me because I want him to quit meat anyway.

We came here because of the Check Please episode. Sadly, it wasn't worth it. I didn't even eat all my food nor did I take home leftovers.....that never happens.
