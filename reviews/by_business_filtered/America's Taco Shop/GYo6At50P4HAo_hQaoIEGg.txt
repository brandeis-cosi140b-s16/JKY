I heard so much about this place I had to try it. I got three Tacos, very bland nothing special, a side of beans,lard free and the guacamole got the two starts. No service at all, or they must have been short of people. The server forgot the beans and finally my friend had to go to the counter and ask for it ( probably overlooked).  We were done with the tacos. 

The tacos, reminded me of "where is the canasada?" very little beef, the shredded lettuce didnt add anything and the salsa did not have any flavoring or punch. I love to support locally owned business, unfortunately we will not go back.
