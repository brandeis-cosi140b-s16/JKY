I guess as with any restaurant, people either love or hate it.  I fall somewhere in the middle.  I have been here a couple of times and always had an ok experience.  Last night I tried the Pastor Burrito.  It was filled with pork flavored with Pineapple. I guess I expected it might have something else in the Burrito like beans, cheese, rice but it only contained just the meat.  For $7.95 I also thought it was on the small size.  

On an unrelated note, I noticed they have electrical wiring running on the wall above the cash register.  Please keep in mind the nearest exit just in case the place bursts into flames.
