Tried the carnitas taco.  It was ok - 3 stars.  I like them more as a true street taco.  This one had pineapple and sauces to go with.  I like mine with just the meat, onions, cilantro and some spicy salsa.  Heads up, the guac that comes with this is the packaged stuff.  It's not the fresh guac you can buy separate. 
Why the 4 stars?  B/c their horchata, salsa, and beans.  Oh so yummy!  THe horchata was definitely homemade.  So yummy and creamy but not too creamy.  Oh and the beans...I'm drooling just thinking about them.  Simple and oh so good.
