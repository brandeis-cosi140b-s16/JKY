My girlfriend got a carne asada burrito and Mexican style corn. I got a chicken quesadilla. I was very excited reading the list of ingredients, however I got none of the flavors in my quesadilla. Although it was our first time and they gave us chips and salsa, I found the salsa wonderful but the chips generic and stale. The tortilla on the quesadilla invited burrito I had were lackluster. However Jessica as it some of the best carne asada she has tried. I think I would try the place again and not get the chicken.
