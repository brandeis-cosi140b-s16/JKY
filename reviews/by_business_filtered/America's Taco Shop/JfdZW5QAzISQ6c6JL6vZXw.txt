This is the best America's location. The quality is very consistent compared to other locations. The bean and cheese burrito is the most amazing burrito I've ever had. The fresh spicy salsa does not disappoint. Coffee with horchata and the tacos al pastor are two of my other favorites. Visited this location once with a coworker who proved to be a finicky eater...she did not like what she ordered and they were happy to make her something different. Very nice employees!
