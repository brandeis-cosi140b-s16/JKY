Why can't we make a big deal about tacos on each day of the week instead of just Tuesday?  

Americas Taco Shop figured it out and they celebrate Taco Tuesday all day everyday.  Whether you want steak tacos, chicken tacos, fish tacos or even just a bean burrito they got you covered.  Dining area is spacious and the staff is friendly.  Come here any time during the day and feast yourself on some great tasting tacos.  I prefer getting them American style with a side of chips and salsa!
