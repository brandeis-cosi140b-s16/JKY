I went in again, and it was amazing! I had a carne asada taco, it was perfect.  THe salsa is not too spicy, and super fresh, and the carne asada was done perfect.  The Corn Tortillas were a perfect touch as well.  I just hope everything goes well with the liquor license, I would of loved a coronita!
