First I should say I don't like Mexican food.  I struggle to find something I can eat on the menu.   Went here tonight since someone else was craving it...I had an incredible egg, chorizo, potato, cheese breakfast burritto for dinner.  I made it clear that it had to be as spice free as possible and they did a wonderful job.  I saw the ppm taxis and bean burritto get devoured.  Guacomole had a bit too much of a kick for me bit that is how most people like it.  We took our order to go and it was all good when we got home.
