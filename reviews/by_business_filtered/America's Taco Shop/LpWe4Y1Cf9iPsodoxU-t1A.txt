Carne asada you'll never forget, customer service that makes you feel like family, and ambiance that will keep you coming back every week! I really love this place for work lunches or weekend relaxation.

I really do wish they would lower their prices a little, though.  I'd visit even more often if a taco didn't cost so much.
