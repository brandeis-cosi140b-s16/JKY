For lunch, my pal and I hit up America's Taco Shop, the self-proclaimed "home of the greatest carne asada in the Valley!"

Its menu is small, but that doesn't mean it disappoints. Choose from items such as tortas, quesadilla and tacos, and be sure to pair it with the great chips and perfectly spicy salsa, at a cheap $1.50 a basket.

I ordered a vegetarian extra-large bean and cheese burrito, and I was really impressed with how ooey-gooey the bean/cheese mixture was and how flaky the flour tortilla was. It was the perfect lunch portion and filled me up without bogging me down.

My pal ordered the carne asada taco, which he said was excellent as always.

The spot's super-casual, really fast and has a patio to sit on, making it a great lunch spot full of tasty comfort food.
