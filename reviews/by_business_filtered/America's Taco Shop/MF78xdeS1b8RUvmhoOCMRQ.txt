America's is one of my favorite taco shops and I frequent this place for lunch and dinner. Their carne asada and al pastor tacos are a must. They season everything perfectly and cut their meat in very small pieces which I like. I also enjoy their carne asada quesadillas because the cheese they use is a really delicious white cheese. I always order the street corn and ask for it off the cob which is never a problem. So good! I take all my visitors here!!!
