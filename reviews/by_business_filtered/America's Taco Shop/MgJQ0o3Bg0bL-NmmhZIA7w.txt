Phoenix's airport is called Sky Harbor, which makes it sound like an outlet mall, but it's really an airport. And if you're on the way to Sky Harbor from Sedona, and you have time to stop for tacos, America's Taco Shop is a great choice. The guac is good, the salsa is fresh, the al pastor burrito is only a little fruity. The carne asada tacos are probably the best thing on the menu. The prices are very reasonable, and you'll be in and out very quickly unless there's a line out the door like in the picture on the wall from the regional magazine's "best of Phoenix" issue.
