I love America. I love tacos. Not always in that order, but let's continue. I've been a few times already. And have yet to order a taco. That's because America's Taco Shop could easily be named America's Quesadilla Shop. But, we know, that wouldn't stick. I've had the carne asada quesadilla with lettuce, guac and monterey jack. Definitely on the smaller side, but hey, it's $4.50. And then there's that Mexican Coke. Pricier than the U.S. Coke. Oh. Wait. We're talking beverages here folks. I left the 80s behind years ago! Yep. Mexican Coke has REAL sugar and not HFCS. I"m not a real anti HFCS kinda guy...but let's just say, this Mexican Coca Cola really rocks my meats and cheeses! But, it's $3. So you gotta feel in a fancy lunch mood. My last visit I added an order of chips and salsa. All said, with tip, was over $13. 

A little pricey. But I didn't mind. Kind of like buying Kiehl products at Neiman's. Or a brick of brie at AJs. Or the expensive toilet paper with chamomile and lotion. Worth it! Especially the latter. I"m just sayin'!

Great service. Friendly, if not a bit too aggressive. Last visit Miss America herself was there with her cute and chatty daughter. I loved it! Though my kids are limited to a Schnauzer, I like seeing family together in the biz. 

America. America. God bless your tacos. From sea to shining sea. From 7th St. to 7th Ave. God shed your guac on me....
