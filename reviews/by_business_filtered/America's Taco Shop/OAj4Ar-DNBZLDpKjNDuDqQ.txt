Does this place deserve all the hype?  Yes.  
Is the restaurant a great fit for the neighborhood?  Yes. 
Is this the place to enjoy the best tacos?  That is debatable like all things in life.

Located in the the historic Coronado neighborhood in an old renovated house like many other businesses in the area.  If you know the area you know what I am talking about.  It's not in a strip mall like most of metro Phoenix.

So why come here?  Here's a few reasons that I have come up with.  It's not to far from downtown so it's a convenient location for lunch.  It's hip, trendy and definitely not like anything you would experience in the rest of the valley.  It's very authenic. Prices are not very high.  Lastly the carne asada tacos are really really that good.

I think America and her husband made their dream come true with the creation of this restaurant.  A small taco shop that serves up some great food, decorated very uniquely, and definitely different than most things out there.
