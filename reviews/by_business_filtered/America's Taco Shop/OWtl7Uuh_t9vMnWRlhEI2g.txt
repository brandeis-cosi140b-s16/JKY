Scottsdale has so many fufu fancy fusion style twisty no look resaturants. It is a breath of fresh  air to get a NEW restaurant that stays true to its classical Mexican roots. 

ATS hit a homerun not only with the food and service but also the location. The Carne Asada burritos as well as the Pollo Asada are phenomal. I also go XL on the food trust me you won't regret it. The food leaves you full and not bloated like many other Mexican restaurants around Old Town. 

The back patio as a cool ambiance and is a great place to get out of the Old Town scence for a second. The chips and salsa are delicious and they also have a good quesadilla. I would recommend this place when your looking for a good go to Mexican meal.
