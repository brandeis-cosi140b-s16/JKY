I feel like I can live here. It's in an old house with a cool backyard "patio" setup for dining. I've never eaten my food there but I've taken it home many times and it's consistently delicious. Consistency is the key word there. My girlfriend and I tried a different America's location (off the 101 and Via de Ventura) and it didn't taste the same so we won't be going back there. The adoba pork is made just like gyro meat but with a pineapple that adds a fantastic sweetness you can't find anywhere else. My gf loves the carne asada and asks for it quite often while we're just sitting around the apartment. Our order always consists of one taco and one burrito each plus a side of beans. She goes for the carne asada burrito and adoba taco and I like to switch back and forth. We only recently discovered this location and have been there at least five times in the past month, highly recommended for somebody who wants to pass by the often rundown taqueria for a fantastic alternative.
