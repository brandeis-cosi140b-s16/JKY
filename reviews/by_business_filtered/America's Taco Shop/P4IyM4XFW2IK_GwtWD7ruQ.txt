I'll start by saying when it comes to Mexican food, I'm fairly particular since no one can cook like my Nana. The menu is simple with just a few basic selections. I have tried the carne asada tacos, the Vampiro Pastor and by far my flavor of choice here is the Torta-Pastor. I also sampled America's corn which I was somewhat disappointed in. For what it is, the prices are a little high. Seating is somewhat limited to mostly outdoor seating cooled by misters which tends to be too warm in the summer months here but they intice you by offering $2 Corona and Tecate. ATS on 7th Ave is great in a pinch.
