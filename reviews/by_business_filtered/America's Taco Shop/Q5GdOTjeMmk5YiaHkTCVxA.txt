this has been a pretty good lunch spot near my work. but after  the last few times, I probably won't be coming back. 

I always get an El pastor burrito, and every time (but once), and especially today, the burrito is half delicious El pastor, and half black crunchy prices of charcoal. I think those are actually burnt scraps of El poster scrapped off the floor or from behind the grill, but they still taste like crap.
