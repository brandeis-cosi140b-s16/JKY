Charity Towing and America's Taco Shop must take great pride in a wonderful scam.  A huge several acre dirt lot on the corner of Marshall and 1st Ave is at the bottom of this luscious, money maker for both of them.  At least 15 cars were towed from this lot in the 1-1/2 hr time it took us to eat.  At $75 per car, they split an awesome amount of money.  The tow trucks pulled in and cleaned the lot out in record time.  

The signage indicating the lot was for America's Taco Shop only are located on non-permanent pails that are moveable by any person.  Very small and limited to two signs spread out over several acres.  Entering by Marshall one sign was turned completely around.  The other sign was located next to a bar entrance.  Not visible unless you parked on top of the sign, that's how small it was.  

The city allows this to happen?  America's Taco's is supposedly alerting it's patrons that they will be towed?  Not so.  What an amazing scam that is allowed to continue.  Truly scandalous.
