I've heard so much about this place and finally went during lunch one day when a coworker suggested it. I asked her what she normally got and followed suit in ordering a cochata (horchata with coffee) and a chicken vampiro. A vampiro is kind of like an open faced taco. Super messy to eat but delicious. Don't let its size fool you. I was definitely full after one. I really wanted to like the cochata but the cinnamon in it gave it a really rough texture. It was kind of like drinking sand. We went back another time and my friend got the plain horchata and said that it had the same texture. I got a chicken taco the next time and wasn't really impressed. The America's corn on the other hand is awesome, highly recommended. There's really no graceful way to eat it without looking like a slob. I chose to cut the kernels off with a knife to avoid a huge mess. I could go back just for that. Apparently they're really well known for their carne asadas but I have yet to try it. Maybe I'll try a quesadilla next. The restaurant is super small. During lunch, our food came out before we even grabbed a table. Also, it's not really a good location for groups. All the tables in side are 2 seaters minus a booth set-up in the front. I wish they had a heater for the outside too since people are forced to sit outside when it's cold out.
