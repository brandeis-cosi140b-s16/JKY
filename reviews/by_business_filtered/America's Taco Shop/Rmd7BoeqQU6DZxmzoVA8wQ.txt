holy horchata.

i always say, there's no better way to try a beverage for the first time, than to drink an entire gallon of it. and trying the horchata at america's was no exception. 

i had no idea what to expect, but immediately fell in love with it. all gallon of it. second best thing to drink, next to beer, with mexican food. so, so good.

the carne asada burrito was one of the best i've ever had. ever. the beef was just so good, tasty, tender, and loads of it. the tortillas were incredible; just right so they didn't take over the burrito, but added to the flavor.

the ceviche was awesome; chopped up like salsa...whatever they do to it works. big time. it's 10:17am and i'd eat a bowl of it now...for breakfast...with milk and a spoon. 

i had two different types of salsa and i loved both equally. the only reason i'm giving it 4 starts is that the veggie quesadilla was pretty far below the rest of the food. basically, it was like they put quac, shredded lettuce, and a sliced up cucumber in a tortilla and threw it in the micro. you know how all of those vegetables are all kind of the same color; blah green? that's how i'd describe the taste: blah green. 

but everything else was incredible. you can eat like a king for around $20 and by like a king i mean, two burritos, chips and salsa, quesadilla, and a couple of horchatas. 

next time i'm sitting on the front porch. so all of 7th can watch me feed my face, cookie monster style.
