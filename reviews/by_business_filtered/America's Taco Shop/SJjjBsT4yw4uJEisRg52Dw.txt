LOVE LOVE THIS PLACE!!!! The beans. Peruvian magic! And my favorite is the COCHATA!!!! I'm addicted! I know it's a small menu, but that's what makes it easy to just order. I've been to a lot of mexican restaurants...and I like to think I am a good judge of good mexican food. Being mexican and all ;-) and the simplicity of this place is what makes it!
