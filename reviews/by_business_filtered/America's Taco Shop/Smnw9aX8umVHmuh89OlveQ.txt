Still a consistent place for a unique bean and cheese burrito, a crave-worthy breakfast burrito, and a fresh tomato-and-cilantro-heavy salsa.

Many of the 2-star ratings focus on portion size and price, but for a regular meal made from scratch (not a super-sized gorge fest that is drive-thru Mexican), America's is a strong value; plus, you can meet the owners, unlike the corporate -berto's model.

They still need a bike rack though. -1 star.
