Great food at a great price.  I love this place!  I don't even know where to start about America's.  You have to get the chips and salsa.  The chips are so light and crispy.  They go perfect with the spicy salsa.  I always get the Bean Burrito America's way.  Lard free beans with jalapenos and homemade tortilla.  This is the best kept secret in Phoenix.  I am so glad they have locations throughout the valley to meet the cravings of the masses.  I hear they have a mean breakfast burrito and I will have to try one of these out.
