My boyfriend insisted this place was great so I gave it a try last night. I felt bad at first walking in at 7:45 since they close at 8 but they were more than happy to take my last minute order. The torta is amazing. It was not too greasy, just perfect. My boyfriend had the carne asada burrito which was delicious. All the ingredients tasted very fresh. I had an Horchata which was excellent too. The salsa is definitely the best part. It very unique. I know that people keep saying blah blah renovated homes but I still think they are great. I will be back for sure.
