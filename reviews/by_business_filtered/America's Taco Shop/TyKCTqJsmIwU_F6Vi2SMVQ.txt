I went in here today hoping that I would be able to get a quick burrito on my way home. I ordered chips and salsa and a carne Assad burrito and a half hour later was served a bean and cheese burrito. Needless to say, it was well over an hour before my order was completed and all of the carne asada was burnt anyways! Avoid this place!
