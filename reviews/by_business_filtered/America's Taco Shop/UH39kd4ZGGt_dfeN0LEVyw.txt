I am very saddened by the fact that they have moved locations. This was a great and convenient location for my commute home from work. I'll be stopping in every now and then at the new location but I'll be missing my (almost) weekly stop. 



Very friendly and welcoming staff members coupled with a nice indoor and patio dining area make for a very enjoyable dining experience.

The food is very reasonably priced and delicious. The portion sizes are a little smaller than I am used to, but preferred to the unnecessarily huge portions found at other nearby Mexican restaurants.

I would highly recommend the carne asada torta sandwich. I tried it after reading another user's review and I was not disappointed. The horchata is also some of the best I've had in town.

I have never enjoyed their happy hour specials but it seems like great deal with Mexican beers available for just $2.
