Ate here for the first time Monday, and we're going back today!! I got a deal on Voice Deal of the Day, so I was hoping it would be good.

I tried the Al Pastor (kinda like BBQ Pork) Quesadilla. A-MAZING!! It was soft, juicy, crispy, and crunchy all at the same time!! Great flavor combinations with the pork, cilantro, pineapple and guacamole.

I also tried the chips/salsa/guacamole.
Loved the chips and guacamole made me yearn for more. BUT... the salsa was so flipping nasty!! Seriously tasted like they opened a can of tomato sauce and called it salsa. 

They don't have a huge menu selection (basically Al Pastor and Carne Asada) but it's still worth the visit.
