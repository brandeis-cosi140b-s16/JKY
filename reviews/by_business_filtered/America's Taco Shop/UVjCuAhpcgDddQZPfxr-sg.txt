At long last, America's Taco Shop is finally open. Unfortunately, they're not open very late just yet--they close at 8pm on the weekends. And they're still working on the liquor license thing. And a couple of other just-open restaurant quirks. Luckily, they are extremely excited and eager to please. 

Their Mexican waters were unbelievable (go with the Tamarindo), and big gulp sized. The corn was awesome as well. All grilled up and slathered with mayo, cotija cheese and hot sauce. I also ordered a quesadilla vegetariana, which could have stood a bit of flavor (the owner went to get salsa, but never came back...seriously), but was not at all bad. Next time I'll try their bean burrito, which is made without any lard in the mix.

The price is right, and they're right around the corner, so I'll definitely be back.
