I eat at Americas Taco shop at least one a week and always get breakfast burritos on the weekends.

My favorite things to get from here are the chorizo burrito as well as the carne asada. 

The only thing I have to say bad about this place is the service, it honestly just depends on what day you go and who is working. Sometimes they will be nice and sometimes they wont even speak to you. I really enjoy this place and am a loyal customer, I just which that they would provide better customer service. It seems like everytime I go in there they look miserable.
