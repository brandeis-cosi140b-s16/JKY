Thank goodness this place has occupied the unfortunate corner of short-lived restaurants. There is nothing worse than giving a place a chance, getting attached to it and then it shutting down shortly thereafter. Luckily, America's Taco Shop has a loyal following and I sincerely hope it stays put in the 7th Ave location. Last night was my 4th time here and it grows on me more and more. Had I wrote this review the first time I went (7th St location), I think I would have given it 3 stars. I mean, to state that it has the best carne asada? I still wouldn't go that far but I always enjoy my food. Last night, I had a carne asada taco, pastor taco, and chips/salsa/guacamole. I love pastor tacos but am not a fan of theirs. They add pineapple to theirs which is my thing. I love pineapple alone, not warm with food. Again, not my thing. I have had their carne asada tostada in the past. I was a little turned by the warm, wilted lettuce on top but I guess that is what happens when it is wrapped with foil. But the tostada was okay. Their bean and cheese burritos are awesome. It is so simple but the flavor is really good...love it. I haven't eaten there in person (we always get take-out) but from the outside, the restaurant is adorable and oh-so inviting. My daughter's day care is right across the street and this place is always busy. Good sign....
