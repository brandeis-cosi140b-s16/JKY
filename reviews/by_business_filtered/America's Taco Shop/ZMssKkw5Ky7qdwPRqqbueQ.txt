After reading everyone's reviews I went in with high expectations - perhaps too high. We ordered two carne asada burritos, chips and salsa, the corn everyone raved about on Yelp along with two carne asada tacos. The burritos were a decent size. I was disappointed that there wasn't more than a small dollop of guacamole at one of the burrito. The meat was lean and flavorful however tasted very charred. Some of the inner pieces tasted good though the meat was seasoned with too much salt. The meat was lean and tender. 

Chips and salsa were okay. I love it when a restaurant heats up the chips - this place does not. The salsa was fresh tasting and not overly spicy. Neither my husband nor I liked the corn. It is corn on the cob dipped in a mayonnaise sauce with Mexican cheese sprinkled on top. It is garnished with a hot sauce and limes. 

Whoever mentioned the small side portions of the lime, radish and cucumber were dead on. The lime was so tiny I didn't get more than a drop of juice from it. 

The servers were friendly and it is an easy place to take your children as long as your total party does not exceed four. The place is tiny but decorated nicely.
