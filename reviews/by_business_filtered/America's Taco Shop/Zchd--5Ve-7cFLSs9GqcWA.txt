I come here often with a particular group of friends. I always liked their food but once I went paleo I ran out of things to eat here...until recently, when they introduced their amazing chicken. 

Now I order chicken tacos without the taco shell. So it's like chicken in a bowl, with all the sides. And it's delicious!!! 

Their margs are okay but nothing to write home about. Service is always friendly and it's very clean. I go here often and will keep coming. 

Definitely check out happy hour, the prices are better. Although if you get the happy hour tacos they will be smaller, which is kind of dumb and defeats the purpose BUT still. Enjoy.
