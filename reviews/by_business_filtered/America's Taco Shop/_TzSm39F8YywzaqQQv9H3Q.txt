After hearing nothing but rave reviews of America's Taco Shop, it was time to give it a try.
I ordered their "best Carne Asada in town" tacos. And I beg to differ. There are plenty of places I have had better Carne Asada. I'm going to blaspheme according to some, but I've had better Carne Asada at Chipotle, for meat's sake. I thought the meat was overcooked. I have yet to find somewhere that comes close to Comedor Guadalajara for Carne Asada. The side of beans was ok. 
The staff was courteous and friendly, the service was great.
But, I really don't see what the big deal is about America's Taco Shop. After all the hype, I expected it to be great. But it was good, at best.
With a menu as limited as America's Taco Shop has, they should excel at what little they do offer and that's just not the case.
