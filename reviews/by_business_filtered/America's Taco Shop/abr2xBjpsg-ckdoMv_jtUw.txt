I heard they had the best Carne Asada in town so I thought I would stop by and give it a try since I was in the area. The service was great, the staff was extra friendly and helpful. Onto the food; So of course I got the Carne Asada Burrito. With a drink it was around $8, so not expensive. I'm very picky when it comes to Carne Asada, and I found this to be one of the better one's I've had, but it wasn't the best. The tortilla was great, excellent consistency and flavor. The steak was flavorful and had a nice char to it. The guac was smooth and rich, and the pico was zesty. All very good. The size of the burrito was pretty small, but then again I go to Chipotle often and they pack those things. For what I spent, I would rather go to Chipotle just because I can get lunch and dinner out of one of their burrito's or bowls. I know, Chipotle vs. authentic mexican food, it's apple's to orange's; but that's just how I feel. I wouldn't call it the best Carne Asada in town, but I would consider it a close second. Personally I find Filiberto's/Aliberto's/Whoever-berto's to be the best; although I find they aren't the most consistent.
