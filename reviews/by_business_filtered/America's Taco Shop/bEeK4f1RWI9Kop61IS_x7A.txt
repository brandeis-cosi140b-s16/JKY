This place is OKAY. Based on all the hype and the price, I guess I expected more. A lot more? The food was decent and far from memorable. Their pomegranate margarita is good, but it came in the world's tiniest cup...it may have even been a thimble, I'm not sure. America's Taco Shop is still a cool spot in the valley and I appreciate that it's there, but in Phoenix where Mexican food places are everywhere you look, this will never be a priority stop for me. I'd rather eat the tacos from the Cocina at the 16th Street and Roosevelt Ranch Market. Really.
