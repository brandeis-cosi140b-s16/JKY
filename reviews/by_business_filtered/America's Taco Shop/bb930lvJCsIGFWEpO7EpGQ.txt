The carne asada is indeed the best I've had in town. No gristle or fatty bits to pick out, no salt overload to beat my tongue into submission. Pure, lovingly marinated, perfectly browned steak chopped into the ideal sized pieces for a clean bite without trailing bits falling onto the table. The accompanying salsa is a wonderfully mild, smoky addition to the flavor which doesn't overpower the beefy goodness.

The al pastor pork is unbelievable as well. Lean, marinated pork roasted on a vertical spit, topped with a hunk of pineapple, is shaved off to order. Whatever is in America's marinade is outstanding, and the pineapple adds a little bit of heavenly sweetness and tang which pairs perfectly with the meat. As with the carne asada, the accompanying salsa (a lighter tomatillo concoction) adds flavor without smothering the pork flavor.

If you're looking for cheap, greasy Mexican food regardless of quality, go find a 'bertos. Americas is all about the quality. Their horchata is the genuine article, not a sickly-sweet bastardized rendition from a food-service tub. The Chorizo in the breakfast burritos is locally sourced. The tortillas are fresh and delicious. Even the iced tea is great.

The service is enthusiastic and friendly, and it's easy to tell the staff take pride in their work. Do yourself a favor, and ask for recommendations. I did, and now I'm hopelessly hooked on the al pastor.
