Great atmosphere for such a tiny tiny place and the staff is always pleasant , even when theyre slammed.

And the food: SO GOOD.

My personal faves include the carne asada quesadilla, chips and salsa, carne asada tacos, an orange soda in a bottle, and the holy grail: their guacamole. Now, youll have to try theirs to truely understand, but their guacamole is like crack. Seriously. Its SO good. To the point that youll start eating it and will not be able to stop. And they put it (and caramelized onions) on practically everything.

 Crackamole. Go.
