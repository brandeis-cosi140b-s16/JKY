This was literally the worst Mexican food I've ever had in Arizona. We walked in and ordered two burritos to go, one of them was just a simple bean and cheese. It took 45 minutes to get our food and the staff didn't seem apologetic at all. To make matters worse once we got home and took our first bite I was not impressed. Overall it was edible, but not good at all. Just to go filibertos...
