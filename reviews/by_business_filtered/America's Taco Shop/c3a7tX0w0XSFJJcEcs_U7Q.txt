This place is AWSOME!! The carne asade tacos are the best I have had in long time. Everything was perfect from guacamole to chips and salsa (salsa I have to say is better then my sis) oh and the carne asada quesadilla is home run!!! The atmosphere is ok inside is limited seating but you can also sit outside where there is plenty of shade. Also the parking lot is also limited so if you are there when it is rush hour be prepared to find parking spot.
