The only saving grace for this taco joint is the al pastor tacos and only because it wasn't smothered in their awful tasting pico de gallo. The horchata was old tasting and room temperature-ish... How do you manage that? Its supposed to be an iced beverage, The carne asada taco I tried was barely edible. The meat was over cooked and way too carb√µn "charred". Let me say this... Guacamole is supposed to have avocados in it and chunks!!!!!! WTF? They have the exact same "guac" as Filigatos and every other "Fili or Roli" taco shop out there ..looks like green ranch....creamy and gross!

Isn't this supposed to a cool, eclectic spot to get Americas B*st Tacos? Well, why dont you stop selling the same crappy tacos as the crappy mexican food joints. Make your own guacamole you cheap bums! Americas "commercialized, mediocre" not best tacos... 2 stars because of the Al Pastor taco instead of 1 for false advertising in the business name.. BOO! thumbs down
