I saw the reviews on Yelp and thought "man, I have to try this place, sounds great" I was sourly disappointed with my burrito. OK, the girl asks me if I want regular or XL for my carne asade burrito (which they claim to be the best carne asada in town) I of course say XL because i like food and want a lot of it. The burrito was 8 bucks and they only have cans for soda. so my meal was about 10 bucks. the girl brings out my burrito to me on the patio and i look down and I think "is that all"  For 8 bucks i would of thought the thing to be huge! It was about half the size of a Filibertos burrito. And double the cost. 

The location was cool, had a nice little outdoor patio with misters, the girls were nice at the front, and it was a clean place. The food was a  good quality and tasted pretty good. But a little expensive and very small portion for calling a XL burrito for 8 bucks. 

I am afraid I will not be back.
