We finally tried this place because my brother in law and sister in law kept telling us how much they love it.  It is a small little house with a patio out front, which was perfect for the great weather the other day.  I ordered a bean and cheese burrito and a carne asada taco.  I am a self described burrito expert, and this burrito was a winner.  The tortilla was soft and flavorful, and the beans, which are not made with lard, were nicely mixed with cheese.  The taco was very good as well.
  Like a good yelper, I checked in to this place when I got there.  There is a check-in offer for free chips and salsa.  When I showed it to the employee, she said I had to print it out in order to get the deal.  I told her that you can't print check-in offers; that they are meant to be used on your mobile device.  She pretty much told me that she wouldn't honor it.  Apparently the manager has not told anyone who works there about the check-in offer and how to use it, because she acted like I was a jerk for even asking about it.  She ended up giving us the free chips and salsa, but I could tell she thought she may get in trouble for giving it to me.  That manager should probably explain the check in offer so this doesn't keep happening.  Aside from that situation, the food was great, and I would definitely go back for more of those yummy beans!
