Love the quesadillas, they aren't too cheesy and I like the proportion of meat/cheese/tortilla best. The extra cost to get extra large portions doesn't seem worth it, I always get two things and take some home. The cochata (coffee+horchata) is delicious!  America's corn is messy but tasty.  The beans are lard free (and delicious!) for all those vegetarians out there!  Love this place!!
