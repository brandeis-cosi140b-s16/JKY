Yum yum yum! I love this place's breakfast burrito and their carne asada. For some reason, the first time I went to the 7th ST location, i didn't like it. However, I came back after about 6 months and now I am addicted!

I do prefer this location over the 7th street for some reason. This location seems to have a nicer staff. Plus it's close to some really awesome antique shops! Makes for a great pre-antiquing breakfast!
