The third location by Terry and America and IT'S IN TEMPE!  I am so excited to have this place so close and having been waiting for weeks for the newest location to open.  The interior is a bit smaller than the Coronado location, but not by much and the patio more than compensates.  Same great food (mmm, carne asada...) and happy hour, so you know what to expect if you've been to the other sites.  If you live in near Tempe and wanted to try this place, but didn't want to drive downtown, you are in luck.
