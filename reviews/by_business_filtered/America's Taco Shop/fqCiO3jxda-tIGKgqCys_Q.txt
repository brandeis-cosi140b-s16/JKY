I was really, really excited to try America's Taco Shop but I'm sad to say I was disappointed to say the least. The portions were very small and extremely overpriced. Even with that factor disregarded, the meat was not mind blowing either. I tried the XL carne asada burrito and an Al Pastor taco and both were unimpressive. The pork in the Al Pastor was a little dry and very small. The burrito was okay but it was far from extra large. I was surprised that this was an XL and that I paid almost $10 for it. The tacos were probably 4 inches in diameter and the burrito left me feeling like it was more tortilla than meat and etc (I hate when places are stingy with the meat!). It was not a surprise, however, that the place was completely empty. The service was okay, the woman at the register kept on starting to take our order then walking away to answer the phone. She told us the happy hour specials which were beer and margarita prices that were Very close to the original price. She also said happy hour food was chips and salsa for $1 or a "small" taco for $1. After seeing the size of the regular taco, I can't imagine how tiny the "small" could be.  I was really hoping this was going to be a great restaurant, but I was pretty embarrassed taking my friend from Colorado here when she was visiting because it probably hurt her impressions of Yelp (since I told her that it was rated high on Yelp). The worst part was that all of us in our party left the restaurant still hungry and opted to go on and eat elsewhere because of the unreasonable prices here. Yelp let me down on this one... Overall, I can confidently say that this place was overrated and I probably will not come back by choice.
