I really like this place and try to eat there when I can.  It's Mexican food that is not drenched in cheese.  They also have Mexican Coke, which is the perfect drink with the tacos or the Al Pastor.  The flavors are delicious.

I recommend it to you.  Have also eaten the one on 7th Street and it's good.
