First off I am a huge fan of refried beans, this place has some of the most velvety, delicious refried beans I've ever had anywhere. Not too salty, homemade, creamy, just perfect. I am a fan of their pastor. Before eating here I did not know what that was, it's a marinated pork in a sweet robust red sauce that is served with grilled pineapple. It's island-y tasting. Portions here are on the smaller side, however the food is so tasty, I'm not complaining.
