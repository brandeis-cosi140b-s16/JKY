I usually only give 1 star to places so I guess that means I'd go back right? yea- I'd go back I guess. "BEST" carne asada burrito???? I dunno???....... we thought about it and the meat WAS good. BUT its too pricey. we bought 2 carne asada burritos (not very big BTW), ceviche, 2 beers and it was $28 bux. dude- that is too expensive for a taco shop. the ceviche was NO good. like- at all. don't order it. Next time, yes- Next time, I'm gonna order just carne asada TACOS and see if I like it better.
