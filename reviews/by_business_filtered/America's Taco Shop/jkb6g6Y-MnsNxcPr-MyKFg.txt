I use to love this place...cool vibe...Awesome food and awesome Margaritas.  A while back they no longer were open on Sunday's....sad day, but I moved on.  Went tonight and ordered we were the only customers.  Then 5 groups came in after us leaving our food in the window because there were only 2 employees and very busy making our food cold.  I will give it another shot but it's also sad they no longer carry a liquor License so no more delicious margaritas.
