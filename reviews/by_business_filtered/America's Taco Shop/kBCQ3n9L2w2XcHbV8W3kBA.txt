I'd heard a lot about ATS, so I had to try it out. I love me some tacos, tortas, tostadas...pretty much all Mexican food. ATS does not disappoint, but it doesn't top the charts. 

First, the service at the Via de Ventura location is awesome. Friendly, helpful, just plane nice. 

The atmosphere is fine, not great. It's conducive to hanging with a larger group, moving tables and being silly. 

The food is good, but it lacks some flavor. However, the portions are generous and the cost is low. You can get a lot of chips, salsa and guac without breaking the bank. I was hoping the tacos would rock my world, but they didn't pack the punch o was hoping for. 

Finally, the margs were okay. Not like the cheap sugary drinks at some places, but not he best.
