One of the most important things in life is to live no more than a minute away from great Mexican fast food. I'm blessed to have America's Taco Shop fulfill that need. 

'Berto's beware, I'll never frequent you again thanks to the amazing Carne Asada at America's. The meat is freakishly tender and cooked to perfection. The grilled onions are the Cher to the meats' Sunny. Simply put, the Carne Asada burrito is damn good! 

The corn is a delight as well. I despise mayo and yet I still can't get past ordering the corn. Lightly coated in mayo then shellacked in cheese, with a spritz of lime and Cholula, the corn is to die (or kill) for. 

You'd think that two noteworthy items like these would be enough but NO! The true star of the shop is the beans. Light and flavorful they set the standard for beans everywhere. 

My sister is a little bit of a dirty redneck. When I mentioned that the beans were lard free she scoffed. I hate scoffing so I demanded that she try them. An hour later she was convinced, and properly apologetic. Thank you America's for giving me the rare win over a dirty redneck. 

America's is a great little shop in central Phoenix, and one that I will continue to frequent. Thanks for existing! 

NOTE: During peak hours the parking lot can be a little scary. You've been warned.
