Not impressed at all.  From what I hear is that each America's Taco Shop is individually owned and each one is a new experienced.  My girlfriend told me about the one they go to in Tempe and had raved how great it was.  Today we went to this location.

We walk in and scan the menu and notice... no tacos... Their digital menu wasnt working right and was still showing the breakfast menu.  The girl didnt offer any paper menus, because they didnt have any.  What eatery (besides fastfood) doesn't have a menu??)

We ordered the guacamole trio with chips and a few tacos.  The meat was pretty dry on the tacos and if it wasn't for the ton of salsa and guac, they would have been pretty bland.  

Spending $30 for lunch, I was not happy.  The only thing that made it two stars was that they had happy hour and we got a few tiny $1 burros.. they were hot with cheese and were ok.  

Won't be coming back here.
