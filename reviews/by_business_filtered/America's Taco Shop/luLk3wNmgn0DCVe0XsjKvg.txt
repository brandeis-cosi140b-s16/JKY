Word on the street is that Americas Taco Shop has THE BEST tacos. I can't say I agree but I don't whole heatedly disagree either. I went with my husband and my carne asada burrito was good, as was the corn. I saw their happy hour menu all too late but it had some decent options on it. I'll go back, I'll try something new. Maybe not the best tacos but they certainly aren't bad tacos.
