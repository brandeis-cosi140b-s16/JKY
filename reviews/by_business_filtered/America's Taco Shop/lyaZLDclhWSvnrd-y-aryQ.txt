Stopped in for a quick lunch with my Mom and found the place to be quite remarkable. We were greeted warmly and told to sit anywhere. Ordered up tacos, two each, chicken, pork and carne asada.  Street taco size and very tasty. Mom had tacos as well and as this was just a way of killing some time we did not sit for a full meal. I will be coming back, soon as time allows to experience more of this wonderful little shop. Had no trouble parking right in the driveway. I asked inside and was told it would be alright.
