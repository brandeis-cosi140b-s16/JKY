Worst Mexican food in Scottsdale. Went to try this place with a friend and saw great reviews. Walked in and was pleasantly surprised that the shop was clean and trendy. Ordered a carne asada burrito and a quesadilla and my friend did the same. 

After modifying my burrito order the manager mocked me by stating that I had taken all the flavor out of my food. As a native Arizonan I know what good Mexican food is and what flavors I want. Immediately dropped this place a star for bad customer service.

Next after a 20 minute wait we got our order and asked for salsa. They were reluctant to give more than 1 sauce without more pushing from me for more sauce.

Drive home to find they left half our order out. Had to drive back to get my order in full that they charged me for. They did NOTHING to compensate me for my time and their error. 

In a competitive market for Mexican food attention to detail counts and they FAIL! Never going back, save your money the food was average!
