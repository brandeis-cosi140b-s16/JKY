I grew up in Arizona and lived in San Diego for about 5 years so its fair to say that I've eaten at a lot of Mexican food restaurants and taco shops. This place has one of the best carne asad burritos I've ever had. Everything is fresh and the tortillas are always soft and never stale or hard. The quesadillas a little bland though. Some pico de gayo would add some flavor or maybe cilantro tossed in.
