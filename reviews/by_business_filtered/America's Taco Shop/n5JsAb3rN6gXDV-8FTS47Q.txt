So, if you are the kind of person that likes suggestions, I will tell you what to order to save you the trouble of guessing... 
An extra large Carne Asada Burrito Add Cilantro. It truly is the best Carne Asada in town... it is lean, non greasy and tasty as can be! There Carne Asada tacos and bean burrito are really good too! As a pointer, the breakfast burrito was no as good, too much eggs and not enough of the good stuff and a little greasy.
A great little cozy whole in the wall that makes delicious food! 
Everyone I have suggested this to loved it!
