Authentic asada in a great setting.  This is a great place to grab a great carne asada.  We went in the evening around 8 and had a burrito, tostada and bean burrito between us.  Everything was good and fresh.  

The ambience is nice with lots of outside seating.  

I understand this place gets busy at lunch and even at 8pm there was a short queue!
