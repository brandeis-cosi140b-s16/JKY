Everything was just bland.  Maybe we are taco snobs but this place made Rubios look like amazing fancy tacos and everyone knows Rubios is decent but not amazing.

We tried all three tacos types.  The pastor was overcooked/dry but did have good flavor.  The carne was juicy but lacked any flavor.  The chicken was just bland.  

We also tried all three burrito types and found the same in them.  The bean and cheese burrito was alright but still nothing special. 

The al pastor salad was better but the meat was cold and still dry.  The dressing was decent and the lettuce crisp.

One last thing, the salsa for the chips was like that pureed tomato salsa that is watery.  It did have some barely there jalapeno flavor.  We tried the hot and the mild but both tasted the same.  Maybe they gave us two milds. 

The service was very good though.  Everyone was friendly and the place was clean.  We just didn't enjoy the food.
