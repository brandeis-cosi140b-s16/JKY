The food is as good as the Coronado location but the ambiance is seriously lacking. The inside had a funky smell so we opted for 100 degree heat and ate outside instead.
The main reason for three instead of four stars is that they screwed up our order. Not a huge offense, you say? Well they put their uber spicy jalepenos on my toddler's quesadilla instead of on my burrito. They replaced it but still... 
Bottom line: their food is good- love the carne and pork. We'll eat here again but I'll be double checking to make sure the order is right.
