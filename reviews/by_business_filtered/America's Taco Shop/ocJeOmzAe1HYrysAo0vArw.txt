I have no complaints about ATS, other than the high price to quantity ratio. It sits in a cute central phoenix location with a nice ambiance and a great patio. The food is fresh and tasty, however, portion size is rather small.

Normally I would not portion size influence my rating, but when Phoenix has an abundance of inexpensive and amazingly delicious Mexican eats around, points will have to be deducted.
