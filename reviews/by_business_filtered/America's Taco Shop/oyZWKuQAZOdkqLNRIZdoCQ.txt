some of the best taco's you can find in phoenix.the meat was cooked to perfection & spot on for taste. i also tried the vampiro,somewhat like a carne asada tostada.the place is clean and has a nice atmosphere.try to avoid the lunch rush to enjoy your meal.although i wish the salsa was a bit spicier.
