This is a little gem.  Sometimes it's best to do one thing and do it really well.  America's does carne asada REALLY well!!  The meat is tender and flavorful and delicious!!  I had a carne asada burrito and it was probably the best I've ever had. But let me speak of the guacamole.....mmmmmm!!  If you like guac, this is awesome guac!!  It's got just enough kick in it and it is very tasty.  Their chips are fresh and crispy and a nice compliment to the guac.  My daughter loved the cheese quesedilla and ate the whole thing.  When we got in the car to leave she said she wanted to come back the next day!  That's high praise from a six year old!

The shop is a cute little house with several tables inside and a nice seating area outside.  Parking can be a little of a challenge.  There is only one way in and it's the same way out.  So if you're leaving and someone is coming in, well....you get the picture.  

The staff is always friendly and accomodating.  They make you feel at home.  The prices are reasonable so you don't break the bank either.  
Thank you America!!
