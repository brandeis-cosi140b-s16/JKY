Addiction: America's Taco Shop pork, aka, pastor. 

My husband loves the carne asada (I'm not a fan of carne asada, but this is pretty good nonetheless), but let me tell you, the pork is fantastic! I get the pork taco's, burrito, whatever form I can get! 

It's very casual, inexpensive, and the staff is great! 

Parking is a wee bit of a pain, because Arcadia Farms is in the hood and they hog the street parking, but it's worth a short walk to eat here...
