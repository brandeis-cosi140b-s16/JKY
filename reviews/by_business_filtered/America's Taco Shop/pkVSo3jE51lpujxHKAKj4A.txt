I finally got a chance to taste what everyone has been talking about! Really fresh food, really good food and lots of it. 

I had the veggie quesadilla, a side of beans and a roasted jalapeno. The veggie quesadilla was simple - cheese, avocado, lettuce and peppers - but it was still tasty. I'm a sucker for beans, and although these weren't the best I'd ever had, they were still really good. I chopped up the jalapeno and added it to the beans. 

The 3.5 star rating that America's Taco Shop currently has (as of the beginning of January 2011) is not at all representative of the food and service that you'll get at the Shop. Go anyway, eat and be happy!
