I was anti-America's for a while there. I had one bean burrito that just wasn't made quite right when they first opened in the Coronado neighborhood, and quite frankly slapped a "Not worth it" stamp on them and ignored the buzz.  I thought that their menu was too expensive for "street food" and ignored others when they raved! I also discovered La Condesa and was on that train full force forging ahead to salsa town. 

How was I to know that one day, mine and America's fates would change and we would be inextricably connected... When I started working at ASU, my coworkers recommended a trip to America's on University. Since I was new, I kept my bean burrito experience to myself and decided to give it another go. I got the carne asada tacos. I thought they were tender, spiced well, and delicious. I went again within a couple of weeks and tried the carne asada burrito (and even ordered a side of beans for chip dipping)... I was delighted. The burrito is so jam-packed with those complimenting flavors that I dream about it. I love their beans now too... Go figure. 

Oh America's... You changed my mind! Like a love I nearly lost, we learned from our humble beginnings and are happy together!

However, I miss your coupons that you offered for ASU-- and the green salsa is too sweet. Those are my only complaints. :) Hooray!
