New owners. Service is SLOW. We ordered a chicken quesadilla and carne asada torta. The quesadilla came out eventually, and was cold. The torta followed a few minutes later, and was fresh and good but lacking the "Americas style" addition of jalape√±os that we paid for. They no longer serve margaritas (server said they're working on it). This America's location is nothing like it was a year or so ago. I won't return. Too many better options out there.
