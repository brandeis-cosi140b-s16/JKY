Caveat to my review: I have always been a burrito eater and only recently decided to start trying tacos. I had a carne asada taco and a pastor taco. The pastor was kind of barbecue-y and they also put some nice guac on the taco. They serve it with a side of light-colored salsa-- is it tomatillo? The entire thing was a multi-layered flavor treat. 

The carne asada taco was also pretty good, but maybe I'm just not a carne asada fan. I've tried a few of these tacos at different places and found the meat lacking distinctive flavor. I guess I'm wanting either smokiness, chile heat or some other spice to jazz up the steak meat. However, the steak was very tender and the tortillas are moist and have a nice, mild masa flavor. The salsa that comes alongside the tacos definitely helps bump them up a rung on the ratings scale. 

We had a side of chips and guac. which was very creamy and mild. Bean and cheese burrito my husband ordered was very, very creamy and had a wonderful pinto bean flavor. Beer was only $2.75 each for the imported bottles we got. The total bill was around $25. I consider that pretty standard for Scottsdale and Phoenix for casual lunch for two people. 

If you want super cheap, homogenized food, you should stick to Taco Bell. If you want GOOD, local restaurant food, go to America's Taco Shop. I will definitely be returning. I hope to try a burrito next time!
