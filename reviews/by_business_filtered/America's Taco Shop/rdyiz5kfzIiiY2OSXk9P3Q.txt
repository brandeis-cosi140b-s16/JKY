I'm confused as to why these are considered "the best" carne asada in the valley? I've had some pretty amazing carne asada and this is just "good". No complaints on the meat flavour or texture, but the size of the burrito was a bit disappointing. The flavour was mostly the pico de gallo (which I specifically asked they not put in it). The guacamole was thin but had an ok flavour. It could have used cheese or sour creme to balance the onions and salsa better. I would have been less miffed about the pico being in there anyway if the place were busy but we were literally the only customers. 
Mother got the carne asada taco and a "vampiro" - something I'd never heard of before but seemed very Baja in nature with more sweet ingredients like pineapple. She liked them though commented the taste of the vampiro was odd (but not in a bad way - just a new kind of food).

Regular carne burrito, taco, vampiro, large lemonade, a can of Coke, and a side of chips with two salsas was just under $20. Didn't seem bad for all that but the portions are a bit smaller than I'm used to for a "hole in the wall" type Mexican food place - for that price at a place like Filiberto's, you'd get more food. I'm all for supporting local businesses though so I won't focus on the price.

Very nice outdoor patio area was perfect for a day like today.

Bottom line, it would have been 4 stars, perhaps, if my order was correct and the portions were just a bit larger. I'd still come back to try other menu items, especially during Happy Hour.
