I don't claim to be a mexican food authentication expert, being from here and raised on chimichangas smothered in sauce and cheese.  I do know good, though, and this stuff is way beyond good.  Costs more than other order at the counter mexican places, but the quality of the food is worth it.  Really good margaritas was a nice surprise in a plastic cup.  Carne asada to die for - I had to order a second burrito.  Their refried beans are the best anywhere.  Staff have always been very nice, patiently waiting as I try to decide what to order, and not acting at all put out when I'm finally ready.
