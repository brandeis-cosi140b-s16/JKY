This place does it right with great ingredients that result in a really good taco.  I had the taco al pastor and it was very good.  Their chips and salsa are excellent and this is coming from a Texas guy who knows good salsa.

Now on to the most interesting part, the corn...I can almost guarantee that you've never had corn on the cob like this!  I'm not even sure it's fair to label it corn on the cob out of fairness to what you're used to.  This sweet corn on the cob is coated with a light smear of mayo (don't judge it till you try it!) and then generously sprinkled with fine ground Mexican cheese.  The result is amazing!  As if that's not enough, they serve it with a little container of sauce that is quite hot and complements the sweetness of the corn.  This is a must try if you're a corn lover!
