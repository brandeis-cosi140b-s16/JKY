We wanted to see what the hype was about this place, so my lady and I crawled out of bed at noon and came here for lunch. 
We came on a Saturday afternoon, there were a few people dining in. I had the carne asada burrito and my girl had the carne asada tacos. The food was tasty, and hot. I'm sure about how I feel about all they hoopla over this place. It was a decent place to grab a bite to eat. The Horchata was good, and they sell Mexican Coca-Cola. The price was all right, but you could definitely get carne asada at a Filibertos or any of the other 'Bertos for that matter that was just as tasty and for a few less dollars.

*Update* I received an email from the proprietor of this Taco shop, he stated to me that "if you can not see the difference in quality from us and the other "Bertos", maybe this isn't the place for you"...

I'm not sure why a restaurant owner would shoo away a guest, especially a guest who said the food was good, he was just not understanding of the hype. 
So if you're like me, and think Filibertos is good, keep going there, because obviously, the owner of this establishment doesn't need our business
