very cute shop inside an old house in oldtown.  clean comfy atmosphere, beautiful patio.  service was friendly and efficient.  Drawback: no fountain sodas or fresh brewed iced tea...all cans.  expensive cans. $1.50 for can of diet coke

.  however, they do serve beer and tquila.  The best chips and salsa i have ever had.  i could eat the salsa with a spoon as a meal.  it was so flavorfil, with just the right kick of heat.  great lunch spot...my coworkers are addicted...
