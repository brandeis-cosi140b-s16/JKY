So far, best carne asade in Phoenix, although I am still on the hunt (Nothing yet like Tucson's BK's).  Small menu leaves a little to be desired and their burritos have just the right amount of carne, but not much else, something feels like its missing.  Good food, great place to try couple things.  Will definitely be back many times.
