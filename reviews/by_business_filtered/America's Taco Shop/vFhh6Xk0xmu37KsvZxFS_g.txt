Okay I am ashamed to admit I eat here at least twice a week, but it's almost justifiable with the lard free beans and fresh ingredients!!!  Though I must say the service can sometimes be questionable, it's WORTH it (and Im a HUGE stickler about service so...)!!  My must have, bean and cheese burrito ADD their famous carne asada with guacamole! And warning: the chips and salsa may be habit forming :)
