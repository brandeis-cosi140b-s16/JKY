Great Mexican food. Don't get thrown off by the name- this isn't Americanized gorditos and chalupas. Tasty, flavorful Al Pastor and Carne Asada burritos. Try the corn! It's unique and delicious. On the weekends they have happy hour deals all day, which are a bargain ($1: 7oz beer? $2: 12 oz beer? $3 margarita? YES!) They forgot a few things from our order and we had to remind them to bring them, but other than that overall very pleased with America's. Plus, we paid way less for a full meal than if we had gotten baseball park food.
