I'm late to the game and can't really add anything that hasn't already been said, so I'll keep this short.

Best carne asada burrito I've ever had. Best pastor I've ever had in my life, and that corn on the cob rolled in cotija should just be called an orgasm on a stick. 

A million stars to America!
