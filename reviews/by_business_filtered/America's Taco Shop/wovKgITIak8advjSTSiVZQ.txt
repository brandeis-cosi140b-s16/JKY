Ok this is the BEST Carne Asada I have ever eaten! Granted I am from the midwest so I thought Taco Bell was good Mexican before I moved to AZ but DAMN!
The recipe (an old family one of the owner's) is amazing and very flavorfull.

Try the burrito, but get something on the side as it needs an extra bit to fill you up. Don't get me wrong this is not the Overstuffed Burrito that you find at Chipotle that gets super messy and in my opinion is not very good. No this burrito is well propotioned as a meal and easy to eat. Not too messy or anything.

Also the Civeche is really great too, very fresh and crisp.
The only reason it gets 4 instead of 5 stars is that it is kinda small. That's all. 

Hell I give them 5 in my heart!
