I've been going to their first location in phoenix for years and it was always amazing. Tempe location is like the evil step sister. Ive been to this location dozens of times and everytime was bad customer service. Everything from messing up orders (and not claiming fault!), burning food, and NO SMILES! They act like I'm an inconvenience every time. They never show appreciation to their customers. NO welcomes! NO thank yous! I wonder if anyone there has ever smiled. Today was the final straw. Breakfast burrito over cooked and they forget my salsa. The real ticker though was when she gave me my total, I passed her my money and she received a text....started to text back while I had my hand held out with the money. RUDE! Dlish is 1 mile away and waaaaaay better breakfast burrito plus they love their customers!!
