Where there's smoke there's fire.  The smoke in this case is the all-to-common reviews of ATS.  This place is constantly mentioned in Phoenix magazine as the best carna asada in Phoenix.  It's not.  Not even close.  As nearly every other reviewer mentioned, the portion-to-cost size (i.e. value) is very disheartening.  Even my waifish (110 lb) wife had to go back for two more tacos.  The tacos are good, not great.  They're not double tortilla wrapped like most taco shops.  The salsa is ok.  I had the burrito al pastor, regular size but it was pretty tiny for $5.95.  Didn't come with any chips or salsa.  The flavor was ok but if you're really looking for great tacos in Phoenix, go to Tacos Atyoac.  Carambas has nearly identical carna asada.  I had the mexican corn but they were out of cojita cheese (?) so it wasn't the same.  It was my choice to still get it but I shouldn't have.  How can you be out of cojita cheese if you're a mexican restaurant?  Grab a $20 from the till and go south to Food City-you'll be back in less than 15 minutes.

This used to be a pretty cool Phoenix sucess story but it looks like the food is now secondary to building a chain.  ATS, please read the reviews and make the corrections needed before its too late. While I wouldn't take points off for service, the help was less than inviting.
