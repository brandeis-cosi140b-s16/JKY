Overall I liked this place and glad it is in the neighborhood.  The carne asada burrito was good and the ceviche was pretty tasty.  However, it seems that this is about all there is to the menu.  

I was not a fan of the set-up of the restaurant.  It was way too crowded - yes it was lunch, but the flow could have been a lot better.  Overall, I will return when in the mood for carne asada.  Hopefully the kinks will get worked out over time and until then I look forward to supporting a local restaurant.
