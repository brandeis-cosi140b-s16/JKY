As the name states its AMERICAS taco shop so they are very Americanized tacos. They are really good but nothing that is going to blow your mind. I was disappointed in the size compared to the price. 

What brought it down 1 complete star is that I didn't see where it said the ingredients of the tacos so my food came out with guacamole and I'm extremely allergic to guacamole so I ended up just giving it to my friend and having to buy more.
