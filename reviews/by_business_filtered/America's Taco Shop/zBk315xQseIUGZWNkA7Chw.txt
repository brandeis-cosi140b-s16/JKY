Everybody raves about the carne asada and pastor, but we go for the bean and cheese burritos (no lard!), vegetarian quesadilla, and (for me) corn on the cob.  My kids are especially crazy about the bean and cheese burritos, and my youngest loves the vegetarian quesadilla -- flour tortilla with monterey jack cheese, lettuce, caramelized onions, guacamole. Corn on the cob is sweet white corn, lite mayo, cotija cheese, chili, lime.  Salsa is tasty and fresh -interestingly, it gets spicier if you leave it in the fridge overnight.  (Guac is just ok, in my opinion.) Also, order online for quick service.  For those wondering about the "America's" name, that's the name of one of the owners: http://www.americastacoshop.net/about
