The other night my husband and I came for a date night. My husband has always been big on this place but, I haven't. We always leave disappointed, this last time topped it off for me. We were sat and someone came up to us and got our drinks. Okay 20 minutes passes....no drinks. I flag a guy down and tell him and he says oh sorry I'm actually your waiter what do you want to drink. I was calm. Said my drinks  again seeing if he'd apologize. Of course not! So than! I try to say were ready to order and he already stormed off..... Fifteen minutes more we get drinks and I really wanted an appetizer but, didn't want to be there all night and realize i was glad I didn't order, their appetizer prices are entree prices. I believe that a plain cheese crisp was 5-6 bucks! Crazy! I ordered a pollo con Caso or something its similar to valle lunas fundidio.... (says my husband who was waaaay wrong) and asked for carne asada and was charged 3$ extra.. By the time we got it 30 minutes later. It was cold and the meat tasted like hamburger meat! Ewwwwwwww! I got one refill the whole time we were there.not by choice... I  was so upset and thirsty already ticked off I waited another 30 min for my bill! My husband asked for the 99 cent margarita and even pointed it out that the people next to us had it.... And he got a huuuuuuge one and then we told them it wasn't what we ordered and still had to pay for it my husband had two sips maybe because it was strong and he didn't like the taste! I finally had to hunt down the manager...I had to explain the situation....he didn't apologize just brought me my bill,.....didn't even comp us for the crap service food or wait times and we left. Glad to say I didn't tip! No way! Another thing e hostesses shirt was like see through and loose...she didn't leave any room for imagination and their outfits are cheesy anyways! Don't go Here! Pay the extra few bucks at Valle Luna or macayos.......
