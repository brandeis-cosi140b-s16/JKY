I used to visit this location years ago and always liked the food. Today was the first time I'd been there in years and will be the last. We ordered the mixed burrito which was okay. Also ordered the kids beef taco and it was extremely greasy, give you a stomach ache greasy. My daughter also disliked the beans. Not to mention the worst service, our server checked on us once. He didn't even refill our waters. Needless to say we won't be back.
