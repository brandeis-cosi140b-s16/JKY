When we entered the wait staff was sitting in the entry and we stood there for awhile before we were even acknowledged. They did not even say HI. We were seated and again no notice we were there from anyone. About five minutes and the waiter dropped off stale chips, salsa, and bean dip at the table. We ordered water (DO NOT ORDER) even with lime it was awful. The food was average. I do not think we will be back.
