I really liked this restaurant for the proximity to my hotel.  It seemed true to the real Mexican fare, in food and quality.  I'm really tired of the Tex-Mex, politically correct food that most so-called Mexican places claim to be.

The atmosphere is fun as is the decor.  Servers were very polite and they serve a kick-ass  flaming queso!  It reminded me of the flaming saganaki served at Greek restaurants.  They also serve margaritas as big as your head!

I would go back again.
