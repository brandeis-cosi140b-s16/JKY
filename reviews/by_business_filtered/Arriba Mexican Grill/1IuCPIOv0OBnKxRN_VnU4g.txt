Well what can I say.   The food is fair.. I do have a major issue with the service.  There is no excuse for waiters that decide to memorize the order and not write it down.   Of course, the order was messed up.... no appetizer!  No tip!   

 I did discuss it with the manager upon leaving and he did insure me that it is not store policy and they're suppose to write out. 

 The manager was nice about it.
