I had a groupon to this place, so we went last Saturday.  I have to say I wasn't expecting much, but I love Mexican food, grew up on it, as I was born and raised in Az, and it's my favorite, so I'm always willing to eat a taco or a burrito, even a bad one.  So we start out with chips and salsa.  I have to say, I was very surprised by how spicy it was!  My daughter got the mild salsa, but mine and the bean dip put a fire in my belly that was unexpected and pleasing to my palate!    I got a red chili burrito with green sauce and rice and beans.  My daughter got a chicken burrito with red sauce and rice and beans.  Megan's food was probably a 3, chicken was ok.  But mine was divine!  The meat was in large meaty chunks, very lean and tender.  The sauce was very spicy, and the green sauce on top also was very spicy and had a great taste.   Beans tasted good and were also very spicy.  The only thing that was just ok was the rice.  I ate it, but it was just ok.  And the service was also great.  Lots of diet coke refills because of the spicy food.  I would go back to this place in a heartbeat again and again.
