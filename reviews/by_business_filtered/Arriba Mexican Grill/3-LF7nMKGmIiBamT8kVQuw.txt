I hate giving bad reviews but this place is horrible! My parents hated it when I was a kid and I foolishly thought perhaps I'd like it as an adult. WRONG! The server had a thick accent (which don't get me wrong, I'm willing to make an effort) but he had the nerve to get rude and impatient with me when I asked him to repeat himself! He also cut me off mid sentence several times or would simply walk away while I was talking to him. It was ridiculous to the point of being comical! I felt like Larry David on an episode of "Curb Your Enthusiasm!" And to make matters worse the food is disgusting! Picture soggy deep-fried nastiness with dollar store canned ingredients. Gross. I hardly touched my meal and the clueless (or careless more likely) waiter didn't even bother to inquire. My friend and I were laughing and saying "so basically we could have gone to Taco Bell and it would have been cheaper, tastier and friendlier." But seriously, Los Olivos, in the same area, is much better or literally anywhere else in that shopping center!
