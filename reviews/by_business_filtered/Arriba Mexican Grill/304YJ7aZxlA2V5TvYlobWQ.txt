This was meal one in my 3 day visit and AZ Mexican food tour. I had a lovely dinner with my brother, aunt and uncle at Arriba's.  I wasn't thrilled but here is the lowdown:
Chips... 4 stars, they were crisp and warm good salsa and bean dip.

Service  3 stars, the server was informative and friendly but she forgot my uncle's extra hot salsa and he didn't get it until 1/2 way through the meal.

Food 2-4 stars, my green corn tamale was just okay, it was dry and lacked the "corny" flavor that I was after.  My uncle really enjoyed his Chile 

Decor.. 3 stars, nothing to write home about but okay.  I agree that it didn't seem very clean.

If I have a choice I would choose a single store mom and pop in the future.
