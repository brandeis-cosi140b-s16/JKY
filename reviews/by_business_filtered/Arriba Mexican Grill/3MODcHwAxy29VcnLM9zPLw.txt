My boyfriend and I had one of the best meal we have had in a while. Not only was the food spectacular; but our Waitress Carmen, was excellent. She exceeded our expectations for this restaurant. 
My boyfriend was craving Mexican Food and we decided to go to Arriba because it was close to our home. We went at Happy Hour which was from 4 to 7PM. Once we sat down, Carmen brings us chips, a bean dip, 1 mild and 1 hot salsa. That was great. I also had some questions with the menu as to what they have inside and how spicy were the chili peppers on the pictures mean. She told us like it is and because my boyfriend is a little picky with his burrito, she made sure it was done like how he wanted. We went to other restaurants and asked the same thing; they said they don't have this or that and when it comes out, it totally had this and that. So not good. We had a cheese crisp which was yummy, My boyfriend ordered straight beef burrito with sour cream and cheese on the side. I had the chimichanga with the white sauce. It had one jalepeno and because I can't eat spicy right now, she gave me a sample of the sauce (talk about great service) and it was okay by me. I wanted to finish everything but the portions were huge. Carmen also refilled our drinks every time we finished and when we were done, she offered to give us the drinks to go. I love that. 
Anyway, you gotta try this place if you haven't and hopefully, you get Carmen. She deserved the big tip we gave her.
