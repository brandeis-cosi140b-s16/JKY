I have been to this location two times, the first time I believe they had only been open a week, so the service was so so.  The second time the server was very attentive and friendly.  There chips were fresh and not to salted like some others are. They give you bean dip which is bland to me, but the salsa was good, not loaded with cilantro.  I had the trio of enchiladas(chicken,cheese, and beef) beans and rice.  The enchiladas were good I really liked the red sauce it had a good flavor.  My husband got the tacos carbon after realizing he missed there Taco Tuesday special (it ended at four pm).  His steak on the tacos had a good flavor but were a little dry.  Overall we enjoyed our meal.  I've eaten at many mexican restaraunts, and you could do a lot worse then Arribas.
