Arriba has been one of my favorite places to eat in Phoenix, but tonight I have really had to examine my love of this restaurant. It has been at least 6 months since I ate there and I was really excited about going back. I was seated in the back room. I immediately noticed that it looked like it needed a deep cleaning. My table was clean, but the walls and the areas surrounding the cheesy nature scenes in the back were filthy. The service was good, and my meal came quickly. As I was eating, something caught my eye not far from my table in the nature scene plants. It was a set mousetrap. This really turned my stomach. The food that I was eating was great as usual, but it really creeped me out that the place was so dirty and that they apparently had a rodent problem. My advice to the owners is to bring in a professional cleaning team and for heaven's sake don't leave mousetraps out for the patrons to see.
