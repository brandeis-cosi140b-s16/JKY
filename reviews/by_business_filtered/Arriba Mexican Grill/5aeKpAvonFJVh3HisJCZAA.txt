Sunday breakfast!  And it is not jammed packed like every other breakfast place on Sunday morning.  I ordered the green chili with eggs and it even came with pancakes, yum!  Service was great, especially because they were not busy out of their ears and the atmosphere is very casual and very clean.  I enjoyed going and will return again for sure!
