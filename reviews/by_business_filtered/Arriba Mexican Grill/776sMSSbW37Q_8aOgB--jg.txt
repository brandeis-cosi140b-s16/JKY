Nice restaurant and food was decent but poorly managed and horrible service. We got there at 4pm on a weekday and it was not busy at all. Servers were standing around and we sat for at least 15 minutes without anyone coming to our table. Our server showed up took our order and disappeared again until we flagged her down for our check. Would not be back
