Used to love them....sooo glad I don't anymore....Don't get me wrong, I still really like Arribas but for my waistline's sake I'm happy that I can refuse a meal here every now and then. It helps not to live in the state anymore, too!

We stopped by for nostalgia's sake and the meal was just as tasty and the service just as good. I haven't had anything that I didn't like but my go to is usually the tacos or chicken enchiladas.  The service at this location is always fast, even during their busy lunch rushes.
