Our service was terrible. Our server forgot about us, so we sat there for 20-25 mins before we could order. Then our order was wrong, the server fixed it. I was happy until the manager came over to ask how things were. He was defensive and extremely rude! Our order was wrong and they need to fix there menu of they're going to add an ingredient. I'll never eat at Thor location again!
