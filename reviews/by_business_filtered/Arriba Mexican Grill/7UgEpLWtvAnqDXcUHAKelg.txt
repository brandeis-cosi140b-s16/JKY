Where to start. I am still upset.  My husband and I usually avoid chains, but since we had the twins we are getting more intimate with some chains.  We were trying to find a new one since the other two we go to have been beaten to death.  With two year old twins choices are a little scary.  I went along and agreed to go to Arriba.  Last time we were there was 4 years ago and it was your typical mediocre fare, which is fine for a quick lunch during work week. First we order for the kids, the chicken fingers and what I thought would be strawberry smoothies.  What a surprise when I had a sip and realized it was a virgin strawberry daiquiri. I was giving my twins pink sugar water.  Not the end of the world.  I ordered some milk.  Then my husband and I were going to share the chicken fajita quesadilla.  The waiter, Omar, seemed fairly nice.  He came by a second time to verify if I wanted beef quesadilla, and I told him "No, I want chicken, no beef please".  Then he pushed for us to add the guacamole and sour cream, which I said fine to bring it with it and I repeated "chicken quesadilla". When it came the quesadilla looked like a sad greased soaked blanket.  My biggest surprise came when I took a bite and guess what I found? "Beef".  I had to spit it out and call Omar, I explained to him this was a beef quesadilla, he gave me this puzzled face and asked: You didn't want beef? I thought it was a joke, by that time the twins were getting rowdy and they had not touch the rock hard fried to death chicken fingers.  So I told him to take off the quesadilla and we would pay for everything else we didn't eat but had ordered.  Afterwards we called from the car and talked to the manager. He wanted to do "something for us", but I told my husband I didn't want to go back, so we didn't accept anything.  I guess CPK with the kids again.
