It is much overpriced, and in my opinion the flavor and texture of the food was similar to what I would expect from any drive thru 'berto establishment. I don't mind that type of food when I'm paying 4 dollars and expecting to throw away a bunch of styrofoam.  But 40 dollars for two people for lunch and one drink each was money that could have been spent buying taco bell and a six pack of bottled margaritas, with money leftover for a tank of gas.  The layout of the establishment is also really weird. (And I'm coming to notice that I have an issue with weirdly laid out restaurants, but I digress.)  You're practically knocking people's food over to get to a table in the back. But this isn't a place you'd want that kind of attention.  This place gets a star for the drink being huge (and for the price, it should be) and giving me a cool buzz on a Saturday afternoon.
