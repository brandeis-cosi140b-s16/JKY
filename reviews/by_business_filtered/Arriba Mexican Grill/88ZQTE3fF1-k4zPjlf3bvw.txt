Amazingly inconsistent!! Not the food, not the prices.... THE SERVICE runs so hot and cold it can be embarrassing. Last week wife and I had a GREAT waitress. Two days later I took a party of 6 there from work. It was 1pm when we walked in. Restaurant 25% full. HORRIBLE attention to our group, SLOW everything: chips/salsa, water refreshes.... The waiter had MASSIVE social time with other wait staff.

What a shame. Camelback store does NOT have this problem.

Over the years I've watched this service component go from good to crap. Guess there's no hope. Goodbye Scottsdale Arriba's.
