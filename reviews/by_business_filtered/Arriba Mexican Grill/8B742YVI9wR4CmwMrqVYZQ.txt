Today's experience was awful! We used to love coming to Arribas, but today we have decided to go no more...It started with the not so welcoming greeting, followed by the immediate change in language as they discussed who they wanted to attend to first-us who arrived first, or the party of 5. Fortunate for us-not so much for them-we speak Spanish! Next it was the catty sizing up of myself and my 2 teen daughters and the smiles to my husband and 3 sons as we were walking to our seats, followed by the dirty table setting when we were seated (silverware covered in hard caked on food). They brought us all the requested water, and when my 7 year old asked for more water we took the lid off if his kids cup to discover it was filthy! Some kind of dirty black residue was on the inside wall of the plastic cup-I thought this cups were all new??-it was almost like a thin layer of dirt or soot. When we addressed it with out server she looked at it and acted like this was not the first time she had to exchange a dirty dish (not including the afore mentioned spoon covered in hardened food-like shredded chicken). Once the food came it was ok. We used to come to Arribas regularly because the food had great flavor and quality. Not so much today. At one point my daughter had ordered some enchiladas and bit into one to find a bone. Normally I would have let it go but from the time we walked in until then it was such  a bad experience. We told a our new waitress (I think there was a shift change between us being seated and getting out food) and her response? "Well animals have bones, so" whith a shrug. We're not dumb. We know they have bones; I guess I was the dumb one for assuming we wouldn't be dining on them.
The only good thing about our meal for seven was the happy surprise that kids eat free on Sundays.
