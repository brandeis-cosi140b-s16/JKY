ok ok ok, before you lambast me because of my previous review - hear me out.  I learned that they have a hot system, and I stayed away from the atomic crap that KILLED me last time, but this time around it was good.  It was not the best Mexican I have ever had, but it really was decent.  I will go back and try more now.  Faith has been restored!
