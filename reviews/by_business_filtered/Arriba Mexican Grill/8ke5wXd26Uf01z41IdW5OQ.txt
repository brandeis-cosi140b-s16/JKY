You  know you have to rate a place when you start craving it... which is the case with Arriba Mexican Grill. The first time I was there it was good but, nothing amazing, I just simply did not order the thing that I like the most. 
I went here and ordered an enchilada dish (can't remember what it was called) with chicken, sour cream with a green sauce, and was blown away, it is some of the best mexican I've had since I moved here from Canada. 
They also have fantastic complimentary salsa and bean dip with chips when you sit down, and to top that all off $1.00 margaritas (yes I said $1.00) during happy hour before 6:00 pm... can't beat it!
