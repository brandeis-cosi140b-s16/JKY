I arrived at 9:10PM last night (4/24/13) with my husband.  There were 3 cars in the very dark parking lot.  We then went inside and waited and waited.  We saw a young man in the back and then he disappeared never looking our way. After several minutes of waiting, we left. Why state you're open until 10PM, if there isn't any one up front to seat you at 9:10PM?
