Service and ambiance were typical for a friendly, mainstream Mexican / American restaurant.  No complaints there.  Our server was quick with refills and made sure we were taken care of.  The restaurant itself was festively decorated and clean.

The food, however, was below par when compared to similar competition, being On the Border, Serrano's or Macayo's.  And we felt that pretty much across the menu they were also $1-$2 more per item.  But the big kicker....There just wasn't any flavor!  The food came quickly, as it usually seems to do in this style of dining establishment.  My wife and I ordered the "Holiday Special" burrito, made with beef and two kinds of chili sauce.  I made it through two bites and was so unimpressed I just stopped eating.  I also added an a la carte beef taco to my burrito...at a cost of $4.99.  There was no flavor coming from that shredded beef that would've given me a hint I was eating southwestern food.

I don't expect much from a $5 kids meal, so I'll give that those were okay, Kraft mac and cheese for one and a burger and fries for the other.

I'm not going to write Arriba's off our future nights out.  Maybe we just got a bad batch of coming out from the kitchen that night.  Maybe we ordered the wrong thing and should have asked for a recommendation.  In any case we'll give them another shot.
