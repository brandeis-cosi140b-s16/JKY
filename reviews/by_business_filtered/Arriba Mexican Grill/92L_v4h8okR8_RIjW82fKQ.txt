My husband and I went here on Thanksgiving. We go here all the time but won't be back. We have eaten here on holidays before and they have always honored happy hour and lunch specials but not this time. We went there for turkey enchiladas but didn't see a sign advertising them so we ordered something else. After we done eating, come to find out that they did have turkey but never would have known because there was no sign. Salsa was horrible. There was a drunk guy in the bar singing loud and out of tune. They kept serving him beer. Very annoying. Several customers complained. Our server Rebecca was in outer space somewhere and it was obvious that she didn't want to be there. Terrible experience. We won't be back!
