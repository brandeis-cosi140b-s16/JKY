Worst Arriba's Ever! We were so excited to have an Arriba's on this side of town yet both times we went to the Goodyear location it sucked! Service is pathetic. On our last visit we walked in to see the Manager and bartender just hanging out talking . We sat at our table for 10 minutes before going to the bar to ask for our own drinks only to find noone working.  (Could clearly hear them in the kitchen)The waitress made eye contact with us at one point, ran a few drinks to a table and walked right past us and sat in a booth to have a few bites of her meal. She returned to serve us about 5 minutes later. About the time she rudely asked "do u know what u want", as if we were an inconvenience, we got up and left.

We will not return. Ever. Bad management. Bad service.
