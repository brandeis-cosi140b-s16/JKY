Ok well first off we walked in with a party of two , there was a huge line an the server said it was a 45 minute wait so we asked to sit at the bar witch we did an on the way noticed the  restaurant was pretty much empty an the bar was full ! The bartender was great her name was Jennifer an she made excellent drinks ! On the other hand food was way to expensive an extremely way to spicy to the point I didn't eat ! Also there was no silverware an no napkins anywhere to be found :/ not to mention all of the servers stood around an talked to one another ! We will not be going back :(
