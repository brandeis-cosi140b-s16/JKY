My husband and I go there every other Friday for happy hour. Happy hour is from 3pm-7pm and 9pm- close on weekdays. All appetizers are 50% off and have margaritas for .99 cents! It's awesome! The food is great there too. The service is great and you usually don't have to wait to be seated because they are so proactive. We've been going there for 3 years so far and not once we been disappointed.
