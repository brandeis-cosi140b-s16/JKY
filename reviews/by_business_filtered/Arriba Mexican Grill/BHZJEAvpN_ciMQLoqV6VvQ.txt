I've been a few times now and I really don't get the appeal.  The place seems a little hodge-podge in their decor, the food isn't very good (not awful, but why go out and spend money on mediocre food?), and the service is pretty slow.  I've tried a couple different dishes and I'd prefer to go to a carry-out place for this type of "mexican" food.  My opinion, don't waste your time or money.
