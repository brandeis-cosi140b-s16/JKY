My wife and I decided to stop in at Arriba for our weekly date night.  I ordered the white sands chimichanga and my wife ordered the carnitas.  My overall impression was underwhelming.  My chimichanga was covered in a white cheese that tasted like velveta (gross) and the tortilla was quite tough.  My wife's carnitas were good but were $16.00 which I find to be too high.

The one good thing were the server and manager.  Both were very friendly and attentive.  My wife had a question about the cream cheese they used and the manager found out and told us.  So kudos for that.  All in all I was unimpressed and would not bring my business here when there are so many better options in my opinion.
