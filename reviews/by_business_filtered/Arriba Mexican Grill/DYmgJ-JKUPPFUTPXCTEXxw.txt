I've been to the Scottsdale location and was really impressed, so when some friends from out of state came into town and wanted a good place to eat we decided to take them here. I was horrified afterwards! We had two tables in our party, one table had great service and no issues. Our table however, took over AN HOUR to get our food! The server only came to our table twice in that time to check on our drinks, and said he would discount our ticket but didn't. We told them in advance our table would be on a split check but they put it on one check.
The food was also not very good, which added to the frustration of the evening.  One of the guys we were with was completely apalled when he saw the "mandatory gratuity" already added into the check and demanded it be removed because the service was absolutely horrible! 
I'll drive the 45 minutes to Scottsdale if I ever feel the need to go to Arriba's again.
