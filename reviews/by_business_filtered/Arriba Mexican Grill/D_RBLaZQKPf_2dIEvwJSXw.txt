Food is delicious and our server was patient with us. Two moms and two babies not always the best table to have. 

We were seat right away and we took forever to figure out what we wanted to order. Our server remained friendly and never made us feel rushed. I really wish I remembered his name. 

I'm sure we will be back for our monthly mommy/baby lunch.
