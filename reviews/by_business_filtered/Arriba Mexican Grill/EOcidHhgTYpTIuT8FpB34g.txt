I used to enjoy coming here. But man, what happened? Did management change, because everything was awful. The host was rude. Our server Brian had attitude and didn't seem to care about our needs. The food was meh. My friend ordered a house margarita and it tasted like pure rubbing alcohol. So she sent it back and said she didn't want a different margarita. The manager came over and tried to get her to buy the more expensive margarita because it would taste better. I'm sorry, but shouldn't the manager just bring her a complimentary margarita because she was unhappy with her previous one? He lingered longer trying to get her to buy one. The waiter didn't notice our drinks needed to be refilled, so we had to keep reminding him. I ordered some spicy chicken tacos-- the chicken tasted like it had been marinated in Frank's Hot Sauce, yuck! I also asked the manager to put the chicken in corn tortillas instead of the flour tortillas. They charged $2 for doing that!!! What the heck! I've never experienced that. My friends enjoyed their food though. No one was friendly and the manager just seemed clueless. I won't ever be going back.
