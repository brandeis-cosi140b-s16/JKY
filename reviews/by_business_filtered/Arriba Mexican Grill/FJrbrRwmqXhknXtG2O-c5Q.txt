if you want delicious americanized mexican, colon cancer causing food, then come here.
if you want authentic, go to mexico. 
no but really. they have ridiculous sized margaritas and martinis. 
i really think that's what they should be called. "RIDICULOUS SIZED"
it's like "may i please have the gallon sized cosmo? yes by myself. yes thank you i'll need a cab." 
i love the abodaba pizza and the pollo con queso. 
been coming here for years and i still love it.
