While I understand that this is a chain restaurant, I still think there are much better Mexican food places to go to than Arriba.

This was my first experience with Arriba Mexican Grill. I ordered the Chile Colorado. The menu designates this as a 2-chile (fiery) dish and to me it was mildly spicy (1-chile or snappy according to their ratings). I was supposed to get rice, beans and tortillas with this and when it was brought to my table, there were no frijoles negro nor tortillas. I pointed this out to my waitress. She apologized and said that she'd be back with them right away. About 5 min later, she walked by the table with no beans or tortillas in sight and asked her about them again. She forgot.  By the time I got my beans and tortillas, I was done with my dinner!!!

After paying for my meal and going up to the front, I asked to speak to the manager about this horrible situation (I waited to complain to the manager because I didn't want my food tainted by something - seen it done too many times when I worked in a restaurant). I told the tale of experience to the manager and it fell upon deaf, or unsympathetic, ears.

I WILL NEVER EAT, DRINK OR STEP INTO THIS PLACE AGAIN!!!
