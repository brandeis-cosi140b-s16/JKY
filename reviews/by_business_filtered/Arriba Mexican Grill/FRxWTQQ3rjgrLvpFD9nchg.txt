Great service.
Good food.
I ordered something a little off the menu.  I had the chile relleno but had them add the carne adobada instead of the regular shredded beef. Turned out to be a great choice.
I think this may be my go to place for day drinking. They have a full bar.
My birthday is on Saturday so it might be a great place to start the day.  
Go!
