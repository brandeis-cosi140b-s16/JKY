Sub-par food at rediculous prices.

My husband and I love Mexican food. We have tried several places since moving here a year and a half ago, and this has been the worst. The meat in my beef tacos had a really strange texture to it, hard to describe. I wanted to add sour cream, bill came and we were charge $2 just for that. Considering the whole experience and how expensive everything was, I will never go back here and would not recommend it to anyone.
