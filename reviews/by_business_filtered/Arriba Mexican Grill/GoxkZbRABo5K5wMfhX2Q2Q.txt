This place has decent food, but the service has really gone downhill lately. I visited recently and was looking forward to trying one of the microbrews they advertise prominently on the building, in menus, and so on. Nope, the microbrews are unavailable because of some equipment problem. In fact, all draft beer is unavailable. Seriously? How long does it take to tap a keg?

The food we ordered was okay but the rice and beans were not hot at all. Then, we ordered fried ice cream. It tasted like rancid fry oil, a taste that does not leave the mouth for hours, trust me.

The waitress took the dessert off our bill but was wholly uninterested in our concerns about the microbrew or the ice cream. I doubt the message that the fry oil needed to make its way into someone's biodiesel made it back to the kitchen. Overall, disappointing and I'll think twice before going back.
