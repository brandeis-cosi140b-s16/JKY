I believe this is the oldest Arriba locations and it shows on the inside. Sort of cramped, but nothing that will make your visit unpleasant. I have always loved the food at Arriba.

 ITS VERY VERY SPICY. And I love spicy food, and even I think its pretty hot. The food is priced just about right for a sit-down style place. 

Two people will easily spend $20-$30. I believe they have a happy hour but I dont think its that great. Its a great place for a lot of occasions, but you may not impress a date very well taking her here.

 As I said before, probably the biggest down fall is the older location and the need for a good face lift. Other than that, its a good solid place to eat and have a drink or two.
