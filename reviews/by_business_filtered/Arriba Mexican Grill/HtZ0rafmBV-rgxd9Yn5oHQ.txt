The atmosphere and service were good. We were seated immediately near the outdoor seating area. We went with our children on Sunday when they offer kids eat for free. We ordered the White Sands chimichanga and shared it. It was delicious and large enough to share, good thing we did. Our older daughter ordered a chimichanga with red sauce and she enjoyed it as well. The kids meals did not skimp. 

We enjoy this place with an authentic New Mexican flare. Try any recipe for hatch chiles and you won't be disappointed.
