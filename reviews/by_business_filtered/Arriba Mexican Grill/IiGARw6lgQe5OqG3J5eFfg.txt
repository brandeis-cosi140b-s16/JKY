My husband and I always love this place.  We've catered from here for Superbowl events as well as gone to lunch and happy hour.  We also picked up some fresh roasted hatch chilis when they have them out front during promotional times.  They were amazing and we made some great dishes at home!

Our favorite is the pollo con queso, but there are so many good menu items.  We often get the pollo con queso and something else to share so that we can try something new as well.  

We just went there tonight because Sundays kids eat free and that is just great! 

Their patio is awesome because it has an indoor/outdoor feel and is backed by a waterfall for some sound ambiance!  

Great salsa, great food, great with kids, I love this place!
