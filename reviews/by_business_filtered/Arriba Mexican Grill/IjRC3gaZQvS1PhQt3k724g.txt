The older lady bartender had 2 other guests and was primarily interested in talking to her co-worker at bar.  I ordered the beef and chicken combo fajitas. The beef was beef in namely. Disgusting dry shriveled up pieces of sorta beef. It's not like these fajitas were cheap either. They were like 14 bucks! Apparently their 99 cents Margs don't contain any tequila. Don't bother with this rip off of a place
