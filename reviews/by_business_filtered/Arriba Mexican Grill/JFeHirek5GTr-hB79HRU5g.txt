Not good at all.  I had the taco salad and it was huge but no flavor in the chicken and very bland boring salad. My husband had the chili rellano with shredded beef.  The shredded beef was put on top of the crispy fried goodness which made it super soggy. Not good eats.  The place was dead - it seems they have a lot of happy hour & drink specials and thats what they cater to. As for the food - skip it unless your happy with just chips and salsa.  This was a spur of the moment stop and it was close to home.  They are many other food choices so I'll definitely take advantage of the others in the area.
