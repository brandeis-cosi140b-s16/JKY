Not impressed at all.  I went with my husband, and as always he ordered a bean burrito, it was very bland and way over priced.  I had a chicken and a beef taco, the chicken was horrible, and the beef was very dry.  For desert we ordered apple chimichangas which were very good, but how could you mess up deep fried apples and tortillas dipped in cinammon and sugar.  The only  thing good I have to say about this place is that every time I ordered a beer the waitress brought me one immediately and then about 20 minutes later the busboy would bring another out to me thinking I never received the first, either way, no matter how drunk I got the food never tasted good.   I would never go here again.
