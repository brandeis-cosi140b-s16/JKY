I'm going right on the average here, and I think that's OK.

Over the past few months, me and my family have been coming here every once in a while for happy meal- cheap margaritas for the over-21 (not me) and half-off apps (what we normally get). Today, I went with my mother, sister, aunt, two cousins, grandma, and four friends. Despite only having six of the eleven to start off with, we went to the table pretty quickly. The server was friendly, and checked up every couple minutes (probably to just get some orders in) while we were waiting for the other guests. She was quick with the waters, and after the others came in, was fairly consistent with her service. The only complaint I had was she didn't ask about refilling my soda when it was getting close to empty.

Like we normally do, we tried to order completely off the appetizer section, since it was half off. Me, my mom, and my grandma split the taquitos, chicken mini chimis, and hatch chili quesadilla. The taquitos and chimis were slightly underseasoned, but were quite tasty in the dipping sauce the taquitos came with. The hatch chili quesadilla was really good! It was spicy, just how I like it; however, you could tell it had been microwaved, which slightly disappointed me.

The food was probably three out of five, and the service probably four, which is why I chose this rating.
