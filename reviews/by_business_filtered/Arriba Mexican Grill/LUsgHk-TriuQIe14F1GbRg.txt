Having spent over 10 years in New Mexico I was curious to try this place. First impression... Not a bad lil restaurant. Went to the bar to order some to go lunch. I ordered the Mini New Mexico Enchilada. I requested Red Chile. Bartender was like red sauce? "Um yes please." LOL So I get it home. The food is good. However, just because you use Hatch Chile does not make it authentic. Lil Anitas in the Burque blows this place out of the water. The brewpub I always used to live at, Turtle Mountain... Their New Mexican cuisine kills this place. They use Bueno Chile. 

So, ya the food is touristy good. I'd go again. However.... Just cuz you make Tex Mex food with Hatch chile, that doesnt make it authentic.
