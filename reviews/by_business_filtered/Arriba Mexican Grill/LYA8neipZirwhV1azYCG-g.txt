Stale chips, horrible salsa, bean dip was NOT edible. Two stars for mediocre food, and service. Plus margaritas were good, pitcher of Cuervo gold margaritas. Meals were overpriced, $10.50 for a taco salad, which wasn't very good, $11.50 for two chicken tacos, with 2 slivers of chicken in them. Save your $$ buy some pre-mixed Jose Cuervo mix, warm up some frozen burritos, add some pace and canned refried beans.... That will much taste better!
