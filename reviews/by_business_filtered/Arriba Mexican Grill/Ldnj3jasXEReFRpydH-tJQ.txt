Behold and Beware The Power of Mexican Chiles in Action

That was the theme of our first time here. MH ordered the Steak Tampico, marked as a 3 pepper dish. Seeing what followed with him was entirely new to me. If you can see a brown person turn red, you know it's hot. 

His take: "among the spiciest things I've ever eaten, better than sinus medication if you have a cold". Hotter than the most diabolical chicken wings that we had together and needed 2 full pitchers of water with. Evidently the chiles in the red sauce which covered the bottom of the plate spread into the guacamole, the lettuce, the tomato, the olive ... 
The white sauce on top performed the same function for the steak ... 

Although he finished about half, which is usual. I wonder how long the effect will last and am monitoring the situation ... 

Our server was friendly and attentive. The chips and salsas were filling. My chicken ? dish was fine. Didn't see why sour cream is an (expensive) extra. The flour tortillas on the side were ok, but bland. Nothing to compare with El Sol. The plates were cute, as they had the name of the restaurant  handwritten and fired into the various bright colors ... 

The menu had photos, a little blurry but nice touch. Maybe it's just me but I'm not really fond of burritos and chimichangas swimming in sauce. Not that I got either this time, but if I do a special request would definitely be in order. 

Overall, I don't think the quality of the food is worth the price. ok, but ordinary. I may go again, being married to a hot food junkie, but who knows - the effects of this particular mouth-burning may go deeper than I think. Time will tell ... 

off to give him an acid pill :-)
