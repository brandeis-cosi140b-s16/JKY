Had lunch and was pleased with the quality of the food, the portion size, the service, and the physical layout of the restaurant. We were promptly seated and the waitress was very quick to the table with the salsa and bean dip.  This was a plus in that you don't often get bean dip with the traditional salsa. They were both spicy enough to get the tongue tingle and it was nice that both my wife and I received our own bowls and did not have to share. They have an extensive menu and had two of my favorites which are chili Colorado and adobada.  I ordered the adobada plate and for $8 it was very good and plentiful. I had the black beans which were also very good. The rice was average but I like to pile some salsa on it so it worked out fine.  My wife had the layered chicken New Mexico enchilada with green sauce which was pretty dang spicy, lots of hatch chile's(also at $8)!  The waitress was friendly and efficient and we will certainly return.
