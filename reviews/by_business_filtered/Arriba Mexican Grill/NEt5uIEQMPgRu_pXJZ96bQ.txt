Ok...so its your standard Mexican food with a very nice Mexican atmosphere. I like that they have pictures of all the dishes on the menu...considering I have a hard enough time with the food names. Except Taco...we all know what that is. 

But here is what I like about the place over others. The service! Our server was super nice and fun and quick and attentive. I told here I was a salsa junkie and she kept me supplied...and I do like their salsa. its fresh made as are the chips. The margaritas are really really huge and very well made. 

So,,,if you want an inexpensive, a-ok mexican food with exceptional service....I recommend Arriba!
