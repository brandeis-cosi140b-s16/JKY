Ugh. They have some good commercials for this place currently playing. Unfortunately...that's where the "good" stops with this place! Everything was terrible from the service to their food, I think their Diet Coke even tasted horrid. We ordered their Mexican Waffle with ice cream..they actually made Eggo's taste good, which is not saying much. Frost bitten and just ewww. If a 6 yr. old doesnt want dessert...something's wrong with your place. 

I will NEVER go here again and if this saves even one person from eating here, I feel I've done my job. Do yourself a favor and don't go here, it's disgusting.
