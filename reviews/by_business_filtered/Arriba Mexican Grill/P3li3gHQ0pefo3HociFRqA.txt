I honestly CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF THIS PLACE! I could drink their(GIANT) peach margaritas and eat their(warm and wonderful) tortilla chips every single day for the rest of my life :) Their food strays from the typical 'Mexican' fare you usually find out here, and they add their own signature touch--those smoky, spicy, sultry hatch chiles...wow.

Try the margaritas, but be prepared to drink about 12oz--they're enormous :p
