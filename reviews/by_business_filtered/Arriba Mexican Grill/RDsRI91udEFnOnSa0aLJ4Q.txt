Their breakfast on the weekends is the best-kept secret in the area. The menu features not only Mexican items but plain-old bacon, eggs, and pancakes. Prices are better than at most typical breakfast places. 

The great thing about it (and something that this review might change somewhat) is that the Sunday morning crowd seems to not know about it, or are scared away by the fact that it's a Mexican restaurant that they think only serves huevos rancheros for breakfast.  Thus, it's always easy to get seated.
