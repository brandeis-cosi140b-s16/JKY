Liked the cheese crisp --it was truly crispy.  The salsa was fresh. The fajita quesadilla was amazing!  The quesadilla veggies were cooked just right, they used grilled chicken instead of pulled chicken and the jalape√±o cream cheese was delicious!  Service was excellent.  Got there just after 10 PM for a late dinner date with my hubby, and they didn't hassle us for coming in at that time and ordering a full dinner, even with the restaurant closing at 11.  We were out the doors by 10:50.  Will go back again.

Margaritas aren't very strong and they're kind of a rip off.
