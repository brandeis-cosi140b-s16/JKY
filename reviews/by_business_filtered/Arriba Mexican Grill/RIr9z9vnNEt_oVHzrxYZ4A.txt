Mexican is usually not my first choice but I was quite happy with the food the couple times I've been here. One unique thing about them that I haven't seen elsewhere is the spicy bean dip they provide with the chips and salsa. For people who aren't into spicy, it really has a little kick so be careful. A couple other people who I was dining with weren't expecting it and they were quite surprised when trying it.

Arriba's rates their spice level by a rating scale of 1-3 peppers. I love spicy food so I got the shrimp fajitas last time with the salsa on the side that had a 3 pepper rating. Usually things aren't spicy enough for me but this was indeed spicy and I was very happy with it.

Their 99 cent margarita was a great value as well and the perfect size for someone who can't drink as much like me!

The food is 4 stars but I can't justify that rating because the service is lacking. It can be super slow. We waited 30-45 minutes after we got our bill and wanted to pay so that was not the best ending to our meal.
