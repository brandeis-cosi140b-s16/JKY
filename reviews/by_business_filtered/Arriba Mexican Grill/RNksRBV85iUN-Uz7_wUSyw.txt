Geez what's up with these places ???  Been coming to Arriba's few times... different times if it isn't one thing it's another.... food not well cooked , dirty utensils , charged for food I did not order things like that... The last time I brought my SIs in law's Family for a celebration ... nope It was like pulling teeth from the Waitress. She had an attitude , brought the wrong food, it took almost 45 minutes for everyone to eat dinner. I still gave the waitress a 10 tip and told her " Boy here is your 10 tip you don't deserve it and I'm sorry for coming here and it is the last time coming here and stay home if you have a bad day ,don't take it on the Customers" . Sorry , Arriba Mexican Grill this place looks like it's going  " Abajo Mexican Grill " .  See ya,  taking my Money somewhere else .... $$$
