Not sure about all the terrible reviews... I think this place is great! Granted I've only been here during happy hour (but got full entrees). Our bartender was awesome both times we've been here. 99 cent margaritas during happy hour and chips served with 3 types of salsas/dips. We've tried shrimp fajitas, Santa Fe salad, few other things ,all awesome. We were bummed we got full too quick off the huge portions. And yea the decor is a little different, but I think it's colorful and adorable. Keep it up! We'll be back!
