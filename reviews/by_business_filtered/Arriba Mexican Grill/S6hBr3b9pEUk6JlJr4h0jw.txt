I love this place. I've been coming here since we've elected our first Black president 
in office. Food is always excellent, fresh, and appealing. Not sure what all of the negative comments are, but this is my favorite Mexican restaurant. The lunch specials are to die for. And is the valley's best-kept secret. Where else in the country can you order a full meal - complete with entree, rice and beans - for a mere $4.99...nowhere !!  Throw-in the unlimited warm bowl of chips and salsa/bean dip and you're in Heaven. 

Alvin, the manager is always kind and friendly, and greets us whenever we are there 3x/wk. We're always the only Asian couple there, yet we prefer Mexican over Chinese due to the immense cooking oils and MSG preservatives used in Asian cooking. And Arriba's gives you large portions so we're always satisfied and full when we leave. 

Arriba's is always open and receptive to our requests; such as to customize our order so 
that there is less cheese or is completely substituted for healthier black beans;  or the chimichanga converted as a fresh burrito instead of it deep-fried. etc....we love it !!  It's a healthy alternative. 

Thanks Arriba's for being an asset to the community. And for continuous loyalty in satisfying our palate with all the love and flavors of Old Mexico.
