The food here was okay, but there are definitely places close by that are better for lunch in North Scottsdale. The server that we had was awesome though. He helped us with recommendations, answered all of our "first-time customer" questions and even helped me add extra heat to my meal with a small bowl of green chiles. I love my ridiculously hot food and those hit the spot when I added them to the salsa and my burrito. Their lunch specials are a little bit higher priced than I thought they would be. Considering that Los Olivos is next door, I would probably head there first, but if you're looking for a similar restaurant and you like guero-fied Mexican food, this might be a spot for you.
