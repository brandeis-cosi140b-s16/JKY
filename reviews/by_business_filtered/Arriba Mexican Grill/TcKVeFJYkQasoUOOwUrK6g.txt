We've been coming here for years but this last trip was just disappointing. We had a large party (and we called ahead since there were 15 of us.) They basically sat us in the isle to the bathrooms and kitchen.  The poor waiters kept bumping into our chairs to get past us. And the people seated in the booths on the other side of us had to wait for us to stand up so they could get out since it was so tight.  I asked for a drink menu and was told they were revamping it and there wasn't one available, so asked a couple of questions and ordered something.  Didn't receive what I ordered but our waiter was new so figured oh well.  He was also very slow in getting back to us so I got tired of waiting.  Got the bill and the drink was $9.  For a drink...that wasn't what I ordered and had not been told a price on.  Yes, I should have asked. Learn the hard way I guess.  99 cent Margarita would have been better. Service was very slow, food was mediocre at best. Prices seemed very high for the quality of food. Staff was friendly thank goodness.
