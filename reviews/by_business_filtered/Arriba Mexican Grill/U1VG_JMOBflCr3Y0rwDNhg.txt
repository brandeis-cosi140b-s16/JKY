After reading the previous reviews I had to check it out myself.  I was craving Mexican and this was close by.  I was skeptical. 

I walked in and was greeted promptly and I sat at the bar, as I was dining alone.  Was served chips, salsa and bean dip, complimentary.   Both were great!

Food was really good.  Service was amazing.  Dominic, the manager, personally introduced himself to me and made sure I was satisfied.  Hillary the bartender took good care of me since I was dining alone. She made sure that I got plenty of attention, and took her time to explain some of their dishes to me.

I had the enchiladas and they were amazing.  The house margarita is 24 ounces and only $6!  Very tasty and hit the spot to cool off my mouth from the spicy sauce on my enchiladas.  

I would bring friends and family here anytime.  Pork green chili is soooo good!!! Yum!!!

I recommend giving it a try.  Sounds like they are under new management and I am literally shocked at the difference I experienced vs the previous reviews.
