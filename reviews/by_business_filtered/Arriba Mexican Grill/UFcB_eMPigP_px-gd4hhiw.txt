Is the food good? Um, not really. Is the happy hour good? No - It's great! Listen,     $.99 Margaritas and half price appetizers is a fabulous deal when you have a large family or are on a budget. And don't forget all the chips and salsa! This probably isn't the place to go when you're looking for authentic Mexican food. However, if you don't want to cook and don't want to spend a ton of money, Arriba's Happy Hour is the way to go!
