This place was horrible from the moment we sat down. The only thing that was good was the chips and salsa.We were there on a Sunday noonish and it was not too packed our server only had one other table. There were 5 of us and only 1 set of silverware and had to ask about 6 times for extra silverware and napkins! Our drink order took forever to come however our food came out right away! All I can say is the microwave was not working right because most of our food was really hot on the edges and cold in the middle! Also after asking several times only two of us ever got our drinks refilled! The waitress also kept stacking our dirty dishes up at the end of the table and never took any of them away!  One person in our party also ordered desert, mini-apple chimmi's with ice cream, they're were 4 total and two of them were ICE cold and the other two were hot but cold in the middle! It had been awhile since my wife and I had been to this location before and had good memories of good food and service! Doubt we will return to this place again!
