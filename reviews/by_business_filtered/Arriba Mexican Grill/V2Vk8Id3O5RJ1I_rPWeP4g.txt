We made a stop here yesterday.  We took our seats at the bar and the bartender was very busy watching soccer on TV.  There were dirty dishes all over the bar.  The a/c was very cold so we moved to the other end of the bar which was much better. 

 I ordered a beer and my lovely wife had ice tea while we munched on chips that had good flavor.  I looked over the menu and was surprised to see most of the appetizers were priced in the $9-$12 range.  

We decided to split the Chicken Quesadilla.  The bartender asked if I would like Sour Cream and Guacamole with it and I responded "yes":
The plate came out in about 10 minutes.  The Quesadilla was one flour tortilla folded in half.  That to me is really a half of a Quesadilla not a full one.  Especially for $8.99.  The flavor was okay, nothing special.  

We finished eating and asked for the bill.  That was after the bartender pulled himself away from the TV.  I took a look at it and was shocked.  We ordered one draft beer, one ice tea and one Chicken Quesadilla and the bill was $22.89!!!!!    I then realized that the adding Sour Cream and Guacamole added $1.49 and $2.49 respectively.  That is the way they make a $8.99 appetizer turn into a $12.99 appetizer.  

I was not impressed with the food of the cleanliness or the service here.  

We will not go back here or to the new location in Goodyear when it opens.
