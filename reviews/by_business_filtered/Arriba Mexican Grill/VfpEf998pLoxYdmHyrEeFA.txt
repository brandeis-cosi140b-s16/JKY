The only reason this place even gets two stars is because of our waiter, he was very nice and fairly attentive.  The food was blah and bought, not made.  It started with the tostitos tasting chips, maybe not even that good. The salsa was boring, even tasting a little like Pace.  I had a burrito, rice, and beans, pretty standard.  The meat in the burrito was ok, nothing to write home about, but not bad.  The tortilla, again tasting like it was from a store had very little taste.  The red sauce was awful, straight out of the can.  The rice had very little to no flavor, but I will say the refried beans had  decent flavor.  Plus... $1.99 for a dollop of sour cream and $2.49 for the same in guacamole...are you kidding!!
