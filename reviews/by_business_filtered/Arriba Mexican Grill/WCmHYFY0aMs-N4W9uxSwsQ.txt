The good:

We were seated immediately and served chips, salsa and bean dip.  The salsa was mild, so my husband requested a hotter version and was pleased with "the kick", which says a lot because he keeps a small bottle of ghost-pepper hot sauce in his car and has a tongue made of steel.

The bad:

We ate chips and salsa...and ate chips and salsa....and ate chips and salsa....without getting served water or seeing a waitress.  At one point, I asked for a drink menu, and they did not have one. I know they serve margaritas, but usually restaurants provide numerous options and have a menu describing those options.  Supposedly Arriba's used to have a menu  but no longer does - so even though you see people drinking out of awesomely huge margarita cups, there is no way to look up the price.

Finally the waitress came to the table and apologized for the fact that no one ever told her we were there.   It was 5:30pm on a Saturday evening.

Back to the good:

Our food arrived quickly.  The portion sizes were large. It was everything you would expect from Mexican food: tortillas, cheese, beans, meats with sour cream, marked up to $10/plate.  But it was a tasty $10 plate of food and my family left very full, slightly bloated, and with a white plastic box of filled of cheesy leftovers that my husband will eat tomorrow for lunch while i detox with a salad.
