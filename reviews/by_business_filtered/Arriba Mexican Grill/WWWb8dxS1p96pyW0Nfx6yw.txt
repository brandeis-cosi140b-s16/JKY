For all of the hype that this place gets, I was extremely disappointed in the food, the service, and the price. The food was probably the least disappointing of the three, as it felt a bit more authentic than your typical Mexican food chain. I will admit that I didn't try any of their well-known hatch chilies. For the price, this food didn't make par.

The service was awful. We were visited at most twice by our waiter, once for our order and once for the check.
