We ordered several platters to go and upon arriving at the requested time, had to wait an additional 30minutes.  Love the food and love the service, when we dine in, but this time they missed the mark.  I could understand if we just called it in but we placed the order several weeks earlier.  

Management was very helpful in resolving the problem but I would call ahead if you order any platters to go.

Otherwise, I would have given them a 5stars rating, when dining in.

Perhaps we will order our food from The Original Burrito Company next time.
