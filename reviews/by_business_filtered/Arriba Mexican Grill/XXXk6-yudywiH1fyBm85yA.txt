Reviewing this is hard. They used to be my favorite places to go. I loved the fajitas. However the portions get smaller every time and the service gets worse and worse. I love the hatch chili but sometimes they forget it and don't bring it to me. They don't refill the drinks and you never see the waiters or waitresses. It wouldn't be so bad but it cost about sixty dollars every time we go there. If I'm paying I want good service and not tiny portions. We've stopped going here because it is no longer worth the price. Like I said it USED to be my favorite but no longer. Going to fast food Mexican is more satisfying because at least I'm not out a lot of money. I love good Mexican food!!
