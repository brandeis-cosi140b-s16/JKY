I have been to Arribas only 3 times in the past 3 months and will continue to eat there, I have a flavor for spicy and the  Hatch Chile Sirloin has always been my favorite as well as the chips and dips before the meal. I read some of the other reviews for this restaurant and am surprised how quickly people are to criticize pricing of a soda (free refills) or not liking a free bean dip, I tip based on the customer service I don't bash a company because someone may have had a bad day, I know I'm guilty of not always being on. I just wanted to defend or voice my opinion to these people that think themselves perfect, this is a really cool place to eat.
