Was not impressed at all.

I like the little waterfall out front and wish they took advantage of it by having an outdoor patio around it.

99c margaritas for happy hour are great!  However paying almost $3 for a soda rounded out the pricing for beverages.

I liked the chips and salsa okay.  Was not a fan of the bean dip at all.  Ordered the guacamole.  Great amount and flavor was okay.  Didn't care for the big chunks of avocado that were stringy.

Can't imagine ever going back.
