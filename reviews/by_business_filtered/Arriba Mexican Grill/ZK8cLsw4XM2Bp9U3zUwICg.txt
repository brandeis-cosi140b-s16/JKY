After some of the bad reviews on Yelp I almost didn't bother going here but I am glad I did.

I found everything from the drinks to the food to be great.  The only warning I would give is that when they say something is spicey.. . they mean spicey.  I am used to places over selling how hot a dish is but this place undersells.  In fact, if I had known I would have ordered something with a little less kick.
