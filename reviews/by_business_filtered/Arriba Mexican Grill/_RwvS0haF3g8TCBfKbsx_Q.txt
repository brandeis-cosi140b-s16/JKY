BEWARE! This is not only a bad restaurant, but really a danger to everyone! We went in and the first thing we noticed was a musty mildew smell. should have left, but WE DIDN'T.

The waiter was very polite, took drink orders and said "don;t get anything with the ground beef because it is rancid and people are puking"! I said "it is still on the menu?" at he said "the manager did not want to pull it in case someone wants ground beef".  

ARE YOU KIDDING ME??

We were really hungry and STUPID and stayed, but did not order the ground beef. The chips were cold when brought out.

Get this: We ordered a 2 taco combo, 2 taco combo, and 1 enchilada with rice and beans. There was about 3 tbs of rice and 2 tbs of beans on each plate! I asked the waited and he said that they were running low and rationing. We had a coke, a beer and a .99 cent Margarita and the bill for this mess was $67.96!

Not only will I never go again, but I contacted the board of health!

I risked my life and wallet to get nothing!
