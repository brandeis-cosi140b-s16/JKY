Don't go here... this place has declined so much. Ordered a tostada and my chorizo was watery and greasy at the same time (i dont know how that happened). Our server asked me how my food was and I told her my chorizo was watery. Didnt really do anything. Queso fundido (which was my fave) was bland and lumpy, not flavorful and creamy like it used to be. I think the old chef must have quit...I dont think the place is doing well anyway, it was dead when we came in. Not sure how the Ahwatukee location is doing but I won't be coming back here. Heres to hoping I dont get sick from that rank chorizo I just ate!
