Not bad, not outstanding but not bad. Had the 99cent Margarita, well actually two. I usually get the ala carte burrito with both types of beef mixed. Also tried both the red and green sauce and added cheese. The beef was on the very salty side  hubby had two tacos and weak iced tea. His were salty too but again not bad. Service was very attentive and quick. They were getting busier as we left at 7 pm. I would go again if not for the salsa bean dip and chips alone
