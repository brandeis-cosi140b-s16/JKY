Just okay.

Stopped by for their reverse happy hour.

Salsa was good. Kind of spicy for mild which I liked.

Disappointed that the bean dip AND the queso had chorizo. 

We split the Mexican pizza subbing the meat for beans. Greasy but satisfying. It's good if you put tons of salsa on it. About halfway through eating it however, I detected something meaty in their beans. Now, I am not a super strict vegetarian. I will eat refried beans at most Mexican places as long as there is not an overwhelming lard or meaty taste. (On a side note though- I feel it is completely unnecessary to use lard or meat products in beans. My favorite Mexican food place- Mi Pueblo- makes excellent beans with no lard. When beans are a vegetarian staple, why would a restaurant be inconsiderate and make it non-vegetarian? Okay- end rant.) So back to Arriba's beans... It tasted something a bit porkish. It kind of killed my appetite so I was done after two pieces.

My husband also ordered pork taquitos which he was underwhelmed by. Although a big chorizo fan, he said the queso it came with wasn't great.

Our server was good. Charming and accommodating.

But what really turned me off was the bill. My husband didn't tell me until we were in the car, so I didn't have a chance to fight it. $31 total. Hmmmm... happy hour prices on the Mexican pizza should have been $8 and $3. On top of that a draft Bud Light (also on special) and a Corona. $31 does NOT make sense. Our server didn't seem so charming and accommodating anymore. 

Yeah, so we won't be back. Way too many good Mexican places to bother with Arriba.
