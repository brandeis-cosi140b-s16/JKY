I love it.
I love their food, so much, that I'm willing to overlook the poor service and sometimes funny findings in the food.

I love their food.  It is very spicy, and I loveeeeeeeeee spicy.
So if you and your family/friends don't enjoy the spicy, look elsewhere.

The fundido sauce is to die for.  I love their roasted hatch chiles.
Love it.
