A bit pricey for Mexican food.

But if you do it right - Tuesday at 3PM you can get $1.00 tacos and $0.99 margaritas. 

Atmosphere is good.  Friendly service.

Queso dip is great.  Chile rellenos are HOT, beware.  New Mexican enchiladas are good with the red or green chile.  I recommend a fried egg on top.
