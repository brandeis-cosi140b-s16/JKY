This is one of the better Mexican restaurants in the area, which isn't saying a lot but something. 

We've been in for a couple of lunches and satisfied every time.  Service could use some work, they are about as friendly as you have to be to not be rude and that's about it.  The cost is great, you get huge portions (we find it's more then enough to share) and at a great price.  Margaritas are very tasty and again a great price.  I'd say happy hour is a great time to visit.
