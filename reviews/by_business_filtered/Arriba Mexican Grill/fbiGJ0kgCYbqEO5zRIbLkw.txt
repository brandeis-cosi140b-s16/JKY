Not a great start - 7pm and took 12 minutes for a hostess to appear. 

Food took over an hour to arrive, and and took almost 45 minutes for them to explain that the kitchen was behind. 

Drinks were very slow, so, they are still. OT doing to great.

I've been here before, and never had it that bad.

Patio doors were opened up, and the restaurant was pretty warm and stuffy inside.

Food was fresh and warm, but, couple of issues and mistakes on the order itself.
