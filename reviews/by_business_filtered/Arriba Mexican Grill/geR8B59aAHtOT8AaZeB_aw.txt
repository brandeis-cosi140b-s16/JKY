Meh, service was decent, vegetarian options were not that great. Water was tap, and the food was not fresh. Nothing special about this place, but it did not make me puke.

Had the vegetarian enchiladas and they were not that flavorful.

Price for lunch menu was cheap, under $10. 

Would I go again? No.
If someone took me there, would I go...sure...
