Always our staple when we're in the area and lunching out with coworkers. It's no-frills, no-nonsense Mexican food. The lunch crowd gets busy, and the parking can be challenging at times, but once you're inside, usually there's not a long wait to get seated. Food is good, fast, and cheap (and check out their lunch menu), and the folks working there are nice. All of these are the reasons why we keep coming back. Their formula just works.
