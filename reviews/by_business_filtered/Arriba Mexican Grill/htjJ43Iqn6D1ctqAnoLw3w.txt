We didn't eat an entree here so I can't comment on that aspect.  We had their house margarita for two (but it wasn't 99c happy hour time) and enjoyed it, great value for 8 dollars.  One of our party had the Ultimate Margarita and he rated it 4 stars out of 5.

We ordered some guac dip to go with the chips and salsa (spicy but good spicy) and left satisfied.  The server we had was great, and gave us top notch service even though we were only having a drink and chips, although I did notice other servers weren't as attentive to their tables.
