Maybe I do not have the most sophisticated palate, but I really liked my dinner here! Plus they were having $.99 margaritas. If you wanted to just live cheaply you could just have $.99 margaritas and chips and salsa and probably live the rest of your life.  all in all the service was good I am stuffed to the gills and I got very cheap tequila. What more can someone wants in life. I guess I am a very simple girl.
