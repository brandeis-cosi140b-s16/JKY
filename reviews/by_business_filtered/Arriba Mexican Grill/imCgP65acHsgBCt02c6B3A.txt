Great atmosphere with a beautiful water feature right in front.  Even the bathrooms were nice!  The food is about what to expect for a Mexican restaurant.  Price was average but the service was a little less than good. We went as a big group for a birthday and we only had one server... they weren't even that busy that they were short handed.  It was fun though!
