Do not ever forget to drain the ground beef before you put it on the Mexican pizza!  Attention to detail is imperative when you are running a busy restaurant next to a popular mall and this place missed the mark when we went there.

Sorry for the low mark, but I will raise it if someone from the restaurant acknowledge this review, because I know, this could have been an isolated incident.
