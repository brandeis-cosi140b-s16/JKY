Just had dinner at Arriba Mexican Grill at Chandler & 48th in Ahwatukee. This is the place with the cheesy commercials about "hatch chili's makin' it hot!" that remind me of old Chi-Chi's commercials. Huge disappointment.

The salsa was decent but the tortilla chips greasy and bland; the spinach enchiladas were okay but small; the black beans, rice, and salad boring. Plus they had the nerve to charge $1.99 for sour cream and $2.49 for guacamole. 

Finally, Robert Irvine would have flipped over the fact that the appetizer/desert menu on the table was filthy!

You know, I've lived in the Great American Southwest for 5-1/2 years and I'm only 162 miles from the Mexican border... I have never had a truly awesome Mexican meal here. Decent but never awesome. Weird. How I miss Mad Mex back in the Burgh...
