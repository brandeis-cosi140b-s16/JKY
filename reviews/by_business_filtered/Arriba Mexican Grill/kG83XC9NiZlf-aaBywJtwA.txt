Food was alright. Service was the WORST ever. Waitress stopped at the table just long enough to ask if everything was alright, not even long enough for our response. When taking our order she didn't listen half the time and got half of our order wrong. Multiple staff walking by looking at our table with a stack of dishes and empty glasses...nobody seemed to care to ask if we needed anything. Staff all looked miserable. They won't get our business anymore
