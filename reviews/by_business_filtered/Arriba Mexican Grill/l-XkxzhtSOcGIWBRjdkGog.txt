Spicy hot is a very subjective thing. Arriba's dishes are made with Hatch chilis from New Mexico. For the lightweights, they have a heat scale next to the chili items. They can't make their food too hot  for me. Everything I've had here has been good. Service is usually good, but have had a couple of issues with the service in the past. I've been to the Chandler and Scottsdale locations.
