DO NOT EAT HERE!! The only reason I am giving one star is because I can't give 0. We recently moved to the area and wanted to find a good Mexican restaurant. When we first walked in I thought it might be decent. The special drink was a 24oz margarita for 9.99. The decor was colorful and festive but as we approached our seats I noticed that they were ripped and warn looking. My hubby and I ordered the special margaritas and a bowl of guacamole that was $7.00. We were served free chips, salsa and spicy bean dip. I wanted to order a chile Rellano but they are made with Hatch chiles and super hot so I went with the taco platter with shredded beef. My son ordered the chile verde and my husband ordered a ground beef chimichanga. Both my husbands and mine were super greasy. In fact I could squeeze the grease out of the taco. My sons chile verde was spicy but ok. A small portion made to look bit by sitting on top of green goo and pork fat. Basically we all hated this food. I have never given such a low rating before. To top it off our bill for 3 people was $79. That's dinner for 3 and 2 Margaritas. My son had water. I don't mind paying for good food but this is anything but. I will never ever ever set foot in this or another Arriba grill again. Do yourself a favor and go across the street to Rubio's where you will get much better quality good for a way better price. Oh and did I mention I hated this place??

On a side note the only bright part of this visit was the excellent service.
