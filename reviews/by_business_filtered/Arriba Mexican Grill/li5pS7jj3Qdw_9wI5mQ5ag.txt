We are new to the area and was looking for a place to watch the laker game and a local suggested arriba. The place itself is okay looking and the people who work there are really nice. They have flat screens on the walls in the bar area and a few smaller tv's so it was a cool place to watch the game. The food was really good, we got some cheese dip and guacamole dip also a plate of carne asada tacos which was yummy. My hubby even took a carne asada burrito to go. I'm giving it 4 stars because the strawberry virgin margarita i ordered didn't really take taste that good but overall it was a cool experience.
