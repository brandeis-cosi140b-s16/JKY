Horrible service. Horrible management. Bad experience overall. Started off with the server asking what we wanted to drink, interrupting us to lean over to his other table to ask if they wanted more beers. Came back with our drinks and slammed them on the table and walked away without a word. He took our order like he was in a rush and when he came with the food he again slammed our plates down and left without a word. He never checked on us and I had to get up and go to the bar to ask for more napkins. We asked for the check and after waiting a good amount of time the server came up to ask us at least twice what each of us had to eat then disappeared confused. He even went to the table next to us who had already paid and picked up their checks to look through it seeing if he gave them ours. He came by our table and grabbed my card off the table and disappeared to the back again for a good amount of time but this time with my card. The manager (who was handling another complaint right by our table) came to our table as we were leaving and asked how it was. We were vague in saying our service was horrible and he didn't pry any further and didn't say sorry or any words at all. Not talking seems to be a trend at this establishment. Bad experience to say the least.
