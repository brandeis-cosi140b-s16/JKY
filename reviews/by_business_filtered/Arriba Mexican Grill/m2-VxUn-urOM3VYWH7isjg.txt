The Good:  In the past, we have often enjoyed Arriba.  They offer good chips, excellent queso and always pleasant service. The real reason to choose Arriba however, was their terrific Tortilla Soup.  When in the mood for homey, satisfying soup, it was the place to go! By far and away, offering the best homemade Tortilla Soup in the entire Phoenix Valley.

The Bad:  On last visit, the price on a bowl of tortilla soup hadn't changed but, the portion certainly had!! When soup arrived we were in disbelief. Barely a large cup, much less than a "bowl" of soup.  I asked our attentive waitress what had happened to the size of their portion?  She could only nod her head in silent understanding. While Arriba's was always a little pricey for local Mexican food, it now appears, instead of raising their prices, they chose to cut back on portion size. Duping the customer into thinking nothing has changed, does not promote loyalty. I gave two stars because the recipes are still very good, but they have lost our loyal business, skimping on a $7.00 bowl of broth!
