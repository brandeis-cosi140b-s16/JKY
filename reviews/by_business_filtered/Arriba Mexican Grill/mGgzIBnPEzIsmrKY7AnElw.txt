Food was ok but at 5:00pm on a Friday night...it was empty!! Wow. It had been a long time since we visited Arriba's and thought we would have a wait - but wow were we surprised to see how empty it was. Something must be going on up there. The service was just ok though....don't think we'll go back there when there are so many other restaurants to choose from. :-(
