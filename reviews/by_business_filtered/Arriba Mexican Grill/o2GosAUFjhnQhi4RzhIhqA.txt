They have a daily special. We came on a Thursday and the special was a Chimichunga for 2.95. When the waitress asked if we wanted rice and beans and o yes how about guacamoli? Well the 2.95 special turned out to be 42.00 with tipfor 4 people. Granted we were remiss in not asking if the extras were included but in a mexican restaurant beans and rice always seemed to be included. Food was good but if you are on a tight budget beware of the daily specials.
