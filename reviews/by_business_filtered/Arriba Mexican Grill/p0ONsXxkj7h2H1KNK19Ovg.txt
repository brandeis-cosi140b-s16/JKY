EXTREMELY slow service here. Don't let empty tables fool you - they work at the pace of snails and will take their sweet time getting things out to you. They made the queso so wrong twice.. It was as runny as water. The server appeared to be very forgetful and not focused. She kept coming back to our table to ask questions about our orders which is odd because she wrote our meals down on the notepad so she shouldn't have second guessed herself. 
Also two of the servers thought that our table belonged to each other so we sat and waited to be greeted by our server for so long lol. 
Just don't go here!
