The meal starts with some really good chips served with a selection of 3 different salsas and a bean dip.  But, that's as impressive as it gets.  The main plates are more about quantity over quality and I felt like the prices were high compared to similar restaurants.  The service was fine, but I just wasn't taken with the food and probably won't be back.
