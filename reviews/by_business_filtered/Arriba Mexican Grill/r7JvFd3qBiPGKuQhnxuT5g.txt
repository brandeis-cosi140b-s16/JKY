I've been going to Arriba for years and never really had a bad experience.  It's my kid's favorite restaurant.  I went in on July 4th and half way through my meal I noticed a cockroach on my plate.  Laying right under my carnitas.  I was pretty close to tears in the restaurant.  I will never return to this location again. I may go to the Camelback location again after I get over the trauma.  But this was one of the worst experiences of my life.
