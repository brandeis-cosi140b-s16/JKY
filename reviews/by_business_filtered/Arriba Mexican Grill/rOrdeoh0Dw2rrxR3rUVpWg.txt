I have always heard of this place on tv. I was around the area and decided to check it out. Walking in was not to expectations. It's to dark, dungeony and it has a weird smell and very hot in here. The place highly needs some upgrades and natural light. I was by myself to I sat at the bar. Ordered house margarita... Prices are from $7-16.99 a drink depending on the ounces. The staff is nice but not friendly. The restaurant provides u with chips, salsa and spicy bean dip. I have ordered from the lunch menu and seems a little high priced for a lunch min. 7.99- 12.99 majority is $9.99
 a plate without an al carte option. I had gone to discount tires and obtained a 20% coupon for eating at arrivals since it's right next door.
