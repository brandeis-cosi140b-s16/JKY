I have some friends that ALWAYS go to Arriba and they always talk about it. I seriously don't know why! I now feel sorry for them because if this is what they think is good Mexican food they've got it all wrong!!!

My daughter had finished 2nd grade that day and I let her pick any place of her choice. Lo and behold she shouted: Arriba momma!!!! :S

Well, to Arriba we went myself and 4 kids.  I don't even want to tell you what we had but it was HORRIBLE!!! I'm actually embarrassed to say we went!!! Stay away from there!! We've been told that they have great margaritas but I don't know if I should believe that anymore. 

No more Arriba for us. I also think that it is overpriced!! Not worth to pay that much money for junk food...Go to Filiberto's and get rolled tacos... seriously!!!
