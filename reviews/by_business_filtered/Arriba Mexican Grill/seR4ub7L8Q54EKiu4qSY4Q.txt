The food was like.... Whoa!   
the Long Island Iced Tea is a little on the small side though. I would like to see a "fish bowl" size Long Island next time I go in. service was very good even as busy as it was on a Sunday. I had a GROUPON for it all too!!  for my first time is I would say I'm a fan!!!
