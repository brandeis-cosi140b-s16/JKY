Husband and I loved this place when we first moved here but the service, food, and cleanliness has completely declined. The hostess that seated us "Alex" was either having a really terrible day or just really hated us the minute she saw us. My husband is never one to complain so when he said to me that she was acting like a b**ch I was glad it wasn't just me. We walked in around 630 pm on a Tuesday and it wasn't even busy. At first no one was even at the front counter to greet people. Then when "Alex" did finally come she stared at us like we were an inconvenience for her and my husband said 2 please and her response was 10 mins is the wait. So my husband goes to the bathroom I sit down in the waiting area and she calls out not even a minute later our name and looks around like there is a ton of people waiting when I was the only one sitting there so I get up and say yep that's us and she tells me to follow her and then I get a command of "sit here" and then she walks away. The rest of the night she kept walking by us with this annoyed look on her face. I felt bad and angry because it was my husband's birthday and he was really looking forward to coming here. I guess we will have to take our business to the one in Goodyear and hope for better customer service.
