Not a great choice of mine.  We were up in Phoenix and needed to have a quick lunch and sort of was craving some Mexican.  The place was practically empty on a Wed. about noon time.  Maybe a clue.  At one time it was pretty popular place but seems to be going a bit downhill.  I had the fish taco lunch special.  Not so special at $7.99 but it seems now a days that is the way it goes.  I must say the fish (probably frozen) tasted fresh and grilled perfectly well.  It was large with two soft tortillas surrounding it.  Nice Baja sauce and lettuce, onions, and a tad of tomatoes.  Really pretty tasty.  I am a chip person and theirs was thin, crunchy and warm. Very nice. 
.  I like the warm bean dip.  The regular salsa was a bit sharp and just so so.  The young lady who served us was sweet and attentive.  There is a lot of competition for good quality food in town. The place seemed a bit run down.
