Ok, so I decided to go against the general consensus of bad yelp reviews and give this place a shot. Sometimes people just have an isolated bad experience, plus I'm always on the look out for good Mexican restaurants. Long story short, I was wrong. Like in most reviews, the food is lacking authenticity and flavor. I would have given only two stars, but the great service made it three. The problem is not the waiters, I was just disappointed in the food... It was "meh" just ok.. I think they could do a lot better.
