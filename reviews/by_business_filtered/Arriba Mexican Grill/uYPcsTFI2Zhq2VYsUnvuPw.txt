I feel like this is partially my fault for eating at a Mexican food place with a neon billboard in front. Someone told me it was good so I decided to go the margaritas were just right and the chips and dips were yummy. I ordered the floutas and yuck! The meat could not have been beef, I ate two bites and that was it. Our server asked if sour cream was okay said sure and then noticed a two dollar charge for a lump of sour cream on there. I really wish I would have just stuck with Ajo Als up the street.
