The 99 cent happy Hour margarita is what we thought it was, a flavorless beverage that tastes like a snow cone minus any flavor. They do give free chips and bean dip and salsa, nothing special in that world either. Also, how can you build a restaurant in Arizona and forget to put in an outside patio. Get ride of that dumb fountain and have some outside seating.
