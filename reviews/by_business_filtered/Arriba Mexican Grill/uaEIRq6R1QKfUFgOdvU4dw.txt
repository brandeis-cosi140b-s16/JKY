We love this place!!    We used to like to come in, when they offered up an all-you-can-eat (early-bird) dinner, that wasn't publicized, but we knew about it, and utilized it up to the last day of the program.  :)

They have THE BEST 99 cent margaritas ever!!  Plus, if you come in at a certain time, you can get appetizers for half-price.  A couple of chicken quesadillas, an order of guacamole, and 2 margaritas each, and we are out of there for under $19 - you can't beat that!!!  Plus really delicious chips and salsa, including a bean dip, that is pretty tasty!!

Ole!!
