I've been going there since it opened in the mid-90's and was called the Andale' restaurant. I think they changed the name because too many people made the same mistake my sister (who took 3 years of Spanish in high school and college) did: She asked why the hell anyone would call a Mexican restaurant the "Ann-Dayle". And so it goes.

I've enjoyed most of what I've had there. Not the place to go while on a diet. Everything tends to be cheese-heavy. Partially for that reason I would forgo the sour cream and guac that they offer, especially considering that they come at a total extra cost of something like $3.50 or whatever. Sometimes the wait staff tells you, other times not. Guess it depends if they've been threatened with tableware when an unsuspecting customer wonders how the bill for a table of four suddenly jumped by FIFTEEN DOLLARS for guac and sour cream.

It's an ok place with reliable quality and decent atmosphere. The chicken con queso is good, but I prefer the adobada plate.
