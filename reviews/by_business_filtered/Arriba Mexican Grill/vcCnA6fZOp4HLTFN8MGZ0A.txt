Calling this "Mexican" food anything above "average" would be generosity. I doubt there is anyone of even a small percentage of Latino/Hispanic descent back in the kitchen- you could get more authenticity at a Taco Bell. I got the white sands chimichanga.... Tastes like canned enchilada sauce on a soggy factory made tortilla with some mediocre meat in there somewhere, heated in a microwave. 

They boast "Hatch green chile" all over the menus, and claim to be the best New Mexican restaurant in Phoenix... Well my last name is literally Hatch, and I was born and raised in Las Cruces, New Mexico... And this place would not last a month anywhere in the state. 

Service was rough, I had to ask three times for an extra plate and some more napkins (waitress spilled salsa all over my lap), and my drink cup didn't get refilled once. Save yourself some time, money, and disappointment and go to the Costco food court down the street instead.
