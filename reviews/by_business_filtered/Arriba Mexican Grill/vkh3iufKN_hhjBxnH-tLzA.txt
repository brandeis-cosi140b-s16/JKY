I dig the food but not so much the prices. I really don't think you get what you pay for. I've been a lil dissappointed the last couple times I went, as the service was slow (which isn't necessarily the waiter/waitresses fault, could have been the kitchen) and my food wasn't exactly hot, but warm. The bean dip for the chips was cold and my food was mediocre.

I've only been to this location and another in Ahwatukee and I'd say I've had better experiences at the -Tukee location overall. 

When we arrived to our seat the table was dirty and we asked if we could be reseated somewhere else, but the lady advised us to take a seat as she came back with a rag and wiped it down while we were there, and pieces of lettuce fell in my lap. Thanks lady, wasn't really looking to save those for my granish on my 'future' meal, just saying. 

There isn't too many Mexican food places, on this side of town, so when you're looking for a sit down this is one of few options, but it's a toss up at this point if I'll stick around or opt out for a meal here again.
