My best friend and I love to go here for the happy hour $1 margaritas and talk about the week and enjoy an appetizer. All the food I've ordered has been so good! I've also gotten some party platters for family events and they did a great job. My only complaint is that sometimes the waiters forget about you and when ordering catering or food to go it takes longer than when you scheduled to pick it up so I'd recommend  asking for an earlier time like 30 minutes so you will get your food when you actually want / need it or just show up 30 minutes early to let them know you're waiting... you may have to remind them a couple times.
