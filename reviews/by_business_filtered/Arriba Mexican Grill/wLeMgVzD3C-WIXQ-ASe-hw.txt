Stopped in here to have some drinks so we could continue our shopping day. Got seated right away, but had to request the patio instead of being asked inside or outside. Once seated, we were waiting quite a bit for service. I get it, it happens sometimes so we just waited patiently. Finally got our beverages and hung out for quite a bit. The chips and salsa were great and they made our drinks as per requested. Not spectacular, but not awful. If you're looking for food here, try the "White Sands Chimi" OMG....so good!
