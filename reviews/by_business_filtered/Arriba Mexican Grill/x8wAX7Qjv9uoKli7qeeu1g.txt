Good Mexican food, but not great. We got there just in time to take advantage of the .99 margarita's, but the food wasn't anything super special. The salsa was knock your socks off hot, which kind of numbs your tastebuds to other flavors and everything was very peppery, which I'm not a huge fan of. I got the chicken tostada and the hubby got the chicken picado, which were both pretty good. The bean dip was awesome and the service was fantastic though.

I think we'll go back sometime to try out other dishes to try to get that rating up a bit. If you go for happy hour then the prices are very reasonable...
