It's sad to witness the demise of this formerly great Mexican restaurant.  We had stopped going to the Camelback location over a year ago, after the food quality took a nose dive, and we saw baited mouse traps in the dining room.  Thought we'd give it another try with family new to the Valley- this visit was the last nail in the coffin.  Bad service, waitress didn't know how to pre-bus our table when subsequent courses arrived- several un bussed tables sat for over an hour near us.  Not sure what happened to this chain, but it's really a shame- RIP Old Arriba.
