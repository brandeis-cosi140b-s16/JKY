went to the gilbertaz san tan cafe today with my 86 year old father  the hostess was so not wecoming and irritated when I first said patio seating then changed my mind for an indide booth thinking my father would be more comfotable   I think the San tan area on market place cafe needs more supervision and training  place not busy took over 1/2 hour for 2 fish lunches  the servers all seemed like if they smiled it would crack their face god forbid don't ask for ANYTHing extra such a s additional napkins or a little more lettice and onions etc  we just waited and waited paid the bill and left so many AWESOME places we could have gone to  very big dissapointment  especially  if you are driving and can't kill the time with a margarita!!!!!   simply does not resonate a happy place  done!!!!!!
