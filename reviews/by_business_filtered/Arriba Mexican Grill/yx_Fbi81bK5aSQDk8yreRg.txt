I have been running into this problem lately where restaurants have a choice between sauce with meat, and really spicy sauce.  This makes me sad because I am the most spice averse vegetarian you will ever meet.  

Arriba has a gigantic menu with lots of pictures of the food.  I found the menu hard to navigate, especially in terms of finding something vegetarian.  I wanted the enchiladas, but the sauce options changed my mind and I got the tamale which was very sub par.  Very bland and chewy.  

I suspect my experience wasn't the norm though, they seem like they would be a great place for someone who likes spicy meat.  Or cheap happy hour margaritas.
