I had no idea it was going to be so hot that I would not be able to taste anything for days after.  I am all for hot food, but this was NUTS!!  Was the joke on me?  who knows, but I will probably NEVER eat at this place again based on how hot the food was.  

I had the Green Chili burrito and could taste nothing but unbelievable HEAT.
