Been a while since we have eaten here.
Steak Fajitas not worth $15.49...served luke warm, over cooked  charged for extra tortillas and a few slices of jalapenos...sever Joaquin, ignored us for 15 mins when we arrived and was less than friendly or attentive...won't be back...
too bad Arribas use to be much much better...
