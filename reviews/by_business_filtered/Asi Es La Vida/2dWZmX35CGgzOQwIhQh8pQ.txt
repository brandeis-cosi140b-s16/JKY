This place is pretty decent.  A nice change of pace from the normal mexican restaurant.  The dishes have tons of flavor.  The appetizers are not really worth the money though.  The guacamole was only so-so.  They do have nice flavorful specialty fruit drinks -- definitely order one of these.

I don't know how this place stays open though, we were the only ones in there at lunch.
