I love this place so much.  What the hell is going on.  Sign did change for a hot minute this year.  But now the sign is back to Asi Es La Vida and the doors are chained and the phone number doesn't work.

WTF???  my favorite restaurant.  Please someone tell me they're remodeling and not closed.  

WHAT'S THE SCOOP!?!?!?!?
