That's life.  I really dug this place.  It was different.  Upscale, but not fancy.  Great Mexican food without a single taco or burrito.  Apparently, it's more like the cuisine of Mexico City, instead of the the Sonoran Mexican food we typically eat... but what do I know?

The defining feature of this place is blindingly pink building in a not-so-great neighborhood.  (It's not a bad neighborhood, but it's a contrast from the luxuries just a few miles North on Camelback.)  Inside, the place feels like a collection of narrow, cozy hallways, and the place settings at the tables are elaborate.

We started with a margarita and a fresh watermelon juice.  The margarita was a little too strong, but the watermelon juice was refreshing.  We started with guacamole.  I heard it was made table-side, but I got duped on that one.  The chips were very thick, like tostadas.  The guacamole, salsa, and pico were all good, but not special.  Next, we had a shrimp appetizer, served over a crepe.  The cream sauce was unexpectedly amazing!  I was trying to sop up the remains with tortilla chips.  It was foreshadowing of things to come... this place knows its sauces.

For the entree, we split a steak dish.  The steak was pounded thin, marinated, and grilled.  It was tender and delicious, but the sides were the stars.  There was a folded chicken enchilada in a mole sauce that was out of this world!  The rice, and the bean-stuffed pepper were also nice accompaniments.  (Next time, I think I'll just order the mole.)

We also had dessert, another crepe filled with ice cream and topped with a tequila carmel sauce.  The sauce was delicious.  Unfortunately, the cold ice cream made the crepe a little gummy and hard to eat.

The waiter was friendly and attentive.  The prices of everything except the entrees were very reasonable.  (The entrees are a little on the high side.)  If you want a different, upscale Mexican experience, this is the place for you.  Great date spot,too.
