So I have lived in Phoenix for over 8 years, and several weeks ago, I finally went to Mexico for the first time, and actually tasted real Mexican food...so I now have a real taste for more AUTHENTIC Mexican food, so for 8 years I have driven by this building and this restaurant and wondered what was this two story building all about, since it is right on a corner of two streets you could never really see if it was busy or not, or see people going in or out of it, so finally me and a girlfriend went in to explore it. All I can say this is the most authentic Mexican food I have found in Phoenix and was very glad to have found it. The service was top notch, the waiter was very informative, and the ambiance was spectacular, the restaurant is set up with some very original decor.  I am the type of person that really likes peace and quiet and seclusion when I go out to eat, I enjoy dark lit venues, where I can enjoy private conversations with myself and my friends and at this place we were the only patrons the whole time we were there, and it was very peaceful. The waiter informed me that they have a guitar player that plays classical Mexican music, so I will be sure to go back there very soon to enjoy this. The food was terrific I had the soup which was delicious and a chicken Torta which was amazing, it was less then $40.00 for both of to enjoy our lunch and for this atmosphere with this food it was worth every penny. This place is now one of my all time favorite hideaways!!! Love it!!!
