This is my first YELP review, but I felt motivated to do it for this place. WOW! The very best mole I've ever had. And the fish dish (pescado a la versceruzana) was outstanding. This just wasn't the best Mexican food I've had in a while, but the best meal I've had in quite some time. Don't miss it! The atmosphere is great, staff very friendly and even a wonderful guitar player.
