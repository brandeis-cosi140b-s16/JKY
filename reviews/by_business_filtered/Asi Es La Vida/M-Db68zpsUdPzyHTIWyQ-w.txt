I really like this place.  The atmosphere is authentic and so nicely dark in the summer.  They keep the place as dark as possible which is so comforting to us Phoenicians.  I liked the chips but didn't love them.  They are the thick kind that is almost a Mexican version of a cracker.  The sauces were excellent.

I  had chicken enchiladas and they were very good.  Again the sauces were fresh and homemade.  The beans were excellent as well.  Even the rice was different than what I have found in other Mexican restaurants.  It was white instead of yellow rice with vegetables as an accent.

I would definitely go back when in the area.
