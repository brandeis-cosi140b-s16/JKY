They re-opened!  I'm a very happy foodie right now.  Went for lunch today and it was as good as I've come to expect.  I got the special, which was sea bass.  Unbelievable.  

I usually get the specials and have never been disappointed.  Don't forget the guac & chips to start off.  They aren't complimentary, but well worth the price.  

All of their natural juice beverages are the best I've ever had.  My favorite is the watermelon.  Yes, I order watermelon juice at lunch!  Crazy no?

The mariachi that's normally playing lunch wasn't there today, but I'm okay with that.  Just happy they're open again.    The service is amazing.  Very personal, prompt, and inviting.
