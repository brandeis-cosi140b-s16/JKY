Went for lunch.  Atmosphere is pretty nice, but I'm a fan of food, not mood lighting.  The food was decent, but the servings were smaller than I expected for the price.  For lunch, I ended up parting with about $16, which is pricey for a midday meal.  Otherwise, service was good, and I'd probably go back on a date.
