Well, I finally made it to Asi Es La Vida. It's kind of sad how long this place as been on my "to-try" list. 

First, I love the quirkiness of this place. Being an eccentric individual myself, I felt right at home. Why aren't more places in Phoenix painted in bright, happy colors. This is the hot-ass desert, we don't need more brown. 

Second, my server obviously had a passion for the food. I mean, he was excited about it. He made me want to eat it. I was like, you know the joys of a good foodgasm, don't you? You and your suggestions can be trusted. 

Don't you hate it when you ask a server for their opinion and they have none. Wtf is up with that? Just make it up for god's sake. That's better than a shoulder shrug. You will find no shoulder shrugs at Asi Es La Vida. 

Lastly, the mole. I love mole. There are very few places to get mole in Phoenix. I don't understand why, because it is literally heaven for your mouth. Asi Es La Vida's mole is on the sweeter side, which is fine with me, because I like all kinds of mole. Yes, there are different kinds. And, like I said, yes to all of them. 

Ok, I'm not done. I have one small gripe. A teeny-tiny thing that won't keep me from coming back, but damn was it a bad choice. It has to do with the fabric covering the booth seats. It's corduroy. Freaking corduroy?! Have you ever tried slipping gracefully into a booth covered in that stuff? Well, I have now. It isn't easy or comfortable. All of your fabric is catching on all of the booth's fabric and it's just a mess. I had to adjust myself so many times it looked like I had hemorrhoids. No, no, my butt is fine, it's just this damn corduroy!
