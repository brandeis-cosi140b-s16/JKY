Tried Asi Es La Vida for lunch today for the first time, and was not disappointed.  

I can't wait to go back for a "nice" dinner... the vibe in this place is great, very colorful and cozy.  I don't really get a cheap feel at all, although I suppose the place could be considered slightly confused.  

I got the enchilada lunch special, which was surprisingly good.  It didn't come with the same nasty red sauce you get on enchiladas elsewhere, and it definitely had a unique flavor.

The best, however, was their cilantro soup.  Amazing!  I am definitely going to attempt recreating this at home, but I suspect I will be back to buy some more next week.

If this place is in fact BYOB, sign me up!
