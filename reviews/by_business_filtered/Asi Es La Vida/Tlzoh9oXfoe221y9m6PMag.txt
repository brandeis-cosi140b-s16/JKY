Do not let the flourescent pink facade scare you! This is arguably the very best authentic Mexican cuisine experience you will ever have the privilege to experience in Phoenix. I grew up here, born and raised here in the valley .... I now live in another valley... Of the silicon type and I can assure you we have nothing like this that even comes close anywhere in California! I've been all over the planet for work and pleasure. These guys do the real deal! And... The best part is that while it's easily 5 star food, it's totally affordable... We ordered 4 margaritas, a great shrimp dish to share, table side made guacamole and with tip it was $55 out the door! All ingredients are ultra fresh and home made! Including the simple syrup in the margarita!  An amazing destination restaraunt for date nights, etc. highly recommend!
