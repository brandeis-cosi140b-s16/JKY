Wow great restaurant and food 
I'm really impressed that this place doesn't have more than 300 reviews !! Really good seafood special that my wife had and I had a steak with some tortillas with mole on top. We had some appetizers before and two entree after and every single bit was really really good! I can't forget about there margaritas and tequila selection! I think I order a Cadillac margarita and it was made with fresh lime juice Don Julio and Agave with Grand Marnier float outstanding!!!
