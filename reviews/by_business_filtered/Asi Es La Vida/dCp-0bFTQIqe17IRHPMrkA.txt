WOW!!! I was totally shocked on how good everything was here, from beginning to end. I accidentally missed the street I was supposed to turn on and ended up driving by here the other morning taking my sister to work. I saw it and told her I have been wanting to try it thanks to Jason C. 

This place was amazingly empty there was 2 other men in here just finishing their meal. The awesome waitress was polite as could be, no fake Hi! How are you BS here. She brought us our menu's told us the specials and put napkins in our laps for us. We had some agua I have not had cantelope fresca since I was a little girl. It was even better when I got to taste it like a bit of heaven in my mouth. I seriously love that shit! Do you remember the food critic on Ratatouille when he takes a bite of the stuff and is off remembering his mother, that is exactly how I felt. It was that fucking good and the goodness did not stop here my friends.

We had the guaca-liscous dip, it was frign good with the sea salt and the 3 salsa's were so refreshingly spicy. We were getting full just from the chips but couldnt stop eating  the stuff, it was too good. 

Next came the tortilla soup it was very good the chips were crunchy they were real chips not something from a bag. The cheese was tasty it could have used some spice and maybe some lime and crema, but I did not care one bit it was still very good just like that I ate it all. 

The food came out shortly, we did not have any waiting time that we had noticed while being serenaded by the senor playing the guitar in the corner the whole time. The main dishes were way good as well. Beware the green enchiladas they are def not for sissy's. Bite after bite our palates were overly pleased. Can you say YUM-GASM?!?! I can, too bad all good things must come to an end and we could not stay here forever. Porque Asi Es La Vida!!
