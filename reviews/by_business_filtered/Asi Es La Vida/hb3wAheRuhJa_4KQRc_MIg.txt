One of my favorite places in the Valley! My ex-boyfriend and I used to come here for lunch and dinner all the time! Great memories! The atmosphere is casual but intimate and cozy. 

The aguas frescas are delish! I usually get sandia (watermelon) so yummy! Guacamole and salsas are to die for but what really keeps me coming back are the Enmoladas, Enchiladas Verdes and the Cecina and Milanesa Tortas! So amazing!!

Try the sangria - they put an incredible amount of fresh lime juice at the bottom of the glass! I absolutely love it!!
