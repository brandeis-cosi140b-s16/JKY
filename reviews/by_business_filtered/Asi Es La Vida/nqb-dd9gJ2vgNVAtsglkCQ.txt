So the update is, dinner is even more amazing than lunch.  And then we went back again for lunch, and it was even more amazing than dinner.  The service is purely unbeatable, and the food is right up there with the service.  At this point, I would just get the chef special or whatever the waitress recommends, because I've never been let down.  And definitely get the pineapple juice.  All you can drink for $2.50, fresh and delicious.  And the guacamole?  I'll let you try that for yourself, let's just say it might be better than my own.
