Came here on a recommendation from a friend. Never would have come in otherwise - if you're put off by the exterior as I was don't be! EXCELLENT service,  and the food was wonderful!  Get the cilantro de crema soup to start. You won't be disappointed. It was pure comfort in a bowl. Our server said they are famous for their award winning mole. It was delicious. Many levels of flavor to savor. This would be a nice date place, upscale dining with live music on certain nights.
