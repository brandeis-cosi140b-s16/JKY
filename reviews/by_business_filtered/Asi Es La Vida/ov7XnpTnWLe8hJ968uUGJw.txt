Excellent food. The appetizers were delicious. The margaritas were very good...very smooth, not made too strong. My entree was the Chilean sea bass. The sauce was the most amazing mixture of cream, chipotle, and wine. My husband ordered the filet and was blown away how tender the steak was. After dinner, the waiter arrived with a slice of cake for my birthday. I had never had Tres Leches cake before this moment and it is my new favorite dessert. The restaurant had a singer performing in the dining room. He played guitar and sang beautifully. This was a wonderful dining experience.
