You know,  there are a great deal of Mexican restaurants here in the Phoenix area to choose from, but I think this place is worth a try for anyone looking for some quality Mexican grub! Excellent ambience and there are different daily specials that might not be on the menu as well. Make sure to ask your server for any of those specials. Friendly staff make this place a great place to visit time and again. The chips are only okay but the three styles of salsa that they provide are amazing! We tried a couple of the desserts and really enjoyed the Tres Leches cake and the chocolate flan!
