I sometimes feel like 3 stars is a little deceiving. This place was good, I don't really have any complaints at all, but was it memorable, great, and would I really have an urge to go back, not necessarily. It was definitely more fancy than I was expecting given the other reviews. They try to make it have an upscale, date-night kind of feel, and that's cool, especially if you take advantage of the BYOBooze, w/out a fee. Something I was not aware of, but wish I was! The fresh guac that is offered is not complimentary, but it is good and well worth it. 

The menu is not chalk full of the usual enchiladas, chimi's, etc, but some fancier (maybe more traditional) Mexican entrees. I had a sirloin that was stuffed with three different cheeses, spinach, bacon, and covered in a tomato based sauce of some sort. I was a little disappointed in the lack of rich complex flavors given the players of ingredients, but again, it wasn't bad by any means. My gf had some vegetable type enchiladas that she said were very good, but we both had the same conclusion. It was good, nothing to complain about, but nothing great either.
