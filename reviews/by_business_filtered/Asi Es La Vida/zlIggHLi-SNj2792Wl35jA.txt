Cute restaurant.  The guacamole is good and freshly made but not the most flavorful, it was missing some more lime or some chili or something.  I felt the same way about all their food, good, but missing just a little extra oomph.  Items are not smothered in cheese which made me super happy.  Not your typical Mexican food, the food was lighter and I was happy to note that it wasn't overly salted.  I will still be back to try it again, but it'll have to be a day were I want some subdued flavors.  Think of it is the yin to Los Dos Molina's yang.
