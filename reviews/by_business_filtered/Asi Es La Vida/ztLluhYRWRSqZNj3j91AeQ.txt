Don't let the cliche, vivid exterior fool you into thinking this is just like the other "Mexican" food places. The food and drinks are far from basic on the delicious scale. If you're searching for true authentic Mexican food this is the place to try. For a second I thought I was having grandmas secret Chicken Mole recipe, which is what I would recommend!  P.S This cozy and intimate place also host live music on the weekends.
