Met my parents here for an early dinner on a Saturday.  Cute place, quick service.
We enjoyed the 2 types of salsa.  The first is a very chunky mild tomato salsa and the other is smoother by spicier.   We all enjoyed to charro beans but mixed opinions on the fide.  The burros and chimis were well portioned meat to tortilla ratio.

My only complaint is how the street tacos were served- covered in cabbage to the extent that I could not identify which taco was which.  Very difficult to eat and enjoy. 

Will be back to try some margaritas!
