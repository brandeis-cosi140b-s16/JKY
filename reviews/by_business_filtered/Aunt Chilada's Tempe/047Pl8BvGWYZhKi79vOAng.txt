To start off our evening the chips and salsa weren't very good; salsa had no spice at all.  I ordered the Ocho (#8), which was a chile relleno and a spinach enchilada with a jalape√±o cream cheese sauce. The chile relleno was pretty good while the spinach enchilada was a little crispy and the spinach almost seemed partially frozen. The rice and beans were alright at best with the beans lacking much flavor. The Staff was friendly and service was pretty quick. We were surprised to have to wait 30 min to be seated at 8pm on a Wednesday night.
