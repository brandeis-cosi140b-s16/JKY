I dont want to give Auntie even a one star.. On a beautiful Saturday, my date wanted to go sit and have something to drink & app on.. We ended up at one of his fav happy hour places.. We opted to sit at the bar outside.. All the tables were reserved for a shower. Every time we were spoken to.. bc no one manned the bar.. it was rudely. We got a cerveza and a marg.. at least those you cant really fail on. The salsa was horrid...& I usually love the Aunts salsa.. we ordered sopapillas.. asked to have them first.. Umm guess not.. THEY never arrived.. Our water ran empty.. our chips and not-so-much salsa ran out... THE end was when our nachos.. had a hair on top.. we told the curt waitress.. & she rolled her eyes and said sorry.. We never saw her again.. THE thing is.. I usually LOVE this place for it's patio and good food , but tonight .. .. I DONT think SO!
