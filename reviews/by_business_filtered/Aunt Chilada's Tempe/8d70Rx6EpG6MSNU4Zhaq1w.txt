I've been here many times. Mostly with business associates. 
The food is good but average for an Americanized Mexican Food place. I've never had anything bad here. Every, but it's not worth the drive from my home. 
If your close by, it is better than other places nearby. You do get plenty of food for the money and it is satisfying.
