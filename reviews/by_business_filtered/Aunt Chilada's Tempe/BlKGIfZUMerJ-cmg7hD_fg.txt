I'm a sucker for a nice patio.

Went here for a work happy hour - it's been a LOT of years since I was at this location. It's similar to the one at Squaw Peak - but not quite as much charm. (Likely due to lack of age of the building.)

Service was solid, food was acceptable gringo-Mex, and the people with mixed drinks seemed to like them. (As long as the Negro Modelo is cold and the glass around the lip of the bottle isn't chipped, it's on par with every other one I've ever had, so I really can't judge the drinks.)

I would never choose this place based on food alone - but when you have a group and the weather is patio-rific, if's not a bad choice at all!
