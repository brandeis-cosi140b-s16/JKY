This was our first meal when we arrived in the Phoenix area. The food was decent and the margaritas were pretty awesome. We sat on the patio on a beautiful day so we will be back for that alone. The service was good, but a little slow so I wouldn't want to dine here is I was in a hurry.
My chili rellano was awesome, but my daughter was not crazy about the shredded beef enchiladas. We also ordered the bean dip, which was a little cold but decent. All in all an ok meal.
