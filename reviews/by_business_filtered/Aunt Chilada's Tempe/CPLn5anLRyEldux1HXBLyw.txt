As far as Mexican food goes, this wasn't the best that I have ever had.  However if you work in the area, it is a good destination for clients or family that are in town shopping at Mill, this should be a viable option.  The food is what I would classify as MexiCali.  Definitely not the home raised Mexican food from Tucson.  Give it a shot, Yelp me back and tell me how it was.
