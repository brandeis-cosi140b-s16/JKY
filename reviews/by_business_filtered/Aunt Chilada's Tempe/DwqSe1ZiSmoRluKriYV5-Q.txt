Best service by EVERYONE (hostesses, bartender, and server)! This is refreshing. The people eating here are even awesome! Best energy and vibe I have had in a long time. Gloria is an amazing server! Lover her! Food a little dry but honestly don't care - that's how welcoming and great these people are....I can deal with a Lil dryness in the food....just not In The people :)

Will be back.
