My friend suggested we celebrate my friend's birthday here.  What a mistake.  The table was akward for 8 people to see each other but hey, we didn't make a reservation.
The sad part is that two of us ordered the fajitas (including the birthday gal).  The food arrived and sat next tto our table for well over 5-minutes.  By the time the waitress came to serve our food, it was cold (although we commented on how when the fajitas had first arrived they were not making a sizzling sound).  
The waitress appeared upset that we were wanting our food at least worm vs. cold.  She took it to the kitchen and brough back fajitas that had been stuck in the over.  Food was HOT but now way overcooked. 
I wont' be returning  to this place anytime soon -- with some many other great choices, i'm sorry my friedn chose this restaurant.
