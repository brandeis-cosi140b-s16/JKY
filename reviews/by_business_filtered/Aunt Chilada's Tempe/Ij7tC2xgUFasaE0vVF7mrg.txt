Aunt Chilada's is a pretty solid Mexican option, their food is good (though not knock-your-socks-off Mexican), the venue is really cool, and the margaritas are tasty. 

The food may be priced a bit above your average Mexican restaurant, but they offer some of the more rare Mexican dishes such as fideo, and their portions are more than generous. 

The venue stretches over 3 or 4 buildings all connected by a central patio with plenty of seating, greenery, and twinkly lights for evening dining. 

The house margarita is a step above the standard, and the staff is very friendly. 

I am holding my rehearsal dinner here this spring, so look for an updated review with information about hosting events!
