Wow, this place is just not good.  Went there for lunch and first off the chips and salsa were terrible. The salsa tasted worse than pace from a grocery store jar. Then came my "taco salad".  I asked if instead of meat I could have refried beans. Okay, so my $13 "taco salad" consisted of a shell with iceburg lettuce and a ladel full of refried beans on the top. That's it. Yeah. That's it.  Oh, I did get some sour cream and guac on the side of the plate, but no tomtatoes in the salad, not even a little onion or garnish or anything. Just iceberg lettuce and refried beans poured on top. It was gross!!  And it was $13 dollars!!  Give me a break.

My husband ordered a black bean chimichanga. The beans were soggy and refried style black beans, no flavor or spice, totally boring. The food was seriously terrible and ridiculously expensive. We spent over $30 on that crappy crap of a terrible lunch and will never go back there.
