What a joke. Just moved to the area and decided to stop here. My husband and I were seated all the way in the back right by the kitchen. Wouldn't have been a problem if they were busy, but they were not. In my opinion that is the worst spot in any restaurant. We weren't even given a view of the fountains that are outside.. Lighting was so dim I could barley see my menu (I'm in my 20's btw...) so we had to move. Our server (Lupe) was on the border of being disrespectful. She has no personality, disappeared for periods of time, didn't fill up my soda, etc. Food was okay but overpriced. When paying for our bill our server NEVER told us that their credit card machines were down. Instead she took our credit card number down manually with the machine. Might have been okay with that if she had of taken two seconds to tell us that was the way they were going to have to do it. I'm not okay with a server being able to copy down my credit card info. Ripped it up and paid cash. Once again zero personality from our server. I wouldn't ever go here again nor recommend that anyone does.
