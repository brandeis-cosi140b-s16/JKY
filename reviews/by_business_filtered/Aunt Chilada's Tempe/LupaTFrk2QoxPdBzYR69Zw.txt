We came here last night for dinner. It had been a very long time since I had been here before. A few months ago we went to the one at Dreamy Draw in Phoenix. I do not think they are connected anymore.
 lots of parking in the lot. I guess they do not have the great happy hour deals the other one does. We were seated right away, but had to wait a bit for a server. Even though there was only 2 other tables in there at the time.
 Anyway our server was nice. She refilled our drinks at just the right time, in fact gave us fresh glasses each time. 
 Our food was good though not very spicy. It was very average Mexican food. I have to say I like Macayo's much better.
We were given chips and Salsa, the chips were nice, warm and fresh, but the salsa was chunky and again not very spicy. 
 I think they cater more to the Hotel patrons now.  It is decorated very generic,like a quick salp of paint and some cheap artwork. I remember it much different the last time I was here.
All in all it was good ,just not great. I do not think we will be back soon.
