If this is the best Mexican in Phoenix (per the Arizona Grand resort), then I think Phoenix has a serious problem. Holy crap was that some greasy, bland mexican food.  Taco bell kicks the hell out of this place. Ceviche was inedible - pretty sure it was days old. Meat in fajitas must have been dredged in flour and totally overcooked. Everything was bland, and just BAD.
