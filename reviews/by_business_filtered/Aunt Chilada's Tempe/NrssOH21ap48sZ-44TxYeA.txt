It's been a long time since I've eaten at Aunt Chilada's. I get out to the east side very infrequently, but we were in the area and decided to stop in for lunch. I liked the pond with the ducks out front. When we first walked in, I was hit with the smell of toilet water, like the floors had been mopped with dirty water. Not very appetizing. Fortunately the hostess walked us out across the patio to a different building. It smelled more like food over there so that was a good sign.
After we were seated, we waited for quite some time before anyone came to greet us, take our drink order, or bring chips & salsa. We were actually contemplating leaving right before our server walked by and said she'd be right with us. When she came to get our drink order, we also ordered our food since we'd had plenty of time to decide. I went with the chicken enchilada, black beans, and rice. The bowl of chips and bowl of salsa were huge. That was different. The first couple of chips I had were underwhelming because they were cold, but then I got to some warm chips that tasted much fresher. It's a very noticeable difference.
The food came out rather quickly, which was surprising considering how long it took to be acknowledged in the beginning. I enjoyed the rice & black beans. The chicken in my enchilada reminded me of canned chicken. It really didn't have a lot of flavor. The enchilada relied on the red sauce for taste and I wasn't very impressed. Also our last water refills tasted odd, like it shared a spout with some variety of lemonade that got mixed in with the water. Not good. But I'm glad I had a chance to remind myself what Aunt Chilada's food is like. I see no need to drive out to the east valley to eat here again.
