Tried out the happy hour at about 4pm on a weekday and place was empty. The bar is small inside and there is no bar outside. They have decent drink prices as I scored a domestic draft for 2 bucks. They have a bunch of food choices as well for between $3 and $5 depending on the time. It was a bit of surprise that they do not offer white meat chicken for the tacos, only mixed. That tells me that this place is saving money and I'm not buying the bartenders "it keeps it moist excuse" Menu prices are right out of Scottsdale, but the free chips and salsa were good. Chips were kinda warm and salsa was chunky variety with some onions floating in the bowl. Too small of a bar area for a good happy hour crowd, so this place won't need to be revisited.
