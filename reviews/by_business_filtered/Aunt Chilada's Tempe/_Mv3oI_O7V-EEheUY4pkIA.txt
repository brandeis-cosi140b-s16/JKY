Food and service good but VERY pricey especially for lunch. A simple cheese quesadilla was 7.50 and to top it a small scoop of sour cream in a little taco shell was an additional 2.50!  Probably wont go there again too expensive when you can go to others for much larger portions and free side of sour cream.
