I do not feel like this place is worth a stop for dinner if you like good food.  It is over-priced for food that is so ordinary and un-Mexican tasting to me.  The salsa was ok and I Iiked the the rice and beans.  The chicken in my burrito wasn't good and didn't like the texture or the way it was cooked. It was pretty much flavorless. The food is very ordinary.  

For 4 adults and 2 little kids at dinner it was $77 with tip and we only had tea and water. I would have enjoyed the flavors of the food at Qdoba or Chipotle better and it would've cost less.

It's a neat building and I enjoyed sitting outside in the evening. I guess we pay a premium for that.
The service we had was good, and I can tell the wait staff works hard to serve. I seem to remember that 10-15 years ago the food was much better. 

I would not recommend Aunt Chilada's to someone that wants good Mexican food.
I don't need to go back.
