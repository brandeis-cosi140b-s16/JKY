Large portions so you might consider sharing a meal. We received a complimentary cheese crisp from our hotel. It was delicious but huge for just 2 of us. I had the fish tacos, black beans and fideo. I make my own fideo at home and this was equally as good. My husband ordered the crane asana street tacos and said the meat was great but could only eat 2/3.  I would definitely return when I'm hungrier.
