I don't know where to begin! Way Over priced for the quality of food! We decided to give this place a shot since we are staying at the Resort and didn't want to go too far tonight since we had a long day! I wish we had! The food is Terrible!!!! I I ordered pollo fundido and it had no flavor ! Boiled chicken breast covered in a cream sauce with cheese. I picked steamed veggies and black beans! The provided refried black beans when I was hoping for whole and the veggies were over cooked and bland! Salsa is not good at all and tortillas were not fresh! 

My husbands carne Asada was horrible as well!  Do not bother!!!
