My husband and I had our first date here together. For our 1 year anniversary we came back and we couldn't help but brag a little to our waiter. She thought it was so cool that she brought out a little chocolate cake for us, free of charge. It was a huge serving and very tender and smooth. 

This would be good for a wedding reception as their banquet room next to the restaurant is huge. They skimped big time on the bar. It's a sad little nook to the side, hardly elbow room at the puny stool table. 

And oh yeah - the food is kinda bland here. Just your average Mexican restaurant that seems to thrive only on account of it being off the I-10.
