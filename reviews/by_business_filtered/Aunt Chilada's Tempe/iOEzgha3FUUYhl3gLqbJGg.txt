I've been here several times, but most recently I went there with a girl friend who was visiting from Vegas.  We decided to stop in real quick and enjoy the happy hour specials.  The specials were fantastic, probably one of the best happy hours, but besides the pricing, the food and house margaritas were delicious.  The service was great (we had bartender Ben who was awesome).  We even met local Charlie who let us try one of his special flour tortilla chips that we were curious about;  which were great.  If you're an enchilada fan, I would suggest getting one chicken and one cheese and mixing them.  We found the combination to be great together.  The cheese crisp and fideo are always a favorite too.  I find the 'water park' as mentioned by another Yelper and the patio to give this restaurant it's charm.  If it wasn't summer, I'm sure we would have been out on the patio.
