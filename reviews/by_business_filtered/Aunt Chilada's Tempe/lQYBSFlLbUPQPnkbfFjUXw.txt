I live in the neighborhood, so Aunt Chilada's is always a convenient option for Mexican. The hardest part is getting past the name, which sounds about as authentic as Taco Bell.

My wife and I stopped in on a Monday night, and the place was packed with people from far-off places like Buffalo, New York. I can't imagine these gringos know much about the great Mexican food here in Phoenix, so Aunt Chilada's is a passable ambassador, especially for the spice-averse.

We opted for immediate seating at the bar and dove into the chips and salsa, which really can hold their own alongside the best in Phoenix. Couldn't order guacamole without tomatoes (my wife is allergic), but the fresh Dos Equis Lager drafts made up for it.

I got the pollo fundido, grilled chicken smothered in cheese and cream sauce. Other restaurants add some spice to their fundido, but I had to make do with a single smoked jalapeño served on top. While the sides of noodles and black beans were piping hot, the entrée was approaching lukewarm, and the accompanying tortillas barely held together. Still, I was craving something along the lines of Macayo's Baja Burro, so I enjoyed the fundido in spite of the temperature issues.

The bartenders were friendly enough, but the place lacks the upbeat vibe of a place like Macayo's. Chalk it up to the average age of the patrons or the awkward parking situation.

I live close enough to this Aunt Chilada's that I'm sure I'll be back. Next time, I hope it's just for drinks and chips. If I have to eat dinner, though, it's definitely not the worst.
