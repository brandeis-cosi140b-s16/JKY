My wife and I held a rehearsal dinner followed by a meet-and-greet here for a 220 person wedding in March, 2015.  The rehearsal dinner was about 50 people, and we were seated in and around one of the large function casitas.  The meet and greet was open to all wedding guests, and saw at least 150 people come through.  

The staff at AC's were very helpful planning the event, and ensured that we selected the right amount of food and appropriate bar structure for our needs.  The rehearsal dinner was perfect, and the food was pretty good.  The meet and greet proved to be a huge success, and AC's agreed to stay open another hour so the party could continue.  

We were impressed with the service, attentiveness of the staff, quality of large scale food, and atmosphere AC's achieved with our large group.  Great for a big party.
