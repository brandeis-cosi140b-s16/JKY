The server was great and the drinks were good. I had a mojito and house margarita. Being a pescatarian it's always a challenge eating out especially for mexican food. I called ahead and they do use lard in their refried beans and chicken stock in their rice for any vegans, vegetarians or pescatarians out there. I ordered the fish tacos and they were some of the worst fish tacos I've ever had!! They were way too fishy and had no other flavor. I had to add salsa and lemon to make them edible. My friend had the swordfish tacos and those looked and tasted way better except they had a bit too much pepper. If I go back I will order those. The black beans were pretty good.
