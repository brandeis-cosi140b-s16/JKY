I really like this place. One of the better Mexican restaurants in the valley. They have great food and their prices weren't outrageous. I sat outside right by a heater... it was heaven. The service was good. Our food was brought out to us right away, but the waiter neglected to notice our empty drink cups. I understand it was busy, and he looked like he was the only one outside at the time, but we were thirsty! All in all, I was satisfied. After we eat there, we usually go and sit up on South Mountain and watch the city lights and walk off the food, lol.
