I've eaten at this restaurant several years ago and thoroughly enjoyed it, so I was quite disappointed in the drink (don't think it had a drop of the patron in it) and the food as it was fairly bland.  The waitress was rushing us out so much as to picking up our chips and salsa and almost our unfinished drink glasses while we are still sitting at the table.  I can honestly say it will be a long time before I consider this restaurant any time soon.
