Couldn't decide where to eat.   Must eat.  Driving in circles.  Must eat.  Want to run over the first a-hole that comes between me and food.

Found this place by mistake.  Family was too hungry to be picky and could not take the 2 seconds to look it up on Yelp.  So we went off the grid.

The service was friendly and attentive.  At one point, they made a mistake and brought our table a second beer.  Which they gave to us, for making the mistake.  Don't get me wrong, I was going to give them a good review anyway, the free beer was just icing on the cake.

The food was very fresh.  Right down to the chips and salsa.  I certainly think that it could  have used more heat, but I feel the same way about water.  I was craving some Chile Verde, so went with the pork.  Not what I had expected.  I was thinking pork marinaded in green sauce.  It was grilled pork fillets that were seasoned to perfection.  It was outstanding.

The Fajita plate had a little more heat, not nearly enough for me, but plenty for my wife.  

Kids had quasadilla and were treated like kings.

I highly recommend this place.  Great atmosphere, great food and most importantly a moat around the front.
