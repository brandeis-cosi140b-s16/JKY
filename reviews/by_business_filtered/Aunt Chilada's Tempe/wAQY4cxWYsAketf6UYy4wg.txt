It has been awhile since I have been to Aunt Chiladas....and what a disappointment!  Went with a large group, we had horible service.  We were not brought refills, the food came very slowly.  We had to go track down our server and a manager to request service.   Seems like since they were getting an automatic 20% tip because we were a large group she must have gone on break or something.  

Food was very greasy, had oil ladden calabasita and a shredded beaf greasy taco.   

The group I was with was a lot of fun....but the food was not good, and teh service horrible.  Next time the group meets it will not be at this place.
