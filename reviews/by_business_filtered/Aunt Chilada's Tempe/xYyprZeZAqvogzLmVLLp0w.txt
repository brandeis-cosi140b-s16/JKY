Too expensive for nasty Mexican food .  This place sucks.  I cut into my beef burrito and a whole buch of water came out.  My girlfriend had the chicken burrito and water came out too.  Why are sodas $3.00 dollars?  We ate here because we stayed at Arizona grant resort.  They suck too.  
Will not eat here again even if its free.
