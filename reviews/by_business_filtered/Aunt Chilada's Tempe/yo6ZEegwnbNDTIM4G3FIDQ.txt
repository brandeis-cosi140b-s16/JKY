My favorite "Mexican" in Phoenix.... If you are planning a lunch trip, be sure to get there early (before 11:30) or you will be in for a wait - but it is well worth it.

I LOVE their salsa & chips, the best anywhere IMO and they also offer a 'hot' version that you can mix in to taste.

I am a fan of 'hot' foods with a bit of pep to them and Aunt Chilada's delivers on specific dishes (ie there is plenty of other offerings if spicy is not your style). The 'Aunt Chilada Special' is my favorite - a cubed, spicy beef filled enchilada covered with both red and green sauces, topped off with cheese and sour cream, served with a choice of sides (I normally go with rice and 'fidao' (sp) - kinda "Mexican spagetti".

I have been eating here for many years as do many people I know, there IS a reason it is always packed - Highly recommended.

There is seating both inside and outside, so depending upon the weather and your personal taste you can do either.
