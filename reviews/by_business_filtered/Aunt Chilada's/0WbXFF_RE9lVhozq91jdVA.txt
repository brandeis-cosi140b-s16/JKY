I went to this place several times for drinks, lunch and happy hours and I think it is more for the atmosphere.  Their decor is fun and their Happy Hour is nice because they have a free chips / salsa bar available.  

Last night, I ordered a Blue Moon I think it was 22oz for 6.50 and a Sour Cream Chicken Enchilada for about 6.95 (off of the a la carte menu)  and sat watching 2 baseball games with my hubby.  There were a few people at first around 5pm and the service was pretty fast, but as more and more groups started showing up the service was slower because it was just the two of us and the waitress had to deal with about 2 / 3 groups of 4 - 8.

I totally understand being busy, especially when our food came out fairly quick in the beginning, but the meal itself was ok.  I think it is a fun place to be and their chips and salsa are good, but for food I think you will just be stuck with an ok.
