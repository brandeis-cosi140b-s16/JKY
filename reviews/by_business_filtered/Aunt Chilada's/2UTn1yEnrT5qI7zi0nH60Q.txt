I just left this restaurant 15 minutes ago and decided to sign up for Yelp to write this review. 

Listen, Aunt Chilada's, before tonight... was a mediocre restaurant near where my boyfriend works. We'd sometimes go there for lunch if we needed a quick bite, and the salsa was good. So it was there to fill our need if we really had nowhere else to go. That being said, tonight was a disaster.

I'm sure it's because they had a few large groups of people who'd already sat down before us in the banquet room, wherever that is. But we waited for over an hour for our food. When it arrived, my burrito had cheese in it (I am lactose intolerant and asked for none). The waiter was courteous and zipped back to get me my correct order, but came back a mere ten seconds later with a cold burrito. Really? I know I've already waited, but at least give it to me warm.

All in all, the server generally ignored us because the table to our left was angry they weren't getting any food, and the table to the right of us had a solid 30 people in it. So, I get it in a sense. But it would've been nice to have them tell us straight out that they had a 46 person table on the other side of the restuarant that just ordered, and that the giant party to our right hadn't gotten their food yet either. It would've saved me a lot of time. Definitely was not worth the money, and never will return again.
