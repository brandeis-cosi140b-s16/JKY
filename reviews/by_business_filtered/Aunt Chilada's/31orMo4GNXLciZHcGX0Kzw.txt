Can't believe I haven't reviewed before, I've been here over 50 times. 

Nightlife was hotter at Auntie C's back in 2011 when I first moved into the neighborhood. It's still great for brunch, though. Especially on a warm day when you can sit on the huge patio. It's also nice when you can find room by one of the fireplaces for a drink on a cold night.

The staff is still friendly and the food is decent. Live bands most weekends. Go see the CPP play some night if you want to dance and sing along. Gail can sing the hell out of anything.

Do not fear the black olives in the taco meat at the free happy hour spread on Fridays.
