I thought I was going to really impress some friends when they discovered the highly touted "famous" chocolate fountain feature of our surprise Sunday brunch. 

Allow me to help manage YOUR expectations, so you're not as disappointed as I was: Yes, there is a chocolate fountain and it is included with your $8-13 brunch entree; but, buy your own(probably identical) model at Wal-mart for $40 and save yourself the heartache of a disappointing meal. 

Granted, we came for the "famous" chocolate fountain but we were prepared to enjoy breakfast first! Another disappointment. 

I had the breakfast burrito and could only stomach the beans. The potatoes tasted like they'd been in the freezer too long. The eggs in my burrito were chewy not "lightly" scrambled in the slightest.  The machaca had decent flavor but it was further ruined by the enchilada sauce that tasted straight from a generic can!

One of my guests had pancakes. Sadly, these were neither light nor fluffy, instead they were chewy and tough just like my eggs.

 "The myriad of accompaniments you can serve with the chocolate fountain are only limited by your imagination" in theory, but at Aunt Chilada's this past Sunday, your choices were dry chunks of cantaloupe, flavorless honeydew, pineapple cubes, (shall we say "aged") marshmallows, and the unimaginative standby: strawberries. Oh! And, crispy lady fingers. 

Full disclosure: I did not tell our server how much I hated my burrito or the pancakes and she DID ask how everything tasted. 

Truthfully: I was weary from the disappointment. It's one thing to send back an entree but to say everything was unsatisfactory?! I just won't recommend it or plan to return.
