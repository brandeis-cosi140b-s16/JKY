We eat here quite often.  My parents absolutely love this place, so this is their place of choice when it comes to mexican food.  The salsa and flour chips are absolutely amazing, but the entree dishes are just okay to good.  The service here is hit or miss.  Overall, a good place.  A very cool patio during the nice months of the year.  Just don't expect to eat the mexician food ever here.
