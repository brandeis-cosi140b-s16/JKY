Great Chips and Salsa (especially the flour chips).  The meals aren't the most exciting.  But you don't come here for cutting edge reimaginations, you come here for the old school feel and reliable menu.  The Sunday brunch comes with a chocolate fountain for goodness sakes (a fad that should have died a merciful death about ten years ago).  Everything here is tasty, full fatty and will taste better if you drown it in the salsa.  The happy hour is generally packed and it's nice to see a place that refuses to change with the times.
