I've been here a few times and really enjoyed the atmosphere. I've seen them have live music on a Friday night and it's really fun to sit at the outside bar with some friends. The restaurant is pretty big so it's great for bringing big groups! If you go to the outside bar ask for Lauren! She is great behind the bar and always so positive!
