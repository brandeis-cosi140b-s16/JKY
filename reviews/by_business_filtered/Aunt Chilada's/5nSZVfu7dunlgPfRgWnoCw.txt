First time here was lunch yesterday. Very few people present, but it took our server more than 10 minutes to make first contact. "I didn't know you guys were here", I believe were her exact words. Sat outside, and it was nice but a little on the warm side for me. Scavenger birds were everywhere, landing on the tables and even plates (used & unused) looking for food. When diners left, birds immediately converged on their table and started eating. There is something very disconcerting about a blackbird eating sour cream off of a half-eaten burrito... I digress. I had the seafood burrito which was very good. Rice & beans were no better or worse than other restaurants in this class. My friend had the chicken sour cream burrito and also said it was good. Our table was very unstable, and it took more than one request to get something to shove under the "short" leg to stabilize it. Overall, not bad, but I probably will not be back.
