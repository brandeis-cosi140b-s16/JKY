Attitude from the hostess
Olives in the salsa
Drinks not refilled!
Food took 30 minutes to come out on a slow night.
Server neglected us the entire time
We asked for the manager.. after waiting 10 minutes we decided to just pay and leave
Another 10 minutes for our check to come back. Still, manager never showed up

I'll never go back again.
