Wowzer, this is quite overwhelming. It is very easy to get lost here. Multiple rooms and nooks and crannies for dining everywhere. I think there was a wedding and a quinceanera going on along with at least 3 birthday parties.
This place is definitely festive and we had a table next to the bocce court. The cocktails are ok. Margaritas are made with mixer instead of fresh squeezed lime.
The food is solid mexican. I had the fajitas which were ok. It was kind of a mash up of chicken, peppers and onions. I am used to fresh al dente veggies(broccoli, carrot, squash, peppers and onions) and this was not that.
Great for kids - after dinner they can root around the treasure chest for a treat.

Solid festive restaurant.
