Not the most Mexican-y of Mexican places I've been to, but passable as Mexican food. I have been here several times and never been blown away. Its been here for as long as I can remember, and is a stable as long as I can remember. Tonight we went for their happy hour and I was surprised to see that they offer a free buffet! Chips, salsa, mini enchiladas, taco meat and beans. Not bad! People were still ordering full meals though, but I was all about the freebies :)
