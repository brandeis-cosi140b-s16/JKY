We took the family out for dinner on a Thursday night.  The kids wanted chips & salsa, gotta love'm!

It is a bit hidden of the beaten path but Yelp & iPhone map took us right to the front door. 

The patio is really interesting. It was a bit chilly for our taste, but others were bundled up and enjoying the patio. We sat inside near the fireplace. 

The chips & salsa were good, not the best, but not the worst by far.  Three of us shared fajitas and our son had a cheeseburger & fries, very authentic "Mexican", only my son!! The burger didn't last long, it must have been awesome because he had already had a basket of chips on his own. We enjoyed our fajitas, our daughter has been on a fajita kick for about three months now. Guess its less expensive than the Prime Rib kick she was on the eight months prior. 

We had a nice evening, but Aunt Chilada's is a bit far for us to drive for Mexican food.
