Slow service....Mediocre canned food....skunky refried beans....bland canned tomato salsa....only place in all of Phoenix that I've had whole black olives in the salsa....still trying to digest that one (literally....!)

Eating here is not recommended....

The only saving grace was tonight's band....

Cold Shot and the Hurricanes ....better advice,  see them at the Rhythm Room ....SRO!!
