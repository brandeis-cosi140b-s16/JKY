Visiting from ca, it is excellent for casual dining. very nice server. Wife had the shrimpand scallop enchiladas with verde sauce and a plus. I stole half. I had polbana chiles with beef and jalapeno crem cheese sauce and it also very good. Generous portions great spicy salsa with cumin and pico de gallo with olives was different.
