Great ambiance and nightlife. Neat patio with bocce ball and live music on most weekend nights. 

This place has a long history, dating back to its origin as a trading post for the local mines. That explains the jumbled layout and location inside the neighborhood.

The food is classic "Gringo Mexican food" - well done. The flour tortilla chips for the chips & salsa are fresh, and besides classics like burritos and tacos there are some unique dishes.
