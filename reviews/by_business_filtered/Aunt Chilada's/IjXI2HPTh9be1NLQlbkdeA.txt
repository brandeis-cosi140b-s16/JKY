After hearing so many people talking about Aunt Chiladas, I finally decided to eat dinner here. 

First off, I think the service was very good. The waitress was quick, friendly, and efficient. The food, while decent and tasty, did not really impress me as much as I had expected. But it was reasonably priced. And the portions were generous.

I would definitely come here again in the near future.
