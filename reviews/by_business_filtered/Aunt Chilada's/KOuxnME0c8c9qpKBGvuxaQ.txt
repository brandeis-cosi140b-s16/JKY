I had a business lunch here recently and we had a wonderful time. The portions here are pretty big so we were both fine with ordering one item each a la carte. She had a tostada; I had a bean burrito. It was just the right amount. And their chips are delicious. It was quiet enough that we could have a conversation at normal volume and the staff was friendly and attentive without being over bearing.
