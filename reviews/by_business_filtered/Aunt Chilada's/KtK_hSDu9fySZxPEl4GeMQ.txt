Overrun with people on Cinco de Mayo. That's not bad. Big gringo party night.

What's bad? Weak cocktails in little 4-oz Dixie cups for $5.50. Starting a tab at one bar and needing to close it out when you go to another of the 4 bars inside because the cash registers don't talk to each other. No food service at any of the bars.

So probably not the best night to review the place, though I've been there several times over the years on non-"holiday" nights, and it never really succeeds in impressing much--in any way, really. . .
