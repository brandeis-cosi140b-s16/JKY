This place is hands down my favorite Mexican food restaurant I've ever been to!!! The chips and salsa were the best I've ever had, the patio had a beautiful atmosphere/environment, and the appetizers/entree were phenomenal! I can't believe this place is only given 3 stars because I would've thought it would have at least 4 star rating, if not 5 stars! You won't regret it if you choose to eat here!!
