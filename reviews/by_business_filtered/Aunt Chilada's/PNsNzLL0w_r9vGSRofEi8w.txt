Be very careful - watch your wallet and don't listen to the waitress - she will tell you they have $3 specials and then charge you $7!!
Food was so-so, I did like the fried flour tortilla chips.  But the red chile burritos are beef and not pork.  They don't serve rice, the pasta like side with carrots and peas is marginal at best.
But its the bait and switch happy hour menu you have to be careful of.  They offer a $3 house margarita, but will charge you $7 saying you ordered a "BIG" margarita.  Save your money and go to Carlos O'Briens, Macayos or Top Shelf.
