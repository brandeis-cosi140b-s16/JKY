Great atmosphere and outdoor area.    Bocci ball court is awesome. If you don't know how to play somebody will help you. When we were there one of the refs was giving us lessons. I was able to find to my skills and become a world champion bocci ball player in just one hour and five margaritas. It was simply amazing.  If only the sport was in the Olympics.  However this does not offset the fact that (in my opinion) the food is not great. Even the chips are bad. How can you have a Mexican restaurant with bad chips?
