I'm giving Aunt Chilada's a 3. Its ok. The service is ok. 

We went here this past weekend with a group of about 25 people. They sat us at 3 different tables. We asked our server if each table could have its own tab, so it would be easier for us and them to figure out at the end....they said no. Lovely. Luckily there was an atm in the bar area so we were able to pull out cash. 

The food came out faster then expected with such a large group. Mine was decent, though I ordered a cheese enchilada and they gave me chicken and never came back to ask how our food was :( BUT I also ordered a green corn tamale AND a beef taco (Leave me alone, I worked all day and was hungry as all hell) Those were both way super tasty. 

I do have big beef with their chips. They suck. Who wants flaky not so crispy chips for dipping in salsa...not me. I want my chips crispy, thin and crunchy thank you very much. 

The margaritas were good, they got me sauced. 

I wouldn't ask to go back, but if someone suggested going, I wouldn't put up a stink. Its ok.
