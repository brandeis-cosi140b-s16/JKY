I'm giving four stars because I love to drink and Aunt Chilada's is one of my favorite places to drink. The food is OK, not good but not bad (I'm from Southern California so my standards for Mexican food are very high and sadly the food here doesn't cut it enough for that fifth star)

But the place is so cool that I would bring anyone here despite the fact that I could have better food elsewhere. Every time I come here in fact, it seems like I discover yet another dinning room that I didn't know existed. You have THREE bars to choose from, my personal favorite being the outdoor bar by the bocce ball court. It has a cool tropical feel that almost makes me feel like I'm at a resort bar (the resort bar where all the drunks hang out)

The servers are always friendly and the crowd that hangs out at that bar are always a good time. It's just a fun place to hang out and people watch. I love to come here and get my drink on.

The bonus for me is that I live pretty close so as long as I don't ever stumble on to 16th street into oncoming traffic, I could probably walk home.
