Yep. Still sucks.

Went their recently for a friend's birthday. Didn't want to but it was for one of my oldest friends and I didn't want to disappoint her. 

I only ordered drinks and had some chips and salsa. Drinks were good but the chips and salsa weren't great. The server seemed annoyed I wasn't ordering food, but do you blame me with my past experiences? I had a taste of my friend's cheese enchilada and vegan black beans the staff is so proud of. Not impressed.

Yelpers please keep in mind that some of the 5 star reviews you see posted for Aunt Chiladas quite possibly may be an employee. How do I know this? Because I got a message from an employee after my last update. She said that she knows which bartender I am talking about that was rude at my HS reunion and said "he is really great, just not for banquets." She also said "I do not know why any server would yell at you, that is just ridiculous." And my personal favorite "And yes, there is bacon and lard in our re fried beans. I have no hispanic background, so I am not sure what is traditional. But they are pretty tastey." But then she says "
With that said, I really hope you come back."

Direct quotes. And this employee has a glowing 5 star review for Aunt Chiladas and she says nothing about being an employee. Isn't this breaking some sort of Yelp rule? And what business does she have messaging me unless she is a manager? 

Sorry but I wouldn't trust any Mexican restaurant in the Phoenix area that has less than 4 stars. There are many better choices.
