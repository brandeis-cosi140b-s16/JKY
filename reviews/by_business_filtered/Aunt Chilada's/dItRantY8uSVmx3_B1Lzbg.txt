This place was really good. I absolutely LOVED their flour tortilla chips. I'm pretty picky when it comes to Mexican food, as I was raised on homemade Mexican food, but I thought this place was pretty decent. They have great customer service. The ambiance was great. Oh, and I can't forget, the margaritas were amazing!! I would love to come back to this place again, when I'm in AZ.
