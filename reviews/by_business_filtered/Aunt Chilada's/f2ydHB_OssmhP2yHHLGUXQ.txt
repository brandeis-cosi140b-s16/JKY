This place gets 3 stars and mainly for the atmosphere and homemade chips. I give them 5 stars for the atmosphere, but other than the chips the food just isn't that great. This place has the potential to be amazing, but it falls a little short.  If you want a fun experience, good drinks, and a cute atmosphere but can leave your food expectations behind then this is the place for you. I will be back, but just to sip cocktails on their patio.
