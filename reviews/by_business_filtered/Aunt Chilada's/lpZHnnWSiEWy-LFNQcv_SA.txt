WHY does this place have bad reviews!?!?!? 
This place is awesome. I literally have never had mexican food this good....EVER!
First of all, they have not one, but TWO types of chips for their chips and salsa. The flour torilla chips are the bomb. I could've eaten all that they had. They have black olives in the salsa. Seems weird, but it is delicious! Guac=fabulous. Had margaritas and they were of course great! We both got the pollo fundido per our waiters recommendation. I was mindblown at how good this was! I am still dreaming about it! I cannot wait to return here! We sat on the patio with other visitors and had a ball!
