My 1st impression of the outside was unclean, cluttered and a little quirky but I was willing to try it out because of the great reviews I've heard. We came in to fast service and a  welcoming staff however the food was crappy!!! My husband ( who will eat anything) ordered the fish tacos took one bite and refused to finish it! He's not the type to complain, so in stead he walked away disgusted and starving. With majority of the meals they are served with fedio (Mexican spaghetti) which was flat out horrible. Bland and just strait up weird!  I don't recommend this place. At all...
