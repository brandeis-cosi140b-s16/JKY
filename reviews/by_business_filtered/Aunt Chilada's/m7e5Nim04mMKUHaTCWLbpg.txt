A terrible HH!! We brought 20 people for a pre-homecoming party... All purchased alcoholic beverages- some ppl multiple beverages .. Food consisted of three banquet trays( one nacho, one enchilada, one chingalinga) HH was suppose to last until 6.30 food stopped at 5.45. Servers kept pushing he expensive stuff . We will head somewhere else with our dollars .. Great example of sad hour ... Nothing happy her
