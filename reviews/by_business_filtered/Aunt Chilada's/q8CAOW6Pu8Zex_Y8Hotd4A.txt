Had a birthday party there. It housed our 80 really close friends and a couple more parties. A gf ordered the chicken enchiladas, which usually are dry and not so good. I tried hers and ordered my own. Fantastic food and service. Excellent atmosphere! Completely satisfied, and I'm hard person to satisfy with food. I'll be back real soon.
