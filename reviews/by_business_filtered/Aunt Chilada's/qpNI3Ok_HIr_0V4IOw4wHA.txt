We just moved to the neighborhood and went yesterday for happy hour. The atmosphere is awesome for any occasion. The service was friendly and quick. The food was outstanding! My husband had the Mexican pizza, I had the lettuce wraps, & our friend had the mini chimis (they have a different name on the menu like chingalinga). Nothing was too spicey and after I left I didn't feel overfull or have a stomach ache which is rare bc I'm pregnant. The chips are literally to die for!! I'm thinking of walking over just to buy a bag to take home.!
