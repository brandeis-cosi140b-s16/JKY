Okay, if you want some music and dancing, this is a cool place for Friday and Saturday nights.  I think Aunt Chiladas was in one of Will Ferrell's movies.  So it is great for that, the layout of the restaurant is worth seeing, but the food is mediocre (with the exception of the AMAZING flour tortilla chips and salsa).  Go for a few beers and a good sports room.  Eat the chips and salsa and enjoy that.  Like I said, dancing and a good band right in your face is pretty darn cool on the weekends.   TIP: Sunday nights is open mike night.  Bring your stupid and get up there!!  Hahhaha, see you there!
