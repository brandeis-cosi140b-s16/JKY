A Mexican restaurant & cantina that stands out in the southwest; unrivaled chips and salsa, quaint setting, striking and gracious staff.  Craving curbing classics like fajitas, enchiladas, tacos and tamales could easily have one overlook enchanting favorites such as shrimp stuffed pineapple or comforting chingalingas.  Inimitable ambiance has supported everything from weddings, charity events, and blow out Cinco de Mayo celebrations, to intimate date night getaways, happy hours, or Sunday brunches with visiting loved ones.  Monday night football, casual business gathering, or weekend day drinking; Aunt Chiladas is the neighborhood drop in for regulars and the stuff out of towners reminisce of once departed.
