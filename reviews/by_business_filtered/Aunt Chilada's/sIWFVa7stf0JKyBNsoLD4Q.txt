I was browsing Yelp and saw all the bad reviews of Aunt Chiladas. I laughed because of all my bad experiences there myself. 

Every time I have gone there for food I have had a horrible experience. They have very limited choices for vegetarians. Now, I understand Mexican food is not vegetarian friendly. I am half Mexican myself. I know refried beans and tamales are traditionally made with lard and sauces and rice often have stock in them. I am usually able to ignore it if I can't taste it. Or a server will be able to offer me vegetarian options. 

Every time I have gone there and ordered the vegetable burrito or cheese enchilada combo, the beans tasted horrible. The last time I ordered food there, I was with a very big group of family and friends. I ordered the bean and cheese nachos. The beans tasted and horrible and I asked the server what was in the beans. He said there was bacon in it. I told him I was a vegetarian and ordered the cheese quesadilla. He informed me that there was lard in the tortilla. I told him I would stick to the chips and salsa. He told me there was lard in the chips. I asked him if there was anything without lard and he yelled at me (in front of the whole restaurant) that everything had lard in it. I sarcastically asked him if my margarita had lard in it. He smiled and said no. 

To be fair, I have gone there just for drinks in the bar a few times and had a good time. The bartenders were always nice and they had good bands playing. 

So imagine my horror when I found out my high school reunion was going to be at Aunt Chiladas. My $40 ticket included a buffet full of lard. At least 2 drink tickets were included. But I wasn't going to let a bad restaurant ruin my night of reuniting with my high school chums. So I had a good meal beforehand and hung out around the bar all night. The bar staff was great and I had a wonderful time. :)
