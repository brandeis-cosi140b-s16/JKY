Right after we moved to Charlotte, I was talking to a local in a bar about how I wanted great Mexican food. He directed me to Azteca, and told me not to worry about the fact it was connected with a Days Inn.

That was 8 years ago, and after trying numerous Mexican restaurants in Charlotte, Azteca remains far and away our favorite. The food is delicious and the portions are huge for the price you pay. Service is always friendly and prompt. The restaurant is hopping on a Friday or Saturday night, and it's always a fun place to hang out. 

The mariachi band that plays on the weekend is a blast. On one of our last visits, they asked us if we wanted them to play us a song. We said sure, but we didn't know which one, so we suggested they play us their favorite song. They chose Elvis, which cracked us up.

My husband loves the Arroz con Pollo. I switch around dishes, but lately my favorite is the Pork Carnitas. For $11, you get a plate with so much food on it that taking home leftovers is a must. We've had nothing but great visits to Azteca!
