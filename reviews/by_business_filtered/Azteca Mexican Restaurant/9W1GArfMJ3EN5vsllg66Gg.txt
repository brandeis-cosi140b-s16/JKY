I am not a mexican food expert but this place was pretty darn good!  The outside looks kinda sketch and it's attached to a Days Inn which makes is seem somewhat suspect. But once you walk in it's fine.  

We walked in and were immediately seated and served delicious chips and salsa (only the first 2 bowls of chips are free as I saw on the menu) not like you need more than that but just sayin...

I had a combo plate of a taco and an a cheese enchilada with rice and beans, it was enormous and only about $7, I also had a giant peach margarita that was delicious.  That cost more than my meal ($8 I think?) but I had a rough day and it was worth every penny.  

Consensus - cheap, decent mexican food a short drive from my apartment.  Sold.
