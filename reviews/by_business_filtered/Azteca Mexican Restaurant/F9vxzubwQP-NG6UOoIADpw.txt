ARROZ CON POLLO!!!!  This place is worth it great staff, great atmosphere, awesome food even down to the little tortilla wit whipped cream and strawberry sauce at the end of the meal. The guy that comes around with the guacamole cart makes killer guacamole. The portions are massive I consider myself a big eater and I have a hard time finishing my meal. The staff is great they come into my store after hours and are just as friendly at that time as they are when at work so I guess that means they are sincere. Great place
