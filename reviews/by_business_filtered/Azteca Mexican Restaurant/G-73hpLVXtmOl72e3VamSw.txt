Holy mole!  This is some good Mexican food!  Probably not the most authentic in the world but still mighty tasty.  I've never eaten anything bad here and for a while, my bf and I were on an every weekend Azteca cycle.  I love fresh guacamole and they actually have a woman who comes by your table with all the ingredients on a cart who makes it right there in front of you.  You can even pick what ingredients you want more or less of.....light onions, extra tomatoes for me please!   We told our friends who have lived here for a while that we went to eat there and they had one word for it, "Epic!"  It may not be THAT good, but for queso dip, tacos, and fajitas it's an excellent.  Full bar, margaritas, and a decent beer selection.  An added bonus: the refried beans are actually slightly spicy and tasty, not brown mush out of a can.
