Arrived for lunch at 12:30 and the place was packed. Overflow parking is around back by the Days Inn pool. The hostess gave us a pager but the wait was only 5 minutes. Not much of a waiting area - it's either the bar or outside.

Two delicious salsas were put on the table and the chips were fresh. An excellent first impression. Our waiter took our drink order and a minute later, the manager came by to confirm that the drink order had been taken. So far, it's warming up as attentive service.

Waiter came back with drinks and took lunch orders. I got the Expresso Burrito from the lunch menu and my friend ordered the Chicken Chimichanga. The food took less than five minutes and arrived on very hot plates. I found mine delicious though light on the promised pork verde. The Chicken Chimi was chock full of chicken. Both were delicious.

By this time, the lunch rush had cleared out, so we stayed another hour talking and were not pressured by the staff to move on. Our drinks were refilled a few times too.

Overall impression: excellent surroundings and a great (if rushed) atmosphere. Good food. Very low price. I'll come back for sure!
