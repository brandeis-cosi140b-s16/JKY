Having been to most of the area Azteca's this one ranks lowest. 

First strike is being attached to a shady Days Inn. Other than that once you get in the door, its typical Mexican chain restaurant fair inside.
Everything, and I mean everything my wife and I ordered came covered in greasy cheddar cheese. Not even a real Mexican cheese, but grocery store pre-shredded cheese.

Our server was very attentive, even took his lunch break at the next table over so he could keep his eye on us. Even though someone else has "covered" his break they both ended up serving us. So great service.

Food quality at other Aztecas just seems higher, and cleaner.
