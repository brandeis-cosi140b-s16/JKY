In town for work, so by myself and got it to go. Asked for a suggestion and was not directed to the most expensive thing on the menu. The staff was very friendly and joked with me while I waited. The food came out fast and hot. I ordered the sopa de tortilla, Arroz Con Pollo (extra spicy) and frijoles negro. The portions are very good and the taste was excellent. I will definitely be back!!
