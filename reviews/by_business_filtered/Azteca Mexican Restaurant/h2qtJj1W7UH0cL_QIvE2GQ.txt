Let me start off by saying that this is the first time I have ever written a review for anything . I felt so strong about my experience there tonight that I had to come out and share it with everyone. I've been to this establishment two other times before today and both times were pretty good, of course this was over a year ago. After today I will never go there again. Two hours after eating their chicken quesadilla and beef nachos both me and my girlfriend got stomach aches. I don't want to bash this places completely because our service wasn't horrible and the atmosphere was nice but the food that we got was just plain awful.
