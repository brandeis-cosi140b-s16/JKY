I'm not a huge Mexican fan, but I always have a good time when I come here! (Go on Fridays. That's when the mariachi band comes :D) A little after we were seated, the mariachi band came over to our table. They asked if they could play a song for us. OF COURSE YOU CAN!! But umm.. we didn't know what song to request so we asked for a "happy" song haha (I guess I should brush up on my latin songs beforehand next time lol) They were so sweet! Near the end of our meal, they came back to ask if we would like another. Of course we said YES! Don't forget to tip btw :)

There was a birthday party beside us and the servers embarrass the birthday girl/boy with a sombrero hat as the mariachi band gathers with birthday songs :) It is a great place for birthdays. The space isn't that big, but they can accommodate large crowds. Plus, being here always makes me more cheery!
