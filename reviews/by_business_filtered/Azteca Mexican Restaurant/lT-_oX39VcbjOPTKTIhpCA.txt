Charlotte, NC seems to have a problem (at least in my part of town) with Mexican restaurants that have decided to go upscale and charge you too much for the simple dishes we all know and love.  Azteca hasn't gone this route at all.  In fact its basically in the lobby of a Days Inn.  Thank you for protecting what Mexican food really is Azteca.
