The atmosphere is awesome, great decor.   Don't let the little entrance next to the Days Inn fool you.  I wasn't too impressed with the food.  It was just okay.  The salsa is not good - very runny.  But, they do give you a delicious  slaw with the chips.  Prices are really cheap - great lunch specials.
