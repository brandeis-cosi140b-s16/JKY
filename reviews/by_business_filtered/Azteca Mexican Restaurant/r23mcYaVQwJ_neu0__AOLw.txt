I stopped here on the way to the airport. It's connected to a Days Inn so I had to question how good it was going to be. But given the clientele I would say the food is authentic. The menu offers lots of choices and the beer and ritas are good. So why the three stars? The service sucked. I was there with a relative who lives in Charlotte and we ordered light (me nachos and she the tres Leche cake, both good) and we were basically ignored for the entire time we were there. The food took so long to come out that we both joked about it. But honestly I was pissed about how long it took to get two simple dishes to our table and about how little attention we were paid. So, food good, drinks also good, service sucked.
