Azteca is suprisingly a great place to take a huge group for lunch.  They're speedy, you can call ahead and reserve a giant table, and they don't complain too much about haveing 20 seperate checks.

I normally order something small off the lunch menu, because I inevitably fill myself up with chips and salsa before my lunch even comes.  I always save room for the desert at the end!

Pro tip: if you're trying to get out of Azteca to head towards Billy Graham, go out the back of the parking lot to come out at the light.  Making a left onto Woodlawn is just plain crazy.
