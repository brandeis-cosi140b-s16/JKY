I love the food here. I come here often. The dishes are large and there is always some leftover to take home. I always order the Mexican stir fry which is chicken and lots of mixed veggies. My girlfriend always gets different dishes and I eat off her plate. The staff is friendly, the beer is always cold and the music is lively. We always end with fried ice cream. I love love love my fried ice cream.
