Love love....love Azteca. Their made to order Guac is the best.  
    I've eaten here quite a few times throughout the years and have yet to be disappointed. Their Carne Asada is delectable as well as the Arroz con Pollo. 
    I highly recommend the margaritas too!
Azteca is great for large groups because of it's lively atmosphere.
