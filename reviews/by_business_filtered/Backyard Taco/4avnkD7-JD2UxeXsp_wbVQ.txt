I found this place to be pretty tasty.  Also reasonably priced.  I really liked their crazy potato. Think baked potato without the skin shoved into a tin foil pouch with meat, cheese, & garnish.  Also Taco Bell has ruined my ideas of what a gordita is. Backyard's is like a tostada with meat, cheese, & garnish on a thicker piece of tortilla. Its also very tasty. And finally we talk about the tacos. They are street tacos so they are smaller. But the flavors are really good. In all,  if you're looking for something that does not have burritos,  you've come to the right place. It has a salsa bar. Chips cost $2. But like an earlier yelper said, a good amount of food for around $10.00. "We fight for tacos"
