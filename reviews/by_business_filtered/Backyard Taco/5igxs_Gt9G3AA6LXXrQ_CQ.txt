They grill most things over Mesquite grill which gives them a good flavor.  All the meat is overcooked and a little dry but it is offset by a great taste of the Mesquite grilling and the Guacamole salsa add moisture and great flavor as well.  This place is always busy with locals having lunch and dinner.  The portions are a bit small for the price.
