This place is a hidden gem in Mesa.  It has a very homie feel, it is a family oriented place and the service is definitely on fleek(meaning they have fast service). Back yard Tacos definitely are one of those mom and pop shops or hole in the wall kind of places. This spot should be on the top 10 go to places for, Taco Tuesday's or any other day for Mexican food/BBQ.
