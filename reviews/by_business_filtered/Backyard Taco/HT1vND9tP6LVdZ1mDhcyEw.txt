So glad a friend suggested this place!  Family of 4, with two kiddos, and we all were happy with our meals.  I had the vegetarian crazy potato, which was a really cool menu item.  The place was packed, but the kitchen got food out fairly quickly and there was plenty of outside seating.  Will definitely come back, and recommend to others!
