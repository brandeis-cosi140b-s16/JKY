I'm revisiting my review now that it's safe to say I've had everything on the menu. Where has this Crazy Potato been all my life? (Papa Loca) I was in Backyard Taco and the owner himself took my order and introduced me to a new stampcard. Buy 10, get 1 meal free (up to $5). My guess is, I will have filled this card in about two weeks. My favorite items are the tacos on corn tortillas, the steak tostada and now the potato. The chips and salsa are delicious as well, and complimentary with your Yelp check-in. Great that they're open late, too.
