Went here because it's close to my house and has great reviews. I probably won't be back much, definitely not for the price. It's really nothing special, bland and not a lot for what you pay, especially for a taco/Mexican place. They have a good salsa bar, that's probably the only reason I'm giving them 3 stars. It's always really busy, with no parking unless you want to park on the street which basically cuts off the road for people trying to get by on Hunt, probably not safest for you or your car. I guess it's ok if you're looking for some artificial 'ethnic experience'. My mother in law is from Chihuahua and a terrible cook, but I'd rather go to her house to eat than this place. IMO
