Very good carne asada tacos for AZ.  One of the closer ones compared to good tacos in Sonora, Mexico.  Will definitely be going back. Recommend putting the cabbage (repollo) out at the salsa/accessories bar and make it a little bigger and not minced.  Would be great if salsa bar was accessible from both sides too as gets crowded in the corner with others waiting for food and tables nearby.  Look at Ta Carbon in west Phoenix for their salsa bar set up.
