This place is addictive! I've eaten tacos at several places in Mesa, Chandler, and Phoenix, but Backyard Taco has become my all time favorite! The food here reminds me of authentic street tacos you get in Mexico. They are absolutely amazing! They offer a family platter that feeds my family of 5 with some to spare. Prices are good and food quality is great!
