Good: 
1) Clean
2) Friendly Staff
3) Decent neighborhood
4) Nice Salsa bar selection that includes Avocado Crema- they call it guacamole
5) Nice atmosphere
6) Decent seating
7) Good Parking
8) Awesome drink selection
9) Gorditas

Bad:
1) Meat not trimmed- Fat on carne asada taco
2) Meat not marinated
3) Chicken is dark meat--or at least it seemed kind of greasy and gristly.  I suspect lots of drumsticks.  


Notice how most of the food is in the bad section.  If they would just trim the meat, it would be my favorite taco shop.  But I HATE fatty tacos that you have to pick through before you eat.  Good place for a mexican coke or jamaica and a cheese gordita I guess..
