I'm kind of a taco snob. I've eaten a lot tacos and know a good taco when I taste one. This place is good for the East Valley, but doesn't even come close to Ta Carbon in the West Valley. But since Ta Carbon is so flipping far from this location, this will do. 

I had the tacos in every meat combo: asada, chicken, and birria. Meats were juicy and had good flavor. They had flour and corn tortilla options and the tacos were topped with finely chopped cabbage, red onion, and cilantro. They are street taco sized so get a few. I got 3 and it was the perfect amount.

The salsa bar is decent. They have cucumber and radish slices, lime, avocado salsa, jalape√±o salsa, pico de gallo, and a spicy salsa for the birria. They had a few other salsas I didn't try out.

Price wise, you get bang for your buck. The tacos are $1.89 each and Taco Tuesdays they are $1.49 each from 2-10.

They have agua frescas and their jamaica was on point. Overall, they get a 3 from me as it didn't blow me away but I will most likely return because I do love cheap tacos.
