I seek out this place when I'm in this part of town, and it's rare that I can get in the door. Lucky me today! 

Today's choice was the carne asada tacos: flavorful, tender, and delicious! Prices reasonable as always. Food came out quickly and everyone was friendly!

Salsa bar tip: try the tatemada. I tried it and the jalapeno, and it was definitely the more flavorful of the two. 

In summary, go if you're in the area. If not, drive over and get some tacos!
