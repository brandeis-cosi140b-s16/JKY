I came in on a Tuesday for lunch and this place was busy! I was able to place an order with-in 5 minutes of my arrival, the staff was friendly and helpful. I received my food ten 10 minutes later (not bad for how busy it was) I ordered carne asada quesadilla and birria tacos, the tacos were flavorful, tender and hot. The quesadilla was delicious! The steak had a chargrilled flavor that makes this taco shop stand out from many others. I will be back to bring others :)
