I love local places born and raised in Mesa and not the crap the chains offer.  This place is funky, fun, and the food is good and fresh.  Lots of cool people there too.  I have been there several times and a few times ago ordered the family pack which is plenty of food for 5 people.  Thanks for brining a new place to our neighborhood!
