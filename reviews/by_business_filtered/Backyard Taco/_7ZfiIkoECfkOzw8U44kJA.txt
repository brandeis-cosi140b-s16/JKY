It's Good, It's Busy, It's worth the trip and wait in line.  

Tasty Tacos, Crispy Chewy Gorditas, Flavorful Beans and Tasty Tortillas - Plus the Tortilla Chips are Hot, Thin, Properly Salted and Come With A Salsa that is Exclusive to the Chips.

Here you will find reasonably priced freshly made food, that is constantly being cooked and prepared.  There is a swarm of people coming, going and socializing and eating.  There is a salsa bar that will please most any pallet, although I would like to see a slight pickle to the carrots and onions, however, the cucumbers and radish have a nice crisp crunch.

The tacos are of the 6" corn or flour tortilla variety as are the gorditas.  The burritos are ample in size and satisfying, the quesadillas are nicely sized and cheesy.  The Papa Loca (a baked potato, mashed, mixed with cheese and choice of meat) is filling and yummy.  The beans are good all by themselves or in a burrito sprinkled with cheese; also flavorful is the chicken and birra meats as fillings.

All in all, Backyard Taco pleases the need for a street style taco or burrito or Mexican fix that is big on flavor and easy on the wallet.
