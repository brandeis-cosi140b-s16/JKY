Finally got to see what all the hype was about.  Backyard Taco is one of those places people mention in conversation the same way they would mention "Bono" or "Elvis" - no further explanation necessary.  I will preface this review by saying I was very hungry when I arrived, so my review may be a little generous.  But I still stand by it.  I got the chicken tacos and they were tasty.  I was happily surprised that prices were really reasonable as well.  Service was quick, although the guy taking orders didn't look like he really wanted to be there.  But, whatever, you don't have to be chipper to sell me a taco.  The most surprising part of my meal was the fresh-tasting lemonade.  Bottom line: good food at good prices.  I've heard there can be long wait times when they're busy, so would I wait half an hour or more in line to order my food? No, it's not that life-changing.  Would I go there again and wait a few minutes in line? Absolutely.
