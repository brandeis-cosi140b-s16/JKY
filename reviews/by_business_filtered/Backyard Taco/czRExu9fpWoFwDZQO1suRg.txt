Best tacos in Mesa, possibly the state of Arizona!

What more can I say? Absolutely love everything this place has on the menu. My girlfriend and I are huge fans of getting the family meal (half chicken/half steak) to take home so that we can make our own tacos as we watch a movie. A couple of quesadillas and some beans round out the perfect movie dinner.

The place is usually packed, no matter the time of day. So either call ahead to order or be prepared to hangout for a bit.
