Some of the best carne aside meat I have ever tried. They are grilling the meat right behind the cashiers filling the entire place with a great savory aroma. My only complaints here is the salsa bar... wasn't a fan of any of the salsas available so I decided not to put any on my tacos. Also there is very limited seating and this place was packed at lunch time, we had to stand around and wait for an empty table.
 Never the less it's still definitely worth to check out and try the food!
