Being used to really good street tacos I used to eat in Guadalajara, I've found it nearly impossible to replicate the flavor of these delicious tacos this side of the border. That said it is not impossible. Backyard has these tacos that please every time when I'm craving the tacos from back home.

They have 3 kinds: pollo, birria y carne asada. Speaking to the owner, really cool guy, I found out they are Mazatlan style. I have never been to Mazatlan but the birria tacos taste just like birria tacos that I had back in Guadalajara. The food is very good and they are right around my neighborhood!

I usually get birria and asada so I have yet to attest to the pollo tacos. I get the yelp deal for the free chips. And always get grilled onions because they are awesome.

The charm of this place is that everything is made fresh. So if you like yourself a good taco,  try these out. I bet you will love it.
