The carne asada here is super good, but that's about it.  I came here the other night and tried a few dishes; overall the chicken was really dry, the chips and salsa were terrible and the carne was good.  Not worth the trip in my opinion, but to each their own.  Also, whats with the 80's music at a mexican taco stand?
