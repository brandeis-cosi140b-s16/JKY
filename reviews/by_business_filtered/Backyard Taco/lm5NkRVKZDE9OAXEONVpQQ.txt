This place is good. I've ordered from here twice already and unfortunately they did mess up my order both times 

They messed up one taco (plain taco for my daughter) on one order and 4 tacos (no onions) on another order.

This is not going to stop me from going back but I will have to check my order before I leave which isn't a good thing.

The brownish salsa & guacamole lacks flavor and it's NOT that spicy from what the other reviewer stated. 

The guacamole needs more guacamole and "less cabbage/water?" when they blend it. Why not add some boiled tomatillo, lemon and cilantro to it to give it more flavor?

A red salsa (chiles japones with boiled red tomatoes/tomatillo + seasoning) would go great with the carne asada tacos. The one they currently have is that brownish jalapeno salsa.

They have another tomato-y red salsa but it ruins the tortilla because it's too runny.

This place has potential, but they need to step it up. Train the staff and improve the order and delivery process.
