Wow! 
If you try one thing, make it have carne asada on it! MM mm Mm! Give the crazy potato a try, too! Fantastic stuff!

So we looked this place up on mouth-by-southwest and thought it sounded good. We were looking for late-night tacos on a Saturday night. Open til 11pm on Saturdays, we thought we'd give it a shot. Arrived at 9pm and this place is hoppin! We ordered one of each type of taco, some nachos, as well as a crazy potato w/ carne asada. Delicious! It's definitely worth the drive and the price is low for such delicious food. We will for sure come here again!
