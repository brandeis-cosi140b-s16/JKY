The tacos were great. Reminded me of the street tacos you can get... just without the unintended consequences that usually follows. I also got a quesadilla and it was good, though I think it would be difficult to screw up a cheese quesadilla. The salsa bar was nice and even had some guacamole.

The patio area is nice, even in the summer. I think misters were probably god's gift to Phoenix for making this land so unbearably hot. 

I will definitely go back as everything I had was excellent.
