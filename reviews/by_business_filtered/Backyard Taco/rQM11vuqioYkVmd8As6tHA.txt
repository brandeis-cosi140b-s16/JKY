It was our first time here and it was so delicious!!! We ordered the carne asada quesadillas, carne street tacos on flour and corn tortillas! Chips and salsa were yummy too, but the salsa ordered with the chips and salsa is not put out on the salsa bar! Oh and the grilled gordita it was good. The carne was flavored perfectly!!! We will be back for sure. The kids got the plain carne flour tacos:)
