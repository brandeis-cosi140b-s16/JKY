My family and friends went to back yard taco. Wow! The food is awesome.   I ordered chicken tacos and chicken burritos.   It is very delighted.   My family and I will come back to this awesome place.  Joyride taco need to learn from this place, all of you non authentic need to eat here so you'll know what a real Mexican taco, is.   At least this place won't take you for a ride. The food here at back yard taco is very reasonable..
