This place had been highly recommended by many friends, and while the food was good, it left me feeling underwhelmed. 

I loved the atmosphere, and how well kept it was, especially when I frequent many hole-in-the-wall Mexican food places with my husband. And my favorite thing from the menu was the baked potato. But, I felt like the tacos were just not quite there in flavor. I will probably give it another chance at some point, though.
