Have been back a few times to Backyard and they have stepped it up. The family pack taco combo is straight bomb. Spoke with the owner Ruben and told him I wrote the first review and would update it with a new recommendation. You gotta try this and I'm telling you order the family pack as an individual if you are a big eater.....it is worth it! Tell them half carne asada and half pollo asado.
