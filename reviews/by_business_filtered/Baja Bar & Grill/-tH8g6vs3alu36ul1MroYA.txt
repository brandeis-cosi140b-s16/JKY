Like the decor- it's fun and has all these little humorous signs posted for your entertainment.  It has been newly renovated to expand the front area to include more seating.  I like that there are many different selections of hot sauces for your enjoyment.  That was unique.  The food is good and the prices are awesome!! I went in on a Friday afternoon when there was $1 Fish tacos.  Tacos were delicious. It's the more authentic flour tortilla rounds and comes with an abundant helping of the condiments of onions, cilantro, cheese, lettuce, etc.  I also tried the potato taco which was hearty but really delicious.  For the price and being located near UNLV,  I was surprised not to have to wait for service.  The food is made as you order- but it didn't take that long to get my food and there was not a line. 
I would definitely recommend going there, especially if you need to use the internet as well. There's free wi-fi!! Doesn't get better than that!! They serve some beers as well!!
