Have been here twice now.  Stopped in first for lunch and got their 3 tacos lunch special.  The tacos were great.  The owner is super friendly and enthusiastic.   A few days later I stopped by for their happy hour special -- $1 tacos and $2 beers.  Tacos were great again and the staff was friendly.

I will definitely be back to this place.  You should stop by, too!
