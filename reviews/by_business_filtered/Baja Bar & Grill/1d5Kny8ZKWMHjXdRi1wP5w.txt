Wasn't expecting too much for a joint near campus and I didn't get disappointed. I was looking for something quick, tasty, and cheap so I decided to try baja out. 

The interior is cool, plenty of table space and seats so not too shabby if you're having a working lunch or supper. The dude at the front was nice and polite. He explained the menu more or less; although, I could have inferred that their main items were tacos and burritos on my own.

I did not like the fact that he charged more for hard-shell tacos, I don't think they're really unique and the incremental cost of producing them over soft-shell is marginal. Furthermore, the hard-shells were opened too far wide so it was difficult to bite into them. The beef was excellent though, juicy, marinated, and tender. The taco was also far too small, about the size of the palm of my hand. The rice and beans were delicious, very flavorful.

The taste was good, but the pricing and quantity weren't completely there.
