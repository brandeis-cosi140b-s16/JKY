This place is great. Food is generally inexpensive and their food does not drip with grease like many other Mexican taco shops do. 

 I ordered the fish burrito ($4). The way they do their fish is a little different that I'm accustomed to. They seem to just grill their fish (tilapia), instead of using the deep fried battered fish that I usually see. Also, it seems like no sour cream, tar tar sauce or guacamole has been added. I'm not sure if you can order the stuff optionally. Definitely a much healthier tasting burrito than the nearby Roberto's though, which I'm happy about. 

I'm definitely coming back to try their other stuff.
