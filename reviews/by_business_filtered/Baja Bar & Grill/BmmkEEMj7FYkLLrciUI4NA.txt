I love this place! 
On my last visit I got the fish and chips. 
-The "chips" were sliced thin enough to have crunch, but thick enough to have potato flavor. 
-The fish was not dry and evenly breaded. 
-They ran out of tartar sauce but who need's tartar sauce with all the sauces on display? I poured myself some green salsa (tomatillo?) and cilantro red sauce into little cups and dipped and dunked my fish. Yum! My own little twist on a U.K. classic. 
Without a doubt I will keep returning :)
