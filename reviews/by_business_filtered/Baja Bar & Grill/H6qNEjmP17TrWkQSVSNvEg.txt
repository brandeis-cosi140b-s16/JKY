Solid burrito spot at very reasonable prices, especially at happy hour ($1 tacos and $2 beers...felt like being back in college). The potato tacos are indeed quite interesting, so be sure to try at least one. Service was above average. Overall, nothing blew me away but I absolutely left full and happy and with hardly a dent in my wallet.
