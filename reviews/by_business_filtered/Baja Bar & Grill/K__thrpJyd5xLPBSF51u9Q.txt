Ive been feeling seafood recently and once again, Yelp to the Rescue! I've gone to Aloha Kitchen (same complex) a few times but never noticed this place. I walk-in and was immediately greeted by a very friendly and enthusiastic man.. I was looking through their menu for a while.. He told me their ingredients are fresh the fish is a big seller and the potato taco.. Then he told me about their special: 3 Tacos and a Drink for $4.99 (excluding the shrimp). Heck, that sounds good to me and throw in a 4th taco, make it the shrimp.

*All the tacos were served in 2 mini corn tortillas, a slice of lime and they're own hot sauce/salsa

Beef Taco: tiny diced pieces of steak, with the typical pico del gallo topping and some queso. barely any meat and barely any flavor.. Just a Filler.

Fish Taco: tiny diced pieces of grilled Tilapia, topped with queso, pico de gallo but instead of lettuce, they used cabbage. Wasn't soaring with flavor but just right. The cabbage gave it a nice little snap to every bite.

Potato Taco: stuffed with chunks of potato and also had the pico de gallo topping, queso plus some white and yellow shredded cheese. The potato was ridiculously tasty! The cheese was shredded cheese was went with the potatoes like bread and butter! 

Shrimp Taco: small pieces of shrimp that were soft not chewy,  pico de gallo and the crumbled queso went well with it. It was ok.

*Fascinating amount of Hot Sauces to choose from! Im talkin' about  pushin'  about a 100 Different types! I wanted to taste my food, maybe next time I'll be daring and try some of them fire sauces! Cool Staff and Service, Good Prices and Food. Place was Bahafied!!
