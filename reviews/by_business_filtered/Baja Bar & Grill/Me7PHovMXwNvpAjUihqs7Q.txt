I have to admit, I was slightly hesitant to go here since they totally replaced one of my favorite after-class lunch spots, East Boy, BUT they made really good food and I'm so glad my friend convinced me to give them a chance.

Atmosphere was like what any typically college student would enjoy.  Place was well-kept and clean, yet it still has an urban feel to it.  If you ever get bored, take some time to read their bumper stickers/decorations.  You'll get a kick out of the sarcasm.

The staff was really friendly and took the time to explain how their menu and specials worked when they learned we were mostly first-timers.  Food came out pretty quickly and we got exactly what we asked for. :-)

I loved that they also carried about 100 different bottles of hot sauces.  For those of you who love spicy food, this would probably be like heaven for you.

We weren't there for happy hour, but the deals looked pretty awesome.  Great quality food for cheap, and cheap booze to go along with it!

Would definitely make frequent trips back and try out the rest of their menu!
