I love this place! You cant beat the prices and the food is sooooo delicious. They have a lot of options and can accommodate anyone - meat lovers, vegetarians and I even heard vegans. They have a fun drink and hot sauce selection. Awesome place between classes or on a lunch break.... quick, reliable and super friendly! Make sure to enjoy the daily drink or food specials.
