Not a bad taco place. We tried the potato, chicken, beef, pork and fish tacos. The chicken and potato taco were the best out of the selection. What was really good was their salsa. The inside of the restaurant is small and cute- a good college hangout place. The restaurant is in a sketchy neighborhood though... Good thing they don't stay open late.
