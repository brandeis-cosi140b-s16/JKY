Casual and comfortable atmosphere. Excellent and friendly service... I tried the beef, chicken, fish, and potato tacos. They're not 1.00 during happy hour they're 1.25. The beef tacos were by far the best. The potato taco came in second. The chicken was bland and fish taco a little too fishy. I showed my yelp check in but instead of one full order of fried Oreos they gave us literally one Oreo. Overall happy with our experience.
