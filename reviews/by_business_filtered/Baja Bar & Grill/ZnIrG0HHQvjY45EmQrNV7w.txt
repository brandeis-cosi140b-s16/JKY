I'd heard good things about the potato tacos so I made it over one night.  He also had potato taquitos and when I couldn't decide he offered me a free potato taco so I could try both.  And then they made me two free potato tacos.  The potatoes had a great flavor- they were crispy, not greasy at all.   Excellent fresh salsa and guacamole.  Kind of a hole in wall place, but overall a great place to hang out near campus.  Good prices and free wi-fi.
