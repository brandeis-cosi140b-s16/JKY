This place is not your normal taco place, this place serves street tacos like you'll find in LA and San Diego when you're wandering around.  I'm a fan of this place obviously, and it's super convenient located a quick walk from campus, and the free wifi is a bonus too.

I'm a fan of the chicken tacos, but really, all of the tacos are good, and I was even pleasantly surprised by the potato taco the first time I tried it.  The toppings are traditional, and definitely need to be spiced up for my taste, but lo and behold, there are like 20 different hot sauces to try.  You can ask the owner or cooks for suggestions, they know all the sauces they have.  Also, how can you not love a place that does a great taco Tuesday and have great beer prices?
