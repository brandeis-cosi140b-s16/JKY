I came here for a quick lunch wanting to try something different (ie not a chain restaurant). Based on the Yelp reviews, this seemed to be a perfect choice. It is located in a small strip mall just north of the Bank of America.  Walking in, it is very small (only 7 tables in the main eating area) and very dark. You order at the counter and they bring the food to your table. The manager told me they are known for their fish tacos, so I tried one of those. I also ordered a chicken taco. (Each cost $1.79) Plus when you check in on Yelp, you get a free potato taco ($1.49 value). Each of these is a soft shell taco. I got them with all the fixins (shredded lettuce, cheese, chopped tomatoes, onions, cilantro, etc). The fish taco lived up to reputation - delish!! The potato taco was also excellent. It was like a cut up latke on a soft shell taco with lots of chopped veggies on top. Not dietetic but delicious. The only weak taco was the chicken taco. It was tasty but it was a bit short on the chicken. I had to add the salsa that came with it to give it flavor.  Lunch for under $5 - great value!! And free Wi-Fi. Overall, this was an excellent choice for a lunch.
