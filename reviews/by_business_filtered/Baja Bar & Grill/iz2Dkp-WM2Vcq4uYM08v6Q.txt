Came here for the famous potato taco. Was not disappointed. The man at the counter, presumably the owner, was very nice. He asked if I had ever been there before and explained all of the deals and menu items when he figured this was my first time. I had the 3 tacos and a drink deal. Such a great deal! I got 2 potato tacos and a veggie one. While I was waiting for my food, I was looking at the variety of hot sauces they had. I randomly chose mango hot sauce, chipotle hot sauce, and tapatio (not so randomly). When my food came out, it was hot and fresh. These were some of the best tacos I've ever had. They were not what I expected. The potato tacos were served on two 4-inch corn tortillas, insert potato, shredded cheese, lettuce, and pico de gallo. The veggie taco was the same thing, but with beans. I will soon be a regular of this place. Taco Tuesday may be my new thing. These tacos for 99 cents?! Yes!
