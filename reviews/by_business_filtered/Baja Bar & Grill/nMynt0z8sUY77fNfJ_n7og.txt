I recommend trying the chicken tacos but you must have their potato specialty, pretty unique. The regular fish taco wasn't a knock out, the shrimp might be the way to go, either wasn't expensive . Lots of different hot sauces to try. Lighthearted beach decor.  Owner cares about his food. Bargain overall.
