Happy Hour 4-7?! $1.00 tacos?! Great service?! Nice portion size?!

This place is great! We have been three times now, and have not been disappointed on any visit! 

Despite arriving 5 minutes to 7 our first visit, the staff said not to rush,they would honor the happy hour special priced tacos when we were ready. I joked with the staff that they boast great fish tacos, and the last great fish tacos that I consumed were just off of the beach in San Felipe, where I watched the fisherman bring the catch in, clean, prep, cook and serve them all with the fish being under an hour old. That was their competition.

WOW! They did not disappoint. The fish was flaky, flavorful and normal sized for soft tacos.

With each visit, we have tried to change our orders up some, to taste more of their wares. This last time, the photo of the nacho plate on the wall caught my attention. Asking what was on the nachos, they listed off all of the ingredients, I made my customization and sat down to watch a basketball game on the TV while the food was being prepared.

Unfortunately, their list of nacho toppings did not include the beans that were included. Picky palette over here, so we asked if we could get another plate, without beans, which we were going to pay for and take the first plate home for the wife to have lunch the following day. They had no part of it. Apologizing for leaving that bit out, they whipped up another plate for me quickly, and made sure they had the order right.

The staff is friendly and inviting, fun to joke around or converse with while enjoying some inexpensive and tasty food!
