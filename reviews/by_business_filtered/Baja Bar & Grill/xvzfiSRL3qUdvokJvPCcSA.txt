I love fish tacos. When I don't feel like driving out to henderson. I will stop here. I love the mango soda with 1 fish taco,1 shrimp taco, and 1 chicken taco. The fish is the best and I will stick with that and just order chips and dip. The prices are reasonable/cheap and it is located right beside the college. Yes, they have my favorite hot sauce Texas pete:)
