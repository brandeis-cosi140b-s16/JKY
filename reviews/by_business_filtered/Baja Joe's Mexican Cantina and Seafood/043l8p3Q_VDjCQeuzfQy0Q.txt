Baja Joe's is definitely a MUST try before you die! Not only is the service impeccable, the food is extremely delicious! First we started with some chips, salsa and guacamole (which they made fresh at the table). The chips were warm and crispy and the salsa was top notch. My bf got the combo platter choosing the shrimp taco and carne asade enchilada as his two items. The shrimp was cooked to perfection and the beans and rice that came with it were awesome too! But lets get down to the important matter, what I got. A friend had recommended the whole fish so I ordered the whole garlic red snapper. I was more than impressed! It was crispy and extremely flavorful, could have probably fed 2-3 people so I had a lot for leftovers. The meat of the fish tasted really fresh, came right off and I didn't get any bones. They provided tortillas and I was able to make a super delicious fish taco that included the crispy garlic fish, rice (that came with the fish) and their special chipotle sauce and spicy salsa ( provided on the table). Baja Joe's is my favorite Mexican Cantina by far, and that is counting all the ones have been too (even in California). My friend got the crazy seafood platter that had everything on a boat with a flame underneath and he enjoyed it very much. They also have margaritas served by the pitcher for $19 and it was worth it. I STRONGLY recommend giving this hidden gem a try!! Scouts honor this place is AWESOME!
