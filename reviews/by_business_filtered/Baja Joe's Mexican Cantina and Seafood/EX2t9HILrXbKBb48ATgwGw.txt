we found this on a whim and because it was open early! the food is fantastic, there are six of us and we all loved it! I ordered the ceviche and sadly it was not the best ever, but was still good. It was watery and just shrimp, I had to order avacado extra. The rest had enchildas, fish tacos, quesedillas and chorizo!! all great! my parents thought it a bit loud, they are in their 70's! All in all a good experience!!!
