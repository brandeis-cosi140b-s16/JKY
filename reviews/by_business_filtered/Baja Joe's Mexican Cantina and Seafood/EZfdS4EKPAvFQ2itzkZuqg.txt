Food was good unfortunately the bartender was completely out of line and rude. We walk in to have dinner and watch the bronco chiefs game (I'm wearing a bronco jersey) and sit down at the bar to be greeted by the bartender very rudely say my team is going to lose and he is going to "piss in my drink". I can take friendly rivalry but this is absolutely no way to treat a customer. His demeanor and attitude was disgusting during the entirety of our meal. Needless to say we left after our meal and watched the game elsewhere.
