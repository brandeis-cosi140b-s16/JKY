Bacon wrapped crab stuffed shrimp, spicy cerviche (sp?), delish Mexican beer served with salt and lime, casual experience with a nice patio.  When I am looking for a little seafood and some day drinking this is the place for me.  It is pretty bare bones, but it is clean and well run, my service has always been great, but I usually sit at the bar.  Try this little place out, you will be very happy you did.
