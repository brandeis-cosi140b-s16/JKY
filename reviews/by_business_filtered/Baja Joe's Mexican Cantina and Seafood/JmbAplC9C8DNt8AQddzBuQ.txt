Usually love this place. Went on Sunday for dinner. The food was not up to normal standards nor was the service. The chimichangas were too crisp and burned on the bottom. The fajita burrito meat had little flavor. I think the salsa was missing something too because it just tasted like tomatoes. I think the server forgot about us as we had to ask busser for drink refills and chips.  Also had to wait an extended period for our check. Will probably go back since it is close to home but the restaurant definitely has fallen on our list.
