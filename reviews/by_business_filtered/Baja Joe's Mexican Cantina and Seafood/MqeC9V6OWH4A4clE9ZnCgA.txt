This place is great! I can enthusiastically recommend everything we ordered: the table-side guacamole, the fish chimichanga, and the bacon-wrapped crab-stuffed shrimp. BACON-WRAPPED? CRAB-STUFFED? Yes. Seriously. Good quality seafood, flavorful and unique dishes, awesome service, nice clean atmosphere, aquatic murals. I'm glad we gave this place a try.
