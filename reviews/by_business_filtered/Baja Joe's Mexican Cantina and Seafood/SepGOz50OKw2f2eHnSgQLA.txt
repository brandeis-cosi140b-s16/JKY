3 1/2 stars, down from 4 for the food because of the slow service. Good food, good setting with lots of TVs, excellent hot salsa.

I went here for lunch on a Saturday with family. We sat down and waited for quite a while before being acknowledged by any of the staff. The staff got our orders correct and responded to our requests, but always in a rather slow fashion. They certainly were in no hurry.

The food was good. We asked for the spicy salsa to go with the chips they bring out at the beginning of the meal, and it was probably my favorite thing from the whole meal (but challenged closely by the carnitas burro). Not only was it the spice level I like (decently spicy, but not uncomfortable), but the flavor was excellent. I ordered two tacos (one grilled fish and one chicken) and the carnitas burro. The fish taco was decent, although the piece of fish in it was rather small. The chicken made me a little unsure as to whether it was breaded and fried or grilled, but with some of that salsa on it, it was pretty decent. But the star of my meal was the carnitas burro. It had an excellent flavor to it, and the carnitas had a nice texture that carnitas should have. My friend had the fajitas, which came out sizzling and looked pretty solid. There were lots of brightly-colored peppers to go with the steak, and the guacamole was good.

All in all, this is a solid choice for Mexican food in this part of town. Just don't be in a rush when you come here.
