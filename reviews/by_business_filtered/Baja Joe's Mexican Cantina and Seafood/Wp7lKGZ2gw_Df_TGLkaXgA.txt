We love Baja Joe's! Cute patio that is relaxing with nice adirondack-style chairs and low tables for relaxing with drinks as well as booths and tables for dining. Misters and cover make it bearable in the summer, and always great in the winter. Salsa is deliciously fresh. Every time I have gone, I have had a seafood dish and none have disappointed. All wait staff has been friendly and even humor my kids (that love telling silly jokes). I have had the chef come to my table a few times to see how we liked the food - always great!

My fave dishes:
Kids fish nuggets
Stuffed peppers
Seafood in coconut
Seafood rice.
