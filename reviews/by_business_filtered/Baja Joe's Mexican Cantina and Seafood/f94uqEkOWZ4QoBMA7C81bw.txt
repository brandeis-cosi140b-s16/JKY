We so enjoy this venue for excellent service and delicious food!  Everything from the chips/salsa, grilled fish tacos, fish soup, chicken enchiladas, machaca burros and the flan are so very tasty!  Their side salads are beautifully presented and fresh!  Judy, Sandra, Mercedes and Fabi are always pleasant, friendly and attentive!  Must compliment this venue for cleanliness!  We find ourselves dining at Baja Joe's several times per week..... No equal in the east valley!
