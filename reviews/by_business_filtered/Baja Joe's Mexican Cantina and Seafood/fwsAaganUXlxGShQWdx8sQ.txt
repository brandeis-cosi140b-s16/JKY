Love the food.  Yes it's in a bar but their food is actually really good. This is not a Mexican restaurant where I order a meat taco and enchiladas.  This is a place where you get their specialties such as the carne asad√° plate (special marinade and grilled) of you order their seafood dishes. Excellent seafood soups too such as soup of the 7 seas...  Drinks are good but service is slow. It's still worth the wait if you aren't in the fast food style mood. The table side guacamole is a must...
