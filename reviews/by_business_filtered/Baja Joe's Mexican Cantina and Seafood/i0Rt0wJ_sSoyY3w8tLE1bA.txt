My fianc√© and I wanted to check this place out on date night. We usually go to a spot in Phoenix but neither one of us felt like driving that far tonight. I am a huge fan of ceviche and I love real Mexican seafood. I've got to say, I was not impressed with this place at all. Shrimp did not taste fresh, octopus was rubbery, bland, flavorless. This is FAR from real Mexican seafood. Everything is Americanized. Also, service was very slow. Save yourself the disappointment. I will be making the drive to Mariscos Playa Hermosa from now on.
