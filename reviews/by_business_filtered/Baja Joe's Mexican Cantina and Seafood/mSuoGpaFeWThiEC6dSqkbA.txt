I wish I could have eaten more! Stopped here with either a Yelp Deal or Groupon, can't remember which, during a long road trip last summer. My wife and I had just spent some time hiking around the Superstition Mountains and the heat had really drained us. We brought our two dogs along, and they were willing to let us have them in the patio seating area, but it was full. So, we ate inside and left the dogs in the car - the sun had gone down at that point. The portions were enormous! And so tasty! I wish I could go back right now!
