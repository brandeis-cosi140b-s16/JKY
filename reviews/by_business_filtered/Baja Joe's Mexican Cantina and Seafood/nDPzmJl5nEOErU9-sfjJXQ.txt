Food and drinks really are awesome. Even the standard house margaritas are worth the money. Sadly the service is hit, or usually, miss. Being a neighborhood bar/restaurant it is largely "regular" customers which is great for them, but the staff I feel is used to serving people who will tolerate bad service (on account that they are familiar with the staff) we always sit at the bar BTW. Tonight we had great food and drink but the restaurant busser JOHNNY took better (and the only) care of us than the bartender Mary. The manager was out and around 3 times  which blows my mind that he "observed" everything to be satisfactory.  I want to note, I am a very understanding bartender....the service just sucks. 

We will be back. This is out neighborhood spot. We just wish the service was consistent 

Lastly, the bar staff should put their phones away, or at least save it for downtime.
