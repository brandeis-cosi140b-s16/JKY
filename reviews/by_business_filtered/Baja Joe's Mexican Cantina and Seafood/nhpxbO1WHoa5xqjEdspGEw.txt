A coworker and I came for a bite to eat during lunch on a weekday, and we weren't let down. Lola, our waitress, was awesome and on top of things. The salsa was tasty (a tad watery), and the chips were warm. The ceviche was a bit rubbery (mostly shrimp), but I still ate it. My fish tacos (fried, even though I asked for grilled) were okay, but you need to try their hot sauce and chipotle sauce in the squeeze bottles. They were so good! I would kill for the recipes. They definitely saved the tacos.

I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but it was definitely a solid choice for lunch. PS, there's $1 off if you check in on yelp :)
