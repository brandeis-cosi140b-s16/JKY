I'm actually jealous everyone else had such a good experience!  My experience...not so good.  My brother recommend this place and has been sent a nasty text message. 

We arrived for the game (I know, I don't know why I watch the Cards either) and had been told during the game, it was 1/2 off appetizers.  So, I got the Original Large Ceviche but it arrived 30 minutes after our arrival, and while we were sitting there steaming from not having received our meal.  Two other tables, one that arrived about 15 minutes after us, got their meals before us (even the ceviche they ordered and again, before we got ours).  So, we chilled a bit and took some bites of the ceviche...well...UGH...no deveining.  Most people would not notice because they cut the shrimp into small bites, but I always look for it.  Ewwww!  No reason not to devein, they charge enough for the item ($12.99), they should make it right!

Well, since our order never came, it was almost 40 minutes after we had ordered, we had 3 bowls of chips and salsa, watching a game I didn't enjoy nor understand (I don't speak Spanish) and we had to sit there and watch Soccer on (I think) Univision, (which I didn't understand since 1/2 price appetizers where for the Cards game), the little girl at the table next to me had let out her 8th high-pitched wail, we were done and left.   I left a tip for the water, chips and salsa, but I was NOT going to pay for yucky ceviche.  

It's not a place I would ever even give another chance too.  The food being brought to other tables didn't even look good, not impressed.  Go at your own risk, don't expect too much though.  

Again, this was my experience and it may or may not have been unique.  I would not go here again, and my brother owes me some gas money with a sprinkle for chips and salsa!
