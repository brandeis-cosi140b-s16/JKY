Went to Baja Joes for lunch.  I ordered the two fish tacos lunch special.  It was okay.  It is worth noting that there is no host at the door, and there were many people waiting to be acknowledged including me.  They need to be more attentive.  

If you want Mexican style seafood go elsewhere.  Thanks.

The following is update to my review.  It is correspondence from whom I believe to be the owner of this business.  Apparently the owner has chosen to harass those who write negative reviews.  I do not normally post nasty responses that I receive, but I think it is noteworthy.  My advice to the person below is to please refrain from these kinds of attacks and work on improving your business.  Also, please cease and desist in your harassment of me.  I will reciprocate in-kind and cease and desist.  The exact message with the contents has been reported to Yelp HQ.  Please refer to below for what the message stated.  I will leave it at that.

funny how you went to both our restaurant AND our old owners on the same day and get us a horrible review and them a glowing one. Â not suspicious in the least
