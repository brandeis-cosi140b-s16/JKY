The food here is really good!  I had the ceviche tostadas and rice and beans and I ate every bite!  The chips are home made and yummy. Overall I want to try a million things on the menu. Big menu too lots of Baja style seafood!  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the service was slow and lacking. We stood at the door for 5 min and no one told us to seat ourselves even though staff walked past us several times without saying anything. Our waitress took forever. We were there nearly 2 hrs for lunch. Then had to wait 15 min for the waitress to bring our check after we already told her we were done. The prices are good. And their lunch combos are only $5.99
