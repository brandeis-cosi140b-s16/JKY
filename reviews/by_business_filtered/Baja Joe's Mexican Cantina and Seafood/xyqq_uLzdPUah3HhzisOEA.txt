Don't come to this place unless you pay cash. The food was alright, I had the campechana especial, and my son had the chicken nuggets. Before placing my order, I had asked the waitress that was attending to the table I was at, her name is Janet, to please separate my son's and my order from the everyone else's bill, she refused to separate it, why? I don't know. Once coming to paying though, I asked her to give me my bill of what I had and my son had, and she wouldn't listen to me, she was looking at the other people I was sitting with, who told her not to, and I directly told her to ignore them that I was going to pay for my food which I had consumed as well as my sons. I handed her my card, told her to swipe it for MY bill, and instead she charged me the WHOLE tables bill, which was 202.49, when she brought me the ticket for me to sign, I was baffled on how she misunderstood me. I asked her to refund me the 202.49 back to my card, and charge me what I owed, she "refunded" it, charged me 33.99 for what I ate. I check my bank account, and it's -112 dollars because of the 202 pending on my account. Keep in mind I went Saturday June 20th, 2015 called the restaurant that same day after I left and spoke to Javier the general manager, who told me that it would drop off by Monday morning, I believed him, on Monday it still hadn't dropped off, went to the restaurant, apparently Javier was out of town, so I had to speak to David the bar manager, who told me they would do anything in their power to fix it. And blamed my bank for holding the funds. Tuesday came by and still nothing. Now it's Wednesday June 24th, and it's STILL pending, I already went to my bank and the fault is in part of the business Baja Joe's, on my bank records, it showed that the amount of 202.49 was charged and approved, leaving me with a negative balance and a HORRIBLE experience. I am left to suffer because of Baja Joe's staff, who chose not to listen to her customer. Clearly they need to train their staff how to properly refund people, and to actually listen to their customers.

Update to June 25th 2015
I was called by the owner, he claimed that he wanted to apologize to me for what happened, but instead I was told I had no human compassion and an irresponsible mother, I was not expecting a phone call. He did apologize, but apologies do not fix his staffs mistakes. I understand we are all human, and we are imperfect as a species, but when someone asks you to let them pay for the food they have consumed, let them pay. I would never want anyone to come here not as a personal vendetta, but to save them from a headache that lasts for days and being harassed by the owner of the company himself. Baja Joe's owner, I hope you learn from your staffs mistake, to train them properly for these situations, because as you so clearly pointed out when you called me you yourself have been in those types of situations multiple times. How could I not be angry when was the one being punished by your companys actions? Leaving me without the ability to even use my own money, because of your negligence of training your staff properly? To those of you thinking about coming to visit this restaurant, I hope you don't have the same issue as I did, pay cash if you must.
