It's right near my house so we tried it out. The food is good. They have different specials for almost every day of the week, which is nice. They also have a nice happy hour and Margarita Wednesday! We just moved to AZ three weeks ago and have been here twice already. It's a nice atmosphere and the staff are friendly as well.
