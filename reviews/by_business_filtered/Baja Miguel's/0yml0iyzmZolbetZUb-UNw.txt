Baja Miguel's reminds me of Don Miguel's restaurant in the Orlean's hotel. (anything catchy in the names ???) 
In fact, the entire Southpoint Hotel reminds me of the Orlean's - just newer.  
Both Hotels the same room layouts which are really quite large and nice. And .... they have exactly the same type Mexican restaurant. 
I really like the service at Baja Miquels much better and they do have quite a display of Margaritas. The food is very good. They will bring you as many bowls of chips and salsa as you can handle.
The Margaritas are quite tasty.
If you stay at the hotel there are a couple of coupons that make your dining stay a bit lighter in the wallet, however the prices are very resonable for the portion size.
A very nice, very average Mexican restaurant.
