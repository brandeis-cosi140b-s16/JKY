My boyfriend and I ate here last Saturday night, while staying at South Point for the first time. South Point isn't a great hotel, but it sure does off a variety of very inexpensive restaurant options, including Baja Miguel's.

I was generous with my rating, because my boyfriend thought that the Shrimp Diablo dish was the best Mexican food that he has ever eaten. Ever! He definitely wants to come back here. I had a shredded beef taco and cheese enchilada combo. It was good, but nothing extra special. It certainly wasn't something that would make me want to rush back.

They do make great tortilla chips that are very light and salty, served with a dipping trio of salsa, beans and guacamole. Very good.

I have several margaritas at the bar during our trip and they were strong and cheap.

My biggest impression of South Point was the inexpensive food and alcohol. Stay here and feast for pennies. Seriously great values to be had and most of the food was good too. 

The decor looks like something from a cruise ship, especially the bar outside of the restaurant. Garish color scheme and just bad design. The restaurant was also kept ridiculously cold and I spent the meal shivering.

Friendly, lightening fast service.
