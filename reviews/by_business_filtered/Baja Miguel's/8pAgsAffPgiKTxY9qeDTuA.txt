We ordered the $8.95 luncheon special that includes a margarita, fideo soup and a 2-item combination.  We went with a traditional margarita on the rocks and chile relleno/enchilada for our combo.  The margarita and soup were good, but Miguel's interpretation of Tex-Mex was pretty typical (e.g. mediocre) for a casino eatery.
