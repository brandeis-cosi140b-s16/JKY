Baja Miguel's has been a local favorite of our family for about 7 years and we've been steady customers.  We've always enjoyed the food for the value and we've referred countless friends to the restaurant.  We ate there tonight for an early Father's Day celebration.  We were shocked to learn that when we requested more chips and salsa, we'd be charged $7.95 for the next round.  Huh?  Then my mom requested a little extra lettuce with her taco and she was informed that would cost $1.75.  At that we asked for the manager.  We have never incurred such charges before and the manager, who was not the regular manager we're accustomed to dealing with, told us they have been charging for those items for a long time.  Wrong!  We have never once been charged for extra chips and salsa or for a little extra lettuce.  Although we enjoyed our meals, to the tune of $80 with tip for 4, I don't think we'll be coming back here any time soon.  I understand times are tough, but come on!  We're not the type of folks who complain about paying money for decent food and we tip well.  But when a restaurant starts being so tight about every little item, it takes the fun out of going there.  Too bad.
