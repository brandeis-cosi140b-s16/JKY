The food is ok. I appreciate the chips with sides of bean dip, salsa, and guacamole was placed on the table when we sat down. The staff was friendly. The female 'busser' wore a scented lotion that was very strong and competed with the smell of the food. I mentioned this to her and she made excuses about her hands being dry instead of washing it off. The staff kept talking about how they wanted chocolate that the man from the reservation booth was carrying around in a bag. It is noisy in the restaurant and you can overhear other diner's conversations. They have tables with armless chairs and booths.
