always the first dinner of the Vegas stay while at southpoint! love the free margarita  coupon, and the trio of dips with the chips...ordered the 2 taco meal, but the waiter brought me the 3 taco plate, saying it was the same price..have always known this, but thought it was nice of him to give me the better bargain lol....all Southpoint stays will always include a meal here!
