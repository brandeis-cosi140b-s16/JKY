I wasn't expecting much when I walked in, but the food was pretty good. Everyone at my table preferred the bean dip over the salsa && guac, but neither were bad. We all ordered tacos, which were good. I also had a pork tamale which was okay, and a taste of the shrimp ceviche was also decent. A few gripes, the floor was dirty, our servers were not the friendliest, but not terrible, and they don't have anything a la carte.
