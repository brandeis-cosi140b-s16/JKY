My Mr. and I were absolutely ravenous and decided on Baja Miguel's due to convenience, as it is located in the South Point hotel we stayed at for our trip to attend the 11th ACR Ball. While deciding on our entree, the server brought an awesome spread of complimentary guacamole, bean dip, salsa, and chips. We decided on the sizzling fajita platter, which is more than enough for two. It was divine!  The margarita on the rocks was great too. Our server was awesome! I will definitely return if I stay at the South Point again.
