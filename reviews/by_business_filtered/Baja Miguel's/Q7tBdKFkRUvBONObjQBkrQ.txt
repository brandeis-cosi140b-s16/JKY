I've had Mexican food before but nothing like this place. First they bring chips and salsa to your table, but not just salsa, guacamole and refried beans for dipping that is out of this world and it's complimentary !  Since we're staying at the resort we get coupons for a free margaritas. Our entrees of chicken enchiladas were delicious!  Our server Octavio was very pleasant and courteous.
