We've been coming here now for over 5 years. Good food, fast service, and friendly staff.  You'll enjoy this Mexican restaurant that's upstairs in the South Point Casino.  

Just outside of the restaurant you can get the happy hour menu from Baja Miguel's.   Great deals and good staff.  We will continue to come back again and again.
