My boyfriend and I paid our bill - I put 7$ in cash and asked to put the rest on the card for a 23$ bill. We get the receipt back to sign and it has charged my boyfriends card the full bill. The guy assumed the 7$ was his tip. Dude your service was good but not 30% gratuity good. Probably the last time I'll be here.
