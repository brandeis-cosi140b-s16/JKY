Several friends and I went to Baja Miguel's Saturday for Cinco de Mayo. Everyone at our table raved about the food and the huge portions. I had the combo plate consisting of a  beef taco, beef enchilada with sides of Spanish rice and refried beans. Massive amount of food and every bit of it perfectly done.  The Albondigas Soup, which  has always been a favorite of mine is just so-so here so skip it.  
The dishes came out very hot and no one had any complaints whatever. 

Just a word about bean dip that comes out as you're seated:  AWESOME!!  We could have made a meal out of that dip and chips.  There is a guacamole and red salsa along with the bean dip but who noticed??  

 The service here is terrific.  This was my first time here but certainly won't be my last.
