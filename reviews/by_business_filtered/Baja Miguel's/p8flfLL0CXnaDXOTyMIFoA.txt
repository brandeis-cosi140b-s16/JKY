The lunch special is a fantastic deal! Wednesday through Sunday from 11am-5pm they have a deal for $9.95 that includes a frozen Margarita, Fideo soup, and your choice of two items from: beef, chicken, or cheese enchilada; chicken, ground or shredded beef taco; chicken or beef flautas; chili relleno. The free chips served as an appetizer were yummy too and included beans, salsa, and guac. Coming back for the daily special in the future!
