Your basic mass produced Mexican food. The waiter's face, Vincente, turned all twisted crazy when I asked for the veggie burrito in corn instead of a flour tortilla. Then oh duh ma'am just get the veggie fajitas with corn instead of flour tortillas. He was so unwittingly rude it was comical. For real, he was clueless. The margaritas were pretty darn good.....that or the fact I've been in "i need a drink" mode since Tuesday night with CES trade show madness and all liquor sounds dreamy.
It was ok food.
Silverware was really clean.
