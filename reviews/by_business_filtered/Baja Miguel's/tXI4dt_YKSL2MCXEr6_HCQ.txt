Food: 3.5 Stars
Service: 0 stars

I ate here while staying at South Point Hotel in Vegas and was quite disappointed by the way my meal turned out. The food was pretty decent with the hearty portions and a killer chips and dip, but the service was dreadful. We waited forever to order our food and didn't get our water until mid-way through the meal. Our waiter kept apologizing for how slow the service is (clearly a bad sign) and in the end we just gave the bill to the bus boy after waiting forever for our waiter. I would not recommend this place.
