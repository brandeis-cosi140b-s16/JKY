While on vacation with family, we decided to try out Baja Miguel's. I have a gluten intolerance (not celiac) so I'm used to limited options while eating out. When I asked the hostess if they had a gluten free menu, the answer was no. I was fully prepared to figure something out on my own but she quickly told me they would accommodate me. When we were seated, I was told I could eat the chips and salsa but not the guacamole or beans because of how they were prepared. I was ecstatic that they were so informed and really seemed to care about my concerns. They even brought me my own bean dip without gluten.

When Octavio, our server, came out he again checked with me and even told me the marinade used on the meat has soy sauce in it. Since I couldn't eat that he had the chef prepare an unmarinated meat for me and even included fresh avocado in place of the guacamole I couldn't eat (I had the chicken fajita salad and it was delicious). I was so impressed by his knowledge and the fact that he really cared for my dietary concerns. I will definitely come back again. This was one of the best dining experiences I have had since being diagnosed gluten intolerant.
