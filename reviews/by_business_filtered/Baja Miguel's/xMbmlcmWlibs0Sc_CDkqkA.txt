Baja Miguel's is one of Las Vegas' best kept secrets.  Located on the second floor of Southpoint casino and hotel, it has always provided fresh, tasty food and very rarely have we had to wait.  

They start with a first class chip and tri-fecta of dips, guacamole, hot bean and medium salsa.  Today I was treated to carnitas and my girlfriend went with the tried and true chile rellano.  Her dish was excellent, as usual.  While I've been pleasantly surprised in the past with the beef and chicken dishes, today's faring was a bit dry, if not tasty.  The pork portions were good sized for the price and the rice and beans were a nice side.  

The service has always been challenging at this venue.  While not necessarily slow, the servers seems to have a chip on their shoulder and almost act bored.  The one standout today was the busboy.  He was quick, efficient, polite and friendly.  I had a flashback that they could have used a bit of Ricardo Montalban in Fantasy Island, when he says, as the plane approaches, "Smile, everyone, Smile!".
