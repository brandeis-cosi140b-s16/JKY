The avocado shrimp dish was delish but I was really upset with their service. When I walked up I told them I needed it to go. She said fine but I had to sit down and then ask for a to go box and said while I wait they serve  chips. The chips never came so when they brought the plate of food and the to go box for me to transfer the food to I asked for some chips that I would have gotten while waiting. They said hou don't get the chips when itsqto go, same price for the meal  it no chips. They went and asked someone else and came back and   and said again no chips. I couldn't believe the rudeness. Over 50 cents of chips. I had to go to the casino gift shop and spend $4 for a bag of chips to go with my Mexican .meal!
