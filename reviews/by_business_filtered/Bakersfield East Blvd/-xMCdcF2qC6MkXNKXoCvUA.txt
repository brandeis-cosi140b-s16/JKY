Tacos. Tequila. Whiskey. How could that combo be bad? 

I was truly hoping that Bakersfield could be "the" place that replaced the likes of Pinche Taco in Denver. The evening didn't start well. Parking is a hot mess but that is just the area. They do offer complimentary valet out of the Berrybrook lot across the street. Limited street parking is it for people that aren't keen on valet.

We started with a Don Julio tequila flight, a cerveza and chips & guac ($7). Honestly, I found it irritating that chips and salsa weren't gratis. I really enjoyed the guac. It was super chunky with the right amount of lime, salt and cilantro. They brought bottles of salsa to go with the tacos, so I sampled those with chips. The green salsa was incredibly mild and slightly bland. The red salsa had a nice smoky flavor and subtle spiciness. 

We ordered an assortment of tacos - pork belly pastor, fish taco, short rib, and a spicy pork. They were served family style on a platter. The food had a visual appeal but none of them blew me away. Especially for $4 a pop. 

Overall, they were close to meeting the 4 star mark. Drop the prices and bring me chips & salsa on the house.
