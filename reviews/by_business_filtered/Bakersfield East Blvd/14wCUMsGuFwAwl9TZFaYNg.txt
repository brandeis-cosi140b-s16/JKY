Tacos are delicious and the margaritas are a must. They have a great atmosphere and good crowd whatever night you go. I've been luck to find a spot at the at the bar every time I've gone, but if you're not that lucky, just grab a drink and wait until they give you a call to go to your table. Once you order your food the wait isn't long at all. There's valet parking across the street so you don't have to worry about parking which I heard was a big deal at the previous restaurants at this location.
