I love the atmosphere. I love the food and my god the margarita pitchers... But. It's set up to be more of a bar, getting a table could take over an hour Thursday-Saturday. Not enough tables and too many people set up at a table and stay for hours just drinking. Which only frustrates me because it's a good place. But it does keep me from attempting to go there on the weekends.
