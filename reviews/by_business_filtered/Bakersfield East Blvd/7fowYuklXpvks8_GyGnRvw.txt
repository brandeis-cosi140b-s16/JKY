What a great new treat to East Blvd.  We arrived on a Friday night around 7:00pm and was told it was a 10 minute wait, not bad at all. We proceeded to the bar, which is amazing. A great wrap around bar with a long communal standing table on one side.  It was crowded, but we were able to sneak in at the counter and order drinks. I chose the house margarita, WOW, loved it! It was definitely made fresh and had a great tequila kick.  My friend ordered a beer, which they do offer a great selection.  After around 10 minutes we were seated at a high table in the front of the restaurant. We started with the chips, salsa and guacamole. All great!  As for entrees, I chose the Mole Taco and the Tostado. The others ordered a variety of tacos.  I will say the Tostado was AMAZING. Black beans with chicken on a lightly fried tortilla, it was one of the best I have ever had. As for the tacos everyone said the Mole and the Short Rib were the best. The service was great too, a definite added bonus.  Only downfall, the TVs and noise level was very high, we felt like we were screaming the entire time.  However, the food was well worth another visit and a new frequent stop for those of us who live in the Dilworth area.  Thank you Bakersfield.
