Mexican, you have my heart wrapped up like a perfect burrito. Well Bakersfield focuses on tacos, but you catch my drift. On a hunt for Mexican Liz and I stumbled on this place, new to East Blvd. but it's actually a small chain for what I Googled. The place was packed, not too surprisingly for a Saturday night and a 30 minute wait, not bad. 

The decor is cool, rustic, with Edison bulbs hanging and thick wooden slabs as the table, I liked the place. A small tapas style place, Liz and I got the cheese dip, guac and a few tacos. We decided not to indulge in a Margarita, even though they looked good! We stuck to eating our calories. Our service was fast and friendly, always a good thing for a new restaurant. 

The guacamole was fresh, chunky and a tad spicy. The Cheese dip was different, not a white creamy kind usually found in southern Mexican joints. It actually tasted more like real cheese, it was filling, just not what I was expecting. 

The el pastor taco with pineapple was deli-sh as well as the fish tacos. I'm sure we will be visiting this place again. 

Warning- Be careful where you park since this location doesn't have a parking lot. We parked int he Harris teeter lot ( and they didn't like that very much ) Also, they don't have outdoor seating.
