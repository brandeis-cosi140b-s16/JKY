On an impulse, we decided to go out to dinner on a Saturday night and I am so glad we came here. Thinking we would not be in luck to find a place, we took a chance based on the photos. Delicious! We ordered an assortment of tacos and cocktails. Not a single thing we wouldn't order again. I had both short rib tacos, side of guac, and a ros√© sangria. Meat was tender and plenty, guac was well seasoned and bright green (no tomatoes like it should be). I want to recreate that sangria at home and drink it for the rest of the summer. The tacos are small (two bites each) but between everything we ordered as a group no one was complaining about being hungry. The queso we had was thick and stringy; not like the canned cheese you'd get at the movies. So, so good. can't wait to return. Love that we had no wait and the windows are open so you sit inside but feel the air. Parking was ok, they offer valet but we parked on a side street. If you are finally ready to break away from the bonds of Chipotle but are scared nothing will compare - try this place.
