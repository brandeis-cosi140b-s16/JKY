FANTASTIC! These are the best margarita's in Charlotte BY FAR. No mix, just tequila and lime. Absolutely amazing. Also, there is a full  menu of tequila, and whiskey, with available flights to order. Plenty of variety for whisky and tequila lovers alike. 

Despite the drinks, the food is to die for! Fresh and flavorful ingredients, unique and vibrant flavors: makes for an unforgettable meal.
