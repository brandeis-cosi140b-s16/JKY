This place has a cool vibe to it. So it fits in the with the south end. Young good looking staff. 
 Now for the food. Most, if not all items are "a la carte". My family is currently obsessed with tacos "al pastor". The tacos are $3 each and 3 filled up my 18 year old son. Not cheap, but what is anymore! I had a bite, and I thought they were good, not great. The bits of pineapple were a nice touch. I had a short rib torta, which I thought was delicious. The margaritas were nice and strong. All in all, if you want some descent California style Mexican food and are leery of going into an authentic taqueria because of the language barrier, try Bakersfield east.
