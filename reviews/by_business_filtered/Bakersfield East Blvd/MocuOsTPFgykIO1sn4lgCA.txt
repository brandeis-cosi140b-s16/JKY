I tried this place after hearing from someone that they have authentic Mexican tacos. Being that I love Mexican food I knew I had to try this place. I had the Rajas Taco which was delicious along with the Papas tostadas. The corn tortillas are delicious and are made in house and the taco was great. My favorite though was the Papas tostadas it was so delightful to my taste buds to keep my food vegan I just ask them to remove the creamy cilantro sauce and cheese and topped my food with there red salsa sauce that was amazing! The only downside is the parking but other than that this is a cool spot!
