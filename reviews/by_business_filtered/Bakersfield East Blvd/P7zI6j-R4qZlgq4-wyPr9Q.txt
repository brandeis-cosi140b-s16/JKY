Went there today for lunch and it was a really cool place with friendly staff and roll up glass garage doors opened to East Blvd, nice atmosphere, good chips and salsa. 
Unfortunatley it was nowhere near the BEST fish tacos in Charlotte like someone had  told me.   My  $4.00 Mahi taco only had a single finger sized piece of deep fried Mahi, raw corn tortilla, and  just tasted ok.  

I'm sure it would be a fun place to get a drink and watch a game.

Cabo Fish tacos still has the best by far in my opinion.
