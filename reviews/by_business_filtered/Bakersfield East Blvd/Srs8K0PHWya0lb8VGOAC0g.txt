With a name like "Bakersfield", I have to admit I wasn't immediately thinking great taco place.  That said, after going there I can say that this is a great taco place!

It's located right in the middle of Dilworth on East Blvd.  Parking is trouble but they have free valet right across the street.  It's a pretty cool vibe on the inside, looks very modern and hip and all those other buzz words to describe the types of places that yuppies enjoy.  

One of the things I really like about this place is that the tacos are a la carte so you can go your own way and mix and max.  My favorites thus far are the pork belly pastor and the fish taco.  

Another thing about this place is that they serve the hell out of some whiskey and tequila.  So that's cool.

Apparently Bakersfield has locations in other cities, but it still doesn't feel like a chain-type place so that is a plus.  Good tacos at a reasonable price is always a winner for me.
