Every time I have gone for food, I am disappointed. Their tacos just aren't my cup of tea. Unless your meal consists entirely of queso cheese (straight cheese -- none of the fancy toppings). Then you will be in heaven because it's excellent. If you're looking for a lively atmosphere to grab a drink, they fit the bill. Just plan on a little bit of a wait on weekends.
