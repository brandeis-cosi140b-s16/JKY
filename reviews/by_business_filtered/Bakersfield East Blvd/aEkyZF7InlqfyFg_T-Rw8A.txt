I drive past this place nearly every day at lunch and it looks empty inside unless the garage doors are rolled up but my friends have said this place is a great Dilworth spot at night. Our group headed up from the burbs on a Saturday night. We had 6 and they don't take reservations. The wait was 75 minutes and that was cool since we were not in a rush. Lighting is cool and it was very busy but not uncomfortably crowded.  The girls found seats at the corner of the bar and the guys bellied up to a "trough" bar top nearby. Bar service was quick and it was noisy but fun. After we were seated we started out with fresh chunky guac, creamy queso and a green salsa that was tasty. The menu is small but varied enough. I had the spicy pork tacos which were hot but not over the top. The short rib taco was my second taco and this was delectable. Highly recommend. At the table several ordered the  fish tacos and were happy with the choice. It was a great group night and didn't break the bank. Considering I ate 17 lbs of chips and dip two tacos were plenty of food. Enjoy!
