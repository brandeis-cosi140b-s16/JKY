Great addition to the vibrant Dillworth scene, this Cal-Mex (not really Tex Mex) place has a limited menu but it seems that they do that on purpose to focus in on quality. And the food is definitely quality as they make their own chips, tortillas and breads. We got a boatload of items, starting with the Queso and Chorizo with fresh tortilla chips. Great flavor but we felt it could have used more heat, so we added some of their roasted red pepper sauce. Followed that with their Short Rib Torta, which was outstanding! Super tender and fkavorful....not sure of the arugula though. Next was the Tostada with chicken. That was pretty good, nice flavor especially when adding the fresh lime they give you. Now for the tacos. I know....we're pigs...oink oink oink. Had the Chicken Mole and Pork Pastor. The pork taco was better. Being from Chicago and my buddy being from NYC our definition of Mole is FAR different than Bakersfield's. Their mole jyst didn't have the requisite "sweet heat" that defines mole. There was too much chocolate and it wasn't Mexican chocolate. Honestly just not a very good Mole.

Other than that this is a solid 4 star restaurant. Note that you most likely will be sitting family style with strangers....but after the meal you won't be strangers no more.
