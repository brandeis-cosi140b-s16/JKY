I loved the ambiance of the place first of all. The low lighting and cool light bulbs made for a modern chic feeling, but the Johnny Cash and June Carter playing in the background completed the rockabilly whiskey and tequila drinking theme. The hardwood floors and seating arrangements were nice and made the place feel comfortable.

Started off with a pitcher of bakersfield margaritas which hit the spot right away. I'd had a long weekend on my feet, and my friend had just gotten off the interstate from a long distance haul, so this 64 oz concoction of tequila and fresh sour mix was much needed. Pretty cool that it comes with a huge paddle of a spoon to play with (at least that's what I did with it), though I'm sure it's truly meant for stirring purposes. 

Ordered some guacamole to accompany said beverages, and it was tasty and fresh. huge Chunks of avocado lead me to believe they don't use the crap that comes out of a bag. For entrees we ordered (from most favorite to least) the mole, conchinita pibil, short rib, and fish tacos, which were served "family style". Mole sauce was perfect, and the meat was tender. The habe√±ero sauce on the pibil taco lends it the perfect kick at the end of your bite. Loved it. Short rib with the radish was great, but it just tasted like short rib, and nothing more. I wanted to love the fish taco, but didn't. Perhaps I'm just a picky fish taco eater,  but I've had way better. The slaw, however, was a nice refreshing crunch of a bite.

Service was great from the time we walked in the door,  to the time we walked out the door. They'd only been open a week- so the staff seemed a little intense, but I think that intensity will calm once the place gets settled. Will definitely be coming back as I enjoyed my meal over all, and the reprieve the margaritas offered!!
