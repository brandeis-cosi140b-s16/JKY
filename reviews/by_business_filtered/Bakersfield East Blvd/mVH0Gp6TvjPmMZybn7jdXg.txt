Awesome atmosphere!!! Garage doors are a welcomed change to this unit space. MAJOR UPGRADE from the previous restaurants here. Great service! Guacamole and queso was truly on point. They play football games on Saturdays. Margaritas were fresh squeezed and great. I hope they get flour tortillas here soon... Corn tortillas are just not our thing. We'll be back!!!!
