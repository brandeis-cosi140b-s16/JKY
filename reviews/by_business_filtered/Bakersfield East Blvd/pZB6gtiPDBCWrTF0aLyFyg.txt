I'm in town for the weekend visiting friends from college. LOVED the ambiance of this restaurant! It was so chic and modern. The service here was wonderful! Our waitress was great, and the service from the bartender, and other waitstaff here was excellent.

The queso appetizer was absolutely delicious and I'd say the highlight of the meal! It was gone within a few minutes.

I ordered the papas tostadas & the short rib taco. I really enjoyed the short rib taco, the papas was alright. All of my friends really enjoyed their meals. 

Another highlight was the salsa sauces. Dangg were those delicious!! The green one... LAWD! I could not stop eating it and am embarrassed to say I used 3/4ths of the bottle. That itself was worth it! Soooo delicious, and fresh.

This would be a cute place for a date!
