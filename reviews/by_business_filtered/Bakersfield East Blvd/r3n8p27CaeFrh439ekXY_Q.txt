I read the reviews of Bakersfield before going so I feel like I had a pretty good idea of what the vibe was.  in keeping with the Old Western theme of the place, we will go with the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.  The good:  the interior is really cool- lots of wood with concrete counters to set your drink on in the bar area.  Our table was in the bar area and our service was good.  We started with queso and added the jalape√±os.  It was very good!  I also had the corn chowder (it was pretty good), the Pollo Rojo taco (again, pretty good), and the short rib taco (very tasty).  It is a little weird that your order is served all together on a tray with your entire party's order.  They call it "family style".  It's just odd.  The bad:  The noise!  I've been to loud restaurants, but this takes it to a whole different level.  I'm talking night club music blaring loud.  They play the music so loud that everyone has to talk really loud to hear each other, which just adds to the noise issue.  Our server could not hear us even when she was right next to us.  There is no reason in has to be so loud to the point that you can't hear each other.  The ugly:  the price of their "premium" margarita.  At $13.00 a drink, I've had better.  I would probably give this place 3 stars, but because of the noise level, I'm not sure we will be back.
