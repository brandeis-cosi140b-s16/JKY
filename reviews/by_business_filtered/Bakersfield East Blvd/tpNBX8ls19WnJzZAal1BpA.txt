I rarely write reviews but their customer service is amazing! We started with chips and queso with chorizo which was great! Our waitress was fantastic and accidentally brought out the wrong tacos but brought out the right ones shortly after and they were great! I, along with 2 others, enjoyed our tacos. All were fresh and full of flavor. We could not believe they took care of our tacos for the mix up!! The food was awesome and the drinks were great too! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone in the mood for great tacos and margaritas. The wait may be long but this is a great place to hang out with friends!
