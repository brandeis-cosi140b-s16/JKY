Second time here in 2 weeks. Great atmosphere with fast service. Went last night with a party of 7, ordered some apps and without even asking the waitress split the shared items amongst everyone. Coming from LA where it's like pulling teeth to get separate bills, this was amazing. The pork belly taco is by far the best! Highly recommend it. Will be back.
