Love the feel of a real Mexican cantina with the floor to ceiling open windows reminds us of places we've eaten at in Mexico. Most importantly we love the  fresh ingredients and the high quality food and cocktails. We've eaten here quite a few times since it opened and everytime I want to force myself to eat more because its so damn tasty! Right now, we can't get enough of the short rib taco, short rib sandwich for my hubby and the jalapeno margarita. The service is normally spot on but the one time we had an inconsistent experience, the owner rectified the situation immediately. Also very cool to have the chalk board in the back to occupy the kids. Love this place!
