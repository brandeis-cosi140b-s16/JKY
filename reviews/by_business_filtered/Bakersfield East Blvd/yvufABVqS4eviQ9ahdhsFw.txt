Tacos are a food group. Good thing as its 75% of the menu here. Tacos are $3-4 each but there is a lot going on in each bite. I loved their guac- chunky guac haters shut your mouth. More for me! Margaritas were on point here and the remodel is amazing. I remember the sticky floor place this used to be. I can't wait for spring for some lovely day drinking.
