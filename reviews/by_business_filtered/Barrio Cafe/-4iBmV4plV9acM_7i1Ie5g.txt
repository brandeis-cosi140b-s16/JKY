I wouldn't come to this restaurant unless you simply have no choice. The wait to get in was expected on a busy travel day. However what was unexpected was the lack of friendly service. I could have dealt with that. But once our drinks finally arrived there was a bug in the ice. After asking for a new cup we where informed that it's Knatt season????? Who cares just bring me a different cup. If anyone is interested they do offer just plain chips and Sala but heads up ITS $9.00 and there are no refills on the chips or the salsa the bowl is tiny not enough for one person to snack on. Only bright spot here was the Guacamole was freshly made. Which it better be for $13.00.
