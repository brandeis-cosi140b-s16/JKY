As I sit here at the barrio cafe I must say I'm really disappointed. The staff rushed me into a decision and didn't really answer some of the questions I had about the menu. The food is way over priced. I got the roasted pork plate because when I asked any questions about anything else the server just told me it was the best (its also the priciest of the options I was looking at). 
I originally wanted wine, but they were out of about half the options and I wasn't about to pay $15 for a glass of Mexican merlot.... My $12 blended margarita was semi runny but also hard to consume due to chunks of ice in it... I mean come on if you're going to over charge me at least give me something decent. 
My meal arrived about 120 seconds after I ordered it... I think I just paid $40 for fast food (that zucchini could not have possibly been cooked fresh...) 
Since I have been sitting here I have noticed rude staff (not necessarily to me but to others around me!) one of the gimmicks of this place I guess is that they make guac table side.... I straight up saw the host and a server get into an argument while the server was making the guac for a table next to me. 
No one smiles. No one accommodates. And my corn tortillas stuck together and ripped apart :( :( :( very sad I wasted my money here.
