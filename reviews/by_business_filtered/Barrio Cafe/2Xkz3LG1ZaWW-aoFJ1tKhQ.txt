Yeah.... I'm going to go ahead and rubber stamp all of the bad reviews on here. The house margarita was way too sour. Barely drinkable and tiny for $10. I ordered a side salad with my tacos which came barely dressed at all and had no flavor. The tacos I order were ok, but left me wanting more. I literally left here and went to another terminal with more options to get a second drinks and appetizer before my flight.
