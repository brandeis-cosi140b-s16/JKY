This is an airport bar with all the airport bar amenities. That means $10 draft beers and the oh-so-airport add of a mid-shelf shot for "only" $5. What. A. Deal. On the plus, the bartender was pleasant in the way bartenders are pleasant when they know beyond the shadow of a doubt there is a 0% chance you're a regular. Also, it's there. And it's the only place in that gate where you can get a drink. Beggars can't be choosers. Tip well and enjoy your nap on the plane.
