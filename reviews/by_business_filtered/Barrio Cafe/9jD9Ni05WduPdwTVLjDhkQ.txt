Five stars for food quality, variety, and atmosphere despite being in an airport. I am docking two stars for speed of service, price, and the general feeling that a portion of the wait staff were actually being held against their will. I felt genuinely forgot about in the latter part of our visit. This was, of course made up for, by the large quantity of butter packets that were thrust at me after requesting one. Otherwise, tasty stuff!
