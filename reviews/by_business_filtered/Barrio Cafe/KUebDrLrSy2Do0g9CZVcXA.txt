You expect horrible, overpriced food and awful service at any airport restaurant. Here, the food and service is great and the airport premium modest. They were able to do 3 tacos no dairy and Chris is a great server. Selfish, rude, entitled Yelpers ... Seriously. With a long wait between flights you could do far far worse.
