A bit of sticker shock when we sat down, but it was pretty good by Mex restaurant standards, with some interesting items you wouldn't see on most menus. Really good by airport standards, we were 4 for 4 on entrees we'd order again. Can't give it 5*, the price/value/food ratio is a little off, but I would (and will) repeat.
