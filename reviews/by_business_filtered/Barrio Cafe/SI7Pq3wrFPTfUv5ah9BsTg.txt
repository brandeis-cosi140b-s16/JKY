It was fairly good at first but my plate came with a lot of grease on it and after consuming half of my plate all that was left to taste was a overwhelming grease flavor. Also, the French press coffee (although it looks quite good) is not worth the $4 a cup.  There was a great amount of variety here though which was great to find and it was so close to my gate!
