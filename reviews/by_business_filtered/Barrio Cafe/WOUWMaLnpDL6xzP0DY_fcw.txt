Today I decided that I'm going to eat at a place I've never been. I'm at the D terminal so checked this place out. Was greeted and seated right away. I just ordered water for my drink and that came pretty fast too. 

Ordered their "famous" pork tacos with seasoned fries. The food came in literally minutes so that's great. Looked good and it smelled good. The fries came with spicy ketchup which was good but the fries were not crunchy on the outside. Seems like they have been waiting for me in the kitchen under the hot light. Seasoned? Deff not! I had to add salt. The "famous" pork? Not sure how bec there's no flavor on it. I had to add salt and I don't normally add salt to my food. It's just that there's no seasoning. I couldn't taste the flavors described on their menu. The corn tortillas tasted like they just took them out of the package. They didn't taste like they were even heated. The salsa was bland and by the way for a Mexican restaurant, they don't have rice and beans. 

For $15, deff not coming back. The service is good and fast, hence the two stars but I'm not spending $15 on tacos that don't have flavor.
