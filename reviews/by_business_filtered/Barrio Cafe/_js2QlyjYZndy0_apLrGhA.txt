I had dinner here once before earlier this year and found the food good...not great...good, in reading the menu I thought that I was In for a real treat....mom and pop restaurant does good with great food.

This time around not so good....I was hungry and Taco,s sounded great, one of the offerings that looked great were chicken tacos covered in a cilantro lime sauce and cheese....YUMMY!!! Not so much, the waitress was sweet and friendly, but the Tacos were tough and chewy...pre made, seemed frozen and reheated.....reheated to the point that the cheese was glued to the plate, chicken dense and thick, and the tortilla shells would crack your teeth if you had ok dental hygiene. The crema and sauce were yummy....not enough to save the dish...

After eating the edible portions that would not crack my teeth, I asked for the check and showed the waitress how tough the tacos were by smacking them with my fork, I asked her to do the same and she did and agreed, I asked her to tell the chefs not to overcook them for other customers.

She returned with my check and stated "I told them" with a worried look, and nothing else....I tipped her well as she deserved, and I left...I guess what I have to rationalize is...."well....it is only airport food"
