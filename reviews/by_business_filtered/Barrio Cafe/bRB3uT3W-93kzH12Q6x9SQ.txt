I will preface this as it is good for airport food... But.... I imagine the airport location is not doing the legacy very good. The food is good... Except dried cranberries in the guac??? :/ (I ate around those). Chips were stale.. I think someone else mentioned that also and my posole was cold. I saw someone else commented on cold food so looks like they have a little problem. Also the waitress was completely overwhelmed and it wasn't that busy, but To her defense I think she was the only waitress in the whole place and she was hustling and very sweet. Overall... Wasn't bad and flavors were good and authentic, but when you say things like world famous on your menu it kinda sets the bar pretty high. If they hadn't I may not have been so disappointed.
