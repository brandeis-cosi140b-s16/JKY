I know Barrio is all the Food Network rage, so I can only speak on the airport location. In a nutshell, the breakfast food was disappointing. The menu itself is condensed which I understand, but this leaves little to no room for variation and flavor. I ordered the Chilaquiles Verde and when it arrived to the table: a few soggy, stale chips, with a few pieces of pork, and two bland eggs. Seriously, there was no flavor and barely any pork. The two stars accounts for the server who was nice and prompt, the coffee (pressed), and the decor. We killed some time but really should have grabbed a bagel and coffee, and saved the dollars.
