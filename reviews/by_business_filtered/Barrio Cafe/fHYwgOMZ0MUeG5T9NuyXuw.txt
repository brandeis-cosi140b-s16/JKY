Just left! Server took 10 minutes to greet the table. She couldn't even smile. We ordered 2 coronas and waters all around. No waters got delivered. She dropped off the food not even asking if we needed anything else. We ate, the food was good. Christin didn't check back in. At the end I had my card out to pay waiting. Overall she made the experience shitty.
