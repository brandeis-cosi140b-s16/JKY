I'm not sure how this place only has 3 stars, maybe travelers into Phoenix are used to the type of Mexican food served at Chilis.

I had the carne asada a la ricardo and the IPA on tap. The food was excellent, not too spicy but enough spice to linger throughout and cause a few sniffles. It was a generous helping of meat with sautéed onions, tomatoes, garlic and fresh cut jalapeños (not pickled) served with steak fries and the house salsa and spicy ketchup.  I'm a native Phoenician, and I've been missing proper southwest flavor since I moved to northern Cali and this delivered while I waited for my flight back home. It's a little pricey, but it's airport food and I am leaving satisfied, so I'm not going to subtract for that.

Apparently this restaurant has been around in south Phoenix for a while, I'm going to make it a point to stop in next time I'm here.
