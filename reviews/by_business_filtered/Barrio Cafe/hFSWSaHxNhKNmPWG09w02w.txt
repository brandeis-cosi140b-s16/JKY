Came in again.  I know a gluten for punishment.  However today I had a much different experience.  My servers name was Reeni, and she was great.  I had the chips and guacamole which were good.  I then had the posole and it was out of this world.  Reeni thank you for taking the time explaining the restaurant as well as the food.  I will return.
