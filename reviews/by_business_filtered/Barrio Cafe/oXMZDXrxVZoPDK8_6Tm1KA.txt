Once I clicked on this restaurant, I was hoping, from seeing the low reviews, I clicked the wrong location.  No, this is the correct spot, the one in the airport, and I actually had decent service and good food.  (I ate here around January 2013).  

What I had:
*cochinita pibil-  meat was flavorful and tender, and large portions.  The sides it came with complimented the meat.
*guac- what a nice, surprising twist adding pomegranate seeds to guac.  Nice how you can add items to the guac (like onions, cilantro, tomatoes, etc) and it is made fresh to order at the table.

I thought this place is the best airport food I have had.  No complaints yet!  I hope to return during my next trip to AZ.
