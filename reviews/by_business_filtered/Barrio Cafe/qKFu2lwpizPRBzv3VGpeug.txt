This was my most disappointing airport food experience ever.

Thinking, "hey, we went to barrio cafe and it was a great meal, we can have a good meal at the airport.  great!" I went in with expectations.  And those expectations were so not met.

First off, no frozen margaritas.  They're on the menu, but they were out?  How does one run out of traditional frozen margarita?  Pretty sure you take all the usual ingredients with ice and stick it in a blender.  So 2 members of our party left.

Then we get food.  Disaster.  I order the cochinita pibil (which I had the last time I was at Barrio Cafe).  Definitely not as good.  Didn't finish it.  Hardly ate it.
Husband was served overcooked, dry, microwaved chicken.

We had margaritas on the rocks.  They tasted like salt.  Just salt.

They comped the chicken (after my husband complained), but we're not going back.  There are better restaurants for us to spend our money at.
