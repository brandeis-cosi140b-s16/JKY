We came in expecting mediocre airport food. We were so surprised. The fish tacos are amazing. So are the french fries. It is also really nice because it is a sit down restaurant, so when you are worn out from traveling it is really nice to have someone else wait on you! :) The service is slow, but friendly. We will definitely be coming back here next time we stop through this airport.
