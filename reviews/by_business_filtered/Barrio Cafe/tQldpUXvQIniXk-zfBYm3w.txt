As far as airport food goes this was pretty good. I had the pork tacos with the side salad instead of the fries. First of all for $12 it was a ton of food. (Fyi my meal was cheap but everything else besides the tacos and burritos were spendy) The tacos were street taco sized but there were 4 of them and the salad serving was pretty generous. The salad was delish and I suspect a lot of it had to do with the cheese. It was unlike anything I've ever had. It's like a cross between a mild goat cheese and cottage cheese. The dressing was really light on the greens too which was great after a weekend of horrible eating. The tacos were really tasty too. On the salty side but the marinade was good and the pork was really tender. Topped with a pico de gallo and more of the cheese. I actually really enjoyed it. Though I ended up scarfing it down like a starving coyote since my first flight got in a little late and it took me a while to order. There is nothing else really for food in this terminal but regardless I would probably stop here again. I would just make sure I had more time to enjoy.

I should note I sat at the bar. This is not for the to-go window.
