What a treat during my layover in Pheonix! As I walked by, I smelled deliciousness, so I couldn't pass up an opportunity to try Barrio Cafe. I got the steak tacos upon suggestion and I was not disappointed! Flavorful marinated steak with large chunks of avocado on corn tortillas. AMAZING. The side salad that comes with it was great as well. 

Hope I get 'layovered' in Pheonix again in the future so that I can try their Arizona Burrito, green chili pork, and shrimp tacos!
