I begrudgingly hate going to the airport, but be-still my heart... There's a Barrio Cafe here! I was so excited about my find, I spent my time enjoying a delicious plate of Chiliquiles Verdes while waiting for my flight to depart. 
The Chiliquiles Verdes cheered me up right away. The tortillas had a crispy texture that was just the right amount of thickness. The baked seasoned tortillas supported the weight of the rich ranchero sauce that embraced them. 
With all this carb loading, the French Pressed coffee prevented me from falling into a deep food coma so I didn't miss my flight! 
Barrio Cafe definitely helped kick off my morning to a great start!
