This is my first yelp review and I couldn't think of a better place to pop my proverbial cherry. So I am a creature of habit and the two times I have been to Barrio I think I have gotten the same exact meal from start to finish. I would say hands down just as good as the first time! 

Let me start by saying I had never tried guacamole in my life due to the look of the consistency of it. I have a problem with that with some foods. But what better way to try something then being called out by a chick. So, I tried it and it was amazing! Now not having anything to compare it to may make this less reliable, but... The pomegranate that they mash into it was great. It sort of cut through the creaminess. I had the Adobo Pork and for those meat-eaters out there it will not disappoint. For dessert I have had the churro. Unbelievable! For those of us that have only had a fair or Disneyland churro in our lifetimes, this was like a religious experience. It is served very warm with cinnamon ice cream I think. 

Be prepared to wait for a table or go later in the night because it is smaller and very popular. Oh yeah, the Sangria is tasty!!!
