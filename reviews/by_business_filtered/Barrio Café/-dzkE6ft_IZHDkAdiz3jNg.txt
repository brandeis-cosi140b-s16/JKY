It's so nice to see upscale Mexican food.  It's such a rare sight.  Many clever menu items here, and plenty of really cool artwork, both inside and out.  The seating area can be pretty cramped though.  I came here for some late lunch and ordered the filetito.  A thin slice of filet mignon, with their own marinara sauce, on a French bread bun.  The sandwich was overflowing in its own juices, nearly impossible to eat with hands without making a huge mess.  Like a Mexican sloppy joe.  I also ordered their homemade horchata; not really a fan.  It was flavorful, but I hated the consistency.  Barrio Cafe has live music during lunch hours.  Just some light acoustic, nothing too heavy, so it was quite enjoyable.  If you to want to enjoy this place, come during the late lunch or early dinner time.  It will be easier to get seated.
