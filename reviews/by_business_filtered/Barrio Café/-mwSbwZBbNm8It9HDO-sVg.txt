I was not terribly impressed with the place, to be honest. I'd read good reviews so maybe I was expected too much. I did NOT like the bread and olive salsa and was terribly disappointed not to have chips and salsa, since this is one of my favorite things about Mexican type eating out. I hate olives. The shrimp tacos were OK. I ordered a margarita and was not too wild about it. It was strong, which I guess is nice, but it was not very tasty and there was a LOT of ice involved. With so many other options for Mexican food, I won't go back.
