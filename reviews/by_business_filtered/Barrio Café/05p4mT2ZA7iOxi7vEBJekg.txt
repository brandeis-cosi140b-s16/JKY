I have been wanting to try this place out for some time. I had some vendors who came into town, and this is where we ended up for dinner.

It really wasnt what I expected. It kind of through me for a loop. I mean, its in a very run down neighborhood (Signs say park at your own risk) with bars over windows and doors. You get in, and it looks kind of average, nothing to hint that there are some food gods working behind the wall.

They pretty much do tequilla only here. They have a tequilla list with over 100 tequillas on it. I opted for a simple margaritta with some tequilla I have never heard of and some fresh agave nectar. Wow it was good!

We got the guacamole appetizer, and it was fantasic. All fresh made right at the table. Next we moved onto the shrimp quesedillas. This was kind of an insight as to how complex these meals were going to be. The shrimp quesadillas were very good, so much so I didnt even realize I accidently ate the shrimp tail! 

Looking at the menu for dinner, its definatley not your everyday mexican food your going to see here. This is kicked up a notch. I would probably call this gourmet mexican food. Never have I seen such menu items, where everything sounds so fantastic. It was like I was in mexican food heaven! I had the special of the night which was a basted lobster tail in tequilla grilled over an open wood flame, 6oz filet mignon with a langustine/chorizo goat chease mixture on top, and grilled vegetables. I think it was their way of doing the filet 'oscar style'. It was extremely good. Everything turned out fantastic.

My only complaint was parking. It was pretty tight to begin with. Our server was strictly to the point, no lolly gagging around which actually turned out to be good in this instance for us since this was a business dinner.

Would definatley visit again!
