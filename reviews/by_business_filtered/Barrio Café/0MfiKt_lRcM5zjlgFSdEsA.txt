A diamond in this rough neighborhood. Be prepared to wait, most nights it's very busy. Order one of their amazing margarita's and try to relax in their very limited space. I've tried a couple of things, but by far the best item is their seasonal Chiles en Nogada. Be sure to order their Guacamole, they make it right in front of you and add the fun twist of pomegranate seeds to the mix. It's awesome!
