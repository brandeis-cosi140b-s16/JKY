I was extremely disappointed with my meal. I'd been here twice before and was impressed each time. This time, not so much. They have excellent guacamole (although anyone can mix some pomegranate in, right?), but the rest was insulting.

My entree (chile en nogada) came out on a very hot plate, yet the chile itself, while charred, was not warm at all. The chicken in the filling was warm, but not anything else. The zucchini side was mushy, and the potatoes that came with it were clearly nuked on the same plate as the zucchini.

I told the server my concerns, and a new plate of everything was quickly brought over in no more than two minutes. Again, parts of the entree and the side were not thoroughly heated, yet overly heated in other parts. The manager asked how things were, and I let him know I thought even this was microwaved. While he might have brushed the accusation aside, he did not emphatically deny it.

My dining partner's meal, chicken mole, was equally disappointing. Three (three?!?) chicken breasts that were clearly cooked hours before and reheated, with some mole tossed on at the last minute. The tips were rubbery and the thicker portions of the breasts were not warm to the touch.

When our waiter came back to ask how the second attempt was, I complained again that it seemed microwaved and he simply said "Sir, I'm not sure why you're so mad, but have a good night. Goodbye."

We left without further discussion.
