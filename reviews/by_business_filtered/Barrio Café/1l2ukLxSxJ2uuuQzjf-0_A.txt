Entered the Barrio caf√© and sat down at the bar really friendly staff huge selection of tequila a whole wall of it. Ordered a La Paloma margarita - Patron reposado with grapefruit soda, Mexican Squirt, lime... It was really good it came time to order ordered the Tacos de carne asada - Grilled tenderloin strip tacos with cabbage, queso fresco, salsa Yucateca and avocado with fries... Fries seemed kind of strange but once I dipped it in the special ketchup I was hooked so good the meal rocked I will be back for sure.
