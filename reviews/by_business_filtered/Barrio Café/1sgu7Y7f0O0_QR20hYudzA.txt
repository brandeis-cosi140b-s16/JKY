We went there for dinner on a Thursday night, which I'm sure helped because we didn't have to wait at all to get seated.  I ordered the Suiza Enchiladas and my girlfriend ordered the Carne Asada Tacos.  The enchiladas were $19, which I thought was a bit expensive.  In fact it was more expensive than any enchilada I have ever had before.  But then I tasted them and immediately realized they were worth every single penny and then some.  They were cooked to perfection and the flavor was unique and amazing.  They could have used a little more kick, but that didn't really detract from the experience at all because the flavor was so good.  The Carne Asada tacos were certainly above average, but didn't quite knock our socks off the way the enchiladas did, though we don't really have any complaints about them either.  We then decided to try dessert.  And after deliberating for several minutes, decided on a $12 churro.  We both thought "for $12, it better be the best churro ever."  Well, it was.  It too was worth every penny.  In addition to that, the service was impeccable and the experience overall was fantastic.  I can't believe I waited so long to go to this place.  It is now one of my favorites and I can't wait to go back.
