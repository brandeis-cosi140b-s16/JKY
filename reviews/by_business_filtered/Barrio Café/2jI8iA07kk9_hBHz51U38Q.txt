Went here last night with some foodie friends based on other reviews and their previous lunch experience.  For us out in The QC, it's a bit of a hike for dinner, but for me the food was well worth it.  We arrived at around 6:45pm on a Friday night and had about a less than 10 minute wait (4 of us).  We sat and listened to the live music for the night by Gustavo Angeles.  Pretty great guitar player.  I friggin love latino music and so the vibes were awesome for me.

Food - was great.  I had the Chile Relleno and also got a side of a slow-roasted pork taco (had to try it).  The Relleno was fantastic for me.  Not battered like others, but full of flavor and I really liked it.  Wife had the Mole which I thought was good (rich, but good...but all Mole is).

We had guacamole made at our table...pretty basic, but addition of 'craisins' were actually a good touch.  

Dessert was amazing.  Goat's milk caramel stuffed churros...are you kidding me?!?!!? Wow, they were good.

As we were sitting the table next to us got served Tortas...I always expect Tortas not to be enough for dinner, but don't write them off here...LARGE.  If I go back, I'll have one of those.

Perhaps the only two things my wife and I walked away from with a thought was the price.  For us non-drinkers, our bill was $75.  The Yelp rating of $11-30 doesn't give a good range.  If you aren't getting Tortas or Tacos, expect $20/person + drinks and appetizer and dessert costs.  The other: a bit loud...expected in a smaller area though...wasn't bad, just noticeably louder than most places.

We love the experience though and time with friends is great!  Recommend if in the area.
