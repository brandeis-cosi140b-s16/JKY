We waited over an hour to get seated which wasn't really bad as it is small and it was Saturday night. Our drinks were dropped on the floor and then a tray full of dishes was dropped behind us not more than five minutes later. We had to yell to each other to talk as their band was so loud. Food was adequate but nothing I would recommend.
