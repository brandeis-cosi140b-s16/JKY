Don't like this place. It may be a different type of Mexican food, but they don't serve salsa with the chips, don't serve cheese crisps, the food that I did order was almost tasteless. When I walked in - smelled like a fish fry gone bad. Won't go back here if they paid me. Just don't like this type of Mexican food. Very different from Macayo's type of restaurants I understand.
