Having been here several times over the years I guess I was waiting for a time to either impress or disappoint me to review.

Well that pretty much said it all huh.

I have never disliked the food but then again never really left the place with a glowing report.

All that I have eaten has been rather pedestrian in presentation and taste.

It is the kind of place where I will go with out kicking and screaming if a friend wants to partake, but not one I would choose on my own.

I always have the feel claustrophobia when in the restaurant.
