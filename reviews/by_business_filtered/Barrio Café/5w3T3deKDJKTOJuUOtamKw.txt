The Barrio Cafe is one of the best Mexican joints in town. If you are looking for traditional Mexican you might be disappointed with Barrio because Barrion Cafe serves what i like to call neuvo Mexican. I can't really explain what i mean by that...LOL...all I can tell you is that the food is FANTASTIC. My favorites are the Enchiladas del Mar and the Lobster Quesadillas....YUM. Oh did I mention the table side guacamole? Yeah it's the BOMB. So if you want one of the best Mexican meals in town with a twist then Barrio is where it's at.
