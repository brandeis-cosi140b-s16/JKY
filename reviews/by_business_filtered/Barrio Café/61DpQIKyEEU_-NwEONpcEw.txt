I wish I could transport the Barrio Café to my neighborhood in Chicago.  This is my 2nd time visiting it while in Phoenix to see my parents, and I can officially confirm now it will be on all future trips!

Love the happy hour tacos because you can try a bunch of different flavors.  This time we went for regular post-happy hour dinner and it was still amazing. The enchiladas are amazing... wow. As is the pork that is on the top of the entrée menu (I'm blanking on the name).  Drinks are outstanding as well, but very pricey for the neighborhood.  These cocktails are more like what I would expect to pay in Chicago at a restaurant downtown.

If it's your first time going there, you have to check out the bathroom... you'll get a giggle, it's intense!
