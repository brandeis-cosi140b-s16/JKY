We decided to try this place because we saw it on TV on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives, but realize now that should have been a reason not to try it. Barrio Cafe is overpriced and underwhelming. 

On the show we saw the chef prepare a chili  relano, but when we went to order it, there's none on the menu. Instead, we went for the chicken enchiladas and fish tacos. We started with the "award winning" horchata.   We must have got some from the bottom of the barrel because it was super grainy and gross. I didn't even drink mine at $5.50. The tacos and enchiladas were both fine, but nothing special.

With the amount of hype surrounding this place we expected more - especially for $20 a person or more.
