Walked in with group of 12 on a busy Saturday night; were seated in less than estimated wait time for fabulous meal! Everyone loved their dinners. Make sure to try guacamole prepared table side. No one had room for dessert. Bartender suggested margaritas were excellent! If I ever get back to Phoenix, will definitely go back!
