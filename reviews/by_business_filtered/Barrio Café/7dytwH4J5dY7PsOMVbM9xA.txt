Sad, sad, sad. That's how I feel after my recent meal at the Barrio Cafe. Had I written this review just a couple years ago, I would have said, "joyous, joyous, joyous." My how times have changed.
I once held Barrio in very high esteem, recommended it to out of town visitors, and regularly thought of it as some of the best Mexican food I had enjoyed outside of Mexico. Well, no more...
Went last Saturday night and I seriously thought it had new owners. The dirty truth...
Service:
Terrible, terrible service. From the host, to the bartender, to the server, we received rushed, unfriendly, inattentive treatment. When entrees are in the $20+ range I expect better service than what I've experienced at most fast food joints. 
Food: 
Who stopped caring in the kitchen? It used to feel like the food was lovingly made by a gourmet Mexican grandma. Now it was just slopped on the plate. We ordered the table side guac and it was thrown together so fast and the server didn't even take the time to ask how we wanted it (spice, mild, etc.). It was fine but not as special as on previous visits. My favorite seasonal dish is the Chilis en Nogada - a whole chili stuffed with chicken and dried fruits with a creamy almond sauce and fresh pomegranates. In this past, this dish was dreamy! On this night it was a nightmare. Dried out chicken, bland chile, and so sweet it was barely edible. Also, it was served with a side of cold unseasoned steamed zucchini and bland mashed potatoes that added absolutely nothing to the dish. After an experience like that, I'm sad to say Barrio is officially off my list.
