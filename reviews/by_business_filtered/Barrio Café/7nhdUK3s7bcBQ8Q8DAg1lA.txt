Now looking at the reviews, I expected to be wow'd. Uhhhhhh no. Maybe we went at the wrong time. It was about 6:30 on a Friday so maybe that's not it. Anyway, we arrived and it was like a 35 minute wait which was fine because we excepted that on a Friday evening. We got seated at a table RIGHT IN FRONT of the guitar player. I mean, he was playing some jams but is it necessary to have tables so close to where he's performing? Could barely hear what my friend was saying.  I ordered the carne asada tacos with the spicy fries. The fries were pretty good with that sauce you dip them in. The tacos were kind of bland though and small. You get complementary bread and some olive mixture that I didn't know were olives until I tasted it. Not a big fan of olives but the bread was soft. All in all, I was pretty underwhelmed and probably wouldn't go back. If I did, I'd maybe try the enchiladas that my friend had. Hers looked good.
