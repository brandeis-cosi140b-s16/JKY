Wonderful modern Mexican food.  We had the guacamole with pomegranate seeds and it was amazing.  The pork was also incredible -- slow cooked so it literally melted off the bone and needed no knife.  Service was a little slow, but I think that's because the place was packed.  I am a patient person, so I didn't really mind.  The food was out of this world, so I can't imagine fussing about the wait staff!!

I would definitely go again and would bring more friends next time.
