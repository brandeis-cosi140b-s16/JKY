Amazing!

We know this was a bit more expensive, so we came here before the ballet. I had the special, which was halibut covered with roma tomatoes, capers, olives, (and probably other things that I can't remember now), and sat on a bed of mashed potatoes. Truly one of the most memorable dishes I've ever had. 

My wife had something more tortilla-based, and loved it. Oh, and I can't forget about the chipotle chese dip. Usually something like that would play heck with our digestive system (getting old sucks). However, this stuff was amazing, easy on the belly, and we couldn't stop eating it.

The margaritas were a bit weak. And probably too expensive. Oh, and the table-side quacamole looked awesome. Pomegranite in it? The table next to us ordered it, and made us very jealous.

I am definitely looking forward to our next visit.
