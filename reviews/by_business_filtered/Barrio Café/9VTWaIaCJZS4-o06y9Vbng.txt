Don't expect typical tacos, enchiladas or burritos and the prices that go along with traditional food. Thus restaurant is what I would call modern Mexican.  My roasted pork plate  had a Mexican version of mashed potatoes with a side  of zucchini-$20. The dish was very good. No tortilla chips upon arrival ; they use French bread with a tapenade. Soup: corn chowder. We also had filet steak tacos-3 for $12 and came with salad. Chips and guacamole were very different. I liked them but probably wouldn't order again-$11.
