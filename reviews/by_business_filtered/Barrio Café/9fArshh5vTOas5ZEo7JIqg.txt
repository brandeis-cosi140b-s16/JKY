This place gets 5 stars from me because of their amazing dessert:  homemade churro filled with dulce de leche, with a side of homemade vanilla bean ice cream with cinnamon and whipped cream on top.  Seriously - heaven on earth.  And, I will make an argument that it has to be somewhat nutritional?   I mean, there's cinnamon and milk - aren't those two items good for the skin and heart? :)

I could eat this every day and wouldn't even mind if I got fat because I'd be so happy.  

The dinner and lunches have been pretty good as well -  I'd recommend Sunday brunch as the best time to go - it's not as crowded and they have a unique brunch menu.  Plus, you can still get the churro dessert at 11:30am and have the whole rest of your day to walk it off.   :) 

Great place to take out-of-towners as it's been nationally recognized in several top publications.
