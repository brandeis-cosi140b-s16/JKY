Solid and delicious upscale Mexican cuisine.

We came here early, around 6pm on a Tuesday evening, and were able to get a table for 3 right away. The restaurant was a bit difficult to find, and the hostess was very friendly about vectoring me in by telephone. The enthusiastic and friendly server got drinks and house made chips on the table extremely quickly. Next up was the table-side guacamole; he custom prepared it from a cart containing pre-chopped and fresh avocado, tomato, onion, chiles, limes and cilantro. My teenage daughter declared it 'the best guac ever'!  I concur -- fab and custom. I agree with Mark C.'s review, and that the addition of the pomegranate seeds sends this dish to a new level!

I enjoyed one of the evening's specials: Halibut Vercruz style. Hailing from Seattle, I am extremely picky about my fish, and I usually never order it outside of my own burgh. However, since we have a deficiency of Mexican cuisine in Seattle, I ventured forth and was not disappointed. The halibut was ocean fresh and perfectly cooked -- just flaky to the fork. The Veracruz sauce it was bathed in blew me away: it was filled with piquant olives, capers and tomatoes and was redolent of garlicand chile. Fantastico. All of this fresh, flaky, flavorful deliciousness was generously portioned and placed atop Yukon Gold mashed potatoes, which were a perfect creamy canvas for the bold sauce. There was also some flavorful sauteed zucchini and onion.

My teenage companions rated the fish tacos as excellent and very fresh.  I did not get to taste them.  A fellow diner at another table commented that his filet mignon was excellent.

Barrio Cafe is a great dining experience. The chef creates dishes which are complex, interesting and layered.  The service was prompt, friendly and extremely efficient.   When we exited the restaurant after our meal, the restaurant was entirely full, with people waiting as well. Lucky them -- I can't wait to return to Phoenix and dine at Barrio Cafe.
