A favorite spot for my hubbs and I. Table-side guac (even at $10 a pop) is amazing. Everything on the menu always satisfies. We usually try their special since we've been through everything on their standard menu. Goat cheese churros with fresh whipped cream or ice cream (if they aren't out) is a must. 

My husband tries a different tequila each visit and with their selection, we could be coming back for 400 years and not try every one... I always get some kind of Cadillac drink. I always forget the name and the server knows what I'm ordering before I do. They don't make bad drinks here. Believe me!

The wait is always long and the prices are high- but sometimes it's just worth it, ya know? 

Atmosphere is perfection. Just don't get sat at the table by the bathroom.
