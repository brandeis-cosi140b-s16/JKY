First time here. The food was very good. Big portion size meals so I guess the price is worth it. So many items to chose from but still simple to the point menu. I ordered pollo en mole black it was good hubby got shrimp enchiladas super delish we also got dessert hubby said best flan and I say delish curros. Small inside tight tables. But I would try it again.
