I'm disappointed.  I  saw this place on a top 10 best in the country list. It's more French than mexican. When you sir down yoy get bread and something that looks like olive paste.  I loved the spread but the bread was slightly stale. But eatable.  I was in the more for chips so u got guac it said award winning. It was more of a avocado salad.  Are you staying to see a grand.  But I did like the guacamole it was different with cran raisins.  I ordered carne tacos because the chillrenno sauces scared me.  The meat was high end trays like a roast. Not like asada. The problem wad it was very beefy. I have to say it was gross I should have sent it back.  I know what your thinking beef is beefy. But this was bad. If you want new types of recipes and don't mind paying twenty dollars plate fire a dumpy place with white table clothes go try. There is a lot to like about this place
