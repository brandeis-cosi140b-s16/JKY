Disappointed that we weren't notified that their chiles en nogada is a seasonal dish. Not only is it highlighted on their menu, there is no mention of it being seasonal and our waiter had 3 interactions with us before we tried to order it and he then notified us that they didn't have it. Really, your restaurant specialty and what you're known for and you just mention it now? Our group of four was very disappointed since we were coming for this dish. The other food was good but paled in comparison.
