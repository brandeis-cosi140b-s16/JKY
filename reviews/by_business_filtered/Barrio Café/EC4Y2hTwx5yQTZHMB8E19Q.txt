What can I say.....probably the BEST Mexican food I have had in years ! I had the Enchilada Suizas and it knocked my socks off. The first bite was heaven. The portion was just right and every forkful was a treat. The restaurant itself is mostly white with artist paintings hanging from the wall, but the outside is colorfully painted and a treat all by itself. The wait staff is great, friendly, cheerful and seem to be having a great time waiting/assisting the eager customers.  Looking around at what the other patrons were having made one want to stay and try a great number of dishes, everything looked like you wanted to go over and say, "Excuse me, can I have a bite of that ?". And there was no waiting for food, although the place as about 3/4 full, the order arrived within 10 minutes, barely enough time to sip a Margarita. So, as you can tell, I loved the place, and will return.
