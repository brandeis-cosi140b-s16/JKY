Would have given this pace a higher rating but...

The drinks were exceptional.  absolutely delicious.
Guacamole was so-so.  a lot of hype, but wasn't mixed too well at table side.  a little high priced for adding some pomegranate seeds to avocado.  both are pretty cheap, so the price tag didn't justify it.
Tacos were very very good with the spicy fries, loved it!  The salad my wife had was the worst.  Lazy chef had it missing most of the key ingredients from the menu.  looked like a bowl of spinach with a bit of cotija tossed in.  Thankfully our server took it off the menu.

great location and ambience, great service, food was decent, worth a visit!
