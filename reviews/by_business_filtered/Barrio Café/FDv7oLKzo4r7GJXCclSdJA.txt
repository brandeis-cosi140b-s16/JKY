We went here for lunch because the cafe was featured on DDD. If you are looking for a "dive" with "dive" prices you will be disappointed. But if you are looking for a white tablecloth gourmet experience this is your place. I had the famous chile en nogado and it was deliciously interesting. Having just hiked Camelback mountain I could have used more food, which I expected for the price. My husband had tacos with the specially prepared pork. They were good.  Great service.
