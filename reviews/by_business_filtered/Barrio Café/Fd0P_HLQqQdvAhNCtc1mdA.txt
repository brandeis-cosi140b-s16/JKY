Not good.  This place is not good.  I'll bet it used to be good, but now it is not good.  

My girlfriend got the mole chicken enchiladas on the servers recommendation.  The dish was flavorless and the chicken was dry.  I got the Carne Asada tacos, and while edible, they were nothing special.

The artwork is fantastic and the server was accommodating (she removed the enchiladas from the tab and offered to get us something else).  However, I would recommend avoiding this place.
