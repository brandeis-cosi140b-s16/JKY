This place keeps it real.  I go there as often as i can and never regret it.  Sometimes, the service is slow...but i stop taking myself so seriously and  realize i will be rewarded by the outstanding food.  This isn't a traditional "american" mexican restaurant.  Many dishes hail from southern mexico.  Whenever i travel to guadalajara i usually see some of the same things served at Barrio. 

If you want the typical american-esque mexican food, go to macayos.  If you want fantastic, true-to-the-region mexican, go to Barrio.
