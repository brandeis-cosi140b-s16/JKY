Thanks to Guy Fieri's show, I looked this place up while visiting on a business trip. The location is in an area I'd probably not want to be at night. The graffiti artwork is amazing surrounding the building.  As soon as you enter, the interior is classy and simple. The walls are adorned with more artwork.  The afternoon we were there, they had live music. They were fantastic!

Service was excellent. It was so nice to see everyone with great personalities in there.

We had the pomegranate guacamole. Interesting combo that was refreshing and light. I had the Cochinita Pibil Torta. It had me screaming oh my god with every single delicious bite! The meat was juicy and tender. The pickled onion gave it a nice tart kick and the spicy fries with that addicting chipotle ketchup sauce. Ay yai yai!!

We were in and out in about an hour so we could head on our way to continue our tour of the city. This is a MUST EAT place!
