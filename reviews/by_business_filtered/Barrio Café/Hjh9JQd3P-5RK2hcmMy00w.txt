Well...the guacamole's good.  That's about all the good stuff I can say.  They're definitely pretentious in here.  NOT handicapped accessible.  And, if there's a fire, good luck getting out!!  But if you like to live dangerously, eat meat and drink lots of tequila, this is the place to go to get your Mex on.  If you're not a high roller, head down to Salsita's and get cheaper eats.
