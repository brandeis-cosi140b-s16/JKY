4.5 stars.
I'm not a member of the 'clean plate club' but I was jumped in last night and I have the food baby to prove it. Delicious southern Mexico style cuisine that yes, will put a minor ding in your wallet if you choose to enjoy a couple of perfectly crafted margaritas with your dinner. It's worth it, trust me. Take note of the extensive Tequila list.

Guess what!? It's not Sonoran people and if you're looking for deep fried chimichangas the size of your arm, smothered in oily sauce and a pound of cheese for $7.99 you're in the wrong place. Hey, I love Sonoran Mexican food. I had the pleasure of working in one of the best damn Son restaurants in Tucson in my late teens. I have a fucking green corn tamale where my cold black heart should be ok.....
My point is I'm not hating, just don't be a tool. Do some basic research on a place before you decide to grace it with your presence. There's this thing called the internet, you can check out many a restaurants FULL MENU from it, including prices...and if you get bored doing that there's always porn! Hey now!

Moving on..
We shared the Cochinita Pibil - Slow roasted pork with achiote rojo& sour orange. It was melt in your mouth amazing served with perfectly tender corn tortillas to wrap the whole mess up in. I will have dreams about this pork, no joke. We also shared the Chilies en Nogada - Roasted poblano pepper stuffed with chicken, onions, garlic, pecans, apples, pears (yes, I'm still listing) and apricots finished with almond sauce and pom seeds. Ohhhhh, sweet lady guadalupe, if this wasn't an immaculate conception in my mouth I don't know what is. Expectations - met/exceeded.

I did find it slightly odd that dessert wasn't 'sold' to us a bit more as we were only offered just that....dessert. What? No visuals? Bummer, because our inner fat kids would've taken over at that point and we wouldn't have had to stop at Culvers on the way home.... just sayin.
