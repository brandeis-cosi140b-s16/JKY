Wow! Wow! Wow! I'm a serious foodie!!!! I have a strong passion for authentic Mexican cuisine! Barrio Cafe.... Out of this world! My career takes me all over the U.S. And Barrio cafe is the best food/place I've ever been to!!  Must order the table side made guacamole (add the pomegranate) sounds weird but it's to die for! I had a filet mignon which was recommended by the server. I thought to myself fillet mignon at a Mexican restaurant?!?... The most amazing Mexican touch was added to this meeting. It's a must-have!!!!!!The staff was friendly and helpful and simply amazing. Thank you think you think you BARRIO! COMIDA CHINGONA!!
