So sad to give this place a 3/5 because I really wanted to like it a lot. I think I hyped it up too much in my head I don't know. Have to say though that considering the price I wasn't super impressed. 
You can definitely tell that the chefs are working with quality product but overall it's not that amazing. Again I feel very bad for saying anything but amazing comments but these are my thoughts. 

Service : outstanding
Ambiance : cozy and colorful
Food : good
