Several years ago, 3 or 4, discovered this place and although prices a bit high, the food was great as well as service, therefore enjoyed a great meal here a couple times every year.

I like trying a restaurant several times before I review it.

2 stars for flavor and enjoyable live music, however the prices are a bit high, service can be inattentive and slow. 

It's been about a year since my previous visit and the menu appears to have updated. Along with most if the previous items there are now some less pricey options, however taste no longer justifiable.

Don't know what it is but it feels and tastes different.  Not sure that I'll go back.
