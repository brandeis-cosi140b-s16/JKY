The reputation of this place was stellar!  I was stoked to try some new food.  I got a dish that had the mole on it.  Definitely not for everybody.  I literally scraped this thick molasses-like substance off my chicken and it still tasted like I was eating sauce only.  I ended up eating a lot of chips for dinner that night.
