This place is AMAZING!!! It's super small which can be frustrating because of the wait but it is so worth it! I had the cochinita pibil and it was like heaven in my mouth. I've never experienced so many flavors in my mouth. I've had cochinita pibil from other places and they have NEVER come close to comparison!! They art on the walls and graffiti on the outside are beautiful and live up to the name of the restaurant. I can't wait to come back here again!!
