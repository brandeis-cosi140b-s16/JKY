Been here a couple of times. Food is above average but the prices are way too high. Small portions of food, small drink portions, and the service was just below average. 

Almost all the times I've been here I've had to wait way too long to have my order taken, and they've almost always forgotten something at our table.

Again the food itself is above average but there is just so little of it, and the prices are way too high.
