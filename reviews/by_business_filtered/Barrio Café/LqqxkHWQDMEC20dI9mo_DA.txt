This was our first time visiting Barrio Cafe. I came her with family for a belated birthday celebration. We got there in time for a round of drinks at happy hour prices which was awesome. All drinks are 50% off until 5pm. We thought this place was closed until 5, so we were pleasantly surprised when we arrived early and were able to get a table and service quickly. We had the table side guacamole which was delicious. As for entrees, the following were ordered by the party: Chiles En Nogada, Chicken Mole, Halibut, Corn Chowder, and Tacos with Queso.  Everyone loved the food and since it was my birthday we had to order dessert. :) We had the churros and the chocolate cake and the restaurant treated me to a flan as well.  The desserts were awesome.  I'm already thinking about what to order next time, because we will definitely be back!

I would have given this place 5 stars, but I took off a star because they automatically applied a 20% gratuity to the bill for our party of 6.  I think the server didn't take as good of care of us throughout the dinner as he would have if he didn't know that his tip was guaranteed regardless.  Just my $.02, gratuity should be automatically applied for tables of 8 or more, not 6.
