I went here for lunch today! Amazing little hidden gem! The food, it delicious, but the service was not (-1 star)!

Not sure if the food is authentic, but it's safe to say that Barrio has it's own style!
The food is extremely flavorful and the sauces tend to be on the sweeter side. I've heard the food isn't spicy, but my salad actually was. 
Sides offered are fries or salad.
Quesadillas are open faced on mini corn tortillas. The kids had hard time adjusting to the new look from the traditional quesadilla.
I ordered the Tacos de Pollo. They were really good, and the presentation was beautiful! 

Don't leave without ordering their G U A C A M O L E   C A S E R O!!!!
Made table-side (at dinner only)!
It is so good, I would have been satisfied just having that for lunch. 
I'm going to try to reinvent it tonight!

Sorry for the 4 stars, but our service was actually HORRIBLE! I think he treated us bad from the beginning since we had children with us. We obviously wouldn't be ordering Margarita's at lunch!
Oh well, hopefully he has a better day tomorrow, but next time, I'll request to not be seated in his section!

BTW- 2 adults, 2 kids= $65 lunch...but worth it!
