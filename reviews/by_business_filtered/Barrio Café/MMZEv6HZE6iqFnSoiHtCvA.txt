I had an interesting dinner here, it was interrupted with a woman passing out and the EMT going through the tiny restaurants pushing our tables and chairs aside. Other than that unpleasant surprise, the food was good. Although I was disappointed that my dinner came out as a sandwich as opposed to tacos. Great flavors!
