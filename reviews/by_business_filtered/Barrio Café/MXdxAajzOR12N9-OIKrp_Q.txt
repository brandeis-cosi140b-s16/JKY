Over two years in Phoenix and my first dinner at Barrio still stands as my best meal since arrival.  Started with the house margarita, which was great.  Also have tried the Organic Margarita, and it is spectacular.  Decide how much you feel like spending and order accordingly, there is no wrong answer to this question.  Except maybe "No thanks".  I shared the Chiles en Nogada and the Pescado del Mar.  I can't pick a favorite, possibly due to the brain damage from the firestorm of joy transmitted from tongue to pleasure center.  Chiles en Nogada is a twist on the classic Chile Relleno, they start with a large fresh poblano pepper, stuff it with chicken, onions, garlic, pecans, apples, and I seem to recall pomegranate and angel dust, then top it with an absurdly tasty almond cream sauce.  Pescado del Mar is pan roasted halibut sort of stuffed/topped with crab, shrimp, lobster, and scallops, finished off with chorizo and another different, obnoxiously good cream sauce.  For dessert, absolutely get the churros.  Do remember the little cinnamon sticks that the word churro implies, but imagine them expertly prepared, stuffed with goats milk caramel and vanilla bean ice cream.  Service was friendly and efficient, the wait was long, but that was expected.  The Sunday brunch is also very much worth checking out, particularly for the seafood crepes.  My only disappointment from El Barrio so far was my own fault.  I didn't feel like waiting for a table and made the mistake of chosing Fish Tacos for a to-go order.  The shelf life on fish tacos is not long.  By the time I got home, we had a Captain Crunch enemy standoff going.  (Soggies...if you needed the clarification)
