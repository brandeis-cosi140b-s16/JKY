My wife and I live this place. It's intimate and the food is great. My favorite are the  shrimp and fish tacos.  Silvana was nice enough to show up the expansion where she is opening a bar.  We showed up just before opening and she was standing outside and I had to tell her that I lives the food.  She was welcoming enough to say hello and show us what she wanted to do. 

She asked us about expanding out west but I said avoid Avondale because people don't spend money and there isn't a lot to do there locally anyway. I said try Peoria or Noeth Phoenix. Hopefully she'll listen so I can visit more often.
