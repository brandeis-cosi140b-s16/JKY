Okay, my friend had been telling me for YEARS that I had to try this place out and I never got around to it. So my husband and I decided to have this be our valentines date. 
We showed up and there was an hour wait, yes an hour! We decided that with it being valentines weekend, everywhere would be busy so we stayed. BEST DECISION EVER. My hubby is a self-proclaimed margarita connesuir. He had the signature marg followed by the pineapple jalape√±o one and loved them both. I don't like tequila so I had the horchata and omg it was amazing! When we were seated I ordered the guacamole, thanks to other yelp reviews, and it did not disappoint. In fact, the guacamole had to be the best I've ever had. It has pomegranate seeds in it, which sounds weird, but absolutely made it!  The enchilada suiza was delicious and had a sweet taste to it that I wasn't expecting. Next time, I want to try the carne asana tacos. Hubby had the fish tacos and said they are as good as you can get away from the Oceanside. We will definitely be back!
