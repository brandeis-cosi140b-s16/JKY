This food is exactly 3 stars - "A-OK." If you live in Phoenix...i mean, REALLY live in Phoenix, proper, you know you will find some food carts and restaurants where the food tastes way better than the food here. It's just not that great. Then when you think about how much you are paying for mediocre food, you'll just be angry. Anger is not the answer; just don't eat here and you won't have to be angry.
