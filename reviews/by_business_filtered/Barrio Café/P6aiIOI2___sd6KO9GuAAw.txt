So here's the deal..... Having tried Barrio at several catered events already, I had been meaning to try this place in person. Then we finally made it there when my brother was in town recently. The food was generally excellent all around (including the famous guac), but I felt like it belonged in a resort setting or something of the sort. Very accessible menu, pleasant service, and fun space.... but I would personally prefer getting the same styled cuisine from somewhere without the white table cloth, without the loud musician, and at much lower prices. It just seemed strange to me in some way that I can't quite identify. So I guess I'll keep bringing out of town guests, but otherwise stick with my favorite hole-in-the-wall places for the most part. Does that make sense?
