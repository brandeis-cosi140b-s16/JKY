I'll admit that my expectations for this place were probably higher than they should have been.  A James Beard Award winning chef serving food at reasonable prices?!? Who would've guessed it?  And I love mexican food, so this seemed like a win-win for me.  I'd been talking with my girlfriend about going to this restaurant since we moved to Phoenix.  To start off with, I love the character of the place.  So many restaurants in Phoenix/Scottsdale try way too hard with the modern trendy look, so its nice to have some character.  The drinks were good and reasonably priced.  The horchata texture was a little different (being grainier than I'm used to), but still good.  My girlfriend's margarita was pretty tasty, but nothing special.  I didn't try their guacamole which I regret, because when I saw them making it table-side it looked delicious.  

Considering everything I heard about this place, I was a little disappointed when the food ended up just being pretty good.  I love a good mole sauce, and our server really talked it up.  Unfortunately, when the food arrived the mole sauce was okay and the chicken was dry.  My girlfriend's cochinita pibil was quite a bit tastier than my pollo en mole.  The portion sizes are large, and it'll definitely fill you up.  I'm willing to give this place another shot since you don't win a James Beard award for just decent food.  Next time I'll probably try the chilies en nogada since it's the "iconic dish", and just see if I didn't visit on an off night.
