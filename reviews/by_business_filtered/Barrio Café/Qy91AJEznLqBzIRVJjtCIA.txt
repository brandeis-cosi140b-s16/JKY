The Barrio Cafe is a "best of" Phoenix. Oh my, that guacamole made at your table is fantastic.  Who knew that pomegranate could make it taste so good.  All the dishes - especially the slow roasted pork - are excellent.  We're never disappointed.  Great south of the border food right here in Arizona - highly recommended.
