This is my 3rd time here and I want to luv this place but I'm not sure why I'm not super into the food. I will continue to support this place because I really appreciate what the owners are doing for the community. The art inside and around the building is super dope and changes often so it's nice to always see something fresh, alive and beautiful in the hood. I luv the bread and olive tapenade that is served before your meal. So tasty! There is a plethora selection of tequila & mezcal. In terms of food I got the Crema de Elota Sopa. It's definitely yummy and made from scratch but it's a tad sweet from the corn and only had one shrimp in it but maybe it's an essence of shrimp. Whatever I luv soup. My friend had the Chili Colorado pork chop which was a big ass pork chop w/some serious sauce w/chipotle mash potatoes and super greasy zucchinis. I've also had the Chilis en Nogada a mixture of yummy chilis, cream sauce and nuts which is a good suggestion because there is a lot of history behind this dish and it's a tasty eat. Either way like I said it's a must eat experience in AZ, don't listen to my review I jus want to be honest.
