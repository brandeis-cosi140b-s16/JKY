Great food, service, and atmosphere!!!
It is great to see one of my fellow Mexican's hit it out of the park.
We both had Fish Tacos!  They were great & gone in minutes!
The Guacamole was different and great!, chunks of Avocados, Pomegranates, Cilantro, & Purple Onions equals yum.  Great back entrance to restaurant, even better Chicano Art, I would love to have bought a t-shirt but not in black, it's too hot here for black.  Will bring all my family and friends when they are visiting from out of town.  A Phoenix  hidden gem.
