I loved Barrio Cafe's dessert but didn't care for my meal much. I ordered the Enchiladas de Hongos (mushroom enchilada) and found the dish to be overwhelmingly rich and not that flavorful (beyond cheese and cream). There was so much cheese drowning in a white creamy sauce with not enough acid or freshness to balance it out. There was a little bit of fresh pico de gallo which made the bites with it much better, but there wasn't enough for the whole dish. It was overall a very disappointing $17 dish and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. My boyfriend got the Torta Poblano and liked it fine. The bread looked good and it looked like it had a lot of sauce on it. The caramel churro dessert was quite amazing and saves this restaurant from a 2 star review by my stomach. The churro was delightfully crispy on the outside and smooth and soft on the inside, and served with very yummy caramel sauce, spiced nuts (added a nice texture), and smooth vanilla ice cream.

The inside of the restaurant is on the small side and it seemed to be getting crowded. I didn't think the interior was all that nice - a mixed match of art for sale on the walls and that's about it. I wouldn't come back here for another meal, and wouldn't recommend it to other vegetarians.
