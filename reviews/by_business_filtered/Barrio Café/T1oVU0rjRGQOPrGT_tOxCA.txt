I have to totally disagree with Nicole T. I understand what she is saying about it not being a typical Mexican food joint. However, I don't think it claims to be. There are so many typical "less than average" Mexican joints in phoenix, I welcome some different Spanish flair. I had the Cochinita Panil tacos. They were absolutely out of control! My friend and I shared the Queso Fundido which was also terrific. The service was good and the selection of Tequila's is awesome. 

So, while it is not another one of the thousands of Mexican joints in the valley, this one actually has something unique. I cant imagine anyone who has a clue about food at all not appreciating this place. Also, Zagat rates this place one of the top restaurants in the whole city.
