I was looking to grab some tacos one night. I checked out Yelp and found that this place was in walking distance from my home and the reviews were great! Oh yeah, taco time!


For some reason I didn't check out the menu or attire before heading over there so I was a bit surprised when I walked in with my Vans on and a baseball cap.  Oops, my bad. Everyone was dressed in their nice evening wear and I looked like I was ready to hop on my bicycle and cruise around the block.

That being said, I was greeted and seated with a smile! I ordered a delicious margarita on the rocks and picked out one of the many tequilas on the shelf. Oh my! It's scary I live so close to a place that has my favorite drink.

The food, oh my, the FOOD! Class act.  When I said I was looking for tacos I wasn't expecting this place AT ALL. This is not your corner taco stand with sloppy beans and dry rice...this is gourmet Mexican food. 

Even though I wanted tacos when the night started I had to splurge, because I was there. I ordered the The Pescado del Mar which included shrimp, lobster, halibut and scallops. Just a few of my favorite things. Being from New England I totally appreciated how the plate was cooked, if it wasn't cooked right you would hear it. The lobster and scallops were cooked perfectly and there was plenty of everything on there.

My friend ordered the Chile Relleno, she loved it.

Bottom line is this place is in an area you would expect to find some good cheap authentic tacos but what you get is some beautiful, delicious food and great ambiance. I would definitely recommend that you head on out to Barrio.
