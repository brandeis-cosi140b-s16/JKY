Barrio Cafe = Meh, I've had better! 

We were looking forward to trying this place an now that we have, I at least can say I've them a try...  This place falls way short on the flavor-roma scale when it comes to tasty Mexican food.   We have a group of five, so we tried several things on their menu.  The first thing we noticed were the portions.  Muy pequena!  Ok, so this is different than what many of the pics on Yelp look like but maybe it's not the size that matters in this place but rather the quality of food.  Pues no, la calidad es el mejor promedio (nope the quality is average at best).  Many of the pollo and rice items were very dry.  We also had an issue with our server.  He was no where to be seen for several minutes so we had to sick the hound dogs after him to get some refills. 

Anyways, this place seems to fill up with plenty of locals.  So good luck!
