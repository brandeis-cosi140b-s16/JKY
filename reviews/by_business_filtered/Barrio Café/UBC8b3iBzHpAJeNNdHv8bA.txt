Came to this establishment for lunch and were very impressed. The wait staff was very polite and quick despite being busy for lunch.  The chips and olive salsa were amazing.  We ordered the guacamole appetizer and it was awesome.  The pomegranate seeds on it was something we hadn't seen before but added a nice sweetness to it.  We split the Pablana sandwich at a friends recommendation. It was worth it.  First it's a big sandwich, the chicken is cooked perfectly.  Saut√©ed poblano peppers and red onions with there poblano sauce was amazing.  Then they add pine nuts which is a really nice touch.  Next time we are here we will definitely go again!
