I've been here for the tequila in the past, but my wife and I decided to give the food a go this past weekend. I mean we knew it was going to be good, but the wait for a table has always deterred us in the past. We were lucky enough to snatch a table right away on Saturday night and our server promptly greeted us and took our drink orders. There was a great 2 piece Carribean style band playing at the front of the crowded restaurant! We ordered chips and guac to start and were surprised when it was made tableside with fresh ingredients by our server! I ordered the Mariscos Enchiladas which were delicious but drenched in the crema sauce to the point that i had to dig to find enchilada! A little less would have been perfect I think! Our service was pristine until it came time to pay the check... we waited about 15 minutes after our leftovers had been boxed up for our server to reappear and present us with our check. By this point business had slowed considerably so I was a little confused as to how he forgot about us, but never the less a great dining experience overall!
