If you go here get the full dinner entrees, they are fantastic. The smaller taco plates and such are decent but not why you want to go to Barrio.

You cannot go wrong with the Cochinita Pibil (12 hr pork) or my favorite, Pescado del Mar (halibut), or my wifes favorite, Chiles en Nogada (stuffed pablano pepper) - but everything is very good.

The place is small, and get packed later in the evenings. The service is very random based on the server you get. I've had great service many times, but horrible service just as many... and everything in between.

Go here... it is not cheap, but the food is worth it for those special occasions.
