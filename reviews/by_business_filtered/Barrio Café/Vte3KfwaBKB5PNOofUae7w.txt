i've had lunch and dinner at barrio and it was night and day.  the fish tacos at lunch are spectacular.  tons of food and everything was well prepared and fresh.  the soups here are also killer.

then dinner - what a disappointment.  my friend has THE spiciest dish i've tasted in a long time - outweighed the hottest curry i've even had lately.  the chef obviously didn't taste what they were putting out because i'd never serve something to this caliber without due warning or knowledge.

i had the seafood enchiladas, which should have been called the queso fresco enchiladas with scatterings of seafood.  TONS of cheese.  i couldn't even finish the dish because of all the cheese.

i'm not in phoenix anymore and if i go back, i'll probably stick to my guns and not go to barrio, at least not for dinner.  but i'll give them another shot...
