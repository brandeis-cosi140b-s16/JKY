Having seen so many yelp reviews and also the feature on Food Network, I had my heart set on the Chiles en Nogada- pepper filled with chicken.  Upon arrival, the parking lot was small but colorful with the graffitis on the walls.  We were seated right away since it was still early and were brought bread with a very excellent salsa (it's got olives in it!).

I ordered the stuffed chicken of course, and the boyfriend had the 12-hour roasted pork.  Despite the good reviews on the tableside avocado, we did not order it as it is really something that can be made at home for 1/10 the price.  For our mains, my pepper stuffed chicken was heavenly with each bite.  The almond slices give everything a nice texture and the pomegranate seeds were a creative compliment.  I literally ate everything except for the stem.  The boyfriend's roast pork taco was very good as well.  The pork had an unusual tangy taste that's not found in your typical pork taco.  The portion was big so we were full just on entr√©e alone.  The only downside of the evening was that our waiter seemed bored and did not really care about serving us.

Despite the service, I would definitely come back for the chicken if I was ever lucky enough to be in town again.
