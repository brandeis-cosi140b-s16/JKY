EASILY my favorite Mexican Restaurant in PHX... hands-down. We've been here several times and I have no idea why I've waited until now to tell the world how yummy this place is. 

It's VERY small and can get busy, but it's worth the wait! Drinks are great, margaritas are a perfect balance of alcohol and mixer, and there are plenty of marg choices! 

On the most recent trip, I started with the Lobster Quesadilla and it's nothing short of perfect. For the main course, I had the Chiles en Nogada, which is a poblano pepper full of chicken, pecans, apples, pears, apricots and spices with some white sauce, oaxaca cheese and pomegranate seeds on the side. This was recommended by my server and it was my favorite meal here so far. It was a perfect balance of flavors that I wouldn't have (and initially upon ordering didn't) expect. On my previous trip I had tacos and my friend had chicken with mole sauce on it, and she explained it was the best mole he's EVER had. 

Service is always great, not too overbearing but always there to quickly refill drinks and take your order or bring your check. I love its chill vibe but fun/authentic atmosphere. When out of towners want to know where to find the best Mexican food in a town full of it, this is where we tell them to go. It's not as touristy as other Mexican restaurants, but that's one of my favorite things... it's not overly cheesy (literally and figuratively). :)
