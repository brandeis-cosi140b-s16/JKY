I try to surprise my wife about once a month with a trip to Barrio.  It's not the closest restaurant to us, but it is always worth the drive.  

I've read on past reviews that people say their margaritas are expensive, true, but you get what you pay for!  At least it's not a crappy expensive marg.  

Rarely do we venture far from the "Two Fish Tacos and Two Margarita 'Combo'".  We'll mix it up with chips and guac once in a while, but that is just icing on the cake.  

The decor is awesome and the place is quaint.  The parking is bad and the wait is long.  Worth it?  Hell yes!  

I love it when Italians work at Italian restaurants... and the same goes true for Mexican joints.  Thanks for keepin it real Barrio!
