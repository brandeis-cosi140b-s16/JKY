Barrio did not live up to expectations. The restaurant itself was not inviting. The echo made the place feel cold, more like a storage room. 

The food was utterly forgettable. Bland and boring. I am not that hard to please and this food failed on every level. 

The server was attentive in the beginning but after the entrees were dropped- we were forgotten. We finally found someone to help us and got the dessert to the table and even that was gross. Which I find unbelievable.     

The positives: the bathroom decor is very cool. The margarita was the best I have ever had. And I do not say that statement lightly. It was awesome.
