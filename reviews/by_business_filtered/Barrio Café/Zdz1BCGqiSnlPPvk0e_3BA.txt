The 411:

-tiny place with live music on the Friday night we went
-long wait (45min for a party of 2 on a friday night) but worth it
-absolutely love the pom guac- ridiculously delicious (my fav)
-legit tacos 

Would definitely go back even with the long wait- next time I will order drinks at the bar while I wait
