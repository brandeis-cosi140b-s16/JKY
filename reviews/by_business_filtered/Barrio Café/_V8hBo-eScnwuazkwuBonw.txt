A group of my friends and I read about Barrio Cafe in The State Press Magazine's "Best Of" edition.  Looking to squeeze something new and hopefully exciting out of the Phoenix Metro area, so the six of us decided to try it.

The wait was long...about an hour, and since not everyone was drinking  we waiting outside on a bench directly outside of the bar.

The wait wasn't as long as they said it would be and we were seated in one of the rooms of the low ceiling white wall adobe interior (ok, that makes it sound bad, because of the lighting, it was nice and cozy not stark and confining).

We ordered the Guacamole to start because it is supposed to be their "signature" as it is made fresh right in front of your eyes at the table.  Apparently quite the draw for most patrons as our server informed us that  EVERYONE ordered it and that she and the rest of the servers all really hated making it (that made us feel GREAT).  The guacamole was however worth it (even if it was insinuated upon us ordering it that we were 'restaurant tourists')

There were basically no vegetarian options and it was quite the scoffing matter on the part of our server when I requested a substitute of beans on a chicken dish ("We don't serrrve beans here.")  I wound up getting the same dish, just without chicken.

All of the dishes (veggie or not) were small for the price (and for being a full dinner).  

The margarita I had was tasty, but not enormous (I think it was about $10).  I like a big margarita with Mexican food, call me crazy.

There was a live duo that played for a while during our supper.  They were entertaining, but not too distracting and still allowing for conversation at our table.

Although I wouldn't recommend this place for large groups (it's pretty small), there seemed to be a number of large groups there which I found interesting.

All in all, I'm glad I had the opportunity to check this place out, but it's definitely not first on my list of places to go back to immediately.
