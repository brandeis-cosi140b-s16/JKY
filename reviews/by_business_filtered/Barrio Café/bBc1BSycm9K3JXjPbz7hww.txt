This is as good as it gets! Imagine driving thru Phoenix for your first time.  You head down 16th street and you find yourself in a distressed part of town. Or so it seemed. You come upon the building riddled with graffiti but very artsy looking stuff. Kinda looks like tattoos on walls. You walk inane it is packed (1pm) Friday afternoon packed. We knew we were going to have good food. The food was the best Mexican food ever. It wasn't typical Mexican food either. It had a lot of culinary flare to it. Very well prepared and presented. I am hoping to get back here again real soon and if your ever in Phoenix make your way here at any cost.
