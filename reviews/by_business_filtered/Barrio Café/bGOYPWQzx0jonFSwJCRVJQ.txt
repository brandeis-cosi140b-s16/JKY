Tried Barrio cafe again. Still had the same experience. I actually ordered the same thing as last time- the thing I really wanted to try they no longer make- "FOREVER", I was told. So, anyhow- again, the mariscos enchiladas were killer. I did find a shell in my food again, but only 1 this time. My margarita was not very good- I tried a house one this time. It was just very sweet. My friend had one that was sort of a red color. It wasn't very good either. I don't think he finished it. He originally tried to order a different one, but the server told him not to- said it tasted like "cough syrup".

The food tastes good, the drinks just aren't great. It's very expensive. It was $13 for guacamole. They make it table side, but our server put in way too much lime juice, so it was... well, it was okay, but probably not $13 ok.


I don't know... $95 for 2 drinks, 1 guacamole and 2 entrees seems steep to me. I do like the place, but I think it will just be a once in awhile spot. I have had much less expensive meals at swankier places in the valley. It's not that swank is important- I just am weighing the value differences.

Our server discouraged my friend from many of his entree choices telling him certain things were not good... eek. I appreciate her honesty, but kinda a bad sign about the food.
