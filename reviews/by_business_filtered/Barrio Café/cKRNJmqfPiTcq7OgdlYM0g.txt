Wow!  The guacamole...

Graphic art meets Culinary art!  If you're in the mood for Mexican, this probably isn't the place because its not what we white folks think of  traditional at all.  However, if you are in the mood for an experience (both for food and ambience) this is your place!  Small and quaint with a large selection of Mexican beer and Tequila and great happy hour deals.  Don't forget to check out the bathrooms - seriously.
