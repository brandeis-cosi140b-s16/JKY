Why not more stars? While Barrio Cafe does indeed serve up some tasty good Mexican food...I was expecting to be blown out of my mind, but that didn't happen. 

We started the meal off with a generous portion of guacamole...fresh & chunky with added touch of cranberry

Pollo En Mole was good but the mole sauce played only 2 notes sweet and hot, lacking the depth of complexity that I was expecting

The Cochinita Pibil was a major disappointment.  While the texture was soft and succulent (as per 12 hour slow roasting technique quoted in the menu), it needed flavor...we had to resort to giving a good dollop of hot sauce to finish the dish.

The Churros we ended with was delicious with goat milk caramel for an added twist.  However, thought that  the $9.50 price was a bit high for just 2 pieces.

Conclusion:  Good food, but just didn't deliver for the price
