You know you're in for a fun experience as soon as you walk in the door. Vintage Mexican movie posters line the hallway, while works by local artists brighten the walls in the two dining rooms. The tables are lit by tall votive-candle glasses embossed with pictures and mini-bios of various saints. Be sure to visit the restroom - wildly painted, adorned with colorful tiles, and decorated with crucifixes, statues of the Virgin Mary, and pictures of Jesus, its somewhat irreverent and completely unexpected atmosphere is sure to stun you and make you smile. As will the food. Despite the name, there's nothing barrio about the cuisine, an eclectic mix of south-of-the-border dishes that eschews the typical combination platters that are geared towards gringo palates in favor of colonial Mexican cooking. As if to emphasize the fact that this is no Chevy's, the traditional chips and salsa are replaced by a basket of French bread with a tapenade of olives, garlic, and capers. Do not miss Guacamole Casero, which is prepared fresh tableside. A ripe avocado, moistened with olive oil, white vinegar, and a splash of balsamic vinegar, is mashed with onions, tomato, cilantro, and pomegranate seeds, and served with topopos (round, fried, chiplike corn tortillas). The chef best displays her successful break from the familiar with the entrees. Seared duck breast is sweet, spicy and tart, aided by the addition of a tamarind and chipotle sauce. Seafood enchiladas are comprised of blue corn tortillas rolled with scallops, cheese, and crab, and topped with a trio of meaty shrimp. The chile en nogada is a large poblano pepper stuffed with apples, pears, raisins, pomegranate seeds, chicken, and smothered in an almond cream sauce. The bar stocks nearly 200 brands of tequila, wine from Valle de Guadalupe in Baja California, and a variety of Mexican beers, in addition to domestic selections. The extraordinary quality of the food is not reflected in the prices - all entrees are $20.00 or less.
