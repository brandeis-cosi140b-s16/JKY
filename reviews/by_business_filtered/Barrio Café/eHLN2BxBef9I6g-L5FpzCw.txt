See the guys in triple D and have been wanting to eat here done. I live in So Cal but come for business a fair amount so it's been tough to get here but I finally made it. Sooooooo glad I did.!!
Cochinita Pibil was bar far the best I've had. I had them make me up a low rider marg to go alongside and it too was money!   

All i can say is come here and enjoy a non greasy, non traditional ( no chips and salsa, no rice and frijoles) mexican good joint.  It rocks! !!!
