My wife and I stopped in for lunch yesterday because we recently saw the triple D episode. Have to say, the food is amazing. Service was good and waiter was friendly. We tried the tacos, she had the fish and I had the pork. Both were phenomenal. When we are in the area we will put this on our rotation of Phoenix food choices!
