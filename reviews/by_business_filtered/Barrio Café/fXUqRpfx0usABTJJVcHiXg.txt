I ate here last week with my boss (she picked).  We had heard that this was a "must try" restaurant and had received great reviews.  I have to say that it was good, but I have had better.  I felt the prices were extremely high for Mexican food.  They did tableside guacamole, which was I think $12 or something.  The place was really small, which I actually liked because it felt homey and relaxed.

All in all, it was ok.
