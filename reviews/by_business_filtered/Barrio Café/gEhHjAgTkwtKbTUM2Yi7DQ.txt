The first time I went here, I LOVED IT!
This time.... not so much.

We had awful awful awful service.
Our server was slow, forgetful, and snotty.

YUCK.

I like the pomegranate seeds in the guacamole.
I ordered the enchiladas suizas, and I found them to be oddly sweet and the chicken was chewy and tough inside.

I think this place has outlived it's useful lifespan.
