BEST FOOD EVER!  . . . and MY HIBISCUS MARGARITA WAS SUPERB! 

On a very crowded celebratory evening  . . . one where AZ finally did the right thing . . .we stopped in for a bite . . . food is so good and there was so much celebrating to do that we were not the only ones who needed our hunger satisfied. We sat in the bar and drank wonderfully potent margaritas and waited for a table to open up. Worth every minute of the wait. Our busy server was attentive, without being overpowering, and there was not one thing I'd change about that exquisite meal. Not one!

This chef has to be one of the tops in the country! I absolutely couldn't have been happier with my meal . . . and will I go back? In a heartbeat!
