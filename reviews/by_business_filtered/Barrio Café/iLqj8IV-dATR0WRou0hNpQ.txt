I called my friend who lives in Tucson up and was like "Oh hey, I'm headed to Phoenix. Let's do dinner!" Given my Northeastern-ness and general geographical warp of the rest of the United States, I assumed it was a "quick jaunt." After correcting me and mentioning the 115 mile drive, my friend mentioned that she had few ideas, but had heard of this terrific upscale Mexican place called Barrio Café. Turns out it was worth the lead!

Barrio Café has an interesting menu presenting thoughtfully prepared Mexican dishes with flair. I really enjoyed the tableside guacamole preparation (which included pomegranate seeds, which I hadn't seen in guac before), and their extensive tequila and margarita menu was great. I had a delicious chicken in black mole dish which was awesome. The mole sauce was flavorful and rich, and the consideration of flavor profiles and the way colors played on the plate was impressive. This is no taco joint! The price point is a bit higher than average for Mexican food in Phoenix, but offers a more sophisticated and elegant range of choices if you're looking for something slightly upscale.

The staff was friendly and accommodating and the spare, but colorfully decorated dining room was pleasant. By the time we exited, the restaurant was packed and I can see why. Another great find in Phoenix, and recommended if you're in the area looking for a leisurely, tasteful dining experience.
