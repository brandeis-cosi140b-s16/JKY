Omigoodness! SO GOOD.  My husband and I weren't horribly hungry when we got here, but we still managed to disappear a plate of cochinita pibil - and it's a LOT of food. 

We got there around 1 on a Saturday afternoon, and the restaurant was half full. Service was prompt, and the food came out quickly. There was lovely live music, and it was just a nice afternoon. 

We aren't much for drinking, but the horchata is worth the cost. 

LOVE.
