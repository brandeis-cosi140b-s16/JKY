Churros = GOOD; Mysteriously delicious restaurant you could easily overlook = typically Phoenix in a way you can come to appreciate via the treasure hunt hypothesis.  

The food is artfully prepared and tasty, but modern Mexican just doesn't sit well with me -- it is far too pretentious.  And my $12 margarita was just not worth it -- which was a bummer  (oh...is it past 1995?  Have people stopped saying that?) because I was in a celebratory mood.
