We came here with a few friends for a lazy Sunday brunch. 

Food 
Someone in our group got the guac with pomegranate seeds, while we split an order of the fish tacos. We substituted the steak fries for a salad. 
Guac - pretty tasty. The pomegranate seeds added a unique, slightly tart taste to the dish. 
Fish taco - four mini tacos, each soft corn tortilla filled with a nicely fried piece of fish fillet (tastes like cod), cabbage, and creamy chipotle sauce. 
Coffee - came in a French press, which allowed for slow steeping and extra aroma. Definite bonus points. 

Ambiance 
There is a guy playing live guitar during brunch. Not really our thing (we couldn't hear each other talking), but kinda cool I guess.
