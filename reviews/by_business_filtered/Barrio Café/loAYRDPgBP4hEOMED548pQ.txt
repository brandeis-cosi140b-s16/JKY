I feel like part of the in-crowd whenever I dine at Barrio Cafe. This is good and bad: good, because I realize, as hordes of other people do, that this is some of the most innovative Mexican food in town; bad, because tonight I realized the in-crowd often is, in its lust for a good meal, downright rude. One set of patrons muscled its way to the front of the line as the restaurant geared up for its 5 p.m. Saturday opening. I mean, really, just get in line. Then, once we were dining, we noticed another set of patrons coming in the back door and just seating themselves at an empty table. The waitperson, to her credit, remained polite toward them. Sigh, I'm trying a week night next time ...
