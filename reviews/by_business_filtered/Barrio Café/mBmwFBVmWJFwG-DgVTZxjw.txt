Flew into Phoenix for the first time, and of course, it's hot as balls. The fact that it can be 100 degrees at 9 PM is very confusing. My co-worker said, "We're going to eat at Barrio Cafe." Fine. I'll get a margarita and I'll feel less... wet.

Fast forward a few hours and I've consumed not one, not two, but four margaritas, each one more delicious than the one prior. I've consumed an amazing bowl of tableside-crafted guacamole. And I am face deep in a pile of the most amazing cochinita pibil that I've ever had. True, my cochinita sample size is an N of 1 but still... ridiculously good.

Then, against my better judgement (not that it was in a good place after 4 margaritas), we ordered the chocolate cake and the churro with goat's milk caramel. Â¡Ermagerd! Total. Food. Coma.

What can I say? The sweating was worth it for food this good.
