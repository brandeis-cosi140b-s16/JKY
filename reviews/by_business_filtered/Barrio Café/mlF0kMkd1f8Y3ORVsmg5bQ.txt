Came here for lunch yesterday with my Daddy.

The location is sketchy to say the least, but once you get inside it's nice.

The menu was big but kind of expensive. Pretty shitty they don't have a lunch menu either. My Dad wasn't very hungry so he got the Posole Verde (pork & veggie soup). I got the Tacos de Carne Asada (pretty self explanitory). Dad said soup was tasty & I felt the same way about my tacos. The meat had to be the best part, so tender. The fries it came with, eh I've had better. Wish I got the Churros Rellenos de Cajeta de Cabra (churros & ice cream dessert) but for $12, wtf!?

Overall this place has very good food but a little too pricey, especially for the location. I think our total was about $30-for a a bowl of soup, 4 tiny tacos + fries & 2 drinks. Don't think we will be in any hurry to come back...
