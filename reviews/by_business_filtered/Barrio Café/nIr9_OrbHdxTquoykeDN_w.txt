The food is just ok in my opinion. I've had lots of authentic Mexican food at a more reasonable price. This was expensive for the quality of the food. Also our waiter wasn't the best he didn't have a great attitude kinda just the "I'm here be I have to be here attitude" and he forgot our drinks and we waited forever finally just caught him waking by and asked for the check. We won't be going back...
