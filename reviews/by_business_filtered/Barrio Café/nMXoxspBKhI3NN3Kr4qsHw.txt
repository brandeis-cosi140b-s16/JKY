THE BEST MEXICAN FOOD IVE EVER HAD ANYWHERE!  And I'm a huge foodie who has eaten at a lot of great Mexican restaurants. This is my family's all time favorite restaurant!  No, it's not cheap, but YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!  Incredible food from an incredible chef. Believe the hype.  There is a reason why chef Silvana has been written up in various magazines and has been nominated multiple times for a James beard award. Notable items on the menu include- guacamole, the elote appetizer, all soups on the menu are to die for, the pescado del mar, the seafood enchiladas, the cochinita pibil, The low rider margarita, and all of their desserts( in particular the churros). I've never had anything here I didn't think was amazing!
