Holy fuck nuggets, this was some seriously good Mexican food!

OK, look, I'm from New York City, and I will admit I do not know JACK SHIT about good Mexican good. Why? Because we don't fucking have it! It's really frustrating! So when I travel anywhere in taco chucking distance of the Mexican border, I belly straight up and stuff my face with every dish ending in -ito, -dilla, and -o, with some sweet, sweet horchata (very generously portioned at this place) to wash it all down. I think the avocado/pomegranate guacamole made at your table is what sealed the deal for me on Barrio Cafe. I mean, seriously, OMG, the food here was delicious. I can't say there weren't a few false notes, but I can hardly remember what they were, so fuck it. The tequila menu is also ridiculous. I need to come back to work my way through it. I hope they offer ambulance service, because I don't even want to think about what's going to gush out of my body after I OD at this, one of the finest Mexican restaurants I encountered in the sprawling wasteland that is Phoenix.
