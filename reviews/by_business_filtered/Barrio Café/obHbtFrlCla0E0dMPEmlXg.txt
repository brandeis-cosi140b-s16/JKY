Pretty awesome, saw this spot on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives a couple of years ago and remembered it when I was in town on vacation. I'm glad we came here for lunch/dinner. The portions were big and the food was very good, not your regular mexican food which I really liked. 

I ordered the famous chile relleno and it was sooooo good, I've had some good chile rellenos in the past but this one was different, stuffed with chicken, cheese, fruit and I believe nuts and topped with this awesome sauce and pomegranates, very Azteca which I loved. The side of mashed potatoes were especially good too, they had a little spice to them and they also gave a side of veggies, the dish was huge. My sis ordered the Cochinita Pibil tacos and those were also very good, three tacos stuffed with marinated pork and topped with pickled onions, what else can you ask for? 

Don't forget to get an order of the guacamole while you wait for your food, that too was delicious. We also tried to horchata which was divine and a mixed drink with horchata mixed in it ( I forgot the name). If I ever come back to the Phoenix area, I'd definitely make this a "must dine" again. The only thing I didn't like about it was it's a bit small and we waited for a table for a while when the dining room didn't seem too full, and it was a bit expensive, but worth the wait.
