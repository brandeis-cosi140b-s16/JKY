Food was good and authentic. I tried guacamole with pomegranate seeds in it and was thinking I would like that mix but it was actually very good.

I asked our waiter to substitute fried shrimp with my tacos with saut√©ed shrimp and he made that happen without hesitation. Everything that came out looked very well played and full of life.

The graffiti "amazing artwork" alone is well worth the visit. It's literally all around the entire building and in the neighborhood just behind the restaurant. In addition they sell art at reasonable prices, it's displayed on the wall inside.
