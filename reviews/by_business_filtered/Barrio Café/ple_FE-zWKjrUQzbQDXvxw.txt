It's been said that "It's the little things that count." While true, it neglects to mention how important the big things are.  Barrio Caf√© is a perfect example of the limitations of this maxim.

You see, Barrio Cafe nails the little things: great art, horchata served in empty Mexican coke bottles, banana leafs on plates, a fantastic mural, pomegranate seeds in the guacamole, a very enjoyable adobo flavored ketchup, a hip ambience, a smartly dressed wait staff - all very well done and deserving of stars.

Where the house of cards crumbles is when the food hits the mouth.  My cochinita pibil sandwich, recommended by the waiter and a signature dish, could only be described as bland.  Served atop two plodding pieces of thick French bread - it made me long for the powerfully flavorful and soft bites at Tortas El Guero down the street.

BC has been out for a while and has a reputation in the area as a winner - maybe their food quality has slipped with a change of chef.  

Until the eats get better, barrio cafe will remain, to me, just a place that gets the little things right.  

Two little stars
