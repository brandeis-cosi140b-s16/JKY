The food here is DELICIOUS!  The Margaritas are fantastic!  The staff is WONDERFUL!  I ate here with my 2 year old son and my husband and the entire staff was so sweet to my little boy.  They were all very warm and friendly.  It almost felt like we were having dinner with friends.  They had live entertainment the night that we were there, which made the experience that much better.

The only criticism that I have is that it was pretty hot inside the restaurant.  I give a bit of a pass on this though because it was 120 degrees this particular weekend and the cold air must have just been leaving the restaurant every time the door opened...

I will be going back to Barrio Cafe the next time I visit Phoenix.  :)
