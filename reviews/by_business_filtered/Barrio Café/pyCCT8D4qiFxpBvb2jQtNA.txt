The food here is good but wayyyyyy overpriced. Talk about gouging your prices. I had the black mole enchiladas they were good just like we make at home but really 20.00 for this plate of tortilla chicken and mole sauce is just ridiculous. It also came with a side of veggies that lacked flavor and a pico that was forgettable.   I didn't even bother eating the pico or the vegetables. My daughter had the carne Asada tacos nothing special. My husband had the crepa de chorizo and he said it was nothing special.  I don't recommend this place  the food is good but with the price ....I left this place feeling taken advantage of.  I won't be back but at least I tried a new place.....
