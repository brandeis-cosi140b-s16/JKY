This place is awesome. I took my mom who was in town for my birthday and we had a great time. 
Ok, so we are of the Mexican persuasion and we know good Mexican food when we have it and this place is GREAT Mexican food. Pomegranate seeds on guacamole, seriously? Amazing. It was so good the next day was the Super Bowl and even though I live in Glendale I drove the thirty minutes there and back just to get the guacamole for the game. I waited outside for my mom while she ran in and picked it up and they gave her a free tequila shot... not that she needed it. And they brought me out free Flan (fantastic) for my bday. 
Tequila bar was on point too.
