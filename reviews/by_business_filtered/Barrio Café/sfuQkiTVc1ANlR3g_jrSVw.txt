I met a group of friends for dinner here and it was a nice dinner.  I didn't break down in bliss because it was the best Mexican food I've ever had nor did angels and cherubs appear.  It was a nice dinner.

The whole waiting situation, to be honest, is annoying.  If the bar area was larger perhaps it wouldn't be or if they took reservations but I hate waiting.  It was only because I like my friends so much that I could do it.  (It was all for you ladies....because I love you. ;)) 

The wine selection is ok, the tequila selection is incredible.   Our server was very friendly and attentive and all of our dishes were delivered quite quickly to our table.  The tableside made guacamole was ok...to be honest, my husband makes a better guac.  I think it may have been that the avocados were not ripe yet because it was very chunky.  The queso was good, not nearly as good as the queso at El Encanto.   I chose the enchiladas suizas which was very very rich; to the point where it was too  rich.  Much to my dismay there was little chicken and a whole lot of cheese.  I left half a plate of cheese behind when I was done. I did think it was pretty reasonably priced however, we each paid about $35 for our entree, a drink, and the appetizers.  

They had live music playing which would normally be a nice touch but we were seated directly next to it and it was very distracting.  I could barely hear my friends over it.  Given the small size of the restaurant and the atmosphere I think the music would be much better acoustic.  

I am sure that during my years living in Phoenix I will return here at some point but I don't know how soon it will be.  I would like to take my husband at some point, if for nothing else the tequila selection, but I don't think it would be at the top of the list.
