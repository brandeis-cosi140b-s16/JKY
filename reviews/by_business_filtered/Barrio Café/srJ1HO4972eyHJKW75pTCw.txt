One of the best Mexican restaurants I've ever been to.  The guacamole was excellent and included craisins, an unconventional but delicious spin on the dish.  On our waiter's recommendation I ordered a stuffed pepper dish with chicken, a cream sauce, and pomegranate.  It was a perfect balance of sweet and savory.  Highly recommend this place.
