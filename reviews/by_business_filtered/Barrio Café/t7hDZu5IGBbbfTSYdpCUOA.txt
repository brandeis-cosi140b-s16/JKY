The food was very good.  The best I've had, no.  Their horchata was refreshing and not too sweet.  The green posole was tasty, I wish they had garnish to add like authentic posole.  The only down fall was I though it was a bit pricey for Mexican food.  You must take a picture in front of the wall on the side of the building, too!
