I am giving this restaurant four stars as it is the first time I've been there and until I go a second time I can't give it a five.
My wife and I went here for lunch. Service was above par. They were attentive, kind and knowledgeable.
The food was very good and packed with flavor. We had the suisa and we split a carne taco plate. Both dishes were very tasty. The prices match the quality of the food. That being said it is pricier for lunch. We spent $40 for two of us for lunch and did not have sodas or dessert.

In the not as great side of the table, I was looking for standard chips and salsa but they do not provide that like most Mexican restaurants.  Instead the offer bread and olives.  This was my least favorite part of the meal. 

Final word, this is a very good restaurant. Its good for business lunches and dinners. I am excited to go back soon and give it a fifth star.
