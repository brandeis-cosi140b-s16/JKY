I love this place, I dont go as often as I should but every time I do I am never disappointed. I read many reviews about it being over priced and I have to agree with one of the last reviewers and say NO. If you are in to average Mexican food with melted cheese and meat inside hard corn tortillas meant to resemble taco's then yes, this is not the place to go. If you want quick not bad Mexican food, there are a couple of places with in walking distance from Barrio. That being said the food here is regional its a little french aka rich in taste but not pretentious. I really have never had anything here I did not rave about for at least 2 hours afterward, sometimes days. The cochinita pibil and the yucca that accompanies it is a comfort food like no other! who needs pot roast and mashed potatoes? The mushroom filled enchiladas bring creamy and earthy together beautifully, I can go on and on...
