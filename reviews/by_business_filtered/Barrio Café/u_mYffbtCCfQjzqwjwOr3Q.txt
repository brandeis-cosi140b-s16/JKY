I love this place!    Everything has a unique taste and after spending eight days in Phoenix, this Barrio Cafe was hands down the best tasting food.  I will admit we did not make it over to the 16th Street location, we did eat at the airport location inside the Southwest Terminal.  After talking with a few locals that were traveling, they all said the food at this location was on par with the 16th Street location.  

We had guacamole table side, was not impressed, but I think the girl who was preparing our app was new.  Then we move on to the nachos.....  OMG, these had some sort of cheesy gravy I have never experienced before, I have to admit, I pigged out.  My burrito was out of this world; everything seems fresh and hand-made.  Left completely stuffed and happy.  Worth the stop.
