Wow! Visited Phoenix, Az and went into this restaurant with local friends.  Unassuming front leads you into a world of delicious mexican food.  The guacamole made at the table was excellent, the tortilla chips seemed like they were freshly friend for each table, the extensive margarita list was amazing (I suggest the Cadillac).  Now for the menu, its amazing, I've gone twice and got the same dish the Tacos Cochinita Pibil, like a moist pulled pork taco stewed in Mayan spices and a homemade tasting queso fresco.  I cannot recommend this dish, nor this restaurant enough.  Friendly staff, delicious food, reasonable prices, relaxed atmosphere.
