I am giving this restaurant for stars as it is the first time I've been there and until I go a second time I can't give it a five.
My wife and I went here for lunch. Service was above par for lunch. They were attentive kindand knowledgeable.
The food was outstanding. We had the sweet says and we split a carnet taco plate. Both dishes were very tasty and had a lot of flavor. The prices match the quality of the food. That being said it is pricier for lunch. We spent 40for two of us for lunch and did not have sodas or dessert.
All in all this is a great restaurant. I would love to go back for dinner.
