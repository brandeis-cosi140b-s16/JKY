Add mine to the list of 'damn, the food is good here' [as long as you order the right thing] and the guacamole is delish. Add also that the service - yeah, you Dario - was bogus. Guac order came with the entrees, side salad for one of the three of us never delivered or acknowledged as missing, and generally a sense that he was doing us a favor coming to work today. Neat. 

On food grounds alone its very fine. I had the langostine quesadilla and it was delish: a nice chunk of lobster on each [and there are four 4" tortillas/quesadillas], in a sweet sauce that was perfectly countered by goat cheese. I tasted the fish tacos - also seemed perfectly matched: the slight heat of the baja sauce, perfectly cooked fish [lightly battered and not at all heavy or greasy]and cabbage...nice. I didn't try the mole but the report was bland. We all loved the guac and the chips. [Two of us had soda, one an iced tea - bill came to $72 before tip for three of us.]

Be warned, this is not a quiet place. Even two-thirds full at lunch, its loud. I could see bringing friends and drinking margaritas, and having the noise just be part of the enjoyment. Now if only Dario would stay home...
