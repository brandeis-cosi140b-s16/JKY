While not an expert on Phoenix Mex restaurants this is hands down my favorite.  Was turned on to it by locals.  Food is almost 5 star, the fish dishes are very unique and exceptionally good.  Wine list and margaritas are very good.  It is a little on the pricey side and the parking and neighborhood are sketchy but I am always driving a rental anyhow.  Haven't seen all the articles written about the place as I am not from Phoenix but I hope that isn't a bad sign.  I find that places tend to go down hill once everyone in the United States know about them.
