I had a late lunch on a weekday. The staff was still pretty busy but customers were thinning out. Service was a little hit and miss. The waiter seemed exhusted. This restaurant is small and feels cramped. It's a little like dining with the people at the next table. 
Our food was pretty good except the tampande was lacking flavor. The tacos were flavorful, the coffee was great. 
It's a little expensive but it's definetly a better Mexican fare.
