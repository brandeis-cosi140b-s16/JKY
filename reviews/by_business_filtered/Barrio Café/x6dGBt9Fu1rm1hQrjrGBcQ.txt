There probably isn't much that I can say that hasn't already been said here.  So I'll just say whenever people come from out of town, and they ask me where they can go for "real" Mexican food...this is where I send them.  Tex-Mex isn't Mexican.  Silvana's Chiles en Nogadas is.  

I remember the first time I met Silvana, at the Botanical Garden, where she had a demo showing how many ingredients are put into a traditional mole sauce.  It's that kind of love for her food that transfers into her creations.  

Yes, the lines can be long.  But there's an obvious reason for that.  Besides, the tequila selection is quite extensive.  Consider it part of the Barrio experience.  Order some chips and guac, enjoy the art, chat with the bartender, learn about the Calle16.org project, take it all in.

BTW, I think many of the people who don't like this restaurant are so indoctrinated by Tex Mex they have a hard time considering a different, and authentic take, on what Mexican food really means.  The country has 32 different states, so many different regions and cultures...it's not just tacos and burritos. 

If you're not willing to be open to that, if you don't have time for a great night out...and aren't willing to wait...there's always Taco Bell.  I'd appreciate you patronize them so you shorten my own wait at Barrio.
