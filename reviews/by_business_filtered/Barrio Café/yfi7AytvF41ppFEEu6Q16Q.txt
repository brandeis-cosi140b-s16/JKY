Wow, wow....wow!! I saw Barrio Cafe on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives and being originally from Phoenix vowed to try this restaurant on my next visit to Phoenix. It exceeded my expectations. Although predictably full when we arrived, the wait was fairly short. In the meantime, we enjoyed the amazing mural art on Calle 16. After being seated, we were greeted by a wonderful server named Jaime. He was very personable and enthusiastic, and made some recommendations for us. I ordered the cochinita tacos. AMAZING. The pork was to die for. My friend had the mole enchiladas. They were also very good, although we decided they could have had more mole sauce on them. A tad dry. But the mole itself was just like what I remember in Mexico. For dessert we had the churros with vanilla bean ice cream. These were no ordinary churros! So soft and delicious. 
Overall, I'd say it was one of the best Mexican food experiences I've ever had. And I am a Mexican food snob! 
Do not expect your run of the mill Mexican American food here. It is authentic and outstanding!
