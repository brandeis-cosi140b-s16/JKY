We had high hopes given the reviews.  We expected a nice dinner, but young people from a travel blog appeared suddenly and catering to them was a much higher priority than patrons for the restaurant staff.  Rather than seating them or us somewhere else, we had to endure endless sound checks and mindless PR drivel.  Food is good, not your usual Mexican/American fare, but pricey.  If they are hosting the Wichita Falls Travel Blog when you arrive, have a margarita and the guacamole, then go somewhere else for dinner.
