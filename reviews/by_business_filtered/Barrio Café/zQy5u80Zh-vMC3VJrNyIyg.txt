Although the Barrio Cafe is obviously a popular and cute little restaurant, I found myself mildly disappointed by the uneven quality. 

The guacamole was a good starter -- chunky and made fresh at the table with lots of sweet pomegranate arils, it was unique and tasty. Nice chips too. Unfortunately my margarita was sub par -- clearly they didn't get the ingredients balanced properly. Both of our entrees were very good overall; I had the chicken enchiladas with tomatillo sauce and spicy mashed potato side, and my girlfriend had the Chiles en Nogada. However, while I loved the flavor of my enchiladas, some of the tortillas were noticeably dry. Finally, we had the churros with caramel sauce for desert, which was just OK due to the churros being overdone.

Overall, a 3.5, but I'm rounding down due to high expectations. I'd certainly give them another try, but they need to eliminate the rough edges next time.
