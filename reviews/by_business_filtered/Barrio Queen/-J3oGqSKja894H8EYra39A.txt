Came here for the first time, for a girls night with two of my girlfriends. I have never felt so un comfortable in a bar, in my life. The blonde female bartender was extremely rude  and condescending. She almost wouldn't serve a friend and I our drinks because of a tiny crease in our id's (we're almost 30) it continued through our entire meal until a male bartender took over as we were closing our tab. The food was amazing but I will never come back due to the terrible service! This being a new restaurant, I hope they make sure to take time to express to their employees that making their customers feel welcome is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT!
