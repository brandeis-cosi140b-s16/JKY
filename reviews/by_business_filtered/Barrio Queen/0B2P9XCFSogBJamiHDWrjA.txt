Long wait for mediocre food...the chips and salsa was excellent but everything else we ordered wasn't great. My husband ordered the pozole and it didn't have much pork and the hominy was almost nonexistent. My plate was room temp and seemed like it had been sitting for a while. I wouldn't recommend waiting over an hour for food that isn't very good.
