Wait time of 20 minutes on a Thurs was reasonable.  The chips and mild salsa were tasty.  Unfortunately, that's where my satisfaction ended. The guacamole and queso barely provided a taste for six adults.  The tacos were absolutely the smallest I have ever been served.  They had little flavor. None of our food had much flavor and no spice.  If you're afraid of spicy Mexican, this place is for you.  Otherwise, there are much more flavor-able places in the area.
