We went here for the taco Tuesday special, 2.50 per taco. I ordered 3, they are just small street tacos, but the chips and salsa that they give to you filled me up. I got three different ones and I will write about each one separately.  1. Carne Asada with Chile relleno- the meat was very tender and well marinated,  the "Chile relleno" was actually a jalepeno. This was a, dissapointment. The flavor of jalepeno over powered the flavor of the meat. I wouldn't get this again and hope they change it to an actual Chile relleno or at least use the correct Chile pepper. 
2. Conchita Pobil- this was good,  the marinated red onion was my favorite part.  I may get this again, I will say I have had better. All I'm going to say is LA SANTISIMA Taco shop in Glendale. 
3. Saudero Azteca (Brisket)- this one was my favorite, I wish I would have had two of these ones. Next time I will want a burrito with this meat. 
I will be going back to Barrio queen to try new items. Just a few suggestions; please have different salsas available with different heat levels. We all don't enjoy mild. And when we ask for something spicier please don't offend me and hand me a bottle of tapatio!!! When I go to an "authentic" Mexican restaurant I expect much better for the salsa options. Please offer other beans. I don't know any kid who would want a black bean and cheese burrito. And last, I think it's crazyv to charge $5 for a horchata. I will have to taste it next time to see if it's worth that. Better be some damn good rice water
