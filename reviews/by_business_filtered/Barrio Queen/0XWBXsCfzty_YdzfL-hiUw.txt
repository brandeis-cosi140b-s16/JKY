The location is pretty rad and the food is pretty delish as well.  They always have a crowd so if you're on the urge to do some serious people watching you can definately do so here.  The outdoor seating is pretty spacious and the food and drink selection are pretty good as well.  The decor is pretty neat as well but the overall setup of the restaurant is odd but not bearing on this review.  The chips and salsa were spot on for a quick treat and the Menudo (served only on the weekends) was AWESOME!  Can't say that I usually go for that first off but it didn't disappoint.  The bar manager "Lost" (seriously his name) was primo and super helpful in describing what were key items on the menu along with suggesting some great pairings.  I'll definitely be back for more action!
