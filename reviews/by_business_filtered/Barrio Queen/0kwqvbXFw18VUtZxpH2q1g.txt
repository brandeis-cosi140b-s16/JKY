I know it's because of the area, but no reservations is a BIG bummer. Plus, the fact that when we went they didn't seat us for about 15 minutes, then proceeded to seat us at a table that had been empty the whole time we were waiting. We know there was a shift change coming up, but we would have been happy to nurse some drinks at a table. 

We've been to the Scottsdale location so we knew what we were getting into food wise, and it was just as good as expected. My house margarita knocked me on my rear-end, but it sure was tasty. Carne asada burritos with TONS of cheese are definitely the way to my heart, and many taco selections are the way to his, so we were both satisfied after eating here.
