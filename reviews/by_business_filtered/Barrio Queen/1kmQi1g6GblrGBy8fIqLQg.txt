Me and my husband really enjoyed this place. We ate lunch/early dinner here. Our margaritas were great and we loved choosing different tacos to eat rather than just getting one plate with the same taco. I don't remember the exact names of the tacos but they were all great (pork, fish, shrimp. steak etc). Wish we had a Barrio Queen in Jersey.
