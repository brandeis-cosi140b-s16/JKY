I don't know why it took me so long to visit Barrio Queen. I walked by it so many times and now that I've visited, I am kicking myself for the amount of time it took me to try it out! 

Barrio Queen was a pleasant surprise. This is definitely a higher end Mexican restaurant. It's not necessarily fancy but it's fancier then a divey Mexican food spot. You can get three tacos for around $10 and the tacos are delicious! They aren't your average tacos and there are about 12 different ones to choose from. The tacos are tiny but they are filling. We each had three tacos and then enjoyed the pork queso dip as an appetizer. We left just full enough without going into a food coma.  

I really enjoyed the atmosphere. They have two bars, with the one in the back being much larger. There are several tvs in the bar to allow sports fans to watch a game. I noticed several specials for happy hour pricing. I love their drinks, especially the punch and a margarita called Limon y Coco which is a delicious coconut pineapple juice. It's truly like drinking a vacation and all I need to do is sit on the patio with one of the drinks in my hand and I might as well be in Cabo! The punch was incredible and definitely a must-order if you like girly drinks. The patio comfortable and feels like you're in a big city and the interior is comfortable as well. 

This restaurant is definitely worth checking out to enjoy dinner and drinks. There's a reason it gets so crowded during the busy times of the year!
