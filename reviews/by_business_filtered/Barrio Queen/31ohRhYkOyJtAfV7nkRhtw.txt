If you love authentic tacos, not just the ones from taco bell or filibertos, then you will love the taco menu at Barrio Queen.
The taco menu consists of 20 different types of street tacos to choose from. And you can try one of each if that is what you wish, or order all of the same kind. It's up to you, which is what I love about it. One of my favorite flavors includes the Salmon y Mango taco, with chilled chunks of smoked salmon, diced mango and pico de gallo, served on a tiny corn tortilla. Delicious! I also tried the Carne Asada taco with fresh orange and garlic marinated grilled beef, topped with diced onion, cilantro and avocado., as well as the El Pastor taco with chile and spice marinated pork topped with diced onion, cilantro, pineapple, and salsa borracho.

Tacos is not all they serve either. Their menu includes enchiladas, tortas, burritos, quesedillas, and more. Barrio Queen serves up some authentic Mexican flavors while adding in their own rendition of spices and other ingredients to stand out from the crowd.

If you haven't tried this place yet, you need to. Excellent food! And don't forget to order their Barrio signature guacamole made table side - chunks of fresh avocado, pomegranate seeds, diced red onion, and maybe one other ingredient I can't remember. AWESOME!
