A few of my co-workers and I decided to check out Barrio Queen this past Friday (11/1/13), and what a great find! We all started with the house margaritas and table-side guacamole. What I particularly loved was while they were making the table-side quac the server made us feel part of the process. Asking how spicy we wanted it and showing all of the ingredients as they were added. We did end up switching servers part-way through, but the same high energy service we received at the beginning was carried out through the entire dinner. My only suggestion (hence the 4 star opposed to the 5 star), is that once we had finished the first basket of tortilla chips we were not given a second. This was only an issue for the fact that there were 4 of us and half a bowl of guac left. We did end up receiving a second basket after we asked. Other then that the night was exceptional! Keep up the good work!

Unfortunately, I cannot remember our first server's name, but the second was Ronald. With this top notch service this restaurant will remain in business a long time.
