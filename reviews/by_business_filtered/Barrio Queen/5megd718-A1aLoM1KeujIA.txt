My husband and I had lunch here first, each getting the 3 taco plate.  I have to say, the Carne Adovada y Huevo was my favorite on the menu.  That fried egg on top was just the right ticket.  My husbands favorite was the Cochinita Pinil one.  We ate again last night, Taco Tuesday, this time sitting at the bar.  Service was great, both bartenders did a great job making sure we were taken care of despite it being happy hour and there were lots of folks coming up trying to get drinks while they waited for tables.
