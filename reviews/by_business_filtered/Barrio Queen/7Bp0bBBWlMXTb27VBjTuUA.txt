We called 2 days ahead to ask if we could get a reservation. They do not do reservations. We were told that they do allow call ahead seating up to 2 hours before you arrive with a group. We called 2 hours before and were told that our name was taken and they would be ready for us. 2 hours later we arrived and no one knew anything about our "call-ahead" seating...The wait was 1 hour and 45 minutes.

I spoke to a manager who got us in as quickly as possible but the wait was still long considering they had promised us preferred access when we arrived.

We were told that the guacamole was a can't miss menu item...it was ok. 1 avocado and some other ingredients was hardly enough for the group to have more than 2 bites each and at $11, certainly not worth the money.

I ordered 4 tacos for the main course. They arrived on a plate that looked like your average run-of-the-mill Mexican restaurant serving plate except there was a huge open space on the plate...like there should have been rice and beans but it didn't come with them...?!?

The whole meal took over 3 hours and the waiter rarely came back to the table.
I thought maybe this was just a bad experience, so we tried it again about a week later. Same result.

Like some other reviewers, I really wanted to like this restaurant and I am excited about all of the new eateries popping up in downtown Gilbert. Unfortunately, I would not recommend Barrio Queen to anyone.
