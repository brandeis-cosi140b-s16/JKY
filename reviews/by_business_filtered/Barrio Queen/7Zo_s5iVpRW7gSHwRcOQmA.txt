We come here for Taco Tuesdays....

Not because we're cheap, but because it takes the edge of the inevitable Scottsdale-hipster-restaurant-surcharge, and gosh darnit, the tacos are downright delish.

Also of note on the menu, the mango avocado salad.  Touche, Barrio Queen,  for presenting a lettuce-free salad option.
