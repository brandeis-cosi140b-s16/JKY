Beautiful restaurant right off the river walk. The menu is extensive with plenty of choices of authentic Mexican fare. I ordered the casa margarita and WOW! it was so tasty! Even my mother who rarely ever drinks ordered one after trying mine. Service was friendly and prompt. I totally get why this place gets so packed with people!
