I was really looking forward to having incredible Mexican food in Phoenix, and Barrio Queen definitely did not disappoint.  From the incredible breadth of taco options to the drink menu, this place has quality food and a great atmosphere. It's a tad expensive, but worth it. 

Our group started out with some table side guacamole as well as chips and queso. The guac is pretty unique-  it came with dried cranberries in it.  I definitely recommend it, but the portion is a little small for a large group, so maybe order 2! You won't regret it. The queso came with chorizo on top, and I am a vegetarian, but the other members of my party thoroughly enjoyed it! We ordered two pitchers of sangria- 1 red and 1 white.  Both options are phenomenal, and come in a glass with a sugar salt rim....such a delicious touch.  

We loved our server, she was kind and offered great advice on ordering! I highly recommend the restaurant; it is fantastic.
