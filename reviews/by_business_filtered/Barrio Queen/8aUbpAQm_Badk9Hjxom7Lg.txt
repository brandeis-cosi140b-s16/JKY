This was our favorite meal during our Scottsdale vacation.  We had breakfast and it was fantastic.  Such an innovative menu and everything  we had was delish.  Even an order of   decaf coffee was french pressed and served in a very large pot.  It was wonderful coffee and I am very hard to please.  I wish we had Mexican food like this in Ashland.
