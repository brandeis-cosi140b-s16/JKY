My wife and I went to the Barrio Queen in Gilbert for the 1st time today. We loved the decor and the service was very good and prompt. The food was really not very good. The chips are VERY thick and just weird. The salsa had a very strange flavor to it. My wife had the Carnitas Taco and a Brisket Taco. I had the Conchita Pabil, Brisket and Grilled Shrimp Tacos. The carnitas were dry and bland, The conchita Pabil was just not very good. The brisket was flavorful and had a bit of a nice spicy kick to it and the grilled shrimp taco was quite good. The size of the tacos was really lacking and in my opinion quite expensive. The tacos are $3.50 each or 3/$10. In my opinion there are better taco options VERY close to the Barrio Queen, I will not use the name in a review of the BQ as I think that would be rude, but It wouldn't be very hard for you to figure out with a small bit of research.
