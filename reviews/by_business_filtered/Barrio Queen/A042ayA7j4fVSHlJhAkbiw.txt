We went for lunch with a group of friends, and the service and wait weren't bad at all - maybe because it was 7/3 and many people were off for the holiday. We were seated immediately, and the service was attentive and friendly. The complimentary chips and salsa were delicious. We couldn't eat enough of them! Everyone's food was quite tasty, although the taco sizes were disappointing. 3 tacos for $10 isn't outrageous, but we were expecting them to be slightly bigger. That said, the food was seasoned well. Definitely try the brisket or fish tacos - delish! Are there better Mexican options around this area? Probably. I don't think this will be a frequent go-to for us, but we wouldn't oppose to coming back now and then.
