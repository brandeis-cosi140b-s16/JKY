I am shocked by the low reviews people have posted. I'm somewhat of a "foodie" and have a fairly high standard for restaurant food. My husband and I stumbled on this place when visiting Scottsdale, and we loved it so much, we drove all the way back to Scottsdale to eat there for lunch before our plane left a couple days later. Excellent margaritas! Fresh chips, delicious salsa, and table-side guac with pomegranate was a total win!! Great combination of flavors, super cool decor, and friendly people! Would do it again any day! ...in fact, we already did!
