While visiting Scottsdale, I found this place on yelp. I'm really glad we stopped in for an early dinner.

We sat at the bar and enjoyed some ice cold beers and apps.

They brought out some hot chips and salsa..

I can't remember the name of the slow roasted pork dish but it was great. It was beyond filling...

We will be back if we are in the area....
