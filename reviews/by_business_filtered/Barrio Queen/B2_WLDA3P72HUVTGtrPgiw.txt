Really enjoyed this off shoot of the PHX Barrio.    Great tequila selection that was at first a lot to comprehend but my server Karen guided me through with ease.   Excellent selection of tacos from "al pastor" to "salmon y arrachera"  - my favorite.   Highly recommend and I'm a native - i've eaten a billion tacos.  Sit in Karen's section if you want to navigate all the highlights this place offers - she's awesome.   The location has been many things and I hope and believe this one 
will stick.   Cheers to you Barrio Queen.
