Barrio Queen is a more or less tranditional Mexican restaurant, done in upscale tones, and set in a fairly nice part of downtown Scottsdale.  About half of the tables are outside with views of the shops and, depending on the time of day, people walking by.  

The thing that distinguishes Barrio Queen is that they have talent in the kitchen.  Everything we tried was a surprise, usually a good one.  This is a magic restaurant - nothing is what it seems.  

For example, the Menudo is actually a much harder to find and exotic dish - Pata y Mondongo - tripe and calves' hooves.  Served in a slightly spicy tomato broth, it is exceptional.  Then there is the Chile Verde, a large portion of remarkably tender chunks of pork with a few onions and chilis, cilantro sprinkled on top, and just enough broth to keep it moist.  Nearly a meal in itself, it is a far cry from most chiles you will get in restaurants.

The Chiles en Nogado is a stuffed chili with a mixture of chicken chunks, dried apricot, onion, and garlic.  The surprise here is that the other ingredients listed on the menu were present, if at all, in only tiny amounts.  The result was a dish with good but simple flavor, lacking the complexities it should have.  The sauce was a overly-mild cream sauce with a couple of slivered almonds and added nothing.  Still it was enjoyable for what it was, just a bit disappointing for $22.

The only real miss was the Tres Leches dessert.  Once more a surprise but this time a very bad one.  This is really strawberry shortcake with just enough condensed milk (or something) to make the flavorless pound cake into a mush resembling bad oatmeal.  If not for this, I could have given Barrio Queen five stars.

HINT:  This place is busy even on weekdays.  If outside seating is not attractive due to heat, cold, wind, or rain, you very likely will have to wait.  As far as I can tell, they do not take reservations.  Parking can also be a problem.
