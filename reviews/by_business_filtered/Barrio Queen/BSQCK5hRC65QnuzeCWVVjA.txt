Went for Taco Tuesdays, so I will not critique the service as I know it can be a mad house and the servers were busting their behinds.. I don't understand why they sell themselves and their guests short of a better meal by not using "taco holders" for lack of a better term. The tacos are served flat on the plate, and by the time they get to you they are soggy and fall apart as you try to pick them up. I ordered 4 Tacos and ate 3 with a fork and knife for this reason. However, this is my only gripe, and it's a shame since the tortillas are clearly home made. The content of said tacos was fantastic. The cochinita pibil was very authentic and juicy. The pork chile verde and nopalitos were very good as well. Overall I would be back.
