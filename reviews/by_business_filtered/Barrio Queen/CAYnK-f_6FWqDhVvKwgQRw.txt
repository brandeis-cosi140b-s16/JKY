So I am in town for some work and we decided to check out this new spot.  Since I am not from Phoenix, I can't really tell you where the heck Barrio Queen is, but I can tell you to come check it out!  

Tuesdays are Taco Tuesdays and all tacos are $2.50 each. Normally tacos are 3 for $10.00.  The beauty of Taco Tuesdays is that you can try several of the 12-15 types of taco on the cheap.  There were several tacos that I had never heard of in California, such as carne asada and fried egg, carne asada and chili relleno, chorizo and egg etc.  I had four of their fat street tacos: Carnitas, Fish, carne asada egg and carne asada chili relleno.  Every one of those tacos was delicious.  The meats were smokey and full of flavor.  The produce was fresh and gave a good crunch.  The egg was cooked a perfect medium so when you bit into it, the egg provided a creamy goodness over the carne asada.  Everything was so good, I really wished I had room to try some more tacos!

We also ordered the Churros which were too large crispy sticks covered in cinnamon and sugar served with ice cream and the most delectable caramel I have ever had.  The caramel was the real star here as it was thick with a deep caramel flavor.  Seriously, we even thought about licking the plate it was so good!
Sorry I forgot to take a photo of the churros!

Great service is a key ingredient in any five star review and the staff was top notch here.  Given it was very early and there was nobody there, but every staff member who walked past our table cleared plates, brought chips or checked on us.  Our server also brought everyone at the table small samples of the house fruit drinks to taste, what a nice surprise.

The house chips and salsa are also very good.  The chips are thick enough that they provide fantastic crunch but not hard enough to break your teeth.  

Overall we loved the experience here and I am really going to miss not having a Barrio Queen back in Sacramento.  If your here in AZ check em out!
