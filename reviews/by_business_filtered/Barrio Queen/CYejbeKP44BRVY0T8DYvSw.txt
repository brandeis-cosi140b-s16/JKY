Haven't had a margarita this bad since my only visit to Salty Senorita. Ordered 2 Palomas which call for fresh squeezed lime and grapefruit juice. When my better half asked for a shot of beer to calm the tartness the bartender suggested adding more of the grapefruit soda....What? Total sour belly result and $28 later a lesson learned. Always disappointing when you know you could have made a better drink yourself at home.
