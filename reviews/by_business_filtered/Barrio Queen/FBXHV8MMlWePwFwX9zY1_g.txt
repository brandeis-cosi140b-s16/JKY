Im currently the Duke here and I'm writing this review reluctantly but it's neccesary I think because as a loyal customer I have been let down too many times on recent visits. I have been coming here since day 1 but things have changed, the last few times I have been here its been on a steady decline. Finally my last visit I have had it. Service is the worst in town, employees have bad attitudes and don't care, always understaffed, didn't have small bills to give change from the register, dirty bar, dirty tables, undercooked cold chips, no attention from bartenders as drinks run out etc etc etc. I don't know what happened internally here but it's not the same as it once was. What was one of my favorite spots has become a sinking ship. Based on the information the employees readily complain about in front of their guests about management and staffing turn over I'll be surprised if this place makes it much longer. It's a sad thing. Food is still great though - if they don't run out of whatever taco you order.
