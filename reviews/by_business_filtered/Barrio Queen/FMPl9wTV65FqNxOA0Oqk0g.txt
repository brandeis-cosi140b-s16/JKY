My fiance said I should write a review.    I replied that the restaurant didn't strike me as good or bad.  It was pretty middle of the road.

2.5 stars for me.

Service was fine.   No real complaints or compliments there.

Food.  During happy hour, you get 2 tacos for $3 Chef's choice of tacos.  And I delighted in eating the salmon taco.   

I was expecting grand things from the guacamole and was disappointed.   The dried cranberries were an interesting addition.  But I much prefer good ol' Trader Joe's guacamole.

Food was rico.   Rico means "rich" in Spanish and usually a compliment.   I just found the food rico in terms of calories.

I wouldn't mind going back but neither am I itching to return either.
