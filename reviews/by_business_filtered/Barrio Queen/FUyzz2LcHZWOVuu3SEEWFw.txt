For my 1400th review, I've chosen a very cool, hip spot in Old Town Scottsdale.  The prices here are for upscale Mexican food and are steep, so don't expect a deal.  However, what you can expect is a different take on old classics served in a hipster environment.  I met a colleague here for dinner and I ordered:

Guacamole, $10.75

Vasito de Elote (Grilled Corn, Butter, Mayo, Cotija Cheese, Tapatio Salsa, Cilantro, Lime), $5

Carne Asada Burrito, $15

Margaritas, $6

The Guacamole i served table-side and is very good.  It's rich, so if you're not sharing it, order the half portion.  The Carne Asada Burrito is also very good.  When I asked the server "What's a specialty here that I must try?", he said the Vasito de Elote...which is a Grilled Corn appetizer.  I followed his lead and tried it...it's amazing!  A rainbow of flavors explode on your taste buds when you eat it....Sweet, Buttery, Tangy, with a little Spice...yum!

The Margaritas here rock.  Very tasty...I think I put down 5 or 6, I can't remember.  Good thing I wasn't driving.

Overall, it was a very good experience.  It's definitely on my rotation to take clients and colleagues.  The only downside to this place is the parking.  Parking is no bueno, but that's a problem everywhere in Old Town Scottsdale.
