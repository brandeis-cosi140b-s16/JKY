First off, the food is overpriced for how mediocre it is. second, our waitress decided to tip herself more than she deserved being charged more than I authorized on my debit card and now going through the dispute process with my bank. Worst experience with this restaurant or any by far, definitely never going back. Make sure you pay cash or keep your receipt!
