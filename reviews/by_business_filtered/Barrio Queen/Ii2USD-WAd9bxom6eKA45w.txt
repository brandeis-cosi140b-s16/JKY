My boyfriend & I were walking through Old Town looking for a place for lunch when we found Barrio Queen. The Decor is to die for. It's very eclectic & the cages they keep the top shelf tequilas are pretty neat. The drinks were delicious. I had a michelada & the BF had a Paloma. Our bartender was really sweet & efficient. I want to say her name was Melissa (cute blonde chick). The food great. I don't normally like black beans but their's were awesome. Only problem with this place is their guac. When I think of guac I think of a paste sorta texture. Their guac was literally chopped up avocado & tomato. Also lacked some lime & salt. Despite the guac I'd come back.
