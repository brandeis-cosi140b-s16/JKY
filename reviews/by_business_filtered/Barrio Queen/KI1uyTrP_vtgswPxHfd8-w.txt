Stay awaaaaaay. Food is not bad they just add too much cheese to wverytning. They dont have salsa. Looool. Chips only served with $12 guacamole made with one avocado.  How sketchy is that?  Service is also mediocre. Wont be coming back here. You should not even try this place. Trust the negative comments.
