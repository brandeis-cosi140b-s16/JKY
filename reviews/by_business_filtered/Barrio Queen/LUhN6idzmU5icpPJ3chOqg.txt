Yikes.  I rarely give 1 star but to be honest, we couldn't get out of there fast enough.  It was obvious that this restaurant has poor management.  Our server  seemed new, was not well trained.  The employees did not work as a team.  He kept asking others for help and no one would stop to help him.  The servers seemed like they really didn't want to work there.  Our server was sweating profusely.  I felt bad for the guy.  He brought us chips and salsa and took our order and we received glasses of water 5 minutes later.  Obviously, he wasn't set up for success in his role.  

The food was below par.   There are just too many good Mexican restaurants around to bother coming back for food that isn't good.  And downtown Gilbert has great options to choose from.  Barrio Queen needs to step up their game or they will be left behind by the competition.  I'm glad we didn't pay for it since we had received a gift card from someone.  You couldn't  pay me to go back there.
