This place is far below the standards set by Barrio Cafe. We have been here three times and the food is underwhelming and the service downright bad.

We enjoy Barrio Cafe so have given this place three chances and each has been worse than the prior visit. In our latest trip we had three servers each of whom seemed confused and untrained. The first person shows up and asks if we have questions about the menu and then -- when we ask a few -- tells us he cannot answer them because he is new and needs to get someone else. The next server then takes our order and proceeds to be oblivious as our entrees show up (about an hour after order) ten minutes before the guacamole and chips appetizer shows up. He was not aware of this though as he was apparently too busy standing around ignoring the few tables he was tending. He then disappears and we get a third server who insists he take our plates when we are still eating multiple times until we have to tell him to go away. The staff seems untrained and not to care at all. 

As to the food it is by no means bad but far from what you expect from Barrio Cafe's management team. The tacos (we ordered several flank steak and vegetarian ones)   are tiny, tasteless and overpriced. The guacamole appetizer was a small portion of avocado overloaded with salt and with a handful of (overly fried) hard as a rock chips. The chicken mole burrito was OK. The best item was the kids steak and corn dishes.

Go to Barrio Cafe, or anywhere else, and ignore this place.
