How fun - loved it! The tableside gucolomoe just could not get any fresher and is most unique with dried fruit and pomegrante seeds. A must try with friends. We didn't sit outside due to the frigid weather but you can enjoy a plethora of outdoor seating. You can pick and choose which tacos you want and how many since they are kind of a la carte. Can't wait to go back.
