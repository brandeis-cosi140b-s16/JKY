Went to lunch with daughter and son in law to Barrio Queen during the week, it was around 12pm on a Thursday, no too busy.

To start with I ordered the Cocktel De Elote - grilled corn cut off the cobb, topped with butter, mayo, cotija cheese, valentina, cilantro and lime , this reminds me of when my kids where younger and chasing some dude on a bike with cooler for some corn. But its all grown up now and no longer in a cooler. This appetizer is great! Love the flavors! I could make a meal just out of this!

For lunch I went with 3 tacos for $10, I ordered one carne asada taco and 2 Barrio pollo tacos. The carne asada was tender, it was topped with diced onions, cilantro and avocado, and the Barrio pollo taco was diced chicken, caramelized onions, roasted poblano peppers with a spicy cream sauce topped with queso fresco. Both of these tacos where delish!    

This was a great meal, service was excellent too! Look forward to coming back.
