The worst experience ever..not only the service was bad but the food was even worst. ..
My bill was over 120...for that kind of service and food next time I prefer to cook at home....salsa was horrible  not taste at all ...tacos only had a tiny camaron and was full of cabage menu do was so spicy that we could  not eat and the waiter not even once went to our table to give us drinks....
There are lots of people working there but it feels that no one is in charge...
Very disappointed. ..
Not a good place to eat at all....
