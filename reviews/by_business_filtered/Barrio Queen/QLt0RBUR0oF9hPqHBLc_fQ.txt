So this won't be hard to review. First time here. Sat at the bar. Cold food. Slow service. Bar staff was overwhelmed by the clientele. It wasn't crazy busy either. The lady bartender was not on target with her friendliness level. In fact, she was the rudest of them all. Her greeting to us was not hi how are you...it was are you sitting here to wait for a table to open...uh...The guys were better, there's potential there. We had to wave them down after 20 minutes to get another beer. They never checked on us to see how the food was. Which of the three tacos I tried I was only impressed with one (it doesn't help they were cold). I doubt we come back. Next time we may just go to SoCal Tacos. Edit: we told one of the bartenders how bad our experience was, he said he'd get the manager. The manager didn't come after 15 minutes of waiting. Thanks.
