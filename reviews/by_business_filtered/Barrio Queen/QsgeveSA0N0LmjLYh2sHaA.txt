Barrio queen. Little sister of barrio cafe, same menu basically but not the same quality. Happy hour margaritas are good, taco prices are fair and food is pretty tasty but more generic than the cafe. I've had the chiles en nogada and cochinita pibil entrees are my favorite but a little pricey so I usually just do tacos. If you want the good version go to the original Barrio Cafe in Phoenix.
