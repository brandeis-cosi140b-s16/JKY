We were really looking forward to trying this place! The outside seating area looked cute and the smells when you walked by were divine. Unfortunately, this place did not live up to our expectations. 

Once we were seated, our waiter came and took our drink and food orders and said he would be back with waters. (In the 95 degree heat, we really were looking forward to that cold water!) About 15 minutes had past and we still had no drinks. Another server stopped by and asked if we had been taken care of. I told her yes but asked if she could bring us some water and check on the drinks. She came back quickly with water and said that our drinks would be up shortly. About 5 min later, she brought us our drinks from the bar. 2 minutes later, another waiter came and brought them again but took them back when he realized we already had them. Uhhh confusion much? No one stopped at our table again except to bring our food, which was like so-so. Nothing special. Our waiter passed the table about 5 times and not once asked "how is your meal?" or "can I get you anything else?". When we were handed the check (not by him), he stopped by to say sorry for the mix up with our food and drinks. Uhhh if he was hoping to regain the loss in a tip, that was too far gone. The other thing that reallllly bothered me was the fact that the hostess literally was watching our table the ENTIRE time we were there. She walked around and passed our table once every 2 minutes, at least. Non stop. And was taking notes on an iPad as she would glance over at us. It felt like they were waiting for us to go so they could seat someone else. It was awful and made us feel rushed. 

Terrible service, awful hostesses and the food was eh...with so many other options, I wouldn't recommend this place.
