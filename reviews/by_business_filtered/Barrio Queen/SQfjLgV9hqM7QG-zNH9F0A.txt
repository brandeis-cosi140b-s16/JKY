Food is way over priced Small portions. Food looks pretty when it's severed but man it doesn't have that LA califas taste. The tacos suck no flavor. Maybe the owner should take a trip down to Baja California to get schooled on how to make a down taco. that's where you'll find some of the best tacos in the World.
