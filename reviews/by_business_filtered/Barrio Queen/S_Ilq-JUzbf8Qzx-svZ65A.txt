Went there this Memorial Day (my bday) I love the atmosphere and the music. Food was good not great but good had the tacos wasn't to pleased with the Al pastor but everything else was good. Staff was nice. Chips and Salsa where very good. I will give it a other try soon. (not to big fan of black beans should have pinto,refried also just saying)
