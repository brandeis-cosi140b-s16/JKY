Very hippy Mexican restaurant in downtown Scottsdale, the food is excellent the service was good. It's a great place to stop while shopping or browsing the arts. I had he carne asada torta served w fries and cold slaw very good, you also get complementary chips and dip. It's a little noises for table conversation lots of repeating but overall not bad experience. Full bar and patio during nice months, the staff is great very attentive
