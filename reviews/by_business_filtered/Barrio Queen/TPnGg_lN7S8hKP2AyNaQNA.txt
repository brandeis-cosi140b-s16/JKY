Rounding up to 5 stars for the fresh, tasty and inspired dishes that aren't too "creative" or Americanized.  Oh, and the best sangria I have ever had.

We did breakfast here (and I'd done other meals here before yelp came along).  Outstanding flavors.  The enchiladas with shredded chicken, another with mole, topped with fried eggs and sided with beans and potatoes.  Delish.  My partner (a serious mole fan) raved about the sauce.

Enthusiastic services, beautiful locale and, oh...

The sangria: crisp, flavorful and on the job.  Simply refreshing.
