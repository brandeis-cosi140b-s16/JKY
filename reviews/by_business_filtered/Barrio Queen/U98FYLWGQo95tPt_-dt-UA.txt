The food and drinks are great however the service at the bar is lacking and rough around the edges, one of the bartenders made a comment about banging senoritas, not what i care to hear when on a date. Unfortunately there are two other mexican restaurant in old town Los Olivos, and Frank and Lupes the service there is questionable as well, a smile and some sincerity goes a long way, its not rocket science people!
