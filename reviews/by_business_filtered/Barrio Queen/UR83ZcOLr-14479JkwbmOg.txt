Taco's and guacamole are delicious.  Service is very slow although we stopped in and had Brandon as our server and he was great!!  If they could work on service this place would be wonderful.  We complained to the evening manager that we had waited quite a while to be greeted and he basically said "we are busy".  Try to look past the service and just enjoy the food.  Salmon & Shrimp Tacos are crazy good!
