This has definitely been one of my favorites in Scottsdale but I absolutely love the atmosphere in Gilbert. It's got an amazing bar scene... the service is fabulous as always the food is just blow your mind delicious. Love the choice of tequila, there something for everybody and I'm so excited to have it and Gilbert go there now!!
