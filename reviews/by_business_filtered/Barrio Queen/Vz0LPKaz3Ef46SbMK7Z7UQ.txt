It was nice to try once but pricey and will not come back.  Bob tried their award winning entree it was a two star entree called Cochinta Pibil.  I had the Spinach Salad with grilled chicken.  That was good.  I din't like Bob's dish either.  The wait time was 46 minutes.  It took another 45 minutes to get food.  We were ready and ordered as soon as we were seated.
