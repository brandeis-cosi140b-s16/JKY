The three star rating here, I have to say, is a goddamn shame.  Barrio Queen is a classy joint with good food, nice service and a great location.  When I went, it was newly opened and it took awhile to get our food, but our waitress was never anything but incredibly nice.

I ordered the huitlacoche quesadilla and it was delicious.  I also had an al pastor taco on the side.  

Straight up, you're in Old Town Scottsdale and you just got done looking at really lame art made by some old lady and she's telling you that it's authentic Mexican American or whatever the fuck.  Uh-oh, is your tummy rumbling?  I think so, bud.  Tell that old lady to shut her trap and come here.  You'll thank me.  Not in person, probably, but you'll go, "Fuckin'-A, Billy was right.  The al pastor is good enough to murder for."
