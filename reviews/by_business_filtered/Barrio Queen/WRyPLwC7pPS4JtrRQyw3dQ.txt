Went in on Friday night. Lots of empty table but we were told it was a 20 minute wait. Instead we went to the bar that is in the dining room and we were the only ones at the bar. Weird.

Bartender was excellent and we had fast service. I ordered the Arizona Burrito - Very Tasty!. However... My friend ordered the 3 for $10 tacos. He asked how big they were and they said street taco size. 3 should do it. When they were served the tacos made us start laughing. The tortilla was about 3" across. No kidding they were honestly one bite each. He did think they were great tasting though.We also ordered a tres leche desert. Very average.

One bloody maria, one soda, a burrito, 3 tiny tacos and a desert. $40 Plus tip. Won't be my first choice of places to return to but it is downtown Scottsdale....
