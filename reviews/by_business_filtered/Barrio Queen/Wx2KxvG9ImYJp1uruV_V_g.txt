Really bad experience all around.    We got sat in the main dining room and about 10 minutes later a pompous "Assistant Manager" came and said he has to move us becasue the hostess sat us in a reserved table (the place was pretty dead).   We got sat in the bar area and the air condition was on full blast making it freezing cold.  It took twenty minutes to get a drink order *(which we ordered at our first table,  our apps actually came out before we had our drinks and they didn't even offer us water.  I had 6 differnet tacos,  3 were really good and three were horrible.  The least you could do if you move a group once they've been seated is apologize, maybe offer to buy them a drink, and make sure the rest of their dining experience is enjoyable.  I have a feeling that there will be another restaurant in it's place soon if they don't get their act together.
