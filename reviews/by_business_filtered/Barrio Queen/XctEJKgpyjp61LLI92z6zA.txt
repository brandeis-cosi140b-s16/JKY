My co-workers and I ate here on Friday May 8. Got right in. Love the decor and the staff is super friendly. My co-workers had the Guacamole made right at the table and said it was yummy. A little pricey for what you get though.  I had the 3 tacos for $10, tasted great but really tiny. Like if your tacos had home had baby tacos. But good size if you want to eat light which is what I wanted so it if your starving you will want something else. Overall for the first week it was great and you can tell the staff is trained very well. Cant wait to try the Happy Hour.
