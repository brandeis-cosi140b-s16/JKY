oh my yummm!   BRAND NEW OPEN!!
ok, i have been a fan of barrio cafe for quite some time, so i was pretty excited that they were opening something so close to me (which was my biggest complaint of "cafe")   location yay!   they totally re-did super cute inside... a wee bit small.. but i'm ok w that... other half of their business not open yet,  curious how that will go.  servers very nice,  food fantastic, and the menu is quite extensive... i will need to eat there day and night to try all... happily!  yay love!!
