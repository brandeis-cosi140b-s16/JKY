I wish I could leave a zero star. We waited about 30 minutes for a table which was expected. The hostess sat us in a corner table that had an awkward pillar so we asked if we could get a table outside. The hostess was nice and moved us outside. We sat for about 15-20 mins and not a single server even acknowledged we were there. No one brought us chips or water. It's like we were invisible. I feel like it appears to be an upscale Mexican restaurant but the service was horrible. We got up to leave and let the hostess know. She informed the manager that was standing there. The manager looked surprised and asked a waitress if she had a table open and if she could help us. Ummm no thanks. I will never go there again. We went to joyride and had a great experience.
