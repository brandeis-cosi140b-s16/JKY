Food is a complete rip off $3.50 for tacos. They are the smallest I have ever seen no kidding folks one bite and maybe a half. I had the al pastor tacos completely lacking flavor. Beware I will never be going there again. The owner should know better since she is from los Angeles. But all she cares is about making money over quality. Complete fail compared to los Angeles standards
