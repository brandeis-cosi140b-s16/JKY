I don't know where to start with this review..

We were seated quickly, but the service the entire night was TERRIBLE. It took a good 15 minutes before a waitress even acknowledged my party. Then another HOUR for our food. There was only four of us and the restaurant was not packed. How long could it  possibly take to make a couple of burritos and carnitas? After the hour long wait, two of the plates of food came out cold. 

My carnitas were delicious the second time they came out and were hot, but it was hard to enjoy my experience with such lackluster service. I will commend them, we complained and of course got the complimentary dessert. 

**Side note** The guacamole is over priced. I paid $10 to have an avocado poorly mashed up with a spoon and a few other ingredients mixed in. For $10 I expect more effort and MORE GUAC. Such a rip off. 

The food isn't even authentic.
