Definitely not my favorite restaurant! It started off bad when they brought the chips and salsa. The chips where thick and the salsa didn't have much flavor. I ordered two tacos, pork and beef and both were pretty dry. My husband ordered the chicken burrito and it had more flavor but still wasn't great.
