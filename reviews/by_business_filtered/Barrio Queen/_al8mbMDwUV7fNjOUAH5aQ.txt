Came in for dinner with some friends. Awesome happy hour special on margaritas. 3 bucks! Brittany our server kicked ass. Had the table side guacamole. Never quite tasted guac like this. Very citrus style. Loved it. Carne asada burrito was from another planet. Great simple tastes. A definite recommendation!
