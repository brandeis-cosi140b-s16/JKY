We went last night hoping for a table for 3. We were told an hour - no big deal, as we were walk-ins. Meanwhile, tables were open all around us in the bar. We asked about those seats and were quickly dismissed hearing how busy they were. When we finally left, those tables were still open and the bar service was slow and discourteous. With so many options in the area, I'd advise picking a place that actually provides customer service.
