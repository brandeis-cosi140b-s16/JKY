I personally loved this place. Since we are in the Scottsdale area for a conference I wanted to try something authentic and native to the area. I'm so happy we chose this place. I had the 3 tacos for $10.50-ish. They were tiny but still so full of their delicious toppings and filled me up just fine along with the chips and salsa. They had a huge variety of taco flavors. I had the Cochinita Pabil (which they're supposed to be famous for), the Barrio Chorizo Pollo and the Carne Asada tacos. Loved each one of them for their unique, awesome flavor. I'm a huge fan of chorizo. 
My friends all got different things on the menu and were pretty pleased with their choices. I tried the menudo. It had good flavor. Was a little spicy, but otherwise good. 
The entrees are a little more pricy (around 20 bucks a plate) but there is plenty on the menu you can find for 12 bucks or under. 
My only gripe with the place in general is that there was no unlimited chips and salsa. Only the first serving is complementary for the table. We were a little bummed by this, especially since the salsa was fantastic in my opinion. 
Overall, great place. Loved it. Would love to come back if every in the Scottsdale area!
