My favorite Mexican restaurant in Scottsdale. 
TACO TUESDAYS!
Love the Salmon Y Mango taco.
The Pescado taco is also really good.

Every taco I've tried there is good and it was the first time I've ate cactus. Not my favorite item of food, I'm assuming it's categorized as a vegetable....?
I love margaritas but I prefer frozen however they don't offer frozen just as many restaurants in the Phoenix area don't. With that said, they offer great margaritas.

Love the environment. Modern Mexican, yet comfortable and not pretentious. Great selection of tequila and a staff that knows the menu.
