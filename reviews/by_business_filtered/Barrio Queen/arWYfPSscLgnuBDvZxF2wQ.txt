Food was good, as always, but our server was...hungover? Confused? Not sure what but...we honestly had a choice of laughing it off or getting mad. We chose to laugh. 

That being said - great guacamole, excellent tacos, and the Sonoran hot dog was given a thumbs up. I do hope we never get the youngest Kardashian server again. You can only laugh some things off for so long.
