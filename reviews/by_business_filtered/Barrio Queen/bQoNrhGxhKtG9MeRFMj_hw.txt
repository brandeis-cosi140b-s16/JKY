Well first of all the guacamole was GREAT.....however when we walked in the hostess's had no smile and frankly were not interested.   When told (at 2:30pm) that there was a 25 minute wait to sit inside we opted for the bar with full service.  I will now be brief.
1. The "bartender/server" never once even looked at us.   Lucky the bus guy got us some water and I ordered guacamole....it was excellent.   The "waiter" still never looked at us.   About 15 minutes later I saw someone come by who happened to be a manager .....he was great and took the order. .......The the "waiter/bartender" still had not looked at us.....1/2 way through the meal I ran out of water.........I had to literally holler to get that idiot to get me some water.   

The food was good.....but will not go back due to such poor service...One of the weirdest experiences for service I have ever had....

I left no tip....and felt poorly for the bus person (I have NEVER done that before)....

Manager was terrific but don't need the aggravation.

ONE STAR
