We tried a variety of tacos here (3 for $10). Tacos were all unique and tasty, but the 
Suadero Azteca (queen's special) was the standout. It was incredibly flavorful and tender and was topped with really yummy veggies. Definitely get your own of this if you are sharing. The fried fish and fried shrimp ones were tasty too. This is a great place to try inventive tacos, but can get a little pricey. I think you need to ask for chips and salsa here, as they didn't bring us any without us asking, but once brought, it was tasty :)
