Don't listen to the nay sayers about the Queen.  The service, ambiance and management is excellent.  The managers hover everywhere and you can see the quality from the second you walk in.  Cheapest Margerita ws $6, which is very fair, OK you can buy one with an expensive call tequila for $12 but the standard one ( agave syrup, lime juice and tequila called 3 standard) is excellent.  The guac is quite different and EXCELLENT.  Yes the tacos are small but at $2.50 what to do you want.  There must be 30 to pick from.  TO be fair some are more expensive.  The duck confit taco is amazing, shrimp taco the same.  Silvana was there and she kept a close check on everything.  This place is amazing GO THERE.  The other side is the fine dining side and the entrees are +-$22 which are reasonable.  This is NOT a regular beans a rice joint, it's unique
