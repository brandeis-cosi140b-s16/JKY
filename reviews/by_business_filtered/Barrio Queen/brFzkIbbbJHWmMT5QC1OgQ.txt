This was the worst restaraunt experiance I have ever had. We a long time for a table due to having 10 people for a birthday dinner. Instead of pushing tables together to accommodate our group, they made us wait for over an hour for one specific table. Keep in mind it is only a Thursday night. There were many, many people who came in well after we did and all were seated before us. By the time we were seated we all knew what we wanted and immediately ordered our food. It still took an hour and a half for us to get served. We also had to send dishes back for not being cooked thourghly and being cold in the middle. When we asked to speak to the manager it was clear that he was just talking to us because he had to and really did not care at all about our experiance. If you are looking for a nice relaxing dinner with good service and food, go elsewhere! I would have rather had taco bell.
