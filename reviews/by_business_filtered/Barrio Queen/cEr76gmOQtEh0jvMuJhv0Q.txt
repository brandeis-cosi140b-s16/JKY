Food was very good. Tue is $2.50 taco night. They have lots of interesting choices. I had two beef, a chicken & chorizo and a vegetarian one with cactus and a fried egg on top. All were good. Tacos were very small (which seems to be a thing in scottsdale ... I had the same experience at The Mission). I didn't know that when i ordered. I probably coud have eaten 6. The biggest downside was that it took about 40 min from when I ordered till I got my food. Gotta knock you for that.
