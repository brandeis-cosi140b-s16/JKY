Took the Mrs here after coming for a happy hour with friends. Dinner on a Tuesday night and it was pretty happening. What I enjoy is the decor and the great HH prices. $3 imports/$3 house margs! 

We started with an order of Mexican Style Fries Chile Verde. The chili pork is so good! 
We asked Ron, the server, what he would get. He quickly told us about the Pollo a la Coco and the Chiles en Nogada. 

The Chiles en nogada has apricots,pecans, golden raisins, onions, garlic, chicken, red wine all in a roasted poblano pepper. Served over a almond cream with a pomegranate garnish that will make you wanting more! The plate was small, but the flavors and richness made it special. 

Pollo a la Coco was a Pan seared spice-rubbed chicken breast topped with goat and menonita cheese, saute of onion and roasted peppers all in a pi√±on cream sauce that is just good! 

Next time we visit, I want the sample all the tacos or just a plate of the Chili Verde! 
Will be back with our pup and sit on the patio for sure.
