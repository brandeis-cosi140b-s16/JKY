The Gilbert location is a new location for this restaurant. Disappointing to say the least. I have visited here on 4 occasions and all have been bad, bad service, bad food, bad salsa! Went there last night and ordered the tableside guacamole. Instead the server brought out a already prepared bowl. Although other tables were having it prepared at there table. Not a big deal, it wasn't bad. The other restaurant has a green salsa that is hotter. We asked for that, "the chef didn't make any today"( By the way that was response on the last three visits) OK? So let's order, I ordered the Pescado Vericuzano, A very good fish dish at the other location. I was brought the wrong fish.
Ok, no problem, I tried the Mango Sea bass, It was fish jerky. Water please? I finally got the server and told her this was not the dish I order. After recovering from the deer in headlights stare I asked for a manager. She was nice but neither had a clue of what I ordered or what was on my plate. The staff is new, I get it, but you might want to read the menu before you start your new career at the Barrio Queen. Finally got the dish I ordered, Same fish I had gotten before with the bite taken out of it, Mango salsa gone, some new sauce applied, of course it was still fish jerky but with a bite taken out of it. Ok, I am outta here. My wife order the Chicken and chorizo tacos, they were good. This place needs a lot of help from management. Needs servers who know how to serve, and consistency in their food preparation. The Barrio Queen is like life " You never know what your going to get" Stealing a phrase from Forrest. Skip this place until they get their act together.
