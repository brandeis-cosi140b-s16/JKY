Lunch. 1215. Tuesday.
Party of 5. 
Very friendly staff; engaging. 
Has an Old Mexico, open feeling inside - ceramic tiling and traditional decor, but classy and modern. There is patio seeing front and back. 

Food: Burrito Azteca, Chicken salad, Tacos (it was Taco Tuesday so 4 for $10 mix and match). Table guacamole appetizer that had pomegranates in it. Yum! Chips were excellent, as was the salsa. Salsa watery but delicious and mild. No options for spicy salsa though, but you can request roasted jalapenos, which I did. Excellent, Smithers. 

A little pricey for lunch, but hey, it's Barrio in Snottsdale. What do you expect?
