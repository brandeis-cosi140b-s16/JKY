I've been to Barrio Queen in the past for a dinner with one of my girlfriends, & so I was excited to try the newest location, in Downtown Gilbert, on a girls day out with my niece. When we arrived, we were greeted by friendly hostesses who were courteous & seated us promptly. Our waitress didn't have a very pleasant disposition or attitude; in fact, she acted like it was an inconvenience to wait on us. This left a negative impression on me; & I'm usually one to see the best in others & find the silver lining, but I also believe in hospitality, good manners, & superior customer service. The food was delicious, & the branding for the business is genius & very unique & one of a kind, which I appreciated, as a self-proclaimed "experience connoisseur." I like to seek out & find places that differentiate themselves & felt like Barrio Queen definitely nailed it in that area. The location is conveniently located in Downtown Gilbert, & an excellent place to take a date, a friend from out of town, or a family.
