Barrio Queen is a great spot in Old Town if you're looking for some good tacos. We were able to watch the Suns game from a booth which was fantastic. 

We started off with the Barrio guacamole which is made table side...this seems to be the way to do guac these days and I'm not complaining because it was so good. They put pomegranate seeds in it which was surprising at first but I really liked the unusual addition! They also have really good chips, which can make or break a Mexican restaurant experience for me, pun intended. 

Next I did the three taco deal. I tried the Cochinita Pibil, Carne Asada, and Pescado tacos. I wish I spent more time eating them because I'm not proud to admit they were gone within minutes. Granted they are small street tacos, they are packed with flavor! 

Between the chips w/guac, an amber dos equis on draught, and three tacos, I was smitten (as my Zach would say). 

This is a place I'd love to head back to on a Taco Tuesday.
