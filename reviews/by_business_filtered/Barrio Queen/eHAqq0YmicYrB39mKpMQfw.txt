Enjoyable moderately upscale atmosphere with some Day of the Dead decor. The service was wonderful, informative and friendly. The guac was unique. With craisins in it but surprisingly sooooo good!  Carne asada, chicken, pork etc were flavorful. Our whole table left stuffed and satisfied with a few leftovers. Two of the small tacos were plenty since they're stuffed with meat. We will be back.
