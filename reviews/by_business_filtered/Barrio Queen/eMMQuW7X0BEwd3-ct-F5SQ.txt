Barrio Queen is in Old Town Scottsdale near the "waterfront."  The restaurant occupies a relatively small space compared to its neighbors and is connected to Silvana Bistro.  We sat at the table facing the entrance with the Jose Cuervo mirrored sign, stylized hood cover from a car, and three tequila certificates.  The Don Julio print on the paper place maps seemed to indicate that there was some descent tequila served at Barrio Queen.  We enjoyed the simple three margarita with the Don that arrived in a plastic Pacifico pitcher.  My daughter had a cheese and mushroom quesadilla. Thick with cheese, mushrooms, and onions she got past the blueness of the blue corn tortilla and the onions, and consumed all of it.  The guacamole came chunky, spicy, and highly recommended by our waiter.  We polished it off quickly, still hungry.

Near our seats were black and white Barrio Queen shirts and food stuffs in cages.  The draft from the door was cold and unrelenting as patrons entered and exited.  Within site of our table was a Frida Khaloesque painting that had been Barrio Queened, a monitor with a slide show of employees, ingredients, and food, and a bar with pastries, caged liquor, and beers on tap and in a refrigerator.

The primary item, fifty of them, are fancy street tacos.  Each is a single, but everyone's order comes on their own plates.  I highly recommend the barrio pollo y chorizo.  The chorizo was really good.  The chorizo y al pastor was good and the cameron con coco was okay.  Four tacos and some of an appetizer seemed to be enough for a meal.  Adding some dessert was too much.  The churro was something to behold as it was topped with caramel and ice cream.
