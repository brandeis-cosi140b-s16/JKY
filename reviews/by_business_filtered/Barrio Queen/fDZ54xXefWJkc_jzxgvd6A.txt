Meh, food was edible. Service was fine, but not great considering there seemed to be a ton of employees and we were there at 3 in the afternoon. I thought it was very overpriced. You have to buy everything individually. We got one fried fish taco (just tasted like greasy batter hardly any fish), one grilled fish (least favorite), two grilled shrimp, one of the "house favorite" pork, rice and beans. We both thought the grilled shrimp was best, but it was so tiny-- one medium sized shrimp per taco. The black bean side was $3 and a very small portion. The rice had a nice flavor but the texture of rice reminded me of the cheap rice you get at a hospital cafeteria :/ We had finished half our meal when they eventually brought the chips and salsa. The decor looked cool from the outside because the bar is cute but inside seemed dated already. And the music selection was obnoxious. I know there are lots of other things on the menu that are probably good but it will be hard to get me to come back because our first try was so lackluster and the prices are just too high for what we got. Too bad, I was excited for this.
