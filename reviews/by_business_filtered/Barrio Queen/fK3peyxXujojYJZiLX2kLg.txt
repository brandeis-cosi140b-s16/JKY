I was really hoping that this place would be good. They constantly have people so I figured it must be good but boy were we wrong. My wife ordered the posole and their was absolutely no flavor at all it tasted like water. I got the cochinita pibil torta, they give you a side of broth which you definitely need because this thing is super dry. Also i ordered a michelada which was just flat out gross. The only reason this place would even have a star is because the waiter was very nice and helpful. I would not recommend coming here ever
