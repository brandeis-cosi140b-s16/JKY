Still great. On my third visit I have not made it to main courses yet given the enticing taco variety.

I got the corn appetizer, which was simple but effective. 

Sadly, the smoked salmon taco is no longer. In its place I revisited the cochinita pibil, which was probably the best of the bunch. The carne asada with a fried egg was excellent.

I enjoyed the huitlacoche but I wonder if it's violating some culinary guideline to combine something mushroom-esque with actual mushrooms. The grilled shrimp was great - sort of a lighter version of blackened - but disappointing in its quantity (one.)

Overall, Barrio Queen continues to excel at the basics while developing intriguing juxtapositions.
