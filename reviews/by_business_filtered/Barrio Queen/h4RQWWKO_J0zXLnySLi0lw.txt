I dig this place.  We've always gone for lunch, never dinner, but we've never been disappointed. With all the taco options, there is always something new to try, and there are a lot of fun and intriguing taste combos. Boring it is not, which is a good thing.

Service has been lower-OK. Usually a bit slow, once or twice a bit forgetful, but always helpful and friendly.
