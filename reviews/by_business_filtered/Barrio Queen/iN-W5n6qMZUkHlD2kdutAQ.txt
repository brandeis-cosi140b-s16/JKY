I wish we had this restaurants in orange county. Just the name alone makes you want to try.
Tried carnitas con Chile. ..awesome tender and juicy.
Elote en vaso...sweet and delish!!last but not least tacos de tinga...spicy and yummy in my tummy. ( a la Yo gabba gabba)

They have a great happy hour and good kids menu.

Please come and show orange county what good authentic home made Mexican food is really like!! 
You guys would definitely give Javiers a run for their money.

Another thing I love..they play actual Mexican music..banda the whole time...not salsa?? Like why salsa music at Mexican joints..it's beyond me?? 

Definitely will come back when inn scottsdale.

Happy tummy...happy hubby..happy toddler ;)
