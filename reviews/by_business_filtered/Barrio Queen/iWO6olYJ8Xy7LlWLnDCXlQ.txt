Long wait, not exceptionally busy. Server was no where to be found for extended periods, no update on when food or drinks would arrive during long waits. Food was pretty good but the prices seemed high for what was received. Friend's dish had to be sent back because it was cold. I would have given three stars, but upon checking my credit card statement and comparing to my receipt, they tacked on a $10 tip to my bill! Never had an issue like this before. Really surprising. Sounds like other reviewers have enjoyed this place, so maybe I just showed up on the wrong night. Regardless, I won't be back.
