So when in Downtown Gilbert the options are remarkably plentiful for a single street. Barrio Queen was off to an auspicious start with 3 drinks making their way to the table and not being liked. The salsa was average and the chips were a little thick for my preference..... And then it happened.... I ordered the Barrio Pollo burrito and my goodness was it ridiculously delicious. The spice rubbed chicken was moist and not over powering, the pinion cream sauce brought all the components together for an forgettable bite! I highly recommend this burrito.... The wait times are a little outrageous for the entire experience so call ahead, get it to go and go sit and people watch with a great burrito!
