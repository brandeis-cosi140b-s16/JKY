I REEAALLLY wanted to like this place. Honest I did. But a few things struck me as unnerving.

The atmosphere was nice and the place appeared very clean, which was good. Even the bathroom. My only issue was the watered down soap in the bathroom. Either step it up or lessen the amount of water used to dilute the concentrate. 

While there were quite a few items on the menu it was Taco Tuesday and, not wanting to place all my tacos in one basket, I THOUGHT it would be a good idea to branch out and try new spots. Ehhhh, bad idea.

The HH menu is sparse. Only one margarita option (please change the house tequila). I always know when I'm drinking cheap tequila when it burns going down. Lol. My goodness. The rita was JUST 'ok'. The parental unti left an entire rita and 4 taco's on her plate, leaving with the tab. She ditched me and went to Joyride. Lol.

As with other reviews, I had to ASK for chips and salsa. What mexican restaurant do they do that at?! The waitress asked 5 times if we wanted to order an appetizer. "No, but I would like some chips and salsa".  As a server, while you've tasted everything on the menu, my expectation is that you'd have an honest opinion on the tequila in the house margaritas. 

Taco Tuesday taco specials arent bad ($2.50 for any taco on the menu) but, they don't taste all that great.  True in what they way, you get what you pay for but these are regular menu tacos.  Which means, they taste like this all the time. I ordered a Verduo (veggie) and a grilled pescado (fish). The fish was grilled so that it was charred and crispy on the outside. And the flavor was bland. Not one to waste food, I ate around that. So basically, I had two veggie tacos. 

For $40 (9 taco's, 2 house rita's and a lemonade) ahhhhh, I don't think I'll be back anytime soon.
