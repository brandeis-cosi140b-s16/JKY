As someone who grew up in the southwest, I was really hoping to experience an authentic Mexican restaurant.  This place isn't it by a long shot. Let's start with the service, I was served by someone bubbly and kind but it wasn't timely or accurate service.  The food, bland! Quite bland. It wasn't spicy or flavorful at all. I give this place a three because I liked the ambiance and the drinks.
