This was my second time in and will be my last if I have any say in the choice. Service was extremely slow, margaritas was weak. Our server seemed irritated that we had ordered and paid for cocktails at the bar before we were seated. The guacomole was good, I had an out of town guest, so the table side presentation was nice. We ordered two guac orders to start and were given one dinky basket of chips. Probably 12 total, getting chips for our guacomole was an ongoing struggle all dinner long. We were told they were making more, but watched as basket after basket passes our table.  
In other food choices, the Caesar was simple, under dressed, and I've had better at most places. The fish taco was not good, at all. The fish was funky, I had two other people take a small bite and we all agreed, not good at all. The other tacos we ordered were okay,  I've had better downtown and didn't try one I would have to come back for.
