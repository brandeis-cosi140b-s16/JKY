I heard all of the hype and had to check it out. The Barrio Pollo taco and the carne asada with egg tacos were out of this world.  We had the carnitas appetizer and it was equally amazing. We arrived around 11:15 and were seated right away. the service was perfect from David W. I have nothing bad to say about this place. We will definitely be back.  Nice work Barrio Queen!
