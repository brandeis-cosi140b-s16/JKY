Barrio Queen has excellent food. Their table side guacamole and tacos are wonderful! If you want great food for a great price, this is the place to go. However, the service is slow and the owner doesn't really seem to have interest in her customers. The owner also stopped serving chips and salsa as she wanted to represent a "real mexican food restaurant." I think this was a terrible idea. All in all, Barrio Queen is in a fun location and the food makes it worth coming back!
