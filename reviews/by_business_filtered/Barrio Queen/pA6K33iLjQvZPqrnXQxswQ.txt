Stopped in for lunch today.  Loved the decor and patio.  Clean, bright and comfy chairs.  Service was a bit on the slow side.  A server came out after about 5 minutes and introduced himself, but then another server came and told him that she didn't think that was his table so he left....and then about 5 minutes later a different server came out and took our drink order.  The longest wait was from when we were seated to us getting our first drink.  After that things came out much more quickly.  That said.....drinks were good.  Margaritas were strong and only $3 dollars during happy hour which is apparently all day.  We had the tableside guacamole which was really good.  It was also Taco Tuesday so all tacos are $2.50 instead of $3.50.  I tried the napolitas (sp) which was ok.  It kind of tasted like green beans to me.  A bit on the bland side.  I also had the smoked salmon with mango taco.  That was good, but in my opinion it would have been better with un-smoked salmon.  The mango on it really helped freshen it up though.  My cousin has a burrito and she said it was great and as for the sauce that was on top....well, she wanted to lick it off her plate.  Enough said.  We also shared the flan which, although I am not an expert on flan or anything as I've only had a bite of it a couple of times, it was really, really good.  All in all, I'll definitely go back.
