The service was good. Nice atmosphere. 

The chips were nice and thick and the salsa was VERY good. We had the green chili nachos and they stole the show. Carne Asada  burrito was good, California enchilada with chicken was good. The beans and veggies lacked seasoning. 

A bit on the pricy side all things considered. 

Will be back for taco Tuesday
