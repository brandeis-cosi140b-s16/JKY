Just got back from my first Barrio queen visit. Let me start with 2 great reasons to eat here......1.50 happy hour tacos 2-6pm mon- fri and free chips n salsa.
Both lost when you  eat at most trendy taco restaurants. Good house salsa and thick fresh chips.
I had the green chile n pork tacos which were tastey. 
Nice decor and pleasant music playing insde.
We had 9 happy hour tacos, coke, 2 marg, chips n salsa for 35.00 w tip
The only negative i see is that their full price menu could leave you with sticker shock.
