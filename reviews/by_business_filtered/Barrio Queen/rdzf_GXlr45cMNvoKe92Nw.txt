If you would like great tasting Mexican food with a side of attitude come here! My friend asked for rice and the waiter pretty much rolled his eyes and said Barrio Queen isn't Mexican American. Margaritas are Mexican American and it's on your menu! Aside from that the menu is unique and I like the modern decor.
