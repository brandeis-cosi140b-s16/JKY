Gosh, having been here about 6 times since it opened seems like it keeps getting worse.  Had a terrible meal the other night, took an hour to get our guacamole.  Looked understaffed, lots of tables with empty plates stacked on them.  Took an hour and a half to eat there, just 3 tacos and enchilades.  If you want good tacos go to Tacos Atoyac in phoenix and if you are in old town and want better mexican just go to Frank and Lupes, half the cost and better.  *Our waiter was really good though and was sorry about the wait for our food, looked like he was doing a lot of jobs at once, others just standing around.  We both decided we won't be going back there again.
