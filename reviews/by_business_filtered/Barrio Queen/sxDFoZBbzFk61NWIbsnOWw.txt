OK, let's start from the beginning. I claim to be a Mexican food expert, so it's hard to impress me, specially outside Mexico. 

So I've been refusing to visit this place for ever since I'm tired of trying Mexican places that claim to be authentic and are just overpriced lame imitations.

But since today I was in a great mood and wanted to try something new (and had to eat in the Scottsdale area) I finally gave this place a try. 

The service was super friendly, on top of their game and pretty knowledgeable. Five stars for the service!

The food was great in general, but let me go dish by dish.

1. Guacamole. Well, it's not authentic but it's tasteful. The cranberries or whatever they put are unnecessary and mine was on the spicy side, which I appreciated but not everybody likes it so be careful.

 2. Chips. Super tasteful, thicker than normal.

3. Steak taco. Mmmm, nobody would miss it if you skip this taco.

4. Suadero. Not 100% authentic but pretty tasteful.

5. Al pastor. Nothing to do with the real thing. Can easily be skipped unless you don't care if it's a freestyle pork taco which tasted ok.

The tacos are medium-small.

6. Cochinita pibil. This was the highlight of the night. Pretty close to the real thing, great taste. Will go back for that for sure!

7. Shrip Barrio. Open quesadilla with shrimp. Tasteful and different.

8. Shrip with avocado. Meh.

9. Tres leches. Again, not authentic and barely OK.

10. Flan. Delicious.

11. Agua de horchata. The real deal. Super tasteful!

Bonus. I asked for a sample of the mole. It was well executed, thick, tasteful. A little in the bitter side, but again, mole can be cooked in thousands of ways. I definitely will try a mole dish soon.

Price was fair. Not cheap, not expensive.

Great decoration!

Cheers!
