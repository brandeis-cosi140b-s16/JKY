I would rate this place a five + star, and would definitely be coming back to Arizona for this! But I ordered some bomb portobello tacos and They were way to small! For the price, it wasn't enough at all. 
Also, I had the best horchata here! So yummy and I definitely recommend it! But again, small portions and no free refills. The ice took up the whole glass and not enough of the horchata was in there to satisfy.
