I will never have the tacos here again, and that's if I come back. Barrio was my favorite Mexican place until this afternoon. Apparently my taco Tuesday special came with a very solid case of food poisoning! I am so totally disappointed, and I don't think the memory of this will have me back over there any time soon... I had the carne asada, pollo y chorizo, chorizo and the fish one (pesca-something) and one or some combination of them had my stomach in pieces an hour later, and with my head in the trash can by 4pm. Ugh, Barrio, why??? We were so good together
