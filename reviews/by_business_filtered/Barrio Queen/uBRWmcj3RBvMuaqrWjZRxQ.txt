I'm a bourbon drinker and almost never have anything else but the only one they offer is Makers Mark. I understand that they specialize in tequila (over 300) but only one bourbon was still a disappointment. That said,  the margaritas are just incredible- highly suggest that you try one. The guacamole is prepared table-side and is oozing with freshness. I had 5 of their tacos as an entree (pork, salmon, chicken, cactus, and one other ?)... they were very good. 5 tacos may sound gluttonous, but they each can be eaten in 2 bites. All of the food was very fresh and you got a sense that it was prepared with care. Overall my party of 7 had a great meal (dinner) while sitting outside on the patio. If definitely suggest that you try this place for a fun, relaxed dinner with a seriously stiff drink.
