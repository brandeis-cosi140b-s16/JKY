I really like this place because the food is excellent.  You just cannot beat their tacos - that's what I always order.  They are great.

The location is good, too.  It's pretty easy to park for free, which is nice (and not like Phoenix, which charges a fortune - thank you, Scottsdale).  

I've always gotten good service here, too - very attentive and nice servers.

I recommend that you try Taco Tuesday!
