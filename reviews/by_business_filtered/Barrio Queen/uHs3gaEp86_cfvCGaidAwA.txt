My boyfriend took me here for a recent date night and so glad we went as we live in the area and have been wanting to go but never made in in. I am so glad we did! My boyfriend had a really good burrito and I had the goat cheese enchiladas and we each had a tequila flight. We also started with chips and salsa that I wanted to drink it was so good! I cannot wait to go back soon in the near future. Service was also great!!!
