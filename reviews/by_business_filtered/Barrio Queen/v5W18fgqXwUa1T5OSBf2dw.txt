I'm a HUGE fan of Barrio Cafe in Phoenix, and Barrio Queen did not disappoint.  Amazing flavor in my shrimp enchiladas, and the margaritas were out of this world.  The service was AMAZING as well.  The staff had a great sense of urgency and teamwork, and the manager stopped by to chat towards the end of our dinner - super nice guy and extremely concerned about our experience.  To the people whining about portion sizes, this is gourmet dining.  Plenty of restaurants within a mile that serve huge portions of traditional Mexican food.  And as for the people saying go down the street to Joyride - I'm pretty much speechless.   If that's what you're looking for, SoCal Fish Taco company blows Joyride out of the water, but neither of those places hold a candle to the fare at Barrio Queen.
