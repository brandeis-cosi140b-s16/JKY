Went for lunch today with some coworkers and had a great experience! Our waiter provided superior service, the complimentary chips and bean dip was delicious, and the tacos were amazing!!! 
The quality of food for the great price on Taco Tuesday is win-win!! I tried a barrio pollo taco, shrimp taco, fish taco, and the huevos con chorizo taco.  All were delicious, but the pollo and fish tacos were by far my fave!!
