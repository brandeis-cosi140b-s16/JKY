I truly anticipated that Barrio Queen would become one of my favorite restaurants upon walking in. Awesome decor and concept with the taco menu resembling a sushi menu where you mark off which you'd like to try. Then we met the waitress & it all went downhill from there... Just the thought of this place makes me sick now!

I ordered a martini & after tasting it, my entire table of avid tequila drinkers decided that there was tequila in it. No big deal, we'll just order another one, right?! Wrong. The waitress was so rude and sarcastic stating that there was NO tequila in it, in fact she made it herself. Okay? 

Ordered a round of tacos, they were fine. Nothing inspiring. Ordered tableside guac, they didn't make it tableside for us but they did for a nearby table. Chips WAY too greasy. We were still hungry so we ordered chicken enchiladas. They were cold, disgusting, and here's the kicker... I found a long dark hair right in the middle... VOM! We were clearly done at that point, and when we politely showed the waitress the hair she says, "That's so weird, I don't think there's anyone who even works here with long dark hair..." Hahahahaha! At a mexican restaurant?! *Cue 5 different employees walking by our table with long dark hair before we leave* Laughable. She didn't apologize or comp anything for us. Had she done that, I might have tried Barrio Queen again and given it a second chance but since the service was so incredibly poor and the food totally subpar I won't ever waste my time again! If you want amazing mexican food try La Hacienda at The Princess or The Mission.
