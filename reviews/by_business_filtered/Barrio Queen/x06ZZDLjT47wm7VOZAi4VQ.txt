Pretty good place, definitely not as good as the original, Barrio Cafe. I don't think the head of Barrio Cafe is even associated with this spot anymore. My main issue with Barrio Queen is their service. It has been very hit or miss and with all the restaurants in the area I think their wait staff should be able to do a better job. 

I will say that their location is great and I do like the outside seating. I typically go to this location for lunch when I'm in the area. If I want the real thing I will always travel to downtown Phoenix for the real thing.
