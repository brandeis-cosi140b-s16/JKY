We went twice while in Scottsdale on vacation, we loved it! We got to go on taco tuesday, got cheap margs and beer, and cheap tacos. We both tried 4 different tacos each, they were amazing. I loved that we were able to choose 1 of each, unlike many restos who only let you choose one type. The drinks were great also.

OH yeah, the Nachos!!! Those are the best we've ever tried, and a huge serving at a low cost.
