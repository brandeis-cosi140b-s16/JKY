Got seated next to the bar. The service was absolutely horrendous. They only opened a month ago so maybe they need time to weed out the poor waiters/waitresses. ordered several tacos and unfortunately, it took 40 minutes (had already waited for a table for 45 minutes). The food arrived cold. So disappointing.
