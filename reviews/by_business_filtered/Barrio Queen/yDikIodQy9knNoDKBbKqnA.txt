Fun atmosphere and the sangria was pretty good. Our food took over an hour to get to the table after we ordered. Hopefully this is just a kink they need to work out since they just opened. But it wouldn't have been as bad waiting that long if our server had acknowledged the long wait or apologized in some way, which she did not.  I had the tacos which were very good (chicken one was really good, the veggie one wasn't that great though). Will wait a while for them to get the hang of things before I go back.
