Superb from start to finish. Great service by Robert who also did our tableside guacamole...which was delicious but $ 10.75 ouch!!! The restaurant had taken my favourite item off the menu (Pollo Coco) however one of the chefs remembered it and was able to make it again much to my delight. The atmosphere is fun and vibrant, the service swift and overall a great pleasant evening...!!!
