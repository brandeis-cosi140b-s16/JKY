Ok, last day of school and kids wanted MX, so we wanted to try the new place in town.  Let say, they are still in start up phase. The  service was poor, slow and literary my empty tea class sat empty the entire time, while server after server, Chip guy, managers walk by and nothing, Will not be back anytime soon. Thank goodness joyride is right down the street
