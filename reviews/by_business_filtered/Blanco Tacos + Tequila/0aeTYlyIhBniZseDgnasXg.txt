As huge fans of 80% of Sam Fox's restaurants (we don't eat meat), the Blanco at the Biltmore has a nice feel.

Normally we dine at their Scottsdale location and we miss Kelly Courson their Manager who moved to their newer Henry's restaurant.

The one thing we do notice at most of Sam's restaurants is that the Chef's seem to have different spins on their standard dishes.  Hence there can be disappointments and we have shared this at TFK in the past.

So of course there was a misunderstanding on a salad prep.  Marlo the Manager came over and could not have been more gracious about it all. 

 This while she was scratching her head why their Fish Salad comes as a chopped salad and the chopped salad does not.  Go figure!

Yet here is where Fox outshines most any other eatery here.

Their ability to attract talent and get these people into management positions is stellar.

Marlo was so earnest and  genuine in her TLC with us.  Outstanding !!!!

So yes there are some discrepancies, yet when the rubber meets the road, the Fox people are the BEST!!!
