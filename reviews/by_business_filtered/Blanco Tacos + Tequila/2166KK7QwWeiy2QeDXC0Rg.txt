Hellooooo shrimp tacos!!!!  All I can say is wow.  The food is amazing and the chips and salsa are as good as I have ever had.

I am a big fan of the Scottsdale location primarily because of the patio and fire pits.

My wife and I go often and enjoy freshly squeezed margs and salty dogs.

Highly recommend a visit.
