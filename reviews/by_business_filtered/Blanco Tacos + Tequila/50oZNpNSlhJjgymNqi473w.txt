I work for a hotel near the Biltmore and I send all of my guests to Blanco because I know they're going to come back satisfied. The environment is clean, fresh and friendly. I recommend folks here in confidence because this is a restaurant that maintains standards and the food is delicious. The flavors all come together, local ingredients used and match well with the vast selection of margaritas, sangria, etc. I brought some friends one afternoon and the service was superb. I was really happy as a guest and I love finding great places to eat. Five stars to Blanco, keep it up!
