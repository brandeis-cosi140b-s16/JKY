Had time for a bite while waiting for an appointment at the apple store so the girlie and I came in here. We both got the house specialty, short rib enchilada. I had the berry mojito and she had some other vodka drink. 

The food was amazing! I especially liked the rice, which had a light lime/cilantro flavor. The beans weren't my favorite. The enchilada was really good. It wasn't your standard enchilada you get anyplace, had a little different flavor in the sauce, but I like that. I like variety and appreciate different places making things their own. 

Our server was very nice and good. We were in a slight hurry due to our appointment but we told her when we ordered and asked if she could bring boxes and the check along with the food. She might not have liked that, but if she had a problem with it, we certainly couldn't tell. 

The only prob were the prices, $50 for lunch for two is a little high, but in hindsight, one meal would have easily fed us both. Next time I want to get the ceviche. Looked fantastic!
