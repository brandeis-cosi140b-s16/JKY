Have tried this place three times now. And only once have I met a staff member I liked. Our server this time was older, bubbly, and knew what she was doing. When came in on a late sunday afternoon, it was fairly slow. We told the hostess that we'd like to sit on the patio and she happily obliged. She took us out and tried to seat us directly next to a couple that seemed to be deep in conversation and enjoying each other. The seating on the patio is pretty tight, but the whole damned thing was empty! Why would you seat us right next to the only people on the patio? My boyfriend laughed a bit and asked if we could grab a table that was not on top of theirs. The hostess got a bit of an attitude and seated up a couple rows down. I've also experienced attitude from their bar as well. I was rushed to place my order, rushed to order a drink, and rushed to pay, with not even a glimmer of positivity or a smile from anyone working the bar. It was so awkward! The food is pretty good, menu isn't very large. Drinks center around tequila. Their margs are pre-mixed and varied, their not totally terrible. I probably won't be visiting again. There are much better options in that shopping center.
