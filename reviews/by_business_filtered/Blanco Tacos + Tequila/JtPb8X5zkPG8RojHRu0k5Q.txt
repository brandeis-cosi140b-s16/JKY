I must say that I really love most of the Fox Concepts restaurants.  Blanco Taco didn't live up to my expectations.  It's Americanized Mexican food.  I would describe the food as bland, tasteless, unispiring and forgettable.

The service certainly didn't meet the standards I see at all the other Fox restaurants.  My friends and I will not be returning to Blanco Tacos to eat.
