I am disappointed by my visit to this restaurant. As a tequila drinker who loves Mexican food, I had high hopes. I was Initially insulted by our drinks. I ordered a Corzo on the rocks. The 1 oz serving which I was given was watered down by at least 50% and my husband's classic margarita was all mix. My tacos were overly salty, but the beans were very good.
