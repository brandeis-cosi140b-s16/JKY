Wow, where do I begin?  Let's start with the service.  We sat at the bar and our tender was Amazing!   He recommended the enchiladas and they were dope.  Both margaritas were fantastic!  Especially the mango habanero.  My friend even spilled hers accidentally and they got us another free of charge without us even asking.  He suggested free sides of pico and jalaps which made the meal.  Then when I pulled out my 50 percent off manager card because I work for another restaurant within the company he was shocked!  Im so happy regular guests get this level
Of service on the daily. . I'll definitely be back!
