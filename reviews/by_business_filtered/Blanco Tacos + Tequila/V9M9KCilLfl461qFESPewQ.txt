To me this is like all Fox restaurants, the concept is wonderful, the execution..meh.  This was my first visit. I had the enchilada. We were warned that the enchilada was "stacked", and I'm ok with that. Actually, the enchilada and how it was served was really good. I liked the small cast iron pan that was perfectly sized to a corn tortilla. The cheese, lots of it and melty too. The sauce, that was where this took a drastic turn for the worse. Enchilada means "in chili". The sauce wasn't chili, I'm not sure it was even something like red pepper, maybe more tomato, and sweet not savory. Had this had a more authentic chili sauce on it, it would have been my new favorite and it would have been incredible. I'm probably lucky it didn't because I can still fit through the door. 

As for the service, location, atmosphere...those are all good, but I go to a restaurant to eat, not look around.
