If Sam Fox -- armed with his bevy of outrageously attractive servers, compelling interior design and people-pleasing menu items -- can't make a restaurant work in this spot, then no one can. Blanco is like the 4th or 5th name applied to this strangely dead zone in a really hot location over the last few years.

As has been my experience in about half my visits to FRC (Fox Restaurant Concepts) places, there was a mild service issue. In this case a friend's order was forgotten twice. To be fair, we were seated at the bar on a busy Friday night. The manager comped his meal to make up for it. That was nice.  What wasn't as nice was needing to stare at someone's discarded bowl of guac sitting in front of me just behind the bar for the entire visit. Guess they need more help for busy times.

Otherwise can't complain about much here. It's a Sam Fox take on gringo-Mex. The carne asada tacos were as expected. I'm convinced no one in Phoenix really wants authentic anything when it comes to Mexican, so here you'll be enjoying good-Mex-as-envisioned-by-account-manager-visiting-from-Chicago. And there's really nothing wrong with that.

It's not cheap, but the ingredients are good and nicely arranged.
