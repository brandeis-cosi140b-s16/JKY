Blanco is a welcome addition to the biltmore fashion park! 

Two friends and I met for lunch here on a Monday.  We were seated in a raised booth that overlooks the restaurant and outside.  Chips and salsa were basic, and we got the roasted corn and the queso to dip.  Both the queso and corn were absolutely delicious!

For my entree I had the short rib and avocado cheese crisp which was super yummy and crispy! It was not greasy like some crisps can be.  My friends tried the chicken tacos (loved them) and some sort of enchiladas.

Our server Keisha (sp) was very sweet! She kept our drinks full and came back to check on us at all the right times.  She also took our photo for us- twice!! 

Also, the taco window across from Williams Sonoma is open daily until 4 pm and has a few select items to grab and go.  I've tried the chicken tacos, queso, and cheese quesadilla from the window which are all straightforward and fresh.
