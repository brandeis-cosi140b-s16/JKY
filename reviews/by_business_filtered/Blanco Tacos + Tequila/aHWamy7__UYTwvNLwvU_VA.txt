My lunch at Blanco had its ups and downs. My aunt and I met at the mall for lunch here and I was so excited for Mexican food! It was a good crowd for a weekday lunch but they earned some points for accommodating our request for a booth. 

They brought us chips and salsa right away, which is always excellent. Unfortunately, there was a miscommunication with our guacamole order, so it came out about 20 minutes after we ordered and about 5 minutes before our lunch entrees were delivered. I was disappointed with the guacamole; it had very little flavor and could have benefited from a healthy dose of salt and lots more cilantro. My meal, though, was excellent. I got the green poblano pork burrito, which had the most tender, moist, and flavorful pork I have ever had. There wasn't much else in the burrito, but that was fine with me. Yes, as another reviewer pointed out, the main flavor of the rice is butter, but it is abated nicely when eaten with the black beans on the side.

The food was inconsistent and the service was only ok. I would probably try another restaurant at this mall before repeating at Blanco, but I would definitely order that pork burrito from there again!
