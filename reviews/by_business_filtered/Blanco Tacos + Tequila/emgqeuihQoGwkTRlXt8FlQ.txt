This is a review for the Blanco Window! $3 NACHOS, PEOPLE! The window serves little tacos, nachos, quesadillas, chips + dips, and tortas for about $3 - $5 each. I frequently order the nachos or quesadillas and ask them to add chicken or steak (an extra couple bucks) for a more filling meal. The cooks at the window have a tendency to go crazy with the cheese, so I always ask them to go easy. After you order you can eat your food on the colorful tables outside the window or on the grassy area in the middle of the Biltmore. If you are shopping at the Biltmore, and don't want to spend money and time on a meal, go to the Blanco window! The folks who work at the window are also super nice.

The actual restaurant has a good HH and margaritas. It's conveniently located at the Biltmore, but overall, there are dozens if not hundreds of restaurants in Phoenix with more authentic and flavorful Mexican food. If Fox put half the effort into Blanco's food as they do the restaurant's image, I'd recommend to a friend. I'd probably give the restaurant itself a 2 star, because at least the servers are wonderful and the place is clean.
