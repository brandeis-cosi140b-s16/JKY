Had dinner here last night with family.  Sat on the enjoyable patio, music was just right-not too loud, not too quiet.  There are a plethora of Mexican restaurants in the valley and I am always up for trying one out.  This place is good!  It's a new spin on old Mexican classics.  Chips and salsa were a nice start...I ordered a trio of tacos and each one was delicious (BBQ pork was AMAZING)!  I will say the margarita was lacking.  Not too pleased with it for $8.  But I will definitely return for the tacos.  Seriously I can't stop thinking about the yumminess!  And the Mexican Street Corn you can order as a side is out of this world.  Costs $1 extra than just a side of beans.  But totally worth it :)
