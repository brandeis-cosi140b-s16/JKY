Very poor quality food and drink . . . There at happy hour, and glasses tasted like soap. Don't order a White Sangria, as it is made with 80% sweet and sour mix from their margarita machine. Really disappointing.

The Quesadillas saved the day. They have a lot of cheese and a pleasant taste. But the Carnitas taco was the worst I've had -- just nasty. And the chips were greasy and right out of the fryer. 

Very surprised. Sam Fox ought to do better. This was a relatively low-cost startup from Fox Restaurant Concepts in a location that has had other belly-up operations. This one is headed same direction, unfortunately. Love his "Wild Child" right up the street, however.
