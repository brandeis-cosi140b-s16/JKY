What great service. Our waitress Christie was on top of it. It was our first time at any Blanco location, not only did she take the time to go over the menu, she was made aware that one of us had a glutten allergy and educated us on what options would best suit our needs. She was timely, friendly and up beat. 

The restaurant itself seemed great. We chose to sit outside and enjoyed happy hour margaritas (what a great value). We both had street tacos, I had the "Award winning" bbq beef and my partner had the fish. We both thought our dishes were great. The side of street corn was absolutely to die for. 

Of course it being a Sam Fox restaurant the decor was lovely and everyone was super hip. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for great service, contemporary mexican and a great margarita.
