This is outstanding in every respect. If you are looking for a new way and an innovative twist on Mexican- this is your place.
Cocktails- try the blood orange margarita. 

Guacamole, cheese crisp w with braised beef, salsa verde, street tacos- delicious!

Kay was our server and she was friendly and very attentive.

Truly a restaurant concept that is 5 stars.
