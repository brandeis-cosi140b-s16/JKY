The chips and salsa were pretty good for starters but I ordered 2 carne asada tacos and one chicken. The rice was overly salty and tasted processed. Blended lime margarita was like a slushy without tequila, (maybe they forget it) There was nothing special about their food and I don't recommend for you to come here. The prices did not fit the quality!
