Good food & AMAZING service.  I believe that if a Mexican  restaurant has good salsa  its a good sign that the food will be good as well & Blanco has several. Our waiter Denver was spot on & made our "date night" extra special. We will certainly be back & definitely request Denver's section. Great job Blanco!
