Good restaurant.  I've been here about 3 times.  Nice ambiance and decor.  Service is always good.  The food here is a little meh however.  Tried several different tacos and I find them all a bit bland. Except the BBQ Pork which was excellent.  Taco's aren't bad, just not very flavorful.  The Blanco Burger is good.  It's worth a visit for the drinks though. They are strong and tasty.  This is a nice place to grab a drink and relax before or after dinner but I wouldn't come here hungry.
