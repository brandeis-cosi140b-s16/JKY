I would give 3.5 stars if I could.

The servers are rather attentive and the space is nice.  The breakfast burrito seems to be the rage here but I say for lunch.  The three braised short rib tacos I had were pleasant but not particular flavorful.   The beans were an item to pass, but the rice was tasty.  

They do have a nice variety of bottle and local craft draft beers.
