I have to give props to this place. Originally I sat at the bar and the bartender was so disinterested that I left to find somewhere else. I came back and say in the dining room where I got a nice bloody orange margarita and nachos with a lettuce base instead of chips. Yum!

Service was initially slow but I got checked on and offered help by all the servers on the area.
