First, they had to change the keg. No big deal. Then they said they were out, please order another beverage. Then, after my meal was delivered, they show up with my original beverage order. The Burrito was COLD, the taste was mediocre, the cheese was cold and not melted, and all that for over 15 bucks not including the beverage. Wow, ...I commented that it was cold, colder than my draft beer and the waiter said I'm sorry and walked off.

Never again. 

I only gave them a 1 star because the app wouldn't let me submit it with no stars.

I understand they are busy,  but that is what they want. Quality control and customer service is completely absent.
