For an airport "food court" option, it was surprisingly decent. The chips/salsa were good, the chicken Quesadilla appetizer was larger than expected (very filling) and full of flavor, and the unsweetened iced tea was the best I had while in Phoenix....with free refills and they even gave is a large one to-go without any charge. Beats the neck out of Modern Burger which was next door.
