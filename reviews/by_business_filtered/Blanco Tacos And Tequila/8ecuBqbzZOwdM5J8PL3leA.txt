Pretty good for an airport restaurant. I had a quick layover and could not consider the thought of another meal on the plane. I stopped in here in a hurry and was seated very quickly. My waitress came to the table in a fair amount of time to take my order. My food was delivered promptly and hot. The food was fairly good. I will probably come back in here when I got in this airport for a layover again.
