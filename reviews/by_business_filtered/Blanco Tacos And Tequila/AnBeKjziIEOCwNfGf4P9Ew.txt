STAY AWAY- 
Bought food at window of Blanco and then went to sit at one of the 19 empty tables. I was told I had to go and eat at another restaurant even though the food I had I just purchased from  them. Seems you can only use their tables if you purchase more food and drinks from the bar. Just got off a long flight and as a disabled veteran I was in a lot of pain and just wanted to eat. Seems the $23 I just spent on food from them was not enough for a seat. Manger said "thanks for your service but you still have to eat at another restaurant with  that food as you bought if from our window and not table"
Stay away not military or customer friendly at all!
