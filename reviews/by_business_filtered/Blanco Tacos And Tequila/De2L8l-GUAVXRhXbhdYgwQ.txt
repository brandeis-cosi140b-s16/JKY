Absolutely love this place. Decided to forgo breakfast at the hotel and test my luck at the airport. I wanted to be able to sit down and be served - versus a McDonald's!  Really cute atmosphere- hip and the music is lively. Great service from Christina!
The food was excellent. I had the bacon egg and Mexican cheese burrito. It is a large portion and served with a side of potatoes. The fresh salsa is what really ties it all together. Now I just need to be located on a Mexican beach somewhere!  Will definitely come here again when I travel through PHX.
