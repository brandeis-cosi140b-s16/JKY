Place was pretty busy yesterday at 12:30 but still had open seats and tables. Seated near the front. Waited 10 minutes, was never served (no drink order, no food order, no nothing!) and had to get something to go from elsewhere before heading for my flight. Will never go back to this restaurant and will tell everyone I know who flies through Sky Harbor to do the same.
