Was told it was must try place when landing in PHX! Even with the awkward moment of the bartender looking at me and then my ID for like 5 min making sure it was me when ordering their Bloody Mary's which by the way was so good I ordered 3 must say I'm glad I stopped by! Awesome drinks food and service!! If I'm ever in PHX will make sure to stop again!
