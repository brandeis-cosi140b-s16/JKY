Was excited to see some new places at Sky Harbor since I'm there every week.  Went to Blanco for a breakfast burrito.  First off, it was wayyyy to big a tortilla for the amount of eggs in there.  And yes it was just eggs, not eggs and cheese as they had promised (at least I couldn't find the cheese).  Plus the tortilla itself had a wierd sweetness to it and was very greasy.  I ended up just pulling out the eggs and trashing everything else.  Very disappointed, and woud be better off at another place, at least for breakfast.
