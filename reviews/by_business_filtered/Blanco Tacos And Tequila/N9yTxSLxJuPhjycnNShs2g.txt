I'm stingy with my stars, but this place deserves a four, simply because it's the best damn food I've had in an airport. And if it weren't in an airport I'd still eat here.

Solid drinks, nice atmosphere, friendly service, flavorful, spicy and dishes are presented very nicely.

Apparently the owner owns all three spots here, including Modern Burger and Olive & Vine.
