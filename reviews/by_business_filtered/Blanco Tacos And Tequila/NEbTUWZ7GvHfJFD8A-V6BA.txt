Surprisingly, Phoenix Sky boasts some pretty solid food options!  Running on empty after a long day of work, and finally heading back home, I was excited at the possibility of some Mexican food before my flight back to the OC.  

Usually I would never order a quesdilla from a Mexican restaurant (the idea being anything I can easily make myself is out of the question), but upon looking at the menu, I was immediately sold.  

Melted Oaxaca, Asadero & Manchego Cheeses on a Crisp Flour Tortilla with Machaca?!  $9 for an airport version of this was right up my alley.  

The food came out fast, and it was exactly what I hoped it would be. Solid.
