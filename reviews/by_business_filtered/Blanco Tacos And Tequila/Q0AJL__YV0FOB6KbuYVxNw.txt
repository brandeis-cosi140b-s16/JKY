Dropped in during a layover at Sky Harbor. Since it was breakfast time, at least locally, I went for one of their several burrito options - chorizo and eggs. They did recognize that it might be lunch to other people, and offered me the lunch menu as well, which was nice. 

My server asked if I wanted sour cream or avocado as well, since the chorizo was spicy. I went with a bit of sour cream. The burrito came out quickly and was served with some very nice fried potatoes as well. 

The chorizo was medium hot, just about right, and the burrito was good sized and loaded with eggs and a bit of green onion as well. Very tasty. 

I had some time so decided to hang for a bit and they didn't make me feel pressured to leave at all. Nice. 

Their beer selection is not great but there are a couple of nice ones in there, as well as a full bar.  This place is worth a visit!
