So I was in a hurry to catch a plane so I got a breakfast burrito to go and sat down at the long bar like table in the center of the restaurant to eat it quickly. The hostess told me I had to leave and sit at some other restaurant because they were only full service. The other section was full so I stayed in my seat and continued to eat. She the started acting like a complete bitch and insisted I had to order something or leave. I ordered a glass of water and she said something about only making four dollars an hour... Tough shit bitch, if you have it so bad try joining the military and you can see what real suffering looks like. The food was ok but pretty overpriced. Nothing new in a airport. As for attitude and service this place can't get much lower.
