Service here is lukewarm.

That being said, everything else is awesome for an airport eatery.  Serious!

I was here for breakfast and the amount of food you are served for $9 is absolutely incredible.  I ordered the burrito with chorizo and eggs.  I didn't really want it burrito-style so they served it with the tortilla on the side.  Thanks!

Two people should split this meal.  Massive heapings of eggs with chorizo along with a huge portion of home fried potatoes which were also very good and crunchy.

I was seated alone at one of the "high" tables and low and behold, each table has multiple plug ins for your electronics.  I immediately plugged in my laptop and phone to get full charge prior to my flight.

A tremendous value.  If you're with someone, split the meal.
