I dread eating at the airport. Everything is super expensive, very microwave-y and just gross. Blanco was a pleasant surprise! I came in for breakfast around 8am and it was already pretty packed. 

The menu was short but had a variety of options. The prices were $8-$14 for options from short ribs, to chorizo burrito to huevos rancheros. Since I was in AZ I had to have the chorizo burrito that came with well seasoned potatoes. I couldn't finish the whole thing and at $9, this is a great option even  without being in an airport! 

They also have an extensive drink menu, specifically with tons of tequila options. It was a little too early for that but I definitely would get into trouble here. 

My food was ready quick even though almost every table was occupied. I definitely will be back when I fly out of PHX!
