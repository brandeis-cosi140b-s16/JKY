Let's face it - most airport food sucks. That is not the case at Blanco. It's near gate A5, near the US Airways wing of the Phoenix Airport. I have been here twice now and both time the service and the food has been great.

They have high communal tables in the bar with electrical outlets at each seat. Sweet!

The waitress recommend the braised pork and avocado cheese crisp and it did not disappoint. They service is quick and easy so that you can make your connecting flight and the beer is cold. If you are ever passing through Phoenix and looking for a great Watering Hole - make sure to stop in at Blanco.
