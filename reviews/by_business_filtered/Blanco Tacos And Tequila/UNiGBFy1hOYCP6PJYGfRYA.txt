I stopped at Blanco preflight to have a drink. I was seated at a two top, which gave me space for all of my stuff. The service was very efficient and friendly. The drink (blood orange marg) was decent and priced reasonably, especially for an airport. I'm pretty sure the Fox restaurants in the airport have the same prices as at their regular restaurants, which I appreciate. I wouldn't make a special trip to come here, but I would come back if it were convenient.
