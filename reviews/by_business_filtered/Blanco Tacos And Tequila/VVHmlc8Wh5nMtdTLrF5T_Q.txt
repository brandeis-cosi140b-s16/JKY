Delicious egg and cheese breakfast burrito! 

It's not often I'm inspired to write a Yelp! review, but this burrito was so good I just had to.  

I wasn't expecting anything amazing because it was fast, airport food but I wasn't pleasantly surprised. The tortilla was soft and chewy, it had just the right amount of cheese, and the salsa was surprisingly spicy! The perfect little quick breakfast as I dashed to my gate.
