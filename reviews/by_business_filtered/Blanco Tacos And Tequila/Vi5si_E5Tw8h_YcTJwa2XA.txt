Woo-hoo! First to review! Well, recently tried this place on my break and it wasn't bad. I'd give it more of a 3.5. I can only comment on the To Go food cause that's all I had time for. I had the carnitas burrito. And it was tasty and quite hefty, but I'd expect that at the prices their burritos are going for. At first taste, I found it a bit odd. I think maybe they buttered their tortillas cause there was a queer taste that I don't find from other burrito places. The filling was good; the pork was yummy and not dry or stringy. I'll probably go back and try more of their menu some time.
