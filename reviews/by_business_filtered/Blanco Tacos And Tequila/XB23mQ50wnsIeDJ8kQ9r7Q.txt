Really beyond expectations for airport food but only 3 stars because on the outside, compared to other Mexican, it lacks the spice and flavor I prefer in my Mexican food.  The kids portion is huge and my ordinarily big eaters both left food behind.  One kiddo ordered the cheese quesadilla and so it was super easy to package it up in their to-go container to eat on the plane.  I got the Mexican pizza and that was also huge.  They were fast (35 min from seating to leaving) giving us plenty of time before our departure.  Bottom line:   Recommend for the airport
