For an airport, this place had really good Mexican food and friendly fast service. Even the lady next to me commented on how good the food was.  I had the shrimp tacos which came with 3 medium tacos and rice n beans.  Perfect amount. The beer n drinks are good too. (When are they not?)  I will stop by again when passing thru.
TIP. At a lot of the tables running along the walls and islands they have outlets at each table. I was able to charge my phone. Sweet, I wasn't a wall hugger.
