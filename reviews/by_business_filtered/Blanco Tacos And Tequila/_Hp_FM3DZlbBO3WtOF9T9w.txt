What a lovely little retreat in the Phoenix Sky Harbor airport. I've been traveling al day trying to make it back home to El Paso from Vermont. I haven't eaten all day and tacos sounded great. I followed other Yelp recommendations and ordered the machaca tacos on corn tortillas. The plate was vibrant with tacos topped with cabbage, peppers, tomatoes, and cotija cheese; a bowl of black beans; and a white rice with veggies. My first bite was of the rice. It was cooked perfectly. I bit into the tacos--generous meat portions, juicy, and full of flavor. I cleaned my plate. Service was a little slow to start off, but overall my server was really on it. Neat spot to visit it you have some time at the airport.
