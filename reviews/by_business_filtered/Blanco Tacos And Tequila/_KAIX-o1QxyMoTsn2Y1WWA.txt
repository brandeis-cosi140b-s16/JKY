The Mexican Chopped Salad is truly one of the BEST salads I've ever had! It was so good! Also the last time I was here the waiter got sour cream or something in my brand new 400.00 Coach purse. I didn't see it and never would have known but he stepped up and told me what happened and we cleaned it up bad it never touched the purse. If it wasn't for his honesty my purse wound have a big stain. I've never splurged on a purse before so I would have been pretty bummed. I so appreciated his honesty! Anyway, this is a great place to eat!
