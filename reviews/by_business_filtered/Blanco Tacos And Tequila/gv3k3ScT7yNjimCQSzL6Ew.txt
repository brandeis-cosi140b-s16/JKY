Food has a good flavor. 

Staff is slow and kind of zoned out (2 bar tenders standing there talking rather than taking orders and refilling drinks).

Portions are small and over priced. It's in the airport so you don't have much of an alternative.

If all of the staff members were a bit friendlier and more attentive, I'd say 4 stars. Drop the prices by 20% and you'd have a 5 star airport dining experience.
