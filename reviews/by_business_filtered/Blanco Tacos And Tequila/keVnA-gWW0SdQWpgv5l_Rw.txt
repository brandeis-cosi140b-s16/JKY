Friendly server. Didn't feel rushed to leave (flight delayed) even though I was alone and they were near capacity. Food was good for an airport, but would be disappointing anywhere else. Ordered roasted chicken tacos. Chicken tasty, but pico in need of flavor. Asked for taco sauce and received generic bottle of pepper sauce. Still okay though. Inexcusable, however, was the fact that they were OUT OF CHIPS!!! No chips and salsa at 10:00 p.m. on a Thursday. At an airport restaurant full of folks drinking beer rather than eating. Can't be good business.
