I travel a lot, and so spend a lot of time in airport restaurants.  Now, those that travel a lot know that airport establishments can be a little on the lacking side when it comes to food quality as the need for speedy delivery and production usually results in mediocre offerings.

The reason I like this place is that some of the staple items I like to eat are done well here.  Specifically the Nachos appetizer and the Steak & Egg Fajitas.  Both items are very tasty.  The only downside is that the meat additions to the nachos can be a little salty.

Service is usually good, with no complaints.

Pros: Good offerings so far.  Decent service, especially for an airport environment. Electrical plugs EVERYWHERE, even under the seats.

Cons: Can be noisy and it is hard to carry on a phone conversation here.  If hit at the peak flight arrivals, can be very busy and tight for seating.
