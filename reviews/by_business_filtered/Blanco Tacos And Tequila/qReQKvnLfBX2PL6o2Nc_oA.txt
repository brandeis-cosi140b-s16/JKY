They have both a take out section (burritos/tacos/chips/simple salads) and a sit down section, which has a bigger mrenu. I ordered the shrimp salad. Crunchy textures and nicely cooked shrimp. Generous portion of salad. Cilantro lime vinaigrette had good flavor. But unfortunately, the dressing and shrimp were both too salty. Please cut down on the salt for your customers. I had to ask for three refills of water!
