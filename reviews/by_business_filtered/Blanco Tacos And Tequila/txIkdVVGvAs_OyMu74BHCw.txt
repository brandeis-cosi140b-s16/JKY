This place was amazing to eat at especially at the airport. The service was great, my waiter kept checking to see if I needed a drink refill or order more food. They're not pushy to have you leave and the setting is quite comfortable. The food was yummy and flavorful!! If you're looking for something filling and delicious while waiting for your flight, I definitely recommend going here!
