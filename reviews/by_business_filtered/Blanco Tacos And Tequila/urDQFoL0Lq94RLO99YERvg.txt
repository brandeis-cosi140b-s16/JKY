I was heading to Vegas so what better way to start off the flight then catching a couple margaritas right before? So I ordered the White Peach Margarita which was too sweet. Don't do it to yourself and I love Margaritas. I then tried the original and it was just alright. Nothing to rave about, but if I had more time I would have gone to Chili's. Blanco looks nice, great ambiance, but it's mostly hype and it was right next to my gate. You live, you learn.
