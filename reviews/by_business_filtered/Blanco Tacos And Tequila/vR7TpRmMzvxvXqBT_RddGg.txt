So airports are not my favorite places and the food tends to be overpriced. My husband discovered Blanco when he was on a business trip and loved the quesadillas so much he told me we had to try them the next time we went through the Phoenix airport. Now every time we're in this airport we pray for a decent layover just so we can go have the three cheese quesadillas (all Mexican cheeses) and fresh, very tasty margaritas. The service is insanely fast--we got our food about seven minutes after ordering--and the wait staff is kind and attentive. Everything tastes fresh and the price is definitely not bad, especially for "airport food" (heck, I'd want to eat here for a date night...it's definitely not your average airport dive). Blanco is a great respite from the grind and pain that airports can be.
