I ordered some food to go.   Since it was taking awhile I sat in the empty table area which is right next to to the to go area.   A very rude waitress told me I couldn't sit there and the to go area was over there because the area was for dine in only.   

I don't see what the big deal was.  I was a paying customer, the place was empty, and I was waiting.   

So I asked for a refund and went further down to the Wildflower where they were happy to take my business.
