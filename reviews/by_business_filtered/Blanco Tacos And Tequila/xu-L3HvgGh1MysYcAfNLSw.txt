I've never been to the Scottsdale location, only this location in the airport. We were seated quickly but I'm honestly not sure who our server was as we were helped by a few different people. The guacamole and chips were both delicious. I ordered the fish tacos - they were very "fishy" smelling and really had no flavour. 

This was a good spot to stop for an airport meal but I wouldn't recommend the fish tacos.
