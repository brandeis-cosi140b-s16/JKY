Blanco is by far my favorite restaurant. I go there on dates with my husband as well as have been there with my girlfriends. They have a small outdoor patio that maybe has 6 different tables (?) and is a great spot for when the weather is nice. The restaurant is open concept and a little noisy but not enough to bother me. I can still carry on a conversation with no problem. ALL the staff are nice, friendy, and knowledgeable. They did recently take off one of my favorite menu items - the ceviche. There is another one offered but it is not as good. The guacamole is amazing so that makes up for it :) All the tacos are outstanding and will definately fill you up. They have a great wine list that features my favorite Malbec - Altos del Plata. Their white sangria is great too! This spot is a must to visit!
