Hostesses seemed bothered we interrupted their conversation to find a table (same reaction several times... we were staying next door on business). Other than that, really enjoyed the service. Servers were always friendly, and the food was consistently good. Tried the short rib burrito,  carne asada burrito, Chipotle shrimp, street corn. Enjoyed all of the above. Would come back.
