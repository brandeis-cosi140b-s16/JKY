I would have given 5 stars if I could have heard the person next to me talk! Music needs to be turned down, just a notch. I understand the atmosphere, but c'mon, we were with a big group of girls and it was impossible to follow the conversation. Ok, moving on. Loved the food, loved the vibe, great, quick service. The chips-n-salsa were addictive. I was this close to ordering some to take home. Loved my meal, which were the fish tacos, perfect portion size. Not too much, not too little. Good time!
