Met some friends here on a Friday night and waited over 2 hours to get a table. I have never EVER waited that long to get a table, anywhere but I am soooo glad we did.  The service was impeccable and the food was to die for.  So good and different than anything I have had in a long time.  The prices were great too, which just made this an amazing experience all around.  Totally would get 5 stars if I didn't have to wait 2 hours.
