We tried this place on Valentine's Day and they got us in a 20 min  however we were wondering why not sooner because of so many empty tables. Really? On Valentine's Day, they wouldn't have staffed extra? Our server was ok but could she seemed new. We had the crab and shrimp ceviche and it was ok. It seemed fresh but I would have appreciated if it was diced more. Really hard to eat giant pieces of vegetables with chips and there wasn't a lot of shrimp in it either. We had the fish tacos and carne asado burrito. Both were ok but our food took a long time. Everybody kept saying food was on the way but still took time and my beans were cool when we got everything.

On the positive side, the ambience is nice, open and airy. The music was at a tolerable level when we came in but towards the end, the volume had been raised such that I couldn't hear my husband across the table. 
Not sure if I will be back. I can think of other places I like better.
