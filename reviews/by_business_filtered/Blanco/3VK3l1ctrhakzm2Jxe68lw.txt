You don't go to Blanco Tacos if you are looking for Outstanding Mexican food, the menu is limited and arguably, there are places that are a lot better..  The food is just average but the atmosphere and ambiance is worth going for.   This is a very hip (club type atmosphere) restaurant.  We sat on the patio and it was great for people watching.  Good music too.  

If I had one complaint, it would be the service.  Our server was preoccupied and kept forgetting to bring things.
