Good Job Fox!  Visited on a Monday night just about happy hour, good service, ambiance hip and trendy, plenty of staff and promptly served with good chips and good salsa. Happy hour margaritas a bit sweet for me and my date so our bill was about $20 cheaper than it could have been.  Crispy Shrimp Tacos delicious, Mahi Salad hit the spot.  White rice was different and the charro beans very good.

 Fox has a way with their restaurants that keeps them just shy of genius but way above run of the mill. We ate at Culinary Dropouts the day before! All good.
