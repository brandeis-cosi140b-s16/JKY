I love the food here, I love the staff here, I love the layout and the service. I came here the first time by recommendation and now I go all the time. The atmosphere is very laid-back and relaxing. One of the better tasting modern Mexican restaurant I've been to. The service is typically very prompt in meeting any requests or needs. Food and drinks are well priced. Asked where the restroom was the first time I went and instead of pointing to the direction, she actually walked me there to the door. That's what I call service. Definitely coming back ....
