I went here for lunch with co-workers. The decor is pretty out dated and the blue chairs had cracking and torn vinyl and weren't very comfortable. I'm not sure why but halfway through lunch they opened the doors and left them open, flies started buzzing around our food and table.

Their food is typical Arizona Mexican food with bland flavor and no authenticity. If you are looking for a Mexican dining experience this isn't the place. We started off with guacamole, chips and salsa. The guacamole was tasteless and didn't have enough cilantro, onions or tomatoes it also didn't have any chopped serranos/jalapenos plus it needed salt. I ordered the carne asada tacos which had very dry corn tortillas, they had to be at least a few days old and left out uncovered. The meat was dry, a little chewy and lacked in flavor as well. The butter rice was good and the bean were good but lets be honest how can you mess those up.
