First timer - really loved it. The only reason why I'm not giving it 5 stars is because I wasn't a fan of the queso - and I'm a HUGE queso fan. Very think and flavor wasn't great. 
Salsa - amazing. Mexican Street Corn - amazing. Chop salad - Amazing. 
I'd be back any time, but I'll skip the queso and try the quac.

Cool vibe, great drinks, cozy tables.
