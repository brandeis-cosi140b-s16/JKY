This place is super fun - we had a girls' night here and it was a blast. Their margaritas are excellent, and the food was pretty good (though not super amazing, but it was more about the atmosphere and drinks). Great place to go if you're in the mood for something upbeat. Love that their bar is large but service is never a problem. Will definitely go back.
