Went here this evening and had the crispy shrimp tacos, and all I can say is OM NOM NOM! Also, the beans are delicious, but the rice is so out of this world, that next time, I may double up on the rice. Also, do yourself a favor and order the guacamole to start with (though they do top it with tomatoes, which makes me sad, but is totally a personal thing). 

Another couple we went with got the carnitas burrito and loved it as well.

To top it all off, our waitress (though now I have forgotten her name, of course) was absolutely delightful. 

The sinks in the bathroom are also really cool, if any of you are into that :)
