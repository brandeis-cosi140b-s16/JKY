I've been to Blanco twice and I haven't been thrilled with the food either time.  Their chips and salsa are just okay.  I feel like their salsa lacks flavor.  I usually order the carne asada tacos which are nothing to write home about.  Their house rice is very creamy and not like most Mexican rice dishes I've tasted.
