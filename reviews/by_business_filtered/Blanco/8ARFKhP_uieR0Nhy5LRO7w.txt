We have been to Blanco twice now and let's tell it like it is. The place is jamming. The music is fun and it's a good vibe. yes, you may have to wait but just enjoy a really good cocktail made with fresh squeezed juices or my favorite a chupacabra beer(from mexico hard to find in the U.S.) or a tequilla with a sangrita back. Just like my favorite cantinas in Mexico.
Now on to the food. Yes, it's not like your Abuela is in the kitchen but this i a really good fresh take on traditional mexican food. Start with the braised short rib cheese crisp-really yummy. also very good Gaucamole. we then had a few difft. tacos and the red chile enchiladas and it was all really good. the last time i tried the steak and for the money it was excellent. i think this place is what it is and represents quality ingredients in a fun atmosphere.
