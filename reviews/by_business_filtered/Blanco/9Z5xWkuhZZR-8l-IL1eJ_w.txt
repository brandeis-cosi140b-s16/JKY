Very sad about Blanco! I love Fox Restaurants and was shocked that this is connected to that company. My hubby and I did a quick date night last week and chose Blanco since we have seen it so many times in passing. The Guac was $9 and seriously the size of a golf ball served in a large bowl. I ordered a dinner salad I think it was $12 for a bread sized plate of lettuce a couple tomatos and avacados and about a half a pound of dressing. I usually get extra dressing on the side but no need for that at this place my lettuce was wilted from the amount of dressing on the salad. This would not have been terrible if it was good but it tasted terrible.
My husband took the waiters recommendation and ordered enchiladas. That was probably the best thing about our experience HOWEVER it tasted like cream of mushroom soup out of the can and came in a little petite size skillet for I think $15 or $16 bucks. I would never go back not even for half price. I will stick to sauce and Fox Sports Grill. For Mexican I will make the long drive to Val Vista and Baseline to eat at Nandos. Nothing compares to their food!
