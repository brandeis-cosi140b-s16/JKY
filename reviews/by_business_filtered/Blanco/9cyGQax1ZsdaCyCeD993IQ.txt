This is another Fox Restaurant Concept and they've once again created a unique and innovated culinary experience based on a timeless classic. I love Mexican food and Blanco has taken it to another level. They have a large menu with enough selection and diversity to satisfy anyone. My favorite item on the menu are the Ahi Tuna tacos, they are simply spectacular. Nothing better than a few tacos and a corona after a long day of work. My only issue with this restaurant is the service. For some reason the staff is less attentive here than at other Fox Restaurants. I've been here 5 of 6 times and the service is always so-so. The food more than makes up for it though.
