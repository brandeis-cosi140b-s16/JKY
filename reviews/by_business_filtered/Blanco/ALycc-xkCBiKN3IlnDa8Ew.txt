Solid place with a cool vibe and decor.  Had lunch earlier this week.  The guacamole was ok, nothing special.  I actually liked the salsa.  Had the BBQ pork tacos and they were very good, my wife had the mexican chopped salad and was satisfied.

Definitely a cool place to hang out for drinks/apps after work.
