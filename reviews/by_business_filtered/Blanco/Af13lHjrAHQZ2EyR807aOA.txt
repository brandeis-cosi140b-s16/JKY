It is a "popular" restaurant in the heart of Scottsdale.  With that comes the usual scene of people that I normally try to avoid, but the food is pretty good.  They also have a pretty wide selection of bottled Mexican beers.  Its nice not have to settle for Corona.

Some people don't like the interior, but I like the clean, all-white look.  Its kind of a refreshing & calming look for a restaurant that wants you to relax.

Food is pretty filling & tasty.  Had the seared Ahi tacos, and they were filled with big tuna chunks.  Buddy had enchilads (he is from Tennessee), and he really liked them.  That in itself should be a win for a Mexican joint.

There's a lot of tequila here to try, but it can get pricey.  If the weather was nicer, I would have sat on the patio.
