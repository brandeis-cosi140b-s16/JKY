This place is your typical high ceiling, ostentatious, characterless place with pretty girls and pretentious people that one would expect to find in Scottsdale. The food is good but uninspired, the service is awful as others have mentioned:  the kid behind the bar was too busy talking to the other servers rather than attending to customers. She's pretty and thinks that she'll get good tips just based on her looks?

In other words, this place is a Phoenician's dream. Fox concepts (could be called Phoenix concepts) fits in perfect in a city lacking any culture or character. Enjoy.
