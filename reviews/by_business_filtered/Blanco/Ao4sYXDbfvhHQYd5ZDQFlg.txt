Nice handsome restaurant!  Stopped in around 9pm for a bite and a beer..never been before.  Cruising up Scottsdale road and the big blue sign drew me in.  Service was good... the young gentleman that waited on us was attentive and very helpful.  Tried the Tuna Ceviche...it was ok.
Had the cheese enchiladas..( I know, who orders a cheese enchilada?)...but, I have been to some restaurants in CA that make cheese enchilada's to die for..this one not so much...they were burnt on top, they put more cheese and sauce on to cover it up, they were dry and drowning in sauce.  

Oh well, next time I will order something else...nice tequila menu though, and I like tequila!  Looks like this will be a happy hour, chips, salsa and tequila place for me!
