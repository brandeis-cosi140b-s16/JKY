Where to start...This place is a "Scottsdale Spot".  

A contemporary way to mix good tacos, sangria, and  good times.  The atmosphere is really fun and I would suggest for all occasions.  We started off with a carafe of Sangria, kept it coming with some appitizers and finished it off with some tasty tacos.

THUMBS UP. Let the good times roll....
