Food- The complimentary chips and salsa are delicious. The chips are homemade and a little bit thicker than most restaurant tortilla chips. The salsa is also really good.
I typical get a mixture of side dishes and mix them together to make a "naked" burrito or burrito bowl. The beans are perfectly seasoned and really flavorful. Same with the rice. Their charred corn is always cooked well. I did get the carrots and jalepenos one time, and it was SO spicy that I couldn't eat it. I have a medium tolerance for spice.

I also enjoy the White Peach and Hibiscus Margarita. It has a great flavor. 
My husband typically gets the Machaca Burrito made Enchilada style. It comes in a cast iron type individual casserole dish. 

Service- The servers are really attentive and helpful, giving suggestions of menu items and accommodating special requests.

Decor- The design of the restaurant is really cool. Nice blues and whites, huge industrial type light fixtures. A nice patio and stocked bar in the middle of the main dining room.

In all fairness, we don't frequent Blanco, because you can get Mexican food that is just as good at a cheaper price point, but I do enjoy splurging on the ambiance of Blanco once in a while.
