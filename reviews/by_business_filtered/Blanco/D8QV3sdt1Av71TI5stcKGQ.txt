I'm starting to think that Phoenix isn't the Mexican food mecca that people seem to think it is. My favorite place closed down over a year ago, and I've since then been on the search for something comparable. I've yet to find anything that comes even close. 

Taste is very subjective, yet most people get quite defensive about their favorite Mexican place. I'm pretty sure this place won't go on the top of many people's lists though. It's not like I thought for even a second that Blanco would blow my mind, but I wasn't paying and since it was a Fox Concept (which is the new way of saying "chain" I guess) I was willing to give it the benefit of the doubt.

I tend to order pretty much the same thing when I hit a new Mexican joint, and I didn't stray from that this time. I like to get a cheese crisp... I know it's totally not authentic, but my mom used to make them when I was a kid. Their version of a cheese crisp was good... even less Mexican than most places, but good. Interesting type of cheese... fresh and light and not oily.

Their salsa was kinda weak, but tasted okay. It needs more flavor and more heat, but it didn't taste bad like some places. I ordered a machaca beef taco dish as well. The beef was boring and flavorless, but quality meat. Their margaritas were okay... nothing to write home about, but at least they didn't taste like a store bought mix. 

The food was merely okay - at least it was edible. It's not very Mexican at all, but it's decent. The things that stands out about this place are that it's very clean and nice inside, and the staff is super friendly and good looking. It's almost to the point that I want to give it 4 stars. If the food wasn't so bland and uninspired, it would be an easy decision. I may change it later. At least I didn't go home with gut rot. I'll eat here again.
