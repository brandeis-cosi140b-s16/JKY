My fiance took me here for lunch today and I was so mad that he didn't bring me here before this. THIS IS MY NEW FAVORITE RESTAURANT!! Usually I judge a Mexican restaurant by their salsa, but this is the exception. The salsa was good, but I like salty salsa.  I don't really like if it's the least bit sweet.  And I hate the real thick hard tortilla chips. This place had thick chips and the salsa was a bit sweet. But EVERYTHING else was mind blowingly good. I ordered the crispy shrimp tacos on corn tortillas with rice and pinto charro beans. OMG!! I've had hundreds of shrimp and fish tacos and these were the best I've ever had. And even though the rice was simple with just some cooked green onions and corn seasoning it...it was so incredible. It had a buttery succulent flavor to it. Ron had the beef short rib nachos and he was in heaven. They only serve Pepsi products here so I got the black passion fruit iced tea and it was amazing. I took some home with me. It's was a beautiful day and the open air layout of the place was gorgeous.  There are two patios, the place has 4 tvs for keeping up with the game.  I gave my compliments to the general manager, Chelsea and told her that we were destined to become good friends because this is my new place.  Great service, even better food and a lovely atmosphere.
