My friend Carrie and I decided to stop at Blanco on the way back from the Scottsdale Culinary Festival.  Yep, kinda ironic, we needed more food and drinks after a culinary festival.  I have been wanting to try the latest addition to the Borgata.  If you like good margaritas and good food than this place is perfect.  If you dont....you need help!  A great relaxing atmosphere on the patio with margaritas that go down....oh so smooth!! We tried one of their flat bread cheese crisp type appetizers which was a perfect compliment to my drink.  Is the drink supposed to compliment the food?? oops!  The chips and salsa were also good and add the guacamole for some extra flare!  Cool place, nice atmosphere, and good food to top it off!  Ill be back!
