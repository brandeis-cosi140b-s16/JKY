I am a fan of Fox Restaurants and I've eaten here several times, but it's my least favorite out of the group.  It's not for a lack of trying...I've been here several times and it's always a popular place for clients and co-workers to meet for lunch.  Here's a list of items I've tried here:

Cheese Crisp - $9

The dishes with the most flavor was the Blanco Burger and the Carnitas Tacos.  Other than that, the food was mostly just OK.  You do get complimentary Chips & Salsa which is pretty good and filling.  You definitely won't leave here hungry.
