I think I became a bigger fan of this place after trying their shrimp and crab ceviche. Simply amazing!!!! I could order bowls of this stuff (something I think I do during their happy hour since its half off) and be content with that. Their shortrib cheese crisp with avocados was equally as delish. Great flavor to the short ribs. Had their guacamole and it was wonderful again, seems to be pretty consistent. Same thing with their white peach hibiscus margarita. I could literally drink 10 of these things which will get me into trouble at some point I am sure. Blanco has great food and fun atmosphere with a hip and trendy vibe. Even the hubby enjoyed the food even though this is not his type of place. Try it, you will be a fan too   :)
