This place actually uses fresh lime juice in the margaritas and that is exactly why I keep coming here. They also have a great happy hour at the bar.  I never can believe how cheap my bill is when I pay.  During HH, a chicken quesadilla, a margarita, and a 25% tip gets me out the door for less than a 20. Not bad!
