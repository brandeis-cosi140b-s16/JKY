So coming back!  No snobbery here. Everyone was polite and gave us great service. The food was delicious. Ordered the braised pork tacos and my hubs had the carne asado burrito. The chips were just the right salty and the salsa was full of flavor and not extremely spicy.  Definitely coming back to try other food on their menu plus I'll bring friends.
