I have been to Blanco several times. Everything about it is good, and nothing is extraordinary. The atmosphere is open and can be a bit loud. The food is consistent. I have not sat at the bar, which is open and looks fun.  They have a wide variety of tequilas.  It's all about what you are looking for.  Blanco is a pleasant experience but not the first place on my list for great Mexican food in the Scottsdale area.
