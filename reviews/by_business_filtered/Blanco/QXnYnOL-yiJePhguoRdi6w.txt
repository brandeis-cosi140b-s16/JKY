I went to Blanco with some girlfriends on Saturday. The Margaritas and Guacamole we had were pretty awesome- white peach & hibiscus marg is where it's at! I am not going to lie though, I was not impressed with our entrees. We each got the tacos and they were pretty small- & in my opinion, overpriced. We had a cute waiter though so that made our experience even better. I'm sure I will be returning to Blanco at some point in the future.
