Best service I have had in a LONG time! Holy amazing is what this staff is. Our food arrived in less than 15 minutes of ordering, the drinks were prompt and our waitress checked on us the perfect amount of times. And the food was amazing too! Dinner and dessert - both amazing. I really dig this place and hope to hit it up soon again. I can't stress how fantastic the staff were!
