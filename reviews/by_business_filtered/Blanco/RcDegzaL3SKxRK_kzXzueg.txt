A mixed gathering of "January" Birthdays.  About 16 of us were quickly seated. Drinks were a little slow...but there were a bunch of us all at once.  Orders taken.  Here's the issue:  I ordered a Kobe Steak Burrito with NO Pico De Gallo and then reiterated....NO onion, NO tomato, NO Pico.  Waiter asked how I would like it cooked. " Well Done please" (being I actually had E Coli about 12 years ago and was hospitalized). 

Food comes in a timely manner.  I cut my burrito in half and take a bite. Literally "raw".  Im not a BBQ master...so I asked around.  We decided that is was extremely Rare and the opposite of Well Done.

Waiter came and he was upset with the kitchen as he should be. Roughly 5 minutes go by and a lady with dark longer curly hair (I assume a manger) brings another burrito.  Cut it open to investigate....meat is Well Done.... but it is full of Pico and Tomato and Onion.

Same guy waiter takes it back and we asked to not have the cooks spit in are third shot. Ha ha...though we were serious.

Third burrito comes and it is as ordered.

WE THEN GET THE CHECK AND THE BURRITO IS NOT COMP'd NOR DID THEY OFFER A COMP'd BEER, APPETIZER OR GIFT CERT FOR "Next Time".

There is no next time. 

....Hmmmmm.  I like Yelp.
