I went to the Blanco Tacos in Tucson when it first opened, and really enjoyed it.  It was more of a casual eatery in a in the back of an upscale shopping center in North Tucson, so I was happy when I heard that one was opened in Scottsdale.  I have eaten at the Scottsdale location on several occasions, and kept putting off writing a review of it, simply because I didn't know what to make of it. Being in Scottsdale, this is, of course, not as casual or as relaxed place as the other.  The food is similar, but the atmosphere is quite different.

The decor is very chic, as are all Fox concept restaurants, and it was well accented with the natural wood and whitewashed ceiling.  They also have a nice outside patio. 

The service varies. I have even had it change on me in the same meal.  We once had a shift change during our meal, - the first server couldn't have been more cheerful and attentive, and the second server was just the opposite.  Not rude or incompetent - just indifferent.
 
And speaking of indifferent, that is their food.  Nothing to rave about, and nothing to complain about.  I have had their entrees, and the best that can be said is that it is good, americanized  mexican food..  That is -  bland, and boring. It is a little pricier than similar mexican but this is the Borgata, so I am sure rent is a little higher.  

So even though I like their decor and the people watching, I have little desire to go back for their food.  But I do like their chips, salsa and beer.  So when the better half is shopping, I get my exercise by walking to Blanco's and having their chips and salsa, and of course a the inevitable bottle (or two) of Dos Equis.
