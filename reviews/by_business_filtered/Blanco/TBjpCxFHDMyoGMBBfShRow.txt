Was really expecting more based reviews and what friends were saying about Blanco but really its pretty much just OK.

Food was OK... not bad, but nothing that got me excited. Service was just under OK which I find to be pretty standard at Fox restaurants. On the plus side the decor is pretty nice and it is a nice atmosphere to dine in. 

Not sure I would go back.
