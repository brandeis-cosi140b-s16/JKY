Such a Disappointment! I love Fox Restaurants so I was uber excited to finally check this place out. We started with the Guacamole. It looked amazing but was bland and flavorless. I ordered the ahi tacos and they were "meh". Now my guy and I LOVE desserts but were so disappointed with what we had.. why bother hitting a disappointing trifecta? Great decor, great service, boring flavorless food.
