I like the atmosphere at Blanco, but I really wasn't impressed by the food. I had the ahi tacos and for $13, I could have had a better tacos at a local hole-in-the-wall mexican joint. If you're looking to start your night off with drinks before hitting the town id recommend.

$50 for two entrees and two draft beers, no thanks.
