I went here with the BF tonight for restaurant week and honestly.... it was not that awesome. The space is very nice looking and open, which was probably the best part of the night. We shared some guac... and it was fine... not overly flavorful, but not bad or inedible... I had the short rib enchiladas and they were also ok. The short rib was good, but the sauce did not add anything to it. The beans were bland and the rice was waaay too buttery. The BF had the chicken tacos, which he liked, but I thought it was at about the same level as chilis.... nothing special. We had the tres leches cake and it was really dry for supposedly being a tres leches cake.... It kinda tasted like a dry carrot cake with milk around it. Not awesome. I would not come back here, but the food isn't really worth the money in my opinion.
