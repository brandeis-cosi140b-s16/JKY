Loved the atmosphere and the food, and we're picky about both!
We had the fajitas and chopped salad, both were awesome. Chips and salsa were also great. The openness of the place made it seem cozy even with 5 million people around. Gets busy, but is nice. Waitstaff was courteous and kind, not fake.Would go there again in a heartbeat!
