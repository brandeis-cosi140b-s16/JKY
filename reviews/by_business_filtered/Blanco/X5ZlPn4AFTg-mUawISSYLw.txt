Being a native Arizonan its hard not to succumb to the ever lasting call of sweet sweet Mexican food, And let me tell you Blanco quenches this ever lasting thirst brilliantly! At least for the next few hours! The quality of the beef is fantastic! I mean to die for! The enchiladas are fantastico! I think Blaco even compares to the classic choices in town like Jordan's and ajo als. If you're looking to satisfy your rampant Mexican food addiction, look no further.
