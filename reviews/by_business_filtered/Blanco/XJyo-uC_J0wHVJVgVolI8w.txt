Amazing service tonight. I had a little issue with my dish, nothing major. But the chef literally came to the table, shook our hands, apologized and then insisted we had a flan on him. Which might I add is AMAZING. Between our outstanding server Matthew and Chef Alex I was very impressed with Blanco and will definitely be back again soon. Get the flan you will not regret it!!
