This place was good but it's not a cheap authentic Mexican meal.  The chips were thick & not warm or salty so they were not that good & I had they chicken enchilada with verde (green) sauce & they were just ok. They also use a smll iron skillet to layer their corn tortillas, chicken cheese & sauce almost like a mini lasagna instead of rolled flour tortilla enchiladas. The black beans were ok & the boyfriend was disappointed with their rice ("tasteless") & their smoky salsa & the grilled corn was way underdone. We each had 1 import beer no apps or guac & our bill was over $60. Seems pretty touristy & hipster
