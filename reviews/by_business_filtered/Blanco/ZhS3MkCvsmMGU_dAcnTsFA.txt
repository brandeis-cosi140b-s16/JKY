After a couple of years we decided to try this place again. Service from hostess and waitress was very good. Kitchen seemed quite slow. Wine list is reasonably priced with adequate selection. My wife loved the tortilla soup.  I notice last time we reviewed she didn't.  She disliked the chopped salad though couldn't define the problem.  We have always liked it before. I had nachos with short rib. The cheese sauce was a strange consistency, with an unusual chili taste. The meat was ok but the overall taste was not good. I got halfway through. In the past the food seemed better. I am not trained in culinary arts and my professional writing isn't as a reviewer but we go to lots of restaurants. I feel there was a problem yesterday. We like Fox restaurants so don't understand.
