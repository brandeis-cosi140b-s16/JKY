Love this place for a drink and appetizers on the patio.   Tried the Carne Asada Burrito for dinner last week and it was bland.  For $14 I expect a burrito that is a lot better that what I can pick up at Roberto's.  I would easily rank a Roberto's or Los Flav's Carne Asada Burrito way above this pocket gouging tortilla.
