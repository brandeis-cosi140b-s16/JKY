I LOVE this place. The burritos are the best ones I have ever had - and are completely original. Black beans with all sorts of squash, spinach, corn, etc. 

I am a really picky eater and they are always happy and willing to take out the things I don't like (pico de gallo, ew!). The first time I ever went to this restaurant, our waitress knew EVERY SINGLE INGREDIENT to that burrito and was extremely friendly.

 I definitely recommend going during the day, though, because it gets crowded at night and a little loud. It also can turn a little "scottsdale/snobbsdale" at night, and this is coming from someone who lives here. Also the wait time can be pretty terrible sometimes.

Either way, I wouldn't skip this place! I love it.
