Allow me to be an asshole for a moment while I write this terrible review. Maybe its because it was Monday, and raining.. maybe it was because I was in the mood for Humble Pie and not Mexican grill.. maybe its because restaurants in Arizona don't have the freshest sea food in the United States of America, whatever it was, I hated this place. 

I have this habit of asking my server what their favorite thing on the menu is.. and usually I go with it. I am adventurous, I like surprises.. So homegirl suggested the nachos or the Seared Ahi tacos.. so what do I do? I ordered a taco plate. Since I like variety, I mixed and matched and went with a fish & pork taco with black beans. The Ahi tasted wicked old and nasty fishy. I almost spit it out, but I am a lady and that is rude. The pork was very undercooked.. I don't know about you, but I have absolutely no interest in catching Trichinosis. I can think of better ways to spend my day than with nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, fatigue, fever, and abdominal discomfort.. sorry those are not things I am interested in, thanks anyway though. Beans were served cold and I swear the rice they served was something out a box from the dollar store. My dog could make better rice than that. There was shit floating in my water and the limes I asked for were so dried out that not one drop of juice came out. Seriously? Cut up some fresh ones.. its the little things that count. 

Service was slow, but the chick was nice enough. One of the girls I went with knew one of the managers, who was supposed to hook us up with an employee discount, but conveniently forgot about us at the end.. but what are you gonna do, nothing is free anymore. 

I dunno, I just wasn't impressed. The only thing I dug about this joint were the tiles on the wall.. and im certainly not going to return to a place to stare at a wall. 

next!
