This place was nice.  Food had good flavor good atmosphere as well.  Didn't try the tacos. Had a burrito.  I don't think it was worth 14 though.  Close but not quite.  Black beans are awesome. 

Tried the white peach and hibiscus marg. GROSS. Tasted like I was drinking a flower.  Waaaaay to much hibiscus not enough white peach.  Took a while to get the flower taste out of my mouth.
