Our experience here was AMAZING!!! 
For starters, we had great service! The waitress knew the menu and was able to answer our questions with confidence. She was very attentive and prompt. 

We ordered:
-Mango jalape√±o margarita, it was so so and not spicy. The sparkling Sangria was like club soda and juice bleh.
-Appetizer - Braised beef cheese crisp with avocado - OMG so good!!! I don't have words. Wish I didn't have to share!
-Entree's 
- Braised short rib enchiladas with all rice, so much meat and so delectable. I do wish they topped it with shredded lettuce to add a cool and crisp crunch to the cauldron of goodness.
Chicken mole - Amazing. Large portion definitely a shareable dish. Tortillas are mackin! 
Fish tacos grilled - good, but not amazing.
BBQ pork tacos - same as the cheese crisp but add an extra OMG... Seriously! I want to eat those pickled onions by the jar!

Noteworthy - We were visiting from out of town (SoCal) so this is by no means a testament to consistency. Also this was our first cheese crisp and are definitely NOT experts on all things cheese crisp. 

4.5 stars because we were disappointed in the booze. 

Thanks for the experience Blanco, we'll be back!
