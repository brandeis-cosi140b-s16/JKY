I just love this place. Casual atmosphere so great hang out place. Music isn't too loud allowing for great conversation. Windows are open making it like one big patio. Alex and Chelsey have been very friendly, quick with our orders and very knowledgeable in their recommendations. One of my friends has never been here and they were quite helpful. I've always had great service here  

Their guacamole is amazing. A definite must-order. Their food is very good for the price. I'm a fan of their tortilla soup and flan as well. 

Margaritas? Great! Today I had the Blood Oranje and the Peach Hibiscus. Both great. They put a monthly special out too. This month is cinnamon vanilla. Sounds odd but very tasty leaving a sweet vanilla aftertaste in your mouth. 

I recommend Blanco to a lot of foodsies and friends and will continue to do so.
