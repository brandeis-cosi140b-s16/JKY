Another great Fox Restaurant - Blanco has really good tacos, salads, and appetizers. I was bummed when they stopped serving my favorite menu item, the Ahi Tacos, but the grilled fish tacos are a good back-up choice. If you're not that hungry, you can split the tacos and they will bring 4 mini tacos instead of three (so two each) and a smaller portion of the side dishes. 

The tortilla soup is also one of my favorite things to order on cooler days.  And it's really good if you add avocado to the soup!
