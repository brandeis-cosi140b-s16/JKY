This place is fine. Average. Nothing spectacular. But not remotely authentic either, like most of Sam Fox's restaurants. They're all absolutely satisfactory, but if you are looking to be blown away by flavorful and inventive dishes, go somewhere else, cuz it aint gonna happen here.

Went Sunday night for restaurant week with 5 of my friends, and I will say we were blown away by the amount of food they give you for $19 a person. I plowed through my fair share of chips and salsa, which was pretty bland I'll add and was stuffed halfway through my first course.

The decor of the restaurant was cute. I couldn't believe how massive the bar was though! Apparently this is the place to go if you are a tequila drinker. Dozens and dozens of different brands/flavors of tequila. Sadly I am not a tequila so this aspect was entirely wasted on me. I did however have a White Peach & HIbiscus flavored margarita which was sweet but delightful. I would like to point out though that at $9, this margarita cost almost 50% of what my 3 course restaurant week menu did. 

Out of all the dishes that I tasted, the tortilla soup was by far the winner of the appetizers, the 3 bites that I could get down of my Shrimp Fajitas were actually pretty tasty, and everyone was pleased with their desserts minus a few moldy raspberries that were thrown on my friend's Tres Leches cake...ick. That said, pretty much the entire restaurant and kitchen staff came over and apologized for said raspberry so the rebound and recovery was nice.

Probably wouldn't go back unless someone else really wanted to and they of course were paying for all of my $9 margaritas, but if you wanted a safe, non-spicy, Scottsdale-version of a Mexican restaurant to take your parents or other out of town guests, this should certainly fit your bill.
