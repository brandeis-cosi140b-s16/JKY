We went to Blanco's recently and showed up at 6:15pm.  Got a pager and was told it would take 25 minutes.  Since the bar was full we went across to J Alexander's for drinks (awesome bar).  5 minutes later we get paged.  The rest of our party isn't here yet.  The hostess states that just come back and we'll put you at the top.  We do come back and well we are put at the bottom of the list and don't sit until 8:00 pm.  My patience only goes so far, and fortunately the manager was very accomodating and took a good chunk off our meal.  The food and service were exceptional, but waiting 2 hrs for a table when there were other open tables wasn't.  And yes, there was a significant amount of the pretentious crowd.  I originally thought our neglect was racial in nature.  If the food and service wasn't as good, the rating would've fallen significantly.
