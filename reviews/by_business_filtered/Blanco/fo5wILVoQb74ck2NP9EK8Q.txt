Like most Fox concepts, Blanco is pretty good. I'm not rushing to come back any time soon (mainly because there is so much Mexican food in much closer proximity to my house), but I would be a repeat eater. 

The food was pretty good - but not memorable. I really liked the chips and salsa and the guac. The veggie tacos were also very good. The chopped salad was good. The tuna tacos kind of meh. Good. And meh. So why the 4 stars? 

Blow jobs! Well, almost. I think.

I was so impressed by the service. The hosts, waiters and managers were so attentive and friendly. Like, over-the-top friendly and giddy. Almost flirty. I'm sure if I was a dude they would have blown me or something. Next time I'm bringing a guy with me to test this theory. Anyone want to particpate in an experiment?
