I've always thought pretty highly of most of the Fox Restaurant Concepts, and Blanco is no exception.  Although I've never had very great service here (kind of slow and unattentive), everything I've had on the menu has been excellent and they have a longer-than-normal beer list, too.  The prices of everything are especially fair, considering the quality of food.

I think Blanco is a particularly good spot for groups.  The atmosphere always seems to be buzzing, and they have large enough spaces to bring several tables together.
