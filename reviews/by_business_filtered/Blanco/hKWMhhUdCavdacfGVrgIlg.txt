I went for happy hour and was pleased with the food and service.  I agree with some of the past reviews that the food is nothing special.  The guac was good, but I prefer the Guac at the Mission.  There is something special about it made at your table with your choice of spice.  The fish tacos were average.  The ceviche was good.  The service was great.  Our server was very friendly and attentive.  Always checking in on us and offering additional drinks.
