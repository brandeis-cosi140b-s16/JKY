Went to Blanco for our 3rd restaurant week meal. Been here before and it's great.  the hostess really was having a bad night and just needed to go home. Not one smile or even a hello. When we walked in just a blank stare. Great! (sarcasm)  Food and service were otherwise really good.   I had the green chile pork enchiladas and I love a good tomatillo sauce. The tres de leche cake was also wonderful!  It's kind of loud place and we got to hear the conversation about blow jobs from the table next to us.
