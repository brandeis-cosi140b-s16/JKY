As I write this review I wonder if I need to re-evaluate my rating system.  I find Blanco a solid "average", so why 4 stars instead of 3?  I honestly couldn't tell you, except for the fact that I find myself going here so ofter for simple, clean, consistent food, that they MUST be more than 3 stars.  Right??
