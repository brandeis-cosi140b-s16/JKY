I was at Blanco earlier this evening to do some Friday unwinding with co-workers after a VERY long week.  We arrived around 7:45pm--the place was hopping and there was a 45 minute wait for a 6-person table (a good sign on a Friday night).  Luckily, upon asking the hostess about the bar situation, we found out there was open seating with a full food menu on the patio!  We snagged a great spot and surrendered our buzzer.

The patio was fantastic with great people watching and ridiculously comfortable chairs--would be a great place for day drinking.  Overall I dig the atmosphere/music/decor of this place, as well as the people and energy.  We decided it was like Sapporo but in Old Town and with Mexican food.  

Our food was decent, I won't crave it but would order the green chile enchiladas again.  The salmon ceviche appetizer was probably the best thing that we ordered all night.  My one drink and one glass of water were also tasty (I asked for more water that never came, and I was not offered a second drink so it was a short night in the fluids department).  

Assuming they fix their confusion with the serving situation, I would go back here again for sure.
