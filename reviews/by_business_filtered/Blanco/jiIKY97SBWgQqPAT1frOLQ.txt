So I gave the Blanco in Tucson a less than favorable review, yet at the same time I couldn't wait for this one to open. Sure, I miss Taneko Tavern, and all of its sake covered glory. At the same time Fox RC always opens up clean, safe-bet, fun restaurants and Blanco is no exception.

The restaurant is brightly colored, with loud lounge like music, and an overall buzzy feeling atmosphere, even if the uniforms make me feel like I am at a frat house. I wouldn't come here looking for innovative Mexican cuisine, because Blanco serves a very American style of cuisine, but with tortillas. They have an obvious American atmosphere, that makes me immediately think of the spa crowd coming here before or after their treatments or in between shopping stops. You'll also see a lot of older folks that come from Paradise Valley around lunchtime or for mid-day drinks. Hey, if you don't have to work, then why not drink your day away on $12 margaritas, right?

The salsa is a sweet, almost candy like substance that goes very well with their grease puff tortilla chips that are glistening-golden brown. Their menu features 8-10 different tacos, all available on either soft white corn tortillas, or yellow corn fried shells. My favorites are the steak and ahi tuna, both full of flavor ($12) and plentiful for a meal that doesn't make you feel like you overate. They also have several entrees which feature steak, seafood, and chicken between $14 and $22 which I have only sampled a couple, both very satisfying. 

I've never gone into Blanco craving Mexican food, expecting Mexican food, or telling my guests they are going to get Mexican food. It's always been well received by those who I have brought here, and always a fun place to be for a couple of drinks on a busy Friday night. Seriously, the name is Blanco, Spanish for white. Shouldn't that be a dead give away this is American food?
