I enjoy this restaurant...its not the best, but its a nice environment and the service is really nice and the food is pretty good...I would definitely go back because I enjoy it...
I really like the blood orange margarita...I am one of those ppl that like a sweet drink...so it was perfect for me!! The mojito is great too!  If I were coming here just for the drinks I would give it 5 stars.  They are fabulous! The chips and salsa is great, but I love chips and salsa.  
I have had the carnita tacos and they were decent...I enjoyed them but I have had better!  
It is a good restaurant.
