Happy hour until 6pm on a Saturday?! Yes, this place is amazing. I was thoroughly impressed by the happy hour prices and selection. The chips and dip on happy hour was by far the best value for the money and so delicious. Loved the atmosphere- trendy and classy but not fancy and definitely not a party restaurant. Entrees were good but not amazing or particularly special. But shout out to our awesome waiter Fletcher. You were incredible. Very attentive, down to earth and nice. One of the best waiters I have ever encountered.
