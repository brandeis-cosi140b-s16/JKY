I meet a client for dinner and drinks. I was greeted by a Hostess who stated it would be a 30-40 minute wait. I wasn't given an option to order drinks or appetizer. Never the less, my client showed up 10 minutes late and we were seated 5 minutes later. It took our servers 5-10 minutes to greet us and order drinks. Our server was training someone that NIGHT. She suggested beef tacos and burrito and I LOVED IT TO DEATH!!! I almost LICKED my plate. drinks were GREAT!! The Chef sent me a few dishes to TRY and it was awesome. SERVICE wasn't the greatest but the FOOD made the difference. I need to get back there soon!!
