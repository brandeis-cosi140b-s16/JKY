We came here on a night in search for desert. When Blanco's first opened up they had the most amazing, flavorful, savory tres
Leches cake. I would even hop on by and order it for take out because it was so delish. Since I sold my date on this cake we walked on over and were disappointed to hear they no longer carried it on the menu. WHAAAAT! 
We settled for the sopapillas but to be honest they lacked the pizzaz. Won't go back to Blanco's for desert.. But will just for a margarita!
