Overall, this place was pretty good. The cheese crisps are tasty and something unique to order - either as your meal or as an app (it 's like a medium sized pizza). 

For my main dish I had shrimp tacos. I got them in a soft shell, though, and they were impossible to eat. Next time, I'd get a hard shell. 

The service was a little sub-par.
