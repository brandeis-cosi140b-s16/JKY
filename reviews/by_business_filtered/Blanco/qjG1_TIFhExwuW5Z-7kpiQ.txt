My husband and I enjoyed a fabulous Father' Day dinner tonight!  First time we have been to this restaurant and we will definitely be back!

Our server, Tony, was outstanding, and made our total experience wonderful and was refreshing when customer service is lacking in most establishments today.

The chips and salsa were amazing and the habanero salsa is a MUST ask for.  I had the tacos and was pleased that when I couldn't make up my mind because they all sounded so good, that I could mix and match.  I ordered the crispy shrimp, carne asada and the BBQ tacos.  They were all delicious but the BBQ was my favorite (and I can see why it is award winning).  My husband ordered the short ribs burrito and it was incredible.  The beans and rice were pretty good, but I was too full from the tacos and chips.  

We are so glad we found a new local restaurant.
