I have been to Blancos a couple times and have always had a good experience. The hostess' are always smiling and I was seated right away. The servers are all very nice and good at what they do. Now the food, It is Amazing! I have gotten the chicken tacos and they are delicious! The margarita's are great as well. The restaurant is clean and always full of patrons when I go there. Blanco's is by far my favorite Mexican restaurant in the Scottsdale area! I will be coming back here again and again!
