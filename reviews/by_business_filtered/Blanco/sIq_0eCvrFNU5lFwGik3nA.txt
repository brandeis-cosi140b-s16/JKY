Well, I guess like many have said this is a Fox restaurant so you get a very nice atmosphere.  I think I remember a quote from Mr. Fox that (and I'm paraphrasing) a dinner out isn't about the food, it's about the experience.
By that standard Mr. Fox did well with Blanco.  I personally think the food is a big part of the experience, I could even argue it's the biggest part.  Not that the food was awful by any means but I wasn't really blown away by any of it.  Machaca tacos were okay, buttered rice was simple enough but hardly Mexican, ceviche was alright.  Are you noticing a trend here?
Motto of the story kids, is that I'll trade the foo-foo surroundings and high Borgata prices for a dump off 19th Ave. someplace and the food is killer.
I don't think I'll head back here any time soon I'm afraid.
