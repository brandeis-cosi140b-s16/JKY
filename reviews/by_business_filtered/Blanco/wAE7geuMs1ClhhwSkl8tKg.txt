My wife and I went here based on the recommendation of the housekeeper at our hotel on a Friday night.

No reservation so we were asked to wait for 20 minutes.   No problem..walked over to the bar and a margaritas later we were ready to be seated.   Got a seat adjacent to the bar and the bartender waited on us.   She did a great job too.

The margaritas were very good -- nice and tart and didn't skimp on the booze.   The salsa and chips was very tasty.   The chips are thick and crunchy and nicely salted.  The salsa is smoky and thick and has nice bite.   We also ordered some guacamole and boy that was delicious!    You get a huge portion.  Very fresh too.  We could have made a meal of that alone.

For entrees I had the shrimp fajitas which I really enjoyed.    They came with corn tortillas and black beans (very good too).   The shrimp were plump and in a spicy sauce.   I liked everything about this meal.

My wife had the fish tacos though and came away disapointed.  Average was her description.    She did love though the flan / fruit she had for dessert.

The servers did a great job too.    We would definitely eat here again.
