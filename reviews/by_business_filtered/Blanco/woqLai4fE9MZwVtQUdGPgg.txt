A Modern Mexican restaurant with an upscale atmosphere - I like it... 

Three of us had the privilege of dining here last Saturday. The drinks, the service, and the unusual food were all outstanding. The prices are very fair as well...

Great location with several other "walking-distance" choices if they are too busy (J Alexander's, Fogo De Chow, El Torito, Flemmings, Quilted Bear). Close to Old Town for nightlife too...

Good luck Blanco!
