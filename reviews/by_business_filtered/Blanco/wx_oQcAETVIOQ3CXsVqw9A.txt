Visited Blanco for the first time for a work happy hour get-together. There were about 15 of us but we made reservations so we got a great table right by the bar.  

We ordered a few rounds of drinks and some guacamole to go with the chips and salsa. I had a peach margarita in a sugar-rimmed glass. It was really yummy and they did not skimp on the alcohol! The chips, salsa and guacamole were also really good. The guacamole had huge chunks of fresh avocado in it, which I really enjoyed - you could tell this was not out a can!

The whole time our server was super attentive. Our water glasses and chip bowls were always full, and he was constantly on top of making sure we had enough drinks without being pushy. Juggling a table this big can be tricky but we felt very taken care of the whole time.

If you have a big group, Blanco is very accommodating. I didn't get to try dinner but I would love to go back and try some of their tacos.
