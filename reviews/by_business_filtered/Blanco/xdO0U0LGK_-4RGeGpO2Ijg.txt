My wife & I love this place. We have earl ten here many times (we just moved out of Arizona). 

I get the Burritos(steak or chicken) and my wife loves a few of the salads.

I knock off one star because I am slightly disappointed in their lack of alcohol selections. 

Oh yes, their white rice is amazing.
