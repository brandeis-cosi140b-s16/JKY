Delicious! I was a little worried because it was so big and so loud, but once you're seated and your server quickly appears as your table and then just as quickly delivers two perfect margaritas, all fears diminish. 

The vibe here is definitely boisterous--lots of groups and the music is notched up. But the space is laid out well, with two levels of dining room and a combination of tables and high tops. The effect is such that you feel like you're in a happening place, but you can also have a conversation with your tablemates. 

We kept is simple; chips with guacamole--perfect--and we each had a taco selection. This is fun, because you get to choose the tacos that you want. We ended up with six different kinds: carnitas, shrimp, bbq chicken, beef, veg. All were delicious. They are small--so if you're really hungry, you might be a little disappointed on the size. But each one is perfectly prepared and really tasty.
