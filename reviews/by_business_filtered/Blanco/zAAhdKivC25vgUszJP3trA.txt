My friends and I ordered here for the first time, and we ordered our meal as take out. We called ahead and the woman on the phone was extremely pleasant. She transferred us to another guy who took our order, he was also extremely polite and professional. And said that our order would take about 20 min.

In 20 min, we walked up to the bar and were greeted and helped out. I ordered the slow cooked BBQ tacos and the portobello and vegetable cheese crisp. They were both extraordinarily delicious. Even as a take out, the cheese crisp was crispy. It's like of like a pizza or flatbread, but way crispier. My meal also came with black beans and rice, as well as chips and fresh salsa. Very pleased with this place.
