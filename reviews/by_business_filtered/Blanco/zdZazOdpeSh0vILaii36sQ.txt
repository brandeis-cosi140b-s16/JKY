i'm a fan of sauce, north and some of the other fox restaurants because they have genuinely good food for a reasonable price and the restaurants are, in typical fox fashion, hip and easy on the eyes. i like that. blanco was no exception ... i adore the wood wall and tile work. i loved my white peach and hibiscus margarita. i loved the chips and salsa ... the chips reminded me of many trips to mexico ... they're very similar to the super yummy chips served down there. i did not love my seared ahi tacos. they were really fishy and the mango salsa was almost non-existent. it was too bad, because they really look beautiful on the plate. i wasn't super stoked about the rice, which was literally soaked in butter. the black beans were yummy. others at my table got the enchiladas, and i wish i had too. those enchiladas looked a lot better than my tacos tasted. our server was sweet, smart and encouraged us to modify menu items to our taste. there was definitely an arrogance in their prices because what you get for what you pay is pretty pathetic, but i guess you have to pay your rent in the borgata somehow. 3 stars for blanco. i really hoped for more.
