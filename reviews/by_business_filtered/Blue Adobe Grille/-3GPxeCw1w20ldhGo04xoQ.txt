First time, here.

Good, family type vibe.

Cuisine of New Mexico comes to Arizona.

Crab Cake appetizer was just OK. Calamari steak appetizer was AWESOME.

Top shelf margaritas were weak. Short of tequila.

3 of us for dinner.

1 HUGE order of beatiful ribs.

1 combo of beef taco, chicken enchilada, and pork tamale.

1 combo of pork tamale and chili rellano.

The pork tamales were some of the best I've ever had.

All the mains and sides were great.  Red & green salsas, of course, New Mexico.

Solid, friendly service.

This appears to be a place for locals. I was happy to find it. I'll be back.
