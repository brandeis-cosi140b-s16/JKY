What a gem of a find! My husband and I and 2 of our friends were in the mood for Mexican the other night and found this place on Yelp. Wish we would have arrived sooner, as we were "those people" who showed up 20 minutes before closing and our wait staff seemed to be justifiably irked. Even with that said, we were well taken care of and our meals were delicious!
This gem is in an old A framed Village Inn. Completely remodeled inside with lots of dark stained wood tables and beams and exposed brick. Very cozy and inviting atmosphere!
They have daily specials written on chalk boards all around the restaurant and their menu is chalk full of delicious offerings ranging from your standard Mexican and New Mexican fare along with many seafood choices, pastas and burgers! My friend and I both had the Layered Enchiladas. I had mine with the green chile and chicken, he had it with red and green chile, chicken and an egg on top. Both were served with rice and beans. All of it was very tasty and enough spice to keep me reaching for my Prickly Pear margarita!
My husband had the Taos Combo, consisting of a honey smoked pork tamale, shrimp enchilada and tenderloin relano. He said it had a kick but all the flavors were amazing! My other friend had the Lobster Tamales, she said the raspberry chipotle made that dish! We all shared a pitcher of the Prickly Pear margaritas which were also refershing and delicious! 
Their prices are fantastic and portions are perfect! Can't wait to go back again! (earlier next time) and try a seafood dish! Their breakfast looks really good too!
4 stars are based on the full experience, granted it was our fault for getting their right before close, but the wait staff should have been a bit more friendly. Don't think any of them smiled and they barely spoke to us. We weren't rushed, I just felt regardless of our timing, they should have been a bit warmer in reception.
