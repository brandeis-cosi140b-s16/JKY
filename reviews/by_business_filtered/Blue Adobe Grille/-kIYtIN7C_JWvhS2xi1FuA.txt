We like Blue Adobe and have visited both locations numerous times.  The Scottsdale location is close to home.   Love to support the locals and these guys make it easy.  Their wait staff is always attentive and friendly.  It seems to be well run with management very involved, you can tell the difference.

Chips & salsa are favorites, although don't fill up (like I usually do) because you'll want to experience the main course.  My special favorites are crab cake tacos - yum!  Great sauce that goes on them, sometimes just not quite enough sauce.  Also some great soups - both Pork Posole & Chicken Corn Chowder are especially good.  We've tried their $10 specials (each night something different), most recently the blue seafood enchiladas.  As I said, I tend to fill up on the chips & salsa so half of this went home w/ me.  I was a little surprised but thought it was even better the next day. 

New Mexican cuisine is a nice change from the traditional.  Blue Adobe does it right.
