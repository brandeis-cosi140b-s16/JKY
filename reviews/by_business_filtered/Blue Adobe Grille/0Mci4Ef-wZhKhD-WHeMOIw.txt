I gave Blue Adobe Grille another try on Sun 11/17/13.  This time, they were not nearly as busy, we got seated immediately and the service was great.  The great thing about Sundays is that all the daily specials are available so all three of us ordered from the specials menu at $10 each and as usual, the food was spectacular.
