Awesome restaurant!! Today was my first time to visit this wonderful New Mexican joint tucked away in NE Scottsdale. The service was amazing and the staff was very friendly. The Adovada and Salsa is the best I've had in AZ so far. The place had nice ambiance with a wonderful sweet mesquite aroma. The restaurant was clean and I would love to go back during happy hour and dinner.
