While I'm typically not a big Mexican food fan, Blue Adobe definitely won me over.  It was a beautiful night to dine outdoors and Blue Adobe had a spacious outdoor dining area.  

Our appetizers with guacomole and lobster dip were pretty good although I would agree that the chips are greasy.  My lobster tomale was really yummy and unique.   

I'd definitely go back!
