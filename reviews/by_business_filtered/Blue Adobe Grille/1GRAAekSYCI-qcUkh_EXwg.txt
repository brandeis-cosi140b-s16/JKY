Our lunch here was really delicious! The abodabo was tender and flavorful without being overly spicy. The tamale was excellent and the multi colored chips and salsa also really good. The waitress was friendly and helpful in guiding us to less spicy choices. We didn't have margaritas, but are always happy to find Dos Equis amber on tap.
