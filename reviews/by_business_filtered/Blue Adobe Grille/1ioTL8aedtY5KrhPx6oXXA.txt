My wife and I are in town to visit our son. We're not real familiar with the area. So after getting on yelp and look around I found The Blue Adobe. 
It was conveniently located two blocks from where we are staying. 
We made reservations for 5 and were promptly seated. We had to wait a little bit for our son Cz he just got off work and was making his way to where we were. I got a little impatient Cz I felt we were just taking up space that could be used for other customers. But the server made us feel right at home and told us not to worry. Our son finally arrived and we ordered. 
This place is remarkable. The interior decor isn't tacky or blah. But tastefully done with menu suggestions around the establishment. Even in the restroom. 
I ordered the ancho chili rubbed ribs. Wow this plate straight up rocked. The meat was so tender and flavorful. It came with salad and cornbread that had green chili in it. I couldn't say enough abt the dish to the server. Which by the way the service was excellent. It's a shame I don't live here. Because I would be here all the time. Especially since they have TV's for Sunday football! So if ur in the area be sure and eat here. U will not be disappointed.
Well I feel the need to update this review. Being that our room is so close to the restaurant. We decided to eat dinner here again. I had the Carne Avodada. This dish was excellent. But what I need to add that I forgot last night. Was that the service is kinda slow. Tonight was blatantly obvious. It wasn't that crowded. I even noticed how impersonal the server was. I commented twice how good the food was and the guy was stone faced. Seriously?  Idk maybe he don't like his job. But when u deal with customers. At least smile.
