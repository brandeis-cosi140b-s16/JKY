Great little place with excellent food and service. 

They use an ancho chile for some of their sauces and its just divine. My boyfriend and I typically go here after catching a few Spring Training Cubs games (there's only so many Old Style beers and hotdogs one can take-lol!) and its usually pretty busy. We almost always split two dishes, because we like variety and are always satisfied. 

Our "go to" dishes we split are the chile rellenos and/or The Land of Enchantment plate. 

Of course, you have to have a Prickly Pear margarita here too. A trip to the Southwest isn't complete without it! :)
