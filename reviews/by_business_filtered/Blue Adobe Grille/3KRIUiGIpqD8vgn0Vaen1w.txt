Blue Adobe catered the Toys for Tots Poker Tournament sponsored cStor and Larry Gentry. The food was amazing, the pork loins tender, the size of the shrimp outstanding with many condiments to make it even better The chipolte sauce had a great tangy taste. Also the mini chimichangas were great. The two gals there had smiling faces and kept the set up stocked. Can't wait to see this place for a meal in the restaurant.
