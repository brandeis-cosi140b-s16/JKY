Ok.. so I saw quite a few Blue Adobe to Dick's Hideaway comparisons in the reviews. Dick's Hideaway is my favorite Arizona Restaurant, so I had to give it a shot. I pulled into an empty parking lot.. not a good sign. Walked into an empty restaurant.. another bad sign. I was worried that maybe I had selected a dud for the date night I had set up with my fiance who was meeting me there. I sat down, and immediately ordered a carafe of margarita. Then I watched my server pour a shit load of booze into the carafe, before adding his other flavors.. a great sign! Pamela showed up, to a glass full of potent, and tasty margarita.. and some of the better chips and salsa I have had. 

Our waiter, who was awesome btw.. recommended the Carne Adovada Enchiladas. This is what I ordered. Pamela got the Oscar Medallion: A small steak with crab meat on top of it, served with pasta and asparagus.

My enchiladas were legit. Tender pork, delicious chili sauce. Cheesy, meaty, tortilla-y goodness. Highly recommended. Pamela's steak was perfectly cooked, and was butter knife slice able. The crab on top was a nice touch. The pasta however, was a real miss. It was a super limp, greasy mess on the plate. Very heavy.. not appetizing. Neither me, or my fiance cared for it. 

Back to the Margaritas. I am not big on margaritas. They sometimes give me heart burn. Blue Adobe Grille's Killer Margarita was great. That carafe got my chick drunk. It got me a little tipsy, and I can hold my own. It was tasty. Not too sour. Not too sweet. No chest pain.

I am not sure why this place was empty. My friend told me that when he had visited, it smelled like a mop and bucket inside. It smelled fine in there to me. I did notice complaining about his in other reviews though. Minus the pasta, my experience was awesome. I will be back to explore their very affordable menu. Maybe drink some margaritas, and watch he game at the bar-
