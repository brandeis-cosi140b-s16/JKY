Great dinner.  Good service.  Excellent food.  Clean restaurant.  We had a great family meal for six and a half.  The menu is filled with descriptive New Mexico food fare. Hard to choose just one.  Service was attentive.  Food was worth a little wait and obviously from scratch, made to order.  Perfect food delivery using position points and facing the entree at 6 o'clock , ladies first; not expected but well received.  Bathrooms cleaner than the one at home.  Sangria (red or white) and local Draft beer selection with Mexican classics.  No room for dessert.
