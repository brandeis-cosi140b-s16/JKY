This place rules.  The service is fast and friendly and the food is amazing.  Coming from Detroit, I was a little intimidated by the menu at first  because I had never seen half of what was on it.  The first time I went I ordered the salmon BLT which put me off when it arrived because it wasn't a sandwich at all.  Of course it ended up being one of the most delicious things I'd ever eaten and I have returned several times to try other dishes.

The wait staff are great and always take time to explain the menu to newcomers.  I've never waited more than a minute or two for a drink and the food flies out pretty fast as well (I guess it has to, this place is always packed for dinner).
