I went here tonight with the BF to use a Groupon.... what a disappointment! I had heard that this place was so good... but really.... not awesome. The chips and salsa were ok, but not anything too special. I started with the supposedly amazing corn chowder.... bland and the chicken in it had a weird texture. Not my cup of tea... or soup, as it were. I ordered the double stack pork adovado enchiladas 'christmas' style... with green and red sauce. Well.... I'm not sure if there was any sauce on it.... there certainly wasn't any spice, I thought it was New Mexican food? No flavor or spice here. The pork was ok.... but again, not very flavorful. The BF just got a cheese crisp. It was soggy, flavorless, and pathetic. If it is an old family recipe, as the menu claims.... that family is probably pretty boring. To top it all off, the service was sloooow. I will not be back, sorry guys!
