Blue Adobe is a great little find in Mesa.  I'd highly recommend to give the Carne Adovada and Blue Seafood Enchiladas a try.  They are both awesome and and have a unique flavor.  I typically end up here for work events; if you need to host some traveling guests and want to find an interesting place where you can still talk over dinner, this is a good spot.

Okay, I have to mention a few other dishes, give the Ancho Chile Rubbed Salmon a try if you like Salmon, it was so tender and really well seasoned last time I was in.  And for dessert try the Creme Brulee, I know this is one of those typical items, but it's pretty darn good here.  In fact, try everything on their menu, I could go on and on, so many solid interesting items, in good portions and with unique flavors.  This is a great little spot and will not disappoint.
