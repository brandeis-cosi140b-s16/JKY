This is a lively place for north east Scottsdale - of course one defines lively a bit different in Scottsdale where the old north east folks come to retire.  The sad thing is those folks don't have a pallet for spicy food, which is what Mexican or Southwestern Mexican food is all about. They think onions are spicy. 

Nevertheless, this place had flavorful food but it really does need the spice and bite to it to really give them a four star rating. 

I had tacos.  They were good, but not to die for. The beans were good as was the rice, but again not to die for. 

The bar tender was excellent, and on-the-ball-Johnny.  The restaurant felt a little jammed with tables, too jammed in fact. I felt like I was in NYC restaurant.  Perhaps that's where the owners come from, or Chicago. 

The place seemed clean and smelt fine.  The staff though was a bit asleep at the wheel as it took more than 5 minutes to get a menu and get attention. The bar tender finally made the move on me - not that kind of move!

He turned it around!  He's friendly and likable. 

I would do this place only because Mexican food in the area is difficult to find.
