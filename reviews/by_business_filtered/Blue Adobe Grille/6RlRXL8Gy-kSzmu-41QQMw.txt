My mom and I just happened to be on this side of town and were in need of a good dinner. My husband had brought home some food for me to try from here in the past, so I couldn't wait to try it out. The food was amazing. As soon as you walk in you smell the fire going and you just know that this food is going to be different than every other place out there. Just one look at the menu and we knew that we were in for a treat. The food exceeded our expectations, and we will be back to try more items!
