One of the best kept secrets of restaurants in Scottsdale I think. (everyone loves old town too much) but here....live bands play regularly, food is terrific ( I don't drink so I don't know about that) but the beef chimichangas are TO DIE FOR!!! No joke. Warning: They are HUGE so probably should split it with a friend. Or better yet let your friend get their own and you will both have delicious left overs for the next day! Also, I love there chips and salsa.
