We went on a Wed evening around 6:30 and were seated immediately.  I've had lunch here before, but this is the first time going for dinner -- and once again, the BAG didn't disappoint.  This is New Mexico cuisine at its finest.   As others have mentioned the dark, smoky chipotle salsa is like nothing I've ever tasted.  Having lived in AZ all my life, I've had just about every variant of salsa out there, and this is simply one of the best. 

We started with the "jimmy crack corn crab cakes " and were delighted with the 4 generously-sized cakes served on a bed of greens and a drizzle of a cilantro-based sauce.  

For an entree, I chose the Taos combo, which included a pork tamale, tenderloin relleno, and shrimp enchilada.  I can't say enough about the quality of this meal.  It's impossible for me to choose a favorite between the relleno and enchilada - both were outstanding.   

Great atmosphere (don't be fooled by the exterior), incredible food.  The Blue Adobe consistently provides a great dining experience.

One final note: for those in the group of 30 who were unhappy with their accommodations, was it really necessary for so many of you to give this place a low rating?  Seems disingenuous to dog-pile on like that.
