This is great New Mexico-style Mexican food.  The "Land of Enchantment" is a stand out dish--steak with 2 shrimp and a chicken enchilada: Very good.  There were lots of things I wanted to try on a future visit.  Great salsa and that dark red Santa Fe-like sauce, whatever its called. This place has good service, great food and good atmosphere. Definitely have some of the more NM-styled dishes rather than the basic Mex fare.
