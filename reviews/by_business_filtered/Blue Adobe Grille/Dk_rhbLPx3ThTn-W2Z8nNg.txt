One of the two best New Mexican style restaurants in the East Valley and to boot, it's been here for a long time.  Rustic southwest decor with fun, friendly, and at times eclectic personalities to serve you, PLUS flavorful dishes with hints of red and green chile or both if you'd like.

We went there on New Year's Eve well after the bedroom community schedule keeper's had eaten and rather than close early like many places, they were open and running on all cylinders having fun alongside all the guests.

If you're  thinking of giving this place a shot, try the Carne Adovada as it's the best in the county, hands down.  If you've been before and have tried the Carne Adovada, give the meat loaf a shot.

Lastly, very good salsa and a full bar and there's a window for pick-up orders and that's something all restaurants should have.
