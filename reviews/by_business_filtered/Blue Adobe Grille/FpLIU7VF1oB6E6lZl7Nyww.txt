i Live right by this place but i never stopped in because it doesn't look appealing from the outside.  But after trying most other restaurants in the area and my need for something quick and close kicked in I decided to give this place a try.   GLAD I did.   It was actually very good.   THey give you chips and salsa to start.  And quite a big portion as well.   It was delicious.   I ordered the taco salad.   They call it a different name but that's pretty much what it is.   ANd that was delicious as well.   It also came with these large cracker looking deep fried chips that were awesome.   My friend had some chicken and rice which looked great and my friend said tasted great as well.  I will definetely be going back soon.    One of my faves for mexican food.    The only reason for not the 5th star was because although the service was nice and pleasant everytime we needed something we had to flag our server down.   She wasn't too attentive.   So overall 4 stars in my book and I'll be back for sure.
