I went to visit a friend up in N Scottsdale and we decided to try this place with our families. I had no expectations going in. I was just hungry.

We were seated almost immediately. There were 7 of us, so prepping a table was in order. Immediately we were introduced to our waiter and drink orders taken. 

They served the complimentary chips and salsa. I could have satisfied my hunger with that. The chips (and those who know me well, know I am not a chip person, nor a salt person.) were not salty, not oily, and the salsa was so delicious!! It had a great roasted flavor and just enough heat to satisfy me, but not spoil my taste for my dinner. Yum....

I ordered the seafood enchiladas. My friend ordered the chorizo stuffed chicken. Once my friend to her first bite, she was hooked. I actually heard a groan of satisfaction escape her. That says a lot considering she ran her own restaurant and is pickier than I am with my food. My seafood enchiladas were delicious! The seafood wasn't rubbery and overcooked. The salmon inside was tender and perfectly cooked. They didn't tell me what the catch of the day was though. I didn't care. It was GOOD. The side dishes were good too. I was happy to hear that the pinto beans were cooked with a chicken stock and not pork products. Whew!

Since this was my first trip, I am hoping that they are consistent. I want to go back. As I'm typing this up, my stomach is screaming at me to fill it.*
