We live super close to this restaurant but rarely dine here. Prices are a little high and when you have kids, it get expensive. Don't get me wrong, the food is delicious and I suggest you trying it if you're visiting the area. With the amount of Mexican restaurants, Id rather visit somewhere else where the prices are affordable.
