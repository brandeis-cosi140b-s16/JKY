This place is awesome. I've been here several times and everything on the menu sounds great, but I keep getting the carne adovada stacked enchilladas (Christmas style with a fried egg). Its just incredible.

The roasted salsa before the meal is also some of the best I've had and they have excellent prices on specials every night.
