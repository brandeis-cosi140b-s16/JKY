I work at a Culinary School and I have tried a lot of food in my day and I have to say that I absolutely loved the food. I had a chille relleno and it was topped with deliciousness. To top it off I had the most amazing service! I didn't have any wait time at all, my server was attentive, used my name several times throughout my meal and really enjoys his job. Overall I give Blue Adobe a 5 star review because of the outstanding service/environment and the delicious savory food. If you haven't been here for food yet you should because it's amazing!!!!
