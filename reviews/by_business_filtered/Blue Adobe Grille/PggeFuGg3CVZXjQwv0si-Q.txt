Went for the first time after being told how great they were.  the service was horrible, only 2 people for the entire place.  the Carne Adovada, which I LOVE, was horrible, burnt, the sauce so thick and concentrated it was like paste.  My wife had a soup that left a lot to be desired and the salsa was forgettable.  Quaint decor, but I can't see going back
