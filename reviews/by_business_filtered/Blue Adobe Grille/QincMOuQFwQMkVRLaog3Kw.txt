I came here for lunch on a Monday afternoon. The host was pretty nice and entertaining and we were promptly seated on the patio. The service was okay. I ordered a shredded beef enchilada and carne adovada combo, and I really loved the enchilada and shredded beef, but the carne adovada was pretty bland, and the rice and beans were really not that great.  But perhaps I am just not used to this Southwestern type of rice and beans. I also thought the menu was somewhat confusing. The chips and salsa were pretty good. Overall it was a fairly good experience; eating that great enchilada on the patio was memorable; but I do think this place is just a bit overpriced for lunch.
