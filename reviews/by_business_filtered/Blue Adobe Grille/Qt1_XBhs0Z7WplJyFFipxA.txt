Was looking for a Mexican restaurant near  Sun Devil Liquors. Had a side of guac with the chips and salsa and it was awesome. Salsa is really good too with moderate heat. Had the Santa Cafe 3 item sampler with a tamale , chicken enchilada and carne adovada. All were out of this world. The margaritas were superior as well. Best Mexican food I've had for some time and I fashion myself an aficionado.
