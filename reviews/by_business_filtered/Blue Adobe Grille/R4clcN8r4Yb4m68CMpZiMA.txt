This was the first restaurant we tried when we moved to Arizona.  It was absolutely delicious.  This place serves New Mexico cuisine, which is a world away from your average Mexican food oozing in cheese and red sauce.

The carne adovada sliders are to die for!  The slow cooked spicy meat is nestled between a fried tortilla cut to look like little burger sliders.  It's served on top of a bed of lettuce and is enough food to be a meal than just an appetizer.  My husband consistently order the Jala Holla steak with its jalapeno hollandaise sauce.  My friend loved her green chili crab dip served with fresh tortilla chips.  This place has pretty good fresh fruit margaritas.  I really loved the mango margaritas!

I really liked the one in Mesa, but the neighborhood borders on sketchy.  I tried the one in Scottsdale when it first opened and it wasn't as good as the Mesa branch.  However, when we moved to North Phoenix, we settled on going to the one on Frank Lloyd Wright.   The chef owner is very pleasant and has remembered us in both locations!
