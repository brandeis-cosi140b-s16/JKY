Came back to enjoy dinner with an aunt who is from the east coast. She wanted a good southwest meal and Blue Adobe Grill was the 1st thing that came to mind. Just like last time it didn't dissapoint. Everything was top notch. I tried the chili rellano with red sauce and my wife had enchanted garden enchilada.  Both dishes were so go and with that spicy kick we expected.  Best mexican in AZ.
