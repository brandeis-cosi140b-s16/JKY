This place was recommended by some local friends and it was close to the hotel.  We arrived late, 20 minutes prior to close.  We were punished  a bit by waiting for the hostess for 5 minutes, we politely asked if we could get a seat for eating and I was surprised that the response was not an immediate "of course". 

That part aside once we were seated we had a fantastic meal.  We split a bean queso dip which was served quickly and was delicious.  I ordered the spooning relleno peppers with cheese and chorizo, breaded and fried, a huge plate with 2 relleno and rice and beans, very tasty.  The house salsa is homemade and very good as well.  I will be back!
