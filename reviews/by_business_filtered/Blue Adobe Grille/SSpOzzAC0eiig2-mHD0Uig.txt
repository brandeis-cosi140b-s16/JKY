I went here with some friends at the suggestion of a classmate who is native to New Mexico.  I had tex-mex food when I was last in N.Mexico and loved it.  I had the Garden Enchilada which was tasty.  I appreciated the fact that they had some nice veggie options and in different sizes.  The Daiquiri was outstanding!  My friend loved her Chorizo Stuffed Chicken but the chili pepper mashed potato was dry.  The waiter was cute and very personable.  He traded out our traditional salsa for the bean dip which was yummy!  Overall it was a good experience, but I would have to go back and try more things to see their range.
