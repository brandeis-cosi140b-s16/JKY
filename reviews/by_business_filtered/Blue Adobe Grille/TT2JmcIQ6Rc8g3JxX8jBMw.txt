This is a mixed report, since I loved my shredded beef chimichanga and my wife hated her Chorizo Stuffed Chicken with Green Chile Potato & Saut√©ed Vegetables.  She said it had no taste. (She also hated her marguerita and didn't drink more than a few sips. Bad night for her.)

My chimichanga , however, was very tasty, with red chili sauce providing the perfect amount of tongue-tingling spice. They had Four Peaks Kilt Lifter on tap, which cut the spice nicely. And the salsa they brought was really good, though the red chips, for some reason, were all stale. 

The place was more of a bar with tables than a restaurant, strictly speaking. Nothing fancy. But a nice menu of New Mexican favorites. I'd probably go again if I come back to town. (My wife, though...I'm thinking probably not.)
