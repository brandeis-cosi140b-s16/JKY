My favorite New Mexico Mexican food restaurant in the entire valley. The senses come alive from the moment you step out of your car and take in the aroma a pecan wood smoking the meat you will soon savor. The "Cruz Kitchen Signature" is a great combo where you can taste a variety from their kitchen. Absolute favorite is the Carne Adovada. The servings are huge enough to share, but you won't want to!
