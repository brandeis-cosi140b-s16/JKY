Don't believe the closing time, the staff decides when they are done seeing guests.

My 4 friends and I were looking for a quick bite at the end of our night. Knowing good and well that it's somewhat uncouth to walk into a restaurant a half hour before closing time we were just looking for a few appetizers and drinks. As we walked up at 9pm, a waiter met us on the front patio and said, "sorry ladies, we're closed". Not only was that a lie, but there were plenty of guests still eating on the patio.

Rather than explain our intentions that night, I accepted his dismissal and thought it better to just let everyone else know that they are content with their current customer base and not looking to accommodate any new patrons at this time. 

Congrats, Blue Adobe, that you have the type of success to turn business away!
