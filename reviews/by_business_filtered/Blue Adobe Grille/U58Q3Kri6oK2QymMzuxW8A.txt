Really great happy hour!!! We went on Saturday at about 4pm and they have $4 house margaritas(in a pint glass), $3 drafts, and $2 off everything on the front of the menu.  My shrimp quesadilla was cooked right, my boyfriends posole was really good(not traditional and had a nice bay leaf after taste), and our extra crispy cheese crisp was pretty good.  My only complaint is the mango salsa I got with the quesadilla was mediocre at best.  Service was great, our waitress was attentive, helpful, and nice.  I will go back for sure!
