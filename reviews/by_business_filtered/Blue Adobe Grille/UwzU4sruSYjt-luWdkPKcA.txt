I've been to Blue Adobe twice now, once for lunch with coworkers and once this past weekend for dinner with my boyf. Both trips were delicious and all around awesome. I think this place totally deserves all five of my stars.

The New Mexican twist on most of the dishes makes for a unique and fresh twist on standard Mexican food fare. Their salsa (it comes to your table in a cute lil glass pitcher!) is to die. It's smokey and chunky and the perfect way to start a meal.

My first trip included a portobello enchilada with a side of their sauteed veggies. The enchilada was covered (but not drowning in) with an Amaretto mushroom cream sauce. It was absolutely delicious, and something new. The side of veggies I subbed in were a nice variety: carrots, asparagus, onion, zucchini, mushrooms, all nice and buttery and still crispy instead of veg-mush. Not the healthiest lunch, but definitely not a gut-bomb.

For my recent dinner trip, I went with the garden enchiladas topped with their green chile sauce. The aforementioned sauteed veggies were folded into tortillas, and were delicious with a light topping of cheese (again, not completely smothered in goo, which I appreciate) and the citrus-y chile sauce. I tried some of their red sauce and it was beyond. Almost like a mole, with smokey, chocolatey undertones. I'll need to go "Christmas style" (food topped with both red and green chile) next time!

Boyfriend got a glorious looking variety plato: A relleno stuffed with tenderloin (I noted that the relleno wasn't drenched in eggy/crazy friend batter. Good!), smoked pork tamale and carne adovada. He said it was one of the most delicious mixed Mexican plates of life. It looked like it! 

All in all, I'm really glad this place is so close to home. We'll be back, lots!
