We've been here a couple of times but have never reviewed our visits. This mainstay near downtown Mesa smells like mesquite grilled heaven as you enter from the parking lot. The menu has a variety of memorable choices from the ancho-chile grilled salmon to the stacked enchiladas and lobster tamales. The tri-colored chips and salsa are terrific... don't miss the Yelp check in for a free cup of house made guacamole. The beer list is decent as well. Our service was good, not great but good. We'll definitely be back!
