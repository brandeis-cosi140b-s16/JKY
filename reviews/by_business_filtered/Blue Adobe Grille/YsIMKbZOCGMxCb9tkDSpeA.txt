Food and service were outstanding. Waitress recommended the spinach dip..... Incredible. Like no spin dip we have ever had. Wife had raspberry pork loin. It was the most tender piece of pork either one of us had ever tasted and the flavor was sweet but not overwhelming. I had the tex-mex pasta and chicken. Delicious and not too filling.
