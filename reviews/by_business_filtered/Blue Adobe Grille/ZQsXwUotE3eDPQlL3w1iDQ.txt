We were still on a search for New Mexican food and I read up on this place and it was also recommended by a friend.  It was average, not very New Mexican.  I tried the pecan grilled shrimp tacos and they were good! My boyfriend got the stacked enchiladas which was just ok.  Still on the hunt for good New Mexican food in AZ.
