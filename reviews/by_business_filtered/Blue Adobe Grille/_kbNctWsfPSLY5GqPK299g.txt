We needed to accommodate 24 rugby players and this restaurant pulled it off without a hitch.  Great service. Numerous chip and salsa refills. A skinny margarita made of only three ingredients- agave nectar, tequila, and lime juice! One word of caution almost every dish was spicy. Perfect for my palate but not for everyone.
