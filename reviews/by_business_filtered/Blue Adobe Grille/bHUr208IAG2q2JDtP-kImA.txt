Oh yeah, this place is an amazing find! After my sweetheart's game at Hohokam Field, I used (once again!) my handy-dandy Yelp app to see what was in the area (since I don't know much of anything about Mesa). 

Up pops Blue Adobe Grille. 

So Monday-Saturday they have $10 specials...on Sunday, that $10 will get you any of the specials from Monday-Saturday. 

I ordered the chorizo stuffed chicken (served with delicious red pepper mashed potatoes and steamed veggies). He ordered the stacked enchiladas with beans and rice. Both of the meals were phenomenal, but I think the stacked enchiladas were slightly more phenomenal than what I ordered (grass is always greener on the other side of the table...or something like that?).  Our server was also fantastic and he was johnny-on-the-spot for refilling our beverages. It's also across the street from a pretty cool piano/wine/beer bar (sneakily located in the basement of a liquor store...so cool!) 

It reminds me of home cooking...in the best sense of the words.
