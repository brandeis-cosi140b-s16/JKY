Fresh all you can eat chips and a nice variety of items on the menu.  Salsa was not very good and guacamole had little flavor.  Not enough waitstaff working but we still enjoyed the meal overall.  The bad part was we all got sick from the food including my kids.  Tried to tell the Manager about it but they were having no part of listing to us and didn't want to hear it.  Eat at your own risk!!!  Been in the Food business 30 years and if your Managers don't care the kitchen help doesn't care.  Improper food handling at this location and more than likely improper cooling and rotation of product.  Don't listen to the positive reviews, this could be your last meal...
