This place is great, It was the first place i dined when I moved to the valley and i continue to go back. The food is outstanding and the service is great. I always get the enchiladas and my girlfriend always goes with the salmon. She always says its the best fish in town, and after trying it she is right. If you want great food and service at a reasonable price go with the blue adobe. Also, they have some of the best chips and salsa.
