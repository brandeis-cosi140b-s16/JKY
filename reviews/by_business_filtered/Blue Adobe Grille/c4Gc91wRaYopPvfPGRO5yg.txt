Staying at the Fairmont in Scottsdale, my husband and I were looking for a New Mexican Cuisine restaurant within an easy drive, and we selected Blue Adobe based on its reviews on Yelp.  We arrived during Happy Hour and were greeted with the wonderful smell of pecan smoke from their wood fired grill.  The restaurant is very casual with comfortable booths.  The outside patio looked nice, but we chose to sit inside and enjoy the AC and college football on the TVs.  We had their Killer margueritas, which were delicious and potent.  Complimentary chips and salsa arrived and we loved both.  Ordered the guacamole, and were presented with a large bowl of chunky green goodness.  The entrees we ordered were delicious..their menu has many great choices.  Service was excellent, and prices were a bargain.  We loved our experience here, and will be back the next time we're in town.
