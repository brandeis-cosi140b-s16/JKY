We were in last weekend for the first time and I'm SO happy we are local so we can enjoy it again! I was super impressed with how they presented the kids menu. It was on a hand-held drawing board! My son sat there and played with it the entire time. 

We had the Shrimp cocktail for an appetizer and WOW were those things HUGE. I loved the pico in the glass and the way it was served. 
We both ordered the Portabella & Steak and my son ordered a cheese pizza off the cool kids menu. The steaks took a bit long to cook so our awesome waiter, Jordan, brought my son's pizza out beforehand because 6 yr olds aren't very patient when they're hungry. :o)

When our steaks finally came, I was surprised at the portabella part, I assumed it would be on top of the steak but it was on the side as a dish of portabella Quesadilla type thing, covered in a white sauce. It was very good! 

Once we finished Jordan brought us a complimentary dessert for having to wait a bit longer for our steaks. We all shared the creme brule and I would go back for that alone! 

The only downfall was that the table top was a bit small for the three of us and I had to move things to the side bar to make more room.
