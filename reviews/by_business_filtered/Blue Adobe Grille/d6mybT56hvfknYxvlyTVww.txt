Went to Blue Adobe on Tuesday.  The Owners greeted us and remembered us from our previous visit.  Tuesday is Taco Night and a Taco Plate is only $6.99.  I ordered the taco plate and a margarita. My wife and son split the pulled pork salad.  Both meals were excellent.  The service was also impeccable. I would highly recommend the Blue Adobe.
