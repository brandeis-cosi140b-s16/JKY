We live fairly close by and try to get our Blue Adobe fix once a week.  The menu is awesome. The carne adovado meal or wraps are excellent. The chile relleno is legendary, and the steak medallions and seafood dishes excite the palate. Sunday brunch is amazing!

The service is excellent. The bartenders aim to please. What's not to like?

And, this restaurant has been open in Mesa forever. Others come and go, but the Blue Adobe remains....
