I didn't love it, but I liked it.  It was a bit spicy for my taste but I'm a wimp.  The food had a very good taste even if it was spicy.  I had a mini chimi which was plenty for me.  The beans were great and the rice had a lot of flavor just a little to hot.  Yes, even the rice was too spicy.  I told you I was a wimp.  Margarita was good. But the atmosphere...I loved the decor.  The place is fabulous.  The inside is nothing like the outside....thank goodness.  My son and his wife love the place, they are not wimps.  They frequently drive from apache junction for dinner.  But, like I said, they are not wimps.
