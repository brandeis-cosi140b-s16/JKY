Excellent food excellent service...all round wonderful establishment

Michael the proprietor seated us and spoke with us at length...it was a most insightful look at the philosophy of this restaurant, and its daily struggle to fend off the deleterious effects of the Obama-economy.

We took Mike up on the ingenious marketing scheme they have which allows you on Mondays to order any of the daily specials served through out the week for $10

Carne Adovada Stacked enhilada's, A green chili cheeseburger, and the green chili corn chowder.  All the food was delicious, Mary was our server and she was working her butt off to keep 10 tables all happy at once.

I must call Robert M. on the 4th of July 2011 out on his bullsh*t review!!  Not worth the drive???  Step above Macayo's??  Locals locked into area???  Remote???  never make it into town to real restaurants??

Robert how about you head back over to that Panchos buffet down in South Phoenix where you obviously spend a lot of time and leave the good places for those of us with a clue!   Robert...these are HARD WORKING people trying to make a living...may I suggest you cancel your Yelp account?!?!?!
