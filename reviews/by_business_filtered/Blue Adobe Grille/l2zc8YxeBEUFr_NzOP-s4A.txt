Great service by Gary.  We began with the Blue Adobe Ceasar Salad, with lime tequila dressing. Delish.  The we split the layered enchilada. Pork. Also, wonderful.  We ended with a sopapia (sp?), although tasty, it was the only "okay" thing.  Very enjoyable and filling.  We would return if we didn't live in Indiana!
