The bottom line first, will a I go back?  YES!  I would go back if the food was average because of the service.  BUT I'm happy to say I was equally please with my meal.  I went for the relleno because of what I read here on yelp.  I had a relleno and a mushroom enchilada with a sweet amaretto sauce.  Both were very good, the chili relleno had a very tasty crusty batter, seasoned with a flavorful chili mixture.  This was the first time I had a relleno prepared that way, it won't be the last.  The mushroom enchilada was great, I balanced the sweetness with salsa. I'm looking forward to going back to try a different enchilada along side the mushroom.  Our waiter was the best!  This place is keeper.  
Be Peace, Candice!
