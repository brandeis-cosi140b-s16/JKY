This place is a real gem! Amazing food and excellent margaritas topped with a great setting. If you haven't tried this place yet you are missing out. Oh and did I mention they have live music too. Do yourself a favor and check this place out! I got the pecan wood grilled steak and it was cooked to perfection. My hubby got the shredded beef lazy tacos which were super tasty.  The wait staff is very nice and attentive. I've been searching for a go to southwestern food place and now I don't need to look any further. This. Is. IT!
