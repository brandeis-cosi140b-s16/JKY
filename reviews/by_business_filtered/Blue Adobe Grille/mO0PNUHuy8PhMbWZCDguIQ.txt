I had to give it five stars b/c my husband thinks he had one of the best pizza's there ever!  He had the Garlic Shrimp Pizza with chipolte shrimp, pesto and garlic.  He is a big garlic fan and he believes it was spot on in flavor and couldn't get enough of it.  I had a chipolte shrimp caesar wrap special with mango and I, too, thought it was quite tasty.  It had a very unique flavor mixture.

Our chips and salsa was also good - though I would have liked if they had a little spicier of a salsa.  Overall - a great find before Spring training.
