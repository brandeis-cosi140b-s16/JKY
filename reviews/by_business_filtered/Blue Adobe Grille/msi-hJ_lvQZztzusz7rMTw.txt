Based on the reviews I was disappointed with my entre...chicken pasta (linguini, basil and cream sauce). Too heavy and thick with an excess of heavy cream. Service however was 5 star so I'd give it another try. Might just have been an off night. Glad they had one of my favorite brews...Dos Equis amber!
