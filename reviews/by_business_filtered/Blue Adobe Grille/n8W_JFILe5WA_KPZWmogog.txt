Had a great, fun dinner here last night celebrating my sister's birthday.
Service was excellent as our waiter balanced food allergies, non-meat eaters, and general indecisiveness with the terrific menu. 
We lingered over first course chips, salsa (just spicy enough to please all, a little light for those of us who really enjoy heat), chunky guacamole (in need of a little salt) and perfect bean queso (mashed, not pureed, beans, just enough cheese, same spiciness as the salsa).  The Don Culio margarita was cool and spicy, and good enough to have two.

Our party enjoyed all our entrees: the panko breading on the Shrimp Rellenos was unusual and worked wonderfully, standing up to the Christmas sauce and maintaining some crunch; Pork Adovado Stacked Enchiladas were tender and flavorful - get the fried egg on top; Crab Cake Tacos are unbelievably yummy - didn't sound like it would work, but they were so much more subtle and delicious than the typical fish taco; Chorizo Stuffed Chicken was the only average dish - just fine but beware of portion size, it was the only dish of the night that might leave someone a little hungry.

We finished our meal with a complimentary birthday dessert of a cookie pie with ice cream.  I'm sure you're rolling your eyes at the mundanity but hold on, this was a slice of actual cookie pie at least twice as thick as whatever you're imagining.  Not just the best of its kind we've had but simply delicious on its own, no comparison necessary. 

Can't wait to go back!
