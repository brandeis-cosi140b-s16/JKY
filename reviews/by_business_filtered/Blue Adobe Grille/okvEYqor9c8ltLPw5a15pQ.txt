Came here today for the first time with 2 friends.  Great atmosphere.  We sat at the bar which was nice. The bar opened to the outside and it had a few nice flat screen tv's.  Lauren was our Bartendar and she was very nice and attentive. We were served our margaritas and chips and salsa right away.  Margaritas were really good.  I got the Muy Flaco and my friends got the Cruz and blackberry pomegranate margarita.  The salsa was very tasty.  The hot salsa had a nice little kick to it.  For the food,  I got the carne adovada.  The pork was really tender.  My friends got the stacked enchiladas and the fish enchiladas.  They both loved the food and said it was very tasty..  Very generous portions.  We will definitely be back.
