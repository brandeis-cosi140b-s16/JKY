My family went there Saturday afternoon they did not get the order right first of all. When we told the server she got so excited and started to yell at us on what we ordered. After the yelling telling us what we had was our order... I told her that we ordered the chicken nuggets for my son. Not two corn tortillas with two stips of chicken. And our enchiladas were to be topped with an egg. We got our food back and the server was still being terrible to us. I wasn't going to tell her there were egg shells in our food. We just picked them out. I have picture but will not post. as far as the food... it was far from being New Mexican... just another Grengofied Mexican restaurant.  When they call there chili sauce you know that's trouble. No Spanish rice here...more like uncle ben's. However I think most people will like it. This is the last Mexican restaurant I go to in AZ sick of being disappointed.
