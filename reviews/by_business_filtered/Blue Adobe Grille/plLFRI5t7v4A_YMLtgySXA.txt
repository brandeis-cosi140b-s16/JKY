A few of us stopped here for happy hour because we heard the patio and the margaritas were great.  This was definitely true!  The patio is perfect: nice tables, feels comfy and ceiling heaters for the chilly nights.

We all ordered Cruz Caddy margaritas since they were on special.  We had chips, salsa and guacamole to go along with our drinks.  Everything was really good.

Our server was lovely, she made sure we were always looked after and had full drinks.
