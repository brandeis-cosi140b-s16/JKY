It was Saturday night and I faced a major dilemma - 

I had 0 edibles in my kitchen (save for some butter and ketchup) but I was not motivated to put any effort into going out for dinner in (North) Scottsdale.  I needed something super easy and casual, so my first instinct was "Let's go to Chilis".

But wait, I had recently seen a review for the Blue Adobe Grill and knew it was right around the corner.

I threw on an old pair of jeans and a hoodie, hid my greasy hair with a baseball cap, and headed out.  It was exactly what I needed.  Casual environment.  No wait for a table.  Moderately priced food and a $25 gift certificate from restaurant.com purchased for $4 (god I love that website).

The food was good enough and definitely hit the spot.  I wasn't coming here for a culinary experience, I wanted something on par with Chilis and they definitely delivered and then some.  And BTW, it's not Tex-Mex as Chip suggests, it's New Mexican (which is way different).  The atmosphere was laid back, the server was friendly, and the food was bountiful.

Thanks Blue Adobe Grille for the quality alternative to Chilis.
