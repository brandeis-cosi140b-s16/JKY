I see a lot of the reviews are about service.  I can't speak to those same experiences, as I've always received good service.  Then again it has always been just my wife and I.  It seems the poor service has been with larger crowds.

Anyway, the food is beyond good.  This is New Mexican, not Mexican...so if you are expecting Jalisco style food -- go elsewhere.  This is not that.

To me, this place has the best Carne Adovada I've ever had.  Ever.  It is so tender and delicious I always eat too much.  The Chile Relleno is great as well (I make sure to add some tenderloin in there like it used to be in the old menu).

The rice/beans aren't the best to me, but that's not why I go.  The chips and salsa (not free) are delicious as well...salsa is really good.

We don't get here as often as I'd like, but I'm a huge fan of the food.  Too bad others have had poor service experiences.
