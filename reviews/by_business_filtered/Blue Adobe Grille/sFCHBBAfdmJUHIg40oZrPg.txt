Picked The Blue Adobe for my husband's b'day lunch...so glad I did!! We were seated by a pleasant young woman..chips and salsa followed within a minute or so...love the salsa!!! Our server, Scott, was attentive without hovering and accommodated our requests for just a few more minutes to check out the menu. I chose the Pecan Grilled Chicken sandwich w/a fantastic Chipotle Tomato Relish. The slightest hint of the pecan wood used to grill the chicken imparted a nice extra layer of flavor but the Chipotle Tomato Relish was DELIGHTFUL!!!!  I suggested that the Chef really needed to bottle and sell it..it was simply addicting..sweet and spicy..loved it. Husband had the Carne Adovada. He finished every bite but did mention that he felt there was just a bit too much of the Red Chile Adobo sauce..it kind of overwhelmed the flavor of the pork..that would be the only small negative we experienced. We both felt that there was a nice blend of spices and flavor in our meals w/o being too hot. Had a good conversation w/Michael, the manager. He is truly concerned about the quality of service and food...we will definitely be back. Thanks again Michael and Scott..see you soon!
