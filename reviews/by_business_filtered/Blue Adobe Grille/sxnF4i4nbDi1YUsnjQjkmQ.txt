I had a great experience here, I'm from the bay area and I know that we're spoiled down here with a variety of very good Mexican Restaurants to choose from. In Az there are quiet a few fast-food style Mexican Restaurants but very few home-style.  I came here on the last day of my trip and had a great experience.  The free chips that they served before the meal were warm and fresh. The salsa was fresh and authentic, and the meal was well prepared. To top it off, the waiter was great!  Oh, also, The Apple Sopopias were exceptional! When I come back next year I'll be sure to stop by again!
