The food isn't fresh. I think that's all I really have to say, but I'll expound a bit more on it. I walked in and the host was friendly. The service was pretty good, but the food took a very long time to come out. The chips came to the table quickly, but they were not fresh chips (bagged and colored variety). The salsa was ok, but it wasn't great either. When the food did come out it was obviously microwaved. I got the chimichilada (1 mini chimi and 1 enchilada) and the person I was with ordered a chicken sandwich. 

When he went to pick it up the bun was so dry it crumbled apart. The fries were microwaved too, and they tasted old. My dish was very large. The rice was over microwaved too though. The chimi was just "meh". There was nothing special about it. The enchilada was good, but I don't think it should have been called an enchilada at all. It was a sort of floppy (not fresh) tortilla folded over cut up portabella mushroom (which did taste good). It had a sweet cream sauce over it. The cream sauce was the best part of the whole dinner, but the flavor of the so called "enchilada" did not go well with the rest of the plate at all. 

Beyond the food, I'm positive that there was no one under 60 eating there. I'm not against going to places where I'm the youngest person, but it seemed a bit odd. 

I would not recommend this place.
