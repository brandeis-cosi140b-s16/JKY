The only place in the area that had decent reviews for dinner. First, don't judge this gem by its exterior, I almost didn't make it in because of it. Nicely decorated, air conditioned and smells pleasant. I had the chile rellenos with shrimp. Yum. House made red sauce? Double yum. My dinner companions had the salmon wrap (which she said was a bit fishy but not too bad) and the lazy chicken tacos (she said these were very good). So overall, yes I would come back here. We didn't have any service issues and it wasn't badly priced. However, I wouldn't drive up from chandler to just eat here.
