We were planning on meeting my dad at Rosa's for dinner, but after pulling into their dark parking lot last night, I realized we would need other options.  We struck out on option 2 (why is no place in Mesa open on Sunday nights?!) before yelping our way to Blue Adobe Grille.

My expectations were low.  The restaurant looks like it took over an abandoned International House of Pancakes building (only smaller).  The interior is generic 70's diner, but clean and well lit.  There were a handful of people scattered at tables around the restaurant and we took a table near the bar where two LCD tv's were showing football.  When I took a look at the menu and saw we were in a New Mexican style restaurant, things started looking up.   

On the wall are a couple of chalkboard panels showing the daily specials, each something off the regular menu offered that day for $10.  On Sundays, you could pick any of those items for $10.  That just about made the trip right there.  We each ordered off the "specials" menu.  Dad added a side salad to his stacked enchilada.  The salad came quickly, it filled an 8 inch place and had about 1/2c of goat cheese on top, with roasted red peppers and baby greens.  Our meals came about 10 minutes later: Blue Seafood enchiladas (shrimp, salmon and crab in blue corn tortillas with rice and whole pinto beans), Chorizo stuffed chicken with chipolte mashed potatoes and stacked chicken enchiladas.  The portions were amble, but with quality ingredients; boneless, skinless chicken breast, all white meat sliced chicken in the stacked enchiladas, roasted pepper sauces, fontina and goat cheeses.  Everything was delish.  And at $10 per entr√©e, the bargain of the century.

We are definitely going back!!
