Great New Mexican food!!! This is one of our favorite places to eat out. Everything we've tried is delicious - stacked enchiladas, carne adovada, chorizo-stuffed chicken, even the meat loaf. Sponning rellenos are great (not sure what spooning means, but the meal is very tasty).  The salsa that comes with the chips is out of this world. Service is friendly and efficient. 

We visited Santa Fe, and our relatives took us out to a couple of places for "good New Mexico food." They were fine, but neither could hold a candle to  the Blue Adobe Grill for the quality of the food.
