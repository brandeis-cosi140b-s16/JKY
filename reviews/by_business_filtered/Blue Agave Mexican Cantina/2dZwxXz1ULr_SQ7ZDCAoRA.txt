I came here with a friend for a Groupon dinner.  We got an appetizer assortment , an entree each, and a house margarita.  The app plate came with mini chimichangs (yay), chicken taquitos (yay), cheese quesadilla (nay), and wings (ok).  I had a decent chicken fajita, and my friend loved her steak fajitas.  The drinks were a little too strong in my opinion.  Overall, I would need another try at this place without the Groupon deal, and see if they can execute more flavorful food.
