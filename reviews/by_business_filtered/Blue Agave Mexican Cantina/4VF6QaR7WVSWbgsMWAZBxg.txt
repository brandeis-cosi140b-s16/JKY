Tried this place out on a whim one night. Sat in the bar area and this was a great choice. Bartender was friendly and attentive.  He suggested the organic Margarita and all I can say is WOW! I have never had such a tasty and refreshing margrita. This was followed up by a equally delicious Carne asada rice bowl. Their menu is different and exciting. They also offer a good variety of better tequilas. Oh and they have a reverse happy hour. All around a good place will be going back.
