Went here with my husband before going to the movies. Was very disappointed in the food. I am huge on Mexican food and this place is not real Mexican food in my opinion.The meat was probably the lowest grade of meat, both chicken and steak. It tasted terrible, you could tell the chicken was processed and the steak was really fatty. The salsa looked like marinara sauce and was nothing special. The food period was just not very good. I would never eat here again. The atmosphere was nice though.
