I would say the food was average and the service was the same. We took a chance with yelp deal. Salsa is really good. Spinach and cheese enchiladas good. Nothing really great.  My wife wanted to try a dish with the Oaxaca sauce so we asked our server what was actually made of. Never really got a full answer. The black bean and corn enchiladas my wife had were less than good. I took a bite and it tasted like canned beans and corn. ?? Their prices are good compared to other Scottsdale restaurants,  but I would rather pay a few bucks more a plate and get really really good food.  They have like 30 entrees on the menu if you are into that, but haven't they seen the show "Restaurant impossible". Try having half the menu items but make them incredible and people will come for the food and not the Alabama games.
