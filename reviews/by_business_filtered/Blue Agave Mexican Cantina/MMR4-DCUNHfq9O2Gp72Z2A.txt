Checked out Agave this past weekend with friends that live in the area. They hadn't been there in a while so we off we went. We were seated right away and checked out the menu. Our friends remarked that it looked like the menu had been slightly revamped.  We started with the Sonoran Rolls (tortillas with grilled fish, avocado and pico de gallo) and the Fried Camarones (battered shrimp).  The shrimp was so fried, it was tough to bite into. The Sonoran Rolls were better but nothing to write home about.  They just weren't very flavorful.  
I had the spinach enchiladas which were pretty good.  I'm kind of a wimp when it comes to hot foot and the red chili sauce wasn't spicy at all. That worked for me, but might not for someone who likes a little kick.
We finished off with the fried ice cream which was just like the shrimp, much too fried and difficult to eat. Our friends noted that the quality of food had definitely changed since their last visit.  The positive is that the wait staff were prompt and attentive.  The food wasn't horrible, just really underwhelming.
