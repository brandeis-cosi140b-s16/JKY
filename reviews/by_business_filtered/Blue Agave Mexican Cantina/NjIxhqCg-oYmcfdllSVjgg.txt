We found this joint thanks to Groupon last year.  Since that first visit, we've been here a couple more times.  It's in a shopping center just off Mayo & Scottsdale Rd....for some reason, this shopping center doesn't do very well, places close down frequently.  We're happy that this hasn't. 

Here are some items we've had here:

Mexican Bean Dip, $4.99

Spinach Con Queso, $5.99 

Nachos, $8.99
 
Owner's Chimichanga (Shredded Chicken, Black Beans, Cheese, Rice, Pico de Gallo Charrio Sauce w/Jalapeno Cream Sauce and Green Chili Sauce, Sliced Poblano Peppers, Cheese, Shredded Lettuce and Sour Cream), $13.99 

Ultimate Chimichanga (Roasted Pork, Rice, Pinto Beans, Cheese, Green Chili Sauce and Pico de Gallo), $15.99

The food is very good.  My fav's are the Nachos & the Ultimate and Owner Chimichangas.  The Bean Dip and Spinach con Queso are very good too, but if you get those don't get a large entree like the Chimichangas because it's too much food.

The servers are friendly.  The restaurant can get packed during happy hour and peak dinner hours.

Overall, it's a nice neighborhood family restaurant.
