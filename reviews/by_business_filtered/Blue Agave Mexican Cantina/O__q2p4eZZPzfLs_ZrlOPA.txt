I wanted to treat my parents who were in town to dinner and we decided for Mexican food. We found blue agave on yelp and decided to give it a try. My family and myself are big on chips and salsa and margaritas! 
The chips were delivered warm, which is great and they were thin chips which I also like, but they had an off flavor. I'm not sure if the oil was old or what. The salsa had a chipotle flavor to it and no heat so also a bit disappointed in that. 
The server, who was very nice recommend getting their special 8$ margarita with blue agave tequila, fresh lime juice and agave nectar. So I got that, because she said there was no sweet and sour mix in it. My first drink, man it was way too sweet, like sweet and sour mix was used. I ended up asking for a bunch of limes and squeezed about 3/4 of a lime into the marg to make it enjoyable. 
I ordered an appetizer that was shredded pork, covered with red and green sauce served with tortillas, onion cilantro and a different salsa. I didn't enjoy the green sauce, and would only do red for next time. The tortillas had the same off flavor as the chips so I only had one. The meat was good and tender, the onion and cilantro really tied everything together. 
Overall it wasn't a bad dinner, but I don't think I'll ever be back. Not enjoying the chips, salsa and margaritas are why I won't be back
