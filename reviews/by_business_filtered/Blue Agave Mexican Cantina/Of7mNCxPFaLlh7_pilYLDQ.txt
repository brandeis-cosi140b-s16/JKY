I can only review on the happy hour specials as we didn't order from the regular menu. As far as happy hour goes, Blue Agave has some great specials. We ordered the chicken chimis and the chicken taquitos. Both were very good and the service was top notch. Our chips and drinks were never less than half full.

My great experience from happy hour makes me want to come back and try some food from their dinner menu. Stay posted for a future review!
