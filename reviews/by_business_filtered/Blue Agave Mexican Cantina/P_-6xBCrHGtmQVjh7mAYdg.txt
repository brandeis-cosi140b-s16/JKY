First time. Came using a groupon. Wasn't wow'd by anything, but the place is nice. Their perfect margarita was very good however!!

I got the ultimate chimichanga and the wife got the carne asada pizza. Both we're ok. Chips and salsa are really good. Salsa has a hint of chipotle and chips were hot and thin. 

Would come back only of in the area. Not close to home.
