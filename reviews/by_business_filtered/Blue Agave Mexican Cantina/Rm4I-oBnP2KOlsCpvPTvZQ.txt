This walk in and seat yourself for lunch (on Saturday anyway) restaurant was awesome!!! WARNING: LSU fans beware!!! The owner is an Alabama alum. There is Alabama paraphernalia everywhere (but in a tasteful manner I must add). 

The bartender that served me was named Kenna and she was very sweet and attentive    I ordered a house margarita (mango, frozen) and the Mexican pizza. The "starter" (free) chips and salsa were phenomenal!! The margarita was a perfect mixture of alcohol, mango flavoring and margarita mix. It wasn't strong to the point that you couldn't drink it but you can still taste that I had a little "umph" to it. The pizza (now the ONLY thing I order) was amazing. It had all the right spices (even a little spicy for this spicy food loving girl) and had the perfect amount of ingredients (carne, shredded cheese, jalepa√±o spread, salsa). I asked for no avocado and no sour cream, add cilantro (which they put a big serving of all over the pizza which I love because I LOVE cilantro).  

I would definitely recommend this place to others and would suggest that you sit on the balcony. Great happy hour/daily specials to benefit from. Nice decor (minus the Alabama flags) but still family friendly and good prices. I am definitely coming back (wearing my LSU Tiger gear of course!!).
