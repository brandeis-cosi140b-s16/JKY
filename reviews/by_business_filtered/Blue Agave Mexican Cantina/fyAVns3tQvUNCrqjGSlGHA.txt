Just went here for the first time last week and was pleasantly surprised. Our waitress was a rock star and gave great recommendations. I am really sensitive to spicy food and she gave me a great option to get sauce on the side so I could control the temperature. The special chimichanga was HUGE but was so good, I ate the entire thing. Even our waitress was impressed. My husband got crispy tacos which were awesome! The shell was lite, crispy, and flavorful. We had cookie dough chimis for dessert which were very rich but very good. Pineapple upside down cake was also delicious. Good place for Mexican food that doesn't feel super heavy.
