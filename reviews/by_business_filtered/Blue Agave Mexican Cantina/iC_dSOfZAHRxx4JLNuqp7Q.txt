I know Mexican food look at my name. Blue Agave is a great restaurant with great prices good atmosphere good for Football. The carne Asada is good the Bacon wrapped Shrimp, the Ultimate Chimi tastes very good, Tacos are great, Fish Tacos are very good. Get the point! Don't listen to the wanna be professional critics on yelp, try this place and you will like it. I will agree that the salsa isn't my favorite but my wife loves it.
