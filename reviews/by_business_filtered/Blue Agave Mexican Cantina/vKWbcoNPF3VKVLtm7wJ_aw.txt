Recently came here for happy hours and dinner with some collegues. The food was disgusting and made me sick, I think I might have got food posioning. I ordered chicken lettuce wrap, the chicken was over cooked and was overly chunky with some stale salsa (it smelled and tasted that way EEEKK.)
Our waitress was pissed for some weird reason and kept making faces when people asked her for additional stuff! Terrible place, will never visit and definetly wont recommend anybody to go there and get sick!!!
