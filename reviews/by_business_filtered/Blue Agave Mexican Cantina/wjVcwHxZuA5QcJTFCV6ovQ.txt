Excellent food!! I especially enjoyed their fish tacos. They are rolled up and served with a sweet sauce... Excellent complement. The Carne asada was prepared in the traditional way and was delicious. 
The strawberry Mojito and the jalape√±o Margarita were also delicious and refreshing. 
There were 7 of us (3 picky kids, 1 teen, 3 adults) and there were no complaints.
Due to previous reviews, I specifically took note of the customer service...All the staff was accommodating and very nice. Again, nothing to complain about! :)
