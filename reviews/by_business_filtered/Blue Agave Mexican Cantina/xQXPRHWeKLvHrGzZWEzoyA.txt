Listen up, I'm full Mexican and I grew up with a mom that cooked the best authentic Mexican food while I was growing up.  I'm very picky when it comes to eating at Mexican restaurants.  It's hard to separate my homemade mother's creations with what they serve at some of these places.  

I ordered the Carne Asada pizza with jalapenos on top.  I shared it with my wife and I regret not getting my own.  It was pretty delicious and well created.

The homemade salsa was meh.  Too sweet for my liking.  I love heat in my salsa so I asked for one with more kick and they brought over a fire roasted salsa.  It was a little hotter, but it still didn't catch my taste buds.  

I would come back to try more of the menu.
