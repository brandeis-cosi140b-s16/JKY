This is a very convenient and easy location to scare up some happy hour fun, even if it's not happy hour. I really love their margarita selection, and I usually choose a higher end one. The Agave is my favorite by far, but I also like The Diamond. However, it must be said that both of these are completely bartender dependent so somewhat inconsistent, which can be a little frustrating because of the premium price. If I'm in a "bulk drinking" mode, the house frozen margarita is really good. Better than a lot of other places upgraded ones. They use a decent reposado in their recipe, which makes a difference. I don't know if they make their own mix, but if not, whatever they use is pretty good. Sweet, of course, but better than many others I've tried. They serve beer and it's cold, says my husband. So, drinks are covered, but what about the food? Not so much...not bad, really, but not good either. If I was only rating this as a bar, they would definitely get 4 to 5 stars. But, the food and inconsistent service reduces my rating by a star.

The one thing we do like is the spinach queso dip at happy hour time. It is really good, and they put little chunks of cream cheese in it, which is YUMMY. They are VERY stingy with the pico de gallo though, Usually about 1 teaspoon on the whole dish. We have been charged inconsistently for a side of pico to add. It has ranged from 99 cents to $2.49. The other downside is that their house salsas are both awful. Truly awful. They are chipotle something or other, but they taste like ketchup with a burnt rubber aroma. Yucky. That's a downside. The food is OK. I've tried a salad, the chimichanga (which is labeled very spicy and IS NOT), which comes with burnt rubber sauce, so ask for them to leave it off. My husband had the shrimp enchiladas, which were "OK, but kind of rubbery and a little fishy" and a shredded pork burrito, which he says was good and will be what he orders from now on. We have also had their nachos, which are OK too.
