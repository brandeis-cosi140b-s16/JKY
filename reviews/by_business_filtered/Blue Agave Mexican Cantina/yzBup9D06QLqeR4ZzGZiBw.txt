Took my two sons to Blue Agave for dinner after the Giants vs Cubs preseason game.  Service was excellent and portions big.  Excellent ambiance sitting on the patio.  Would recommend highly.  As an added bonus, two MLB umpires arrived and gave my sons a ball used in one of the games today.  What a nice gesture.
