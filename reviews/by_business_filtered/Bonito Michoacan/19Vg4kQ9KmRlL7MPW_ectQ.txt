This restaurant is amazing! The guacamole is a must. Great ambiance, friendly staff, and incredible food. We found this place while searching on Yelp for a family friendly restaurant. The kids loved everything. Even the free margarita we received for checking in on Yelp was delicious. This will be a must go to place every time we come to Vegas!
