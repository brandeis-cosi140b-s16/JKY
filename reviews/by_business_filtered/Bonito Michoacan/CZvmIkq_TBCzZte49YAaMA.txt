I am seriously torn.  When it come to Chinese and Mexican food, I think there is a fine line between value, and rip off.  I mean if I'm eating a perfectly delicious taco for $3, how much better will it get for 6-8x the price.  I understand that at a restaurant there are other amenities, advantages, and portions are bigger, but on flavor and experience alone, is the mark up really worth it?  This place serves delicious Mexican food.  I have no complaints, service was professional, and friendly.  There is nothing wrong with this establishment.  I just feel that I would hit up one of my favorite no frills taco joints before returning here.
