Absolutely The Best Mexican Restaurant In Town

My husband and I drive from Southeast Henderson almost weekly to enjoy Bonito. We have always had excellent service and the food is phenomenal. Anytime we have out of town guests we bring them here for a special treat. We have tried many different items on the menu and have never been disappointed. We love the decor and enjoy the piano player on weekends. We always leave happy and satisfied.
