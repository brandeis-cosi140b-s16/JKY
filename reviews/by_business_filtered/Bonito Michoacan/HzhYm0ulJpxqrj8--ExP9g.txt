OMG I'm in LOVE with this place. I grew up and lived in this area and have been going to Bonito Michoacan for years. It's the best mexican restaurant that I know of in Las Vegas. I always start off with thethe part. Their steak pacado is my #1 dish!! 

I love this place so much that everytime my husband asks me where we want to go on my birthday I choose Bonito! MMM! 5 stars all the way!
