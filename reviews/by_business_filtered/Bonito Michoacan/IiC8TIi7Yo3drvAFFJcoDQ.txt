Firstly, I really like this place! Now down to brass tacks:

Food:
I've been here twice, and the second time was specifically because of how much I loved the food. The green enchilada sauce is amazing, as well as the citrus marinated carnitas. I had some huevos con machaca tonight (breakfast for dinner!) and it was great! Oh! The flour (have not tried the corn yet) tortillas are very good. 
Margaritas are made with fresh squeezed lime juice rather than a bottle or gun of sour mix. Very tasty.
The chips are very disappointing and so is the salsa. This is the only reason I could not rate it 5 stars.

Service:
This is some of the best service I've seen in a while. The staff (bus staff included) truly want to make sure that you have a great time and love every minute.

Atmosphere:
While the typical Mexican restaurant theme is the basis for the atmosphere, it is done well and does not feel "cheesy." Pretty quiet most of the time, but can get loud when busy (of course).

Can't wait to go back!
