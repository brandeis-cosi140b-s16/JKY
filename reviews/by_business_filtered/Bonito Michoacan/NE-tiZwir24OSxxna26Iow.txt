Tasty margaritas that come in giant sizes.  Not only do you get the standard chips and salsa but a really yummy bean dip too.  Friendly, if a bit over the top service.  A gargantuan menu.  I think this place is a solid hit with tons of Mexican standards.  Even though my carnitas weren't the best I've ever had, some of the other dishes were delish.  I'd eat here again.  Three plus plus stars.
