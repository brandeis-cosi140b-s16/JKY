This is my favorite Mexican restaurant in town. I'm never really disappointed here and I felt the need to bump them up a star for being my favorite. It's still not the best Mexican restaurant in the world, but it's definitely one of the best in Las Vegas!

Every dish I've tried is delicious and the portions are extremely generous for the price. The menu is ridiculously extensive. There is just too much to choose from sometimes. I try to get someone to share dishes with me so I can get a taste of multiple things. 

I enjoy the decor and as a fan of clowns (rare, I know) I actually quite enjoy the back room that is decorated solely with clown figurines and pictures. 

Great place for large groups as well. I highly recommend it.
