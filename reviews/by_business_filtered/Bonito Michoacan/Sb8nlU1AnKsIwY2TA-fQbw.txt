Good, solid food- a cross between Tex-Mex and authentic Mexican, definitely a place that caters to both American and Mexican tastes- the menu is HUGE! Chips and salsa are outstanding as is the guacamole. I had enchiladas and they were awesome, beans and rice typical. 

Vibe is great and waitstaff are wonderful. I will definitely be back!
