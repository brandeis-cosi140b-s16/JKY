I have been on the search for a great Mexican restaurant ever since I moved back here a few months ago & THIS IS IT! I feel like I am in Mexico every time I go. The atmosphere is great. The staff are friendly. The place is clean. The location, super easy to find. Good parking spots. 

Firstly, the chips & salsa they serve when you first sit down are delicious. They also serve BEAN DIP! We always get the guacamole as well & it is made table side! Be careful not to eat too much & stuff yourself before you even order, like I always do. 

The menu is so big, it always takes me a while to decide. They have a combination menu for people like me who can't decide on what to get. Last time I got the beef taco & cheese enchilada combination, which is served with rice and beans. 

They also have a great desert menu! I forgot what the name was, but we ordered the Fried ice cream with bananas around it. It was delicious! Also, their margaritas are exceptionally good. 

Definitely going here any time I want good Mexican food in Las Vegas.
