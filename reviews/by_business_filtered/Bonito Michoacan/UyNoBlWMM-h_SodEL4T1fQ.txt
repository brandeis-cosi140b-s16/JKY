This is very good quality food and excellent service!
I have been here several times before, this particular visit I was a little disappointed with the bean dip. I look so forward to the chips, salsa, and bean dip that is served when you are seated. Usually it is AMAZING and I dive in like a maniac! Today the beans were hard and dry, just not good at all.
Chips and salsa were still good though..... just a bad day for the beans I guess.

Today, my husband and I shared the Parrillada de Marisco. A huge platter of shrimp, crab, fish, and rice.
A very good value for $45. 
There was shrimp prepared different ways, butterflied and fried (which was very tasty) bacon wrapped (wasn't my absolute favorite) shrimp in enchilada sauce (very good, especially when eaten with the fabulous rice in the center of the platter)
There was not a lot of crab. One bunch of snow crab legs... they were nice and sweet though. 
A large Tilapia filet in a butter sauce, which was very good. 
Wonderful creamy rice piled right in the center of the tray.
Then on the side they serve an amazing queso and warm fresh homemade tortillas!

We accompanied our Parrillada de Marisco feast with a couple of shots of tequila, 1942 and it was FABULOUS!!! Pricey tequila shots, but good!!!
