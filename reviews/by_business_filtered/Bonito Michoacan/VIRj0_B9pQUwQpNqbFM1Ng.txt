This is easily my favorite Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas.  The chips and salsa are great.....both are home made and the salsa is very spicy.....just the way I like it.  It is not for the weak.

My favorite dishes are:
Queso Fundido w/Chorizo - Basically a cheese appetizer with chorizo served on a hot fajita plate.  Comes with flour or corn tortillas....this is very good.  I order this when I take friends to this restaurant for the 1st time and every one of them agree with me.

Carne Asada Burrito - Very tasty, good quality Carne Asada.

Inside their menu, they have a lot of dishes to choose from....not to mention an extensive combo menu where there are a lot of combo dishes.....I have tried at least 7 or 8 different combos...all are very good.

We go to this restaurant at least 1 to 2 times per month for lunch at work and 1 time per month for dinner.  The prices are very reasonable too.
