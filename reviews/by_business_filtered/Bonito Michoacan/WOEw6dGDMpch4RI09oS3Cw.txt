Amazing Food and Experience! Took 4 others with me to celebrate my birthday. We made reservations earlier in the day for 6:30pm. We walked in and were sat immediately. They had a Yelp checkin that offered us a free margarita so we all checked in and got some. Our Servers were Awesome and they care very much about making our experience with them Wonderful. They sang to me with a band of fellow servers and gave me dessert and tequila slammer to top it off.

Needless to say we Highly recommend Bonita Michoacan!

Must try the carnitas and Enchiladas with green sauce.
