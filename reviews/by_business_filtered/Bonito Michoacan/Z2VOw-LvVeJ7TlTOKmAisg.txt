Excellent meal, and quite a steal when you add in the Groupon discount. The salsa and bean dip were good. Not the best I've ever had, but tasty and they were quick to bring a second serving when we finished off the first. Very quick to take our drink and food orders, and service was quite fast. I ordered a tilapia dish to do something different from the usual burrito or combo plate, and was very impressed. Whole fish, flaky moist meat, crispy skin and a flavorful sauce. It didn't feel at all heavy for a fried item. Came with a healthy portion of rice and beans, as well as french fries? Don't understand that part but even the fries were delicious. Very reasonable price ($13) for seafood and the portion size. Everyone else at the table seemed to thoroughly enjoy their selections as well.

I would definitely go back, even without a groupon.
