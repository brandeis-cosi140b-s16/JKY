Love the ambiance but i think it was the ambiance that made the food taste good.  Food was on the bland side.   I got the steak fajita and i prefer the steak fajita served at Chilis. It was very bland and steak was over cooked. I mean overcooked to well done and i don't believe anybody should eat steak well done.  I will definitely be back for the ambiance and hope that the next dish I order isn't like the fajita.
