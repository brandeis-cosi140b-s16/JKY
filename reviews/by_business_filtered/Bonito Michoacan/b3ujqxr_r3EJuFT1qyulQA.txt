We came here with a Groupon. I was reluctant since I'm just not thrilled with the Michoacan restaurants as a whole. I find the food to be overpriced and ever so bland. But, Boyfriend wanted Mexican food, so off we went!

This location is considerably less crowded than the others. We were seated immediately and had drinks within minutes. We ordered not long after that and were eating quickly. I noticed that the menu items are cheaper than at the other locations (combination meals average $11.99, as opposed to $14). The food was marginally better than other locations, I think.

I would love to go back to this location, though, because the service was phenomenal. Seriously, the best service I've ever had, ever.
