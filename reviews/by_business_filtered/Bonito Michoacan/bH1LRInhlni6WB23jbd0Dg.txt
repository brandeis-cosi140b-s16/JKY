This place is fantastic. Very Mexican looking, a large restaurant with plenty of seating.

Staff is wonderful and very attentive all the time. They have an extensive menu and their food is really good.

They even make plates that are not listed in the menu. I always get the "Pollo Milanesa".

They have a live band as well.

Their tortillas are so so so fresh and so so so yummy. You can have a soup with your plate as well.

Their prices are great and you get a lot of food. Their chips are really good and they come with salsa and bean dip.
