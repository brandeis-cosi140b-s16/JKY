Every time I would drive by this restaurant the parking lots always at its max capacity.  So finally on a slower day I decided to give it a try :P

The ambience was highly energetic.  All the coworkers  gathered and sang two different birthdays.  The decor was very colorful and gave the Spanish vibe.

As I looked their menu I was getting pretty  full eating their complimentary snack- chip and dips.  They had bean, salsa and guacamole (this was extra $8)  :P  what was so awesome, was how they made the guacamole right in front of us!  Two whole avocados and get to tell them how spicy you like it.  Then they also give this comp soup cup - chicken/tomato I think ? It was pretty delicious. 

Their cilantro steak ($16) was very tender - I ordered the steak medium rare.  They had 
Green sauce with sautéed onions on top of the steak.  It came as a combo - with rice and beans.  

I also tried their chilé relleño burrito ($8.95).  I wasn't too impressed with it.  This is what I would order at any other Mexican fast food chains, but this restaurant made it like an enchilada style - with tomato salsa over it.  
Maybe next time I'll tell them just like a regular burrito with beans and rice inside the burrito and no sauce on top :P
