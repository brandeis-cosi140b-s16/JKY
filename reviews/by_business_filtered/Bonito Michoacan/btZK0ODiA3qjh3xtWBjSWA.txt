Craving the delicacy we call carnitas, I found myself at Bonita Michoacan.

I ordered the Michoacan carnitas expecting deep fried goodness but came out with a savory, saucy goodness! It was coated with a delicious green sauce that was superb for the carnitas!

The tortillas were thinner that what I was use to but they were homemade. Being different made it better!! The tortillas were also larger than the normal corn tortillas.

I LOVE BEANS! So it was a plus that they gave SALSA and BEANS with our chips at the beginning of our meal.

For all you clown-a-phobics, do not go here! There is clowns galore near the bathroom. If you go, you'll know what I mean.
