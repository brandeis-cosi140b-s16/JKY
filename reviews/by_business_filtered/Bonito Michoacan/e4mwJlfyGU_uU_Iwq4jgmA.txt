Not really a fan.. I realize my tastes are different than the average Vegas person, as I'm more into the whole Tex-mex thing, but still I just don't think this place is that good. I got the 2 crispy taco lunch special. I like that the crispy taco tasted homemade, but man thanks for warning me about the sick shredded beef in there.! I much prefer ground beef and expected it, but apparently I'm the weird one, so I won't bring them down to 2 stars for the tacos I hated.
