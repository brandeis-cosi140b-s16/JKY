I've come here a couple times now...I don't love it or hate it...but there are certainly some very bright spots!  

The gringo in me feels like i'm deep inside a different culture just by walking in here.  Also, I love that the menu does a little translating for us...such as: "Servidos con sopa de fideos, arroz, frijoles y tortillas" and then the translation they give, "Served with sopa de fideos, arroz, frijoles y tortillas"...could we be missing anything here?

Additionally, they have some solid prices on some of their higher-end tequilas!  They make fresh guacamole right there at your table!  Their hotter salsa is tasty and...eh...hot!  I haven't found a 5 star Mexican restaurant in Vegas...Bonita Michoacan does a solid, authentic, job!  Carnitas and I have this thing...we love each other deeply.  The carnitas here don't love me enough for me to come here for them specifically, but they'll do in a pinch.
