The best in Vegas by far. This is where the locals go for Mexican. Many different dishes not just tacos, burritos etc. Many seafood dishes.  Service was exceptional. They make the to taste right at the table.  Drinks are also good. As an added attraction there is a lady making tortillas right in the front. Not the easiest place to find but worth the search.
