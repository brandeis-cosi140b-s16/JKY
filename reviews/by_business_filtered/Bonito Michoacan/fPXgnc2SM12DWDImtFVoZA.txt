We are from LA where thiers an abundance of Mexican restaurants,, but when we leave it's seams hard to find a decent restaurant that's authentica Mexicana. This hidden gem of the strip tailors to the local clientele.  What a treat it is. They would of gotten a 5 star from me but. Customer service is a bit busy. This restaurant can probably hold 200 plus. And frequently they do. So food is great! But service is slow. Try the homemade gugamole, just like mom made at home right in front of you ( table side.) Thanks Vegas coming back soon again.
