Fun place to celebrate a birthday because they sing to you and give you a sombrero to wear and maracas to shake. The mariachi guys take requests of regular songs too. 

They serve complimentary warm bean dip and spicy salsa with fresh tortilla chips. 

Fast service even when it is crowded. Authentic decor but the booth table was too high even for my tall husband. 

The fried shredded beef tacos are awesome! Good enchiladas, rice and beans.
