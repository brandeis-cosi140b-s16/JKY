First time i been there honesty the waiters are very nice and the food taste so good. Shrimp cocktail is alright to compare to others i have. Tostadas of shrimp are the bomb and also we had other plates which i heard they were  delicious. Agua frescas were good. I would recommend to someone else to come and eat there.
