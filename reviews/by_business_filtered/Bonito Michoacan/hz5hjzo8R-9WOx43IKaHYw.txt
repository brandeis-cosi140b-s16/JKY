Pretty standard mexican fare. Cheesy mexican lounge singer singing christmas music added to the ambiance or something. I had the camarones al cognac which was in a rich cream sauce and quite good. My mom had some camarones a la diabla or something like that was spicy, but it masqueraded any flavor. The rice and beans were not good. The salsa was pretty good, had a good kick to it. It was okay, but definitely not the best I've had. Their menu is massive, which yields a lot of choices for groups. Standard is all I can say. And the booths are definitely not at a normal height.
