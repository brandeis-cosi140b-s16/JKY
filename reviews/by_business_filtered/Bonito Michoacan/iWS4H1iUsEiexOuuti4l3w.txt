Truly awful.  If I had not eaten here, I would not have believed it was possible to mess up Mexican food this badly.  By comparison, Taco Bell gets at least two Michelin stars.

Ambiance - A cut or two below Denny's, with Mexican colors.  The best I can say is that I didn't actually see any cockroaches.  There was some noise, which I assume was intended as music, but which sounded more like drunk UNLV students celebrating a basketball victory.

Service - Quick and disinterested.  In fact, quick is an understatement.  The food appeared within less than a minute, and was obviously pre-cooked and sitting under a heat lamp in the kitchen.

Food - Awful, awful, and more awful.  The tortilla chips were not fresh.  The guacamole had so much lime juice that it was nearly inedible (and I LOVE guacamole).  The soup tasted like equal parts dishwater and vinegar, with a thimbleful of ramen noodles thrown in.  My beef burrito had chunks of beef (God, I HOPE it was beef) that appeared to be boiled soup meat, although the tortilla was fresh.  Even the rice and beans tasted acidic.  The portions were small (no Woody Allen jokes here, please), and the prices (by Mexican restaurant standards) were no bargain.  Don't get me wrong - $8 for the guacamole and $10.50 for each Margarita is not ridiculous in and of itself, but by the time the check came I was thinking they should have paid me to eat here.
