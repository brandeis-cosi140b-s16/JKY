This is the best Mexican food in Las Vegas it's a tradition to go eat when we visit absolutely amazing. I love the sopa aguada that they give you as a starter you must have have their refried   beans.Customer service is absolutely great always cheerful and very pleasant I don't think I will ever stop coming to this place... it's a bit far from the strip but the drive is worth it never had a bad experience  nor bad food and for that I will continue  to return!!!!!
