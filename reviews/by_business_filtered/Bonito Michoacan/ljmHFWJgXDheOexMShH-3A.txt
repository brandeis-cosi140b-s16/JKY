When you come to Mexican Food, I always tell people to go to this place. Great interior and exterior color such as authentic mexican feel you were in mexico. I cant say anything bad about this place little bit of louder music who playing the keyboard in the corner. May be that's a part of mexican lol. ANyway, The very first thing you try is the Fresh Guacamole  they made in front of you and give with home made chips and the mouth watering beans ad salsa. They have a biggest verity of any mexican restaurant in the town... Their Number of stake is right on the money and their other plates are also huge.  Also, The soup they gave you before the meal is make a great appetite.  

Finally, they have great magaritas and great seafood if you love to be drunk and a islander....
