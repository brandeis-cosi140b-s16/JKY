We checked in on yelp for the free margaritas, I was surprised and delighted that they were 2 margaritas on the rocks and not frozen overly sweetened blended margaritas.   This was a perfect way to start our meal,  while we were looking over the menu we were served chips, salsa and beans.   We were starving so that went pretty fast.   We then ordered our entrees,  I ordered the camerones al conac and he ordered camorones dionisio.  We were still hungry after the chips and salsa so we ordered chips and guacamole which they prepare tableside.   (You can definitely tell these servers do the tableside guacamole several times a day) it's nice that they ask if you want all the ingrediants and how spicy you would like your guac.  The guacamole was nice and refreshing with our margaritas.   Then our soup came.   The fideo soup was a small cup of tomatoey brothey noodle goodness,  I finished every last bite.  When our entrees came out, we both finished everything off our plates,  shrimp,  tortillas,  rice,  beans and a dallop of guacamole,  everything was good!   I enjoyed everything from the service to the margaritas to the appetizers to the entrees,  by this time we were pretty full so passed in the desserts,  I definitely recommend this place for the service,  atmosphere and food.
