GREAT SERVICE!!!!
GREAT FOOD!!!
GREAT PEOPLE!!!

It's a must stop for us when we visit to Vegas. We usually take a taxi to and from our hotel/casino...this time when our server called on a taxi, they said it would be an hour wait for pick up...the lady at the counter offered to give us a ride back to our hotel/casino.  FYI we offered $$ to kind lady for the ride and she refused to take our money....THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE RIDE!!!
