I always get the same thing at Mexican restaurants, shredded beef taco and chicken enchilada with rice and beans. I've eaten here about 3 times and I think I keep going back because of their lunch specials. Their rice and beans is not the best. Sometimes when the main dish sucks, I can just fill up on rice and beans and be ok with that. But not here. They do have good horchata and my boyfriend absolutely loves this place. I don't know, just me I guess.
