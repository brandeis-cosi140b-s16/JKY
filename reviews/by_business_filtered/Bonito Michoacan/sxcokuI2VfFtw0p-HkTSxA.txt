The service here is probably the most noteworthy, fun and relaxed- and ultra attentive. Everyone in my group seemed to enjoy their food- 

For my Chile verde I substituted Lengua, and it was great. Their Utra Margarita is awesome though! 6 shots in a huge margarita glass you get to take home afterward. I can't belive I got through the whole thing! My fiance tried some of their cocktails which were just- eh, nothing special. 
Go for the Tequila Margaritas you GRINGOS!

This is a fun place for classic mexican dishes. Ole!
