One of my favorites! I've been going to this place for years now but as I've grown older I've grown to appreciate the amazing food they offer.

The chips, salsa, and beans they offer as soon as you sit down are always so delicious that I have to limit myself lest I spoil my appetite (I'm not fancy - I've just always wanted to say "lest"). If I'm particularly hungry I order the Nopalitos as an appetizer. I absolutely love cactus and the way that it's cooked with onions and peppers is amazing and it's healthy!

I've had the shrimp cocktail, which has never let me down. The shrimp ceviche is one of my favorites as well. On hangover days I like to go in and get the Fideo soup (I have tried the menudo - I wasn't a fan). And nothing cures a hangover like a Michelada! The ones offered here never disappoint! The margaritas are also very good, as well as the Corona Margaritas, but the mixed drinks I've found are way too strong.

The one dish that I actually had to send back was the Mole. Call me spoiled but once you've tried my mom's mole, nothing compares. Mine was too sweet and the meat was too chewy. I sent it back and got a shrimp cocktail.

I guess this place just depends on your taste. Amazing for something things, not so great for others. Try it anyway.
