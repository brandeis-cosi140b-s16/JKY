My husband and I went here to use our groupon. He ordered chile rellenos and I carnitas. Food was great specially with our groupon. However our server was not the best. He waited several minutes  before he checked on us or to refill our drinks. But the busser was very attentive and took care of us because our server wouldn't. Also the so called live music is just a man with a key board. If my review was solely based on food I would rate it 4.5. However based on the overall experience I had to rate 3.
