I had a Groupon for Bonito Michoacan.  I was seated in the bar area and the bartender was my server.  She brought me chips, salsa, and bean dip quickly along with my iced tea.  She passed the empty sweetener bag test with flying colors!

First. my dinner came with fideo soup.  It was very good with less of a tomato taste than I'm used to getting.  There was more of a chicken stock flavor.  For the main course, I ordered the Enchiladas de Mole con Pollo, two cheese enchiladas heated in a red mole sauce with a chicken breast, refried beans, rice, and some lettuce shreds and a dollop of sour cream.  The mole tasted a bit sweet at first but then I got the undertones of the other spices and the richness of the mole came out.  The chicken breast was good.  It was seasoned in any manner so I gave it a good shower of Tapatio.

For dessert, I got the fried ice cream.  I guess fried ice cream is just something that comes out of the freezer.  I don't think anyone "breads" and fries the ice cream in real time anymore.

I was very pleased with my visit.  I was of two minds about where I was seated.  Two men were having a loud discussion (argument?) about politics in Spanish and the one had enough tecate to not know how loudly he was talking.  However, I could have been sitting in another part of the restaurant where there was a crying baby.  I think it was better where I was.  

This was an enjoyable dinner!
