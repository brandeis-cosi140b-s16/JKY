Was there a couple of weeks ago and the bartender was great.

Returned last night and the bartender clearly was racial. She greet everyone that walked up with a smile and an OLE! She barely said high to me while she was doing something else. When my meal was served, she never offered fork/knife leaving me to ask for it. She waited until AFTER happy hour was over to ask if I wanted another drink.

Some old guy who has no business being in show business provides the worse entertainment I have ever heard.

If it was possible to give this place a minus 5 star I would.

Not only will not go back, will actively recommend to anyone that asks - Dont Go There!
