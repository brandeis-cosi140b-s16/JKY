Loved this place.  Service was first-rate, we sat at the high tops and our server didn't miss a beat.  Our food took a while to come so the bartender brought a free round of margaritas without us uttering a word.  Given that this was happy hour and the margaritas were already $5, this was a steal.  And, the margaritas were great.

The highlight of the meal were my husband's beef nachos.  Homemade chips, perfectly cooked beef, sweet corn, beans and melted cheese = perfection.  I liked my fish tacos too but had to have some of his nachos because they were so good.

The Top Chefs did not disappoint!
