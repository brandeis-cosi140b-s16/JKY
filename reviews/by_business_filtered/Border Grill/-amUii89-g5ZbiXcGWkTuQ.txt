Border Grill has become a Las Vegas staple for us specifically because of their weekend brunch.  The unlimited cook-to-order mini plates (that are still a lot of food) are full of bold, unique, southwest inspired flavors and are all available for one set price of $34.99.  We signed up on the website for the free VIP club and immediately received a coupon for a Buy one get one free entree which really lowers the cost of the brunch.

They have recently changed the menu to offer some new brunch options including some amazing pigs in a blanket and bbq brisket sandwiches.  They also changed the recipes on some of the favorites to give them a different flavor as well.  A common theme was manchego cheese and spicy avocado sauce.  We were very happy with all of the options because all of the flavors are just so unique. 

The service was impeccable.  We had the pleasure of having Carmie as our server and she was very attentive, was able to anticipate our needs, and the food came out at perfect intervals.  We chose to have our brunch with water and coffee and the coffee was great.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant, and more specifically the brunch, to anyone.  Carmie also informed us that they've added a similar all-you-can-eat tasting on the dinner menu all week as well.  We can't wait to give that a try.
