I was so disappointed in our meal at Border Grill. We went in on a Sunday evening around 7:30. Our waiter seemed ready to be done for the day already. I don't know why but he was extremely difficult to even get any attention from at all, despite there only being 5 tables in use (2 weren't even his). He was great to a table of 4 young women but actually seemed to go out of his way to go around us rather than checking in to see if we needed anything. I really think it had to do with the fact that we only ordered water to drink at first. The tables he was more attentive to were buying multiple drinks from the bar. Maybe he just saw that we wouldn't be a big ticket table? I don't know. 

The busboy was fabulous and far more pleasant, despite being treated like crap by the waiter (I saw and heard our waiter berate the bus boy for not moving fast enough...)

We ordered the guacamole, which was quite good. I ordered the Chicken Poblano Enchiladas, and they were...weird. I literally needed a steak knife to cut them, but I couldn't flag the waiter down to request that, so I had to muscle through them with a butter knife. The tortillas were a really strange texture, almost like a taquito, but not fried properly so instead of being crispy they were just very, very tough and chewy. I've eaten and cooked a TON of Mexican food and I've never encountered that preparation before. And it was just very salty. 

My husband had grilled fish tacos and he was not very impressed. 

This place is too pricey, the waiter was too rude, and the food was nothing special. What a disappointment.
