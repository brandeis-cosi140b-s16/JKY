Stopped in last summer for a late lunch (3:00 ish) and was impressed by the generous portions and the outstanding service. I wanted to try a few different taco offerings that are sold in 3s by the plate. Our server suggested that I pick 3 to try and he would combine them as one choice. I also had some black beans and rice, guac, homemade chips and salsa. It was very good. 

Our server answered any and all questions we had regarding the food, the restaurant and the Good for the Planet operation that they tout. He was extremely knowlegable and friendly. I wasn't sure what to expect from the Border Grill, but was impressed with the entire experience and will return to try the dinner menu.
