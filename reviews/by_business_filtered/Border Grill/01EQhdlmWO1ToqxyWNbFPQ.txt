Went for the Sunday brunch, and it was amazing. The food was really tasty.. it was tapas style, so we ordered 6 dishes and shared them into 5 (Plus: they give you refills on those said tapas! So no need to fight over the last bite). Our server, Eduardo, was on point and really helpful and friendly. Definetely will come back next time we're in Vegas.
We didnt have a reservation, and got a nice table on the patio... I'd still recomend to make a reservation (it's Vegas, everything is busy lol)
