I loved my meal but not the service so I'll focus on the lunch. I ordered the Yucatan Pork plate and was thoroughly impressed.  While we were waiting to be seated a woman already eating said,  "this is the worst Mexican food I've ever had." Considering the location and reputation of the chef I thought that was a little overly dramatic and possibly overstated but it still made me concerned.   Anyway the menu was full of standards--quesadillas and taco options--but I wanted to have something that required enough effort that the chef couldn't just mindlessly throw it together so I chose the Yucatan Pork.
It was a business lunch so I was concerned that the portion would be a little much but I went for it and so did the gentleman seated next to me (a former bball player built like a lineman, so my portion question remained). 
The pork was tender, fall apart, melt in your mouth good and season perfectly. The mountain of pork was more than enough and so distracting that the tasteless tortilla accompaniment was unnecessary and unmissed.  A side of sweet plantains with a bit of crunch was excellent!  I considered taking my table mates portion since they weren't of interest to him but kept some form of etiquette and decorum.  I'm not sure what the concoction was but the black bean paste on the side was another great edition with the cheese and rice.
Ignore the mile long trek through the restaurant to be seated outside on a freezing Vegas afternoon, and the young "too busy for you" waitstaff and I would go back specifically for this dish!
