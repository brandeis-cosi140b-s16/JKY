Stopped in for the Sunday brunch and was not disappointed.

Brunch consists of a large menu of small plate items to choose from, all made as you order.
Everything I had was wonderful, except for the bacon and peanut butter biscuit thing. Just not a good combo of flavors, even though I love bacon.

The machaca chilaquiles were wonderful, as well as their eggs Benedict. When you get the brunch though, be prepared to eat a LOT of eggs.

I think it was about $30 per person, but it was good quality food. For another...$8 I think, you can add bottomless mimosas. You can even get one more mimosa to go :)

If you're in Vegas and need a great hangover recovery meal, this is it.
