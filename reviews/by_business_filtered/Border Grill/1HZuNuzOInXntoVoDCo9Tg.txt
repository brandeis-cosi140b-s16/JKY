We came here on recommendation from a friend who finds it hard to find decent Mexican food in Vegas. 

The good? They have pretty good service, decent guacamole, and my friend's scallops were great, just doused in sauce. Oh, and she ordered a blood orange margarita that was delicious!

The rest of our meal? Salsas are quite bland, the steak nachos were covered in some orange sauce that made my stomach do somersaults almost immediately...Strangely enough, the carne asada on our nachos was better then the carne asada plate we ordered. Also, I specifically asked what veggies came with the meal because they said we could substitute. The waitress told me squash and zucchini. Perfect! My friend and I both ordered the veggies. When our meals were served, she got the veggies and the ones on my plate were tomatoes and cucumber--more like a tiny Greek salad. I was highly annoyed. For dessert, I just ordered my toddler berries with whipped cream. The berries came in a bowl of a side dish--maybe a dozen total. The whipped cream was a side of creme fraiche. For a toddler. Really? She's two. "Me no like it" is what kept coming out of her mouth. 

Lastly, the pricing. I paid $138 for two appetizers, two main courses, a tiny bowl of fruit, one alcoholic drink and two sodas--and only ate about 65% of the meal. Huge disappointment. What I'm more confused about is the pricing of the items. I understand it's Vegas and you pay for location. Seriously. I get it. But since when do scallops and shrimp have the same price as a quesadilla or enchiladas?? I'll admit, the quesadilla looked appetizing, but my soul wouldn't let me order it. Quesadillas are what we eat when we need to throw something together quick!

I would not eat here again. I would rather spend more money and indulge my taste buds. I think most of us don't enjoy their meal when it's overpriced and below satisfactory. My bf barely finished the meal and in the words of our daughter said, "me no like it."
