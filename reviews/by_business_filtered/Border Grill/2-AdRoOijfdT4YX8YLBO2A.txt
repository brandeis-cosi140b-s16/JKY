Had dinner there last night. It was amazing!  My waiter, John was the best - felt truly taken cared for. When I told him I was in Vegas to decompress after a deployment he gave me a huge welcome home hug!  
Now the food; started with border grill classics -- yum - my fav was the empanadas and the quinoa fritter; tamale was just ok but John added a beef brisket flauta OMG!!! Yes!!! I decided to eat more - LOL - and ordered a carne asada quesadilla. All I can say is everything was off the chain!  Muaaah- thank you Border Grill!  This is a must eat place when-in Vegas!!!
