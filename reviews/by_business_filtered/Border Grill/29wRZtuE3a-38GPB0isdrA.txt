I really wanted to like the food here. It yelped well so I took a chance knowing well hotel food usually sucks. I had the tortilla soup. It was more like tomato basil with tofu and some tortilla strips. $14. Not great. Not worth the money. I next had grilled fish tacos. They were OK however the rice and beans were cold. And, why is it you can never get decent hot sauce?  Good service. Bad food. Good ambiance.
