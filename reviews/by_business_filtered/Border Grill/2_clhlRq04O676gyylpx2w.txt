Wondering around Mandalay while a little lost and hungover and encountered Border Grill for brunch.  The hostess seems a little confused about what the plan was since we wasn't selling it over well.  Once we figured out what the deal was, I was very exicted to eat there.  For $25 (or $30 with bubbles), you got to order from a Mexican style tapas menu with about 20 items.  It's also an all you can eat set up, so you can taste as many of the items on the menu as possible. 

The same hostess tried to seat us at the worse table in the restaurant - a 2 top right by the kitchen door.  I asked if we could set anyplace else and she seems confused (again).  Luckily we got a larger table and everything went pretty smooth after that.  For some reason our waitor was held up somewhere and the manager came over to explain.  I'm glad that we ended up with the waitor that we did because she was friendly and did a great job.

We also tried a couple of their cocktails.  Since some of the other people mentioned that water issue - here is my take.  We were charged $1 for two waters and they must make their own water because it comes in special containers and tastes much softer.  Nothing like a $100 breakfast for two!
