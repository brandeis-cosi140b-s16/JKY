Met a college buddy today for lunch at the bar!
He ordered the shrimp tacos, I did the fish. We then traded each other one. 
This fish was moist, topped with a nice slaw and creamy guacamole. 
The shrimp, a bit spicy but tasty. They too had a nice slaw topping. 
Both were served with black beans, a cilantro rice and spanish rice. Both rices were very flavorful. 
Speaking of flavor, the trio of sauces and chips they serve you before hand are delicious. The green sauce... I could drink by the gallon! 
Service was great and quick... 
Definitely a place to reccommend to friends who are staying at Mandalay Bay. 
For locals, its not the easiet place to get into...
