Went on Valentine's Day, was amazing. Literally shed tears at how beautiful it was. We sat up stairs outside, being from the east cost and coming to vegas in the Winter time and being surrounded by palm trees was amazing.  The food blew my mind. Was the best food I have ever had. The desert was even better, believe it or not . I am not a huge desert person, but wow did it blow me out my seat. It was amazing and by far my favorite place to go to now when I spend time in vegas. Loved it, and they had a locals discount, extra points for them! Loved it, if you are debating on going , don't debate anymore. GO! You will not regret it!!
