Border Grill is located in Mandalay Bay, just down the hall from the wedding chapel.

When I visited, my friends wanted to sit outside on the patio.  One plus is the patio outside is completely covered.  It's almost like a room with just the one wall to the outside missing.  So you get the breeze and the fresh air, but still feel like you're slightly indoors.  Also, the patio overlooks a pool with a stage and you can enjoy whatever live music may be playing.

Another plus is their menu has a lot of different and interesting items from which to choose.  I ordered chicken panuchos, which is black bean stuffed tortillas with chicken.  I've never seen black beans stuffed into the middle of a tortilla before, so that gave it a nice twist.  But unfortunately, the chicken was very dry.  I had to add A LOT of salsa to give it some moistness.   

A couple of negatives.  The restaurant has this weird policy that they bring you their special filtered water and pour your glasses, and if they refill your glasses - then they charge you extra.  It's stated on their menu, but the problem I have is - why even bring the water without asking if the table wants it?  And the waiter didn't fill one of the glasses full, and although the person never touched the water - he filled it up to the top when he returned.  This meant we would have been charged, when he never even filled it all the way to begin with!  Sneaky?  You be the judge.

The other negative is, there is no restroom on site.  You have to go somewhere downstairs, which is a little ways to walk.  Instead, I went down the hall to the wedding chapel.  If you don't make eye contact with the receptionist, you can go in and the restroom is right there at the entrance :)
