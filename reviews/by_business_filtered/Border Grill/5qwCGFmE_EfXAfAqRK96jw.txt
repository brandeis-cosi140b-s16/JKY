Good good and mmmm good. 
Was in Vegas for a trade show and came here for a sit at the bar order a few things and share kind of lunch. DEEEELISH!! Guacamole was delicious, as were the carne asada quesadillas and ceviche and the steak salad OMG all sooo goood!! If your idea of great Mexican is Rosa the rip off Mexicano then get ready for a wonderful treat. If you are staying at the Mandalay Bay or at The Hotel and you want to throwdown some great Mexican ... totally hit Border Grill. YUM!
