I had ordered the tortilla soup because I am a big (huge) fan of tortilla soup. And I have to say that it felt that the soup was maybe chilled? It was really chunky. I liked it but it was more spicy than anything. I couldn't finish the whole thing. I didn't like it. The soup itself was good because it was thick and not brothy. I liked it. 

I had then the chicken quesadilla and I have to say that this was enough for just an entree. It was large. Others had the carne and said it was delicious too. 

Overall, the food was decent but I wouldn't go back for the food. I'd go back for the service. Our service was amazing.
