This is probably more like 2.5 stars. I've always been suspicious of Two Hot Tamales but gave this place a try because it is in our hotel. We had a sample platter to split with three dishes: Chicken panuchos, green corn tamales and plantain empanadas. The plantain empanadas were by far the best of the three. Basically, the exterior of the "empanada" is a seared plantain stuffed with a cheesy black bean mix. It is topped with a spicy sauce and a generous amount of crema. Delicious. I could have eaten a whole platter of these.

The other two dishes were weaker. The green corn tamale was more like a polenta in terms of texture. The flavor was good but a bit sweet even for me (I love sweet). Still, topped with crema and salsa it was tasty enough.

But the chicken panuchos were inexcusable. The chicken was utterly flavorless. The avocado was nice and the radishes added a much needed bit of brightness but the chicken was so lackluster that it dragged down the whole dish.

The complimentary salsas were also weak: none of them had any spice and at least two of them were extremely bland.

Service was friendly and efficient. Cocktails were delicious and standard 
Vegas prices.

A fine place for a quick casual bite but nothing to write home about.
