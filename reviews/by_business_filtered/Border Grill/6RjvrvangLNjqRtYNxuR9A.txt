We had drinks at the bar before a  concert a couple of weeks ago and they were good...girlfriend liked the sangria margarita?  On the way out stopped for a bite to eat and I found the food okay.  The mole was pumpkin seed and did not find out until I finished mine that they had the traditional mole as well.  Chips and salsa were good.  However, I guess I was expecting more based on my knowledge and hype of the restaurant.
