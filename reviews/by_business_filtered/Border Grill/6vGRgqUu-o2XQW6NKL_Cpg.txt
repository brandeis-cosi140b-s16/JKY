We had dinner here, we eat out a lot and I have to say by far we received the best service we have ever had at any restaurant.  Rachel started us off and Crystal took over, both were incredibly personal, attentive and very knowledgable.  The food was outstanding, flavorful, hot and large portions.  If you like grits, you MUST try the Tecate Carnita's.  There were six of us so we ordered quite a few dishes...the Queso Fundido was very good and any dish with the short ribs I highly recommend!  I could go on about this place, but I think you get the picture. We will definitely be back.  It's located at Mandalay Bay.
