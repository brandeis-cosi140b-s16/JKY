I came to this Border Grill a few years ago and pretty much hated it.  So I avoided the chain all together until this past weekend.  My fiance and I were staying at the Four Seasons and wanted to have lunch outside within close proximity to our pool.  We sucked it up and went to Border Grill.  My fiance had a hackerin' for some ceviche and I really wanted a cocktail with lunch.  They had a special Spring menu chalk full of goodies.  We started out with two lemon blueberry mojitos and shared the ceviche.  The mojitos were one of the best I have had.  It was a perfect call from the waiter.  As for the ceviche we couldn't get enough of it.  There was nothing left.  To complete our lunch we split their Chicken Panuchos.  They're like mini harsh shell tacos.  The tortillas of the tacos are stuff with black beans and then fried.  Of course this was devoured.  This dining experience has changed my opinion completely about the Border Grill chain.
