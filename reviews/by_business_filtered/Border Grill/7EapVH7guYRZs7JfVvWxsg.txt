I don't know why, but I tend to be Mexican food averse in the face of other options. Maybe because I live in San Diego and have lived in Tucson - both places with exceptional, traditional Mexican fare. But, Border Grill is outside the Convention Center at Mandalay Bay, so I end up there when at abrade shows.

And the food never disappoints.

The house made tortilla chips come with three delicious salsas. Addicting. Fresh, crunchy and perfectly salty. The salsas are insanely good - very flavorful.

I had the flank steak which was so very good. Perfectly seared, perfectly sliced, perfectly cooked (medium rare). Came with a tasty corn relish (vert good) and black beans (which were just okay). My friend had a quesadilla, which seemed pretty basic, but which he inhaled.

The service was great, the food perfect. Great job, ladies! Two stars off because, as others have mentioned, it was overpriced. Way overpriced.
