"It's like a dim sum for brunch".  This place is sooooo gooooood!   You order 2 things, they bring it out on a small plate and you can share it, then you order 2 more things while you are chewing round 1.  Everything we tried was good (except the Oyster Rockefeller)  sampled almost everything on the menu.  They are the perfect size so that you can try everything and not get too stuffed... well, not TOO stuffed ;-P  We will definitely come back here. Brunch is served Sat and Sun 10-3
