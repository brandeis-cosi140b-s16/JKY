If you have the power to write what every you want with out any recourse. You need to be responsible. I am still learning this, just because I don't like something. Doesn't mean someone else won't like it! After posting a 1-star review on Border Grill, their management messaged me and asked for me to come back again. They were willing to make it right. When a restaurant is reaching out and trying to make right. You have to give it to them. Now I did tell them, I probably will not go back. Because I am rarely at the Mandalay Bay! But I did appreciate the offer! So! I am going to add another star, I am still not impressed with their food, and we might have been their  on a bad day for them. That does happen!
