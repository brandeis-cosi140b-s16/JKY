Went to Border Grill in the Madalay Bay Hotel. We had the lunch salad special-WOW. It was served with chicken, but I asked for Talapia instead and Tom had the chicken. The salad was an amazing blend of hot, sweet, and tart. The salad had slices of nectarines, peaches, grapes and spiced candied walnuts. The service was outstanding and Tom Davis was our waiter. The guacamole is the best and the sparkling peach lemonade was outstanding. We had half a piece of the chocolate pie that had the perfect amount of cinnamon. It would be a place to go again and again. Outstanding.
