Complimentary chips come with 3 kinds of salsa. I had the chicken tortilla soup because I had too much to drink and wasn't up for real eating. Soup was good and chunky with chicken. Extra tortilla strips and lime, please.

My friend had the enchiladas. He asked for the red sauce to be put on the side but the waiter said it couldn't be done (what?!) and his plate came flooded with sauce.

Anyway, we came in between the normal lunch and dinner area and sat in the quiet balcony-patio area. I saw that it was packed with people during lunch hours on my way to see the shark reef aquarium. 

Was a very pleasant time.
