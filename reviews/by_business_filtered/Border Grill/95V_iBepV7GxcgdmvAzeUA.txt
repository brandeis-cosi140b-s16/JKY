Came for the brunch & the unlimited mimosas in a variety of flavored! The strawberry basil is amazing! The brunch is all you can eat in small plates so it gives you a chance to try a little bit of everything. I had some firsts that I had not had before...the Oyster Taco, Peruvian Shrimp and Grits and the Churro Tots:) I voted for the owners on Top Chef! Mary Sue Miliken and Susan Fenigen. Loved her so was very excited to come to her restaurant.
