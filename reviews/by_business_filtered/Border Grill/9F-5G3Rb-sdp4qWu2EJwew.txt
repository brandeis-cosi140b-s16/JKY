This place is off the beaten path and worth finding.   It's hidden on the way to the convention center.  Probably the only restaurant that has both indoor and outdoor seating.

If you're doing the quick lunch at convention time, this place is a go to.

 Their tuna crudo is an omg.  

Bruce the manager has game on.  

Good selection of beer.  Margarita menu is exceptional.
