We were very pleasantly surprised by our dinner. If we had looked at the menu online we probably wouldn't have come in. Sitting down looking at the menu we were a little skeptical that it didn't seem like traditional Mexican food. Don't let that stop you from coming in. I had the brisket taquitos and they were so good. My friends had quesadillas and they were made with fresh tasty tortillas. They didn't stop raving about how good the tortilla were. The guac at our table was really good as well.  The chips are fresh and crunchy. I ordered a pineapple vanilla margarita and it was delicious. 
The patio is great because it's covered so we weren't hot out there.
Our server was very knowledgeable and so friendly. Fast service and always had fresh drinks ready to go.
