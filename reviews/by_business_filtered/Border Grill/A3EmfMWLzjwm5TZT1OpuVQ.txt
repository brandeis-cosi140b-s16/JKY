I wish I could have given this place a 5...I really do.  The food was excellent.  My friend had the chicken mole and I had the chicken enchiladas...delicious!  The service was great...until the storm hit.  All of a sudden there was crazy wind and rain, and I guess their computers went down.  We waited for over 30 minutes in order to get our check.  Our poor server tried his best to keep us happy, but he was a bit frazzled himself.  After finding out it was only his 3rd day on the job, I was much more impressed with how he handled things.  If it wasn't for that crazyness, and no manager addressing our table when it all happened, there would have been 5 stars.  Good food.  Job well done, Jason.  Thank you for the birthday cake!
