We had a completely disappointing meal here in March 2015.  I picked Border Grill for a group dinner before a concert at Caesar's.  My boyfriend and I had eaten at the other Vegas location in Mandalay Bay 6 months ago and had such an amazing meal, decided to try this location.

The service was awful and the food unmemorable.  We waited 25 minutes for our drinks when finally one of our friends had to get up and find out when they'd be bringing out our drink order.  They did bring appetizers on the house as compensation but the food was just all bland.  I had the steak tacos and the meat was disgustingly chewy.  

So disappointed and as someone who really values food, was frustrated that I had raved about Border Grill to our party and we all thought it was awful.
