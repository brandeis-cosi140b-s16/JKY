Ever watch the Food Network? Do remember that old cooking show (not currently on anymore) with those women who cooked exotic dishes? No, not the Two Fat Ladies! I'm talking about the Two Hot Tamales: Mary Sue Milliken and Susan Feniger! Anyway, they are the masterminds behind Border Grill.

This location (there's at least one more that I know of in Pasadena, CA) is in the beautiful Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino, on the Sin City strip. It's kinda tucked way back in the hotel, but I'll travel out of my way just to eat here. 

Anyway, I love this place. I was walking through the casino one night with my wife and I saw a sign pointing down towards no man's land. I thought the name sounded familiar and remembered the Two Hot Tamales from TV. Lo and behold, this was, in fact, the same Border Grill I'd tried in LA years ago. This place was a whole lot different than what I'd experienced in LA though. This place was hipper, funkier, more colorful, and in Vegas for cryin' out loud! Woo-hoo! Vegas, baby!

Border Grill serves up some righteous Mexican/Southwestern/Cuban fusion-hybrid food that has my mouth watering just thinking about it...mmmm... We started our meal with complimentary chips and salsa. However, the salsa was an experience in itself. We received a trio of salsas that were excellent. I'd write more about them, but I don't recall what was in them (roasted tomatoes, chipotle peppers, tomatillos...something like that). It may have also been the tasty mojito and margarita I had before the meal that altered my memory of the meal...*hic!*

Our entrees were delicious as well. I ordered a steak (well-seasoned and juicy) while my wife ordered the carnitas. Both dishes were so good that we couldn't stop talking about it the next day. Maybe if we had won some money we could've gone back for more. Oh well...

I highly recommend Border Grill for anyone staying in the Mandalay or within a 100-mile radius of Las Vegas. I can't wait for my next meal here...
