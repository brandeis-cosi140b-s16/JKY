I've been to this location twice in my past 2 vegas trips and I must say the meal was one of the best dining experiences I have had in a while. 
Both times that I've been here we got the brunch option which i believe is only available Saturdays and Sundays not sure about friday i forget. It is a bit pricey there were about 8 of us all got the brunch option with bottomless mimosas and it came out to about $45 each, but all totally worth it.

Brunch gives you the a list of BOTTOMLESS "small plates" options ranging from a tres leches french toast, chilaquiles, and huevos rancheros i believe there are 21 options to choose from and I suggest going on a empty stomach if you go for brunch because its each one of those plates are amazing! If you go in a big group you can order in a sort of family style and they bring out a good amount of that one dish so it comes out faster and everyone can try a little bit of it all. 
The tres leches french toast is hands down one of my favorites, I also recommend the steak and eggs, huevos rancheros, and definitely the chilaquiles fersure. 
Also get the bottomless mimosas, they have a ton of different flavors, i tried all of them and let me tell you they were all good.

Service was just perfect both times ive gone, I forgot both their names cuz i usually leave too drunk because of the mimosas lol but they were both super friendly and fast.
At one single moment I 3 people helping take out my dirty empty plates, fill my empty glass of water, take my order for my next mimosa and ask if everything was good. We were all impressed. 

All in all, great food, great atmosphere, amazing service, and I will definitely be coming back on my next trip.
