Was not super impressed other than the great view and homemade chips. The dished looked lovely, but my carnitas was greasy and unappetizing even though it came recommended by my companion. She got a pork and plantain special that she liked. The rice was dry and didn't look/taste very appetizing. Blood orange lemonade which was also recommended was SO sweet. The place was busy.
