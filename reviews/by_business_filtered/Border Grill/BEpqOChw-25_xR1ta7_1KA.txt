This place has a variety of Mexican/Tex Mex as well as latin food and I only say latin because I had the torta Cubana but for the most part the menu has to offer more Mexican dishes than anything else. It is located at the Mandalay Bay hotel. All of our dishes taste wonderful, I really enjoyed each and every one of them. They start you off with Chips and 3 different types of salsa. We then had a plate of fresh fruit drizzled with honey, empanadas were also good. Next we had the queso fundido topped with  chorizo and a side of  flour tortillas. I also had the Tortilla soup and it was delish!. Our main dish torta cubana and pulled pork followed by dessert, flan. I highly highly recommend this place. Service is very good.
