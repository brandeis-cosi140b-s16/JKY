Mexican food with a twist! Everything we ate at Border Grill was great and our waiter was funny and had great suggestions. 

We had the queso, guacamole, and each had a different entree. I had the chicken poblano enchiladas and they were delicious. Everything was very tasty and we were all happy with the meal. The drinks are very good as well. I recommend the Cucumber Cooler. It's a little pricey, but that's the same most places in Vegas.
