Very nice spot 7n the end of mandala bay, directly located beside the pool. We come here very spontanious, as we decide to eat mexican and headed to mandalay bay hotel&resort. 

We then asked inside the hotel and they have 2 mex restaurants in mandalay. We have done the right decision to choose border grill. Avery awesome experience from the beginning. 

The service was very friendly and helpful. He gibe us the advise to try the plates dinner as we asked several questions about the meals. Its a all you can eat deal annd so then you cannorder diffrent meals. Wagyu beef tacos, and steaks have been delicious! All the plates come in a smaller size so you canntry several plates. We had around 6-8 each. 

We also liked the place here. Nice decoration, style and overal look. It was a bit crowdy bit thats normal for such a good place at around 8 pm. 

Definetly can highly recommend this spot when you like mexican food. Very friendly and fast service, amazing meals and choice and nice atmosphere!!
