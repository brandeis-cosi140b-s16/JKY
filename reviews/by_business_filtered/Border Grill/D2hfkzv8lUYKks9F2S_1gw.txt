My favorite new ceviche place in Vegas!!!!! On the bottom right of my pic is my absolute fave I've ever ordered out: aguachile verde featuring calamari, Alaska King crab, avocado, cucumber serrano broth (so tasty we wanted to drink it!!!) and mango (to compliment the flavor but not too much that it tastes sweet) On the left is the Peruvian ceviche with fresh mani mahi, lime, ginger, aji amarillo chile & plantain chips.. & the best chips, warm & freshly made w/the perfect amount of salt & thickness (not too thin & not too thick). The salsa trio that comes with your food is bomb (dark red smokey salsa and the green tomatillo are the best). Must try! @ The Forum Shops @ Caesars in Vegas, ask for Darlene if you want IMPECCABLE service.
