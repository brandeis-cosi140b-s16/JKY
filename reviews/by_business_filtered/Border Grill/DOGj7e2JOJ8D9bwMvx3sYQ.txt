There are so many great restaurants in LV now - you have my permission to AVOID this one. Worst food I should have just downed the salt shaker I would have saved time waiting for what was a salt laden and uneatable meal. The drinks and doused in sugar and I don't even like the chips I caught a few stale ones and those leave a horrible taste in your mouth.
