Went here on a whim.  Had Brunch on Saturday.  $39 per person.  $10 for unlimited mimosas.  This is the best deal for brunch on the Strip.  There is a menu of about 25 different things to choose from.   They are small plates.  You can have as many of you want of anything.  The ceviche tasted fresh we liked it do much we had another round of it.  My husband doesn't normally like ceviche but he enjoyed this one.  The lettuce wrap had a chipotle aioli that was to die for.  Smokey with just a little hint of heat.  chilaquiles were delicious too.  Every plate was better than the last. They don't rush you either so you can sit for as long as you like.     They had a great deal of gluten free options too.  Our waiter Matt (?) was friendly and made some really good suggestions.   The manager also stopped by the table and was super friendly.  She honestly seemed to care what we thought.  Can't wait to go back.
