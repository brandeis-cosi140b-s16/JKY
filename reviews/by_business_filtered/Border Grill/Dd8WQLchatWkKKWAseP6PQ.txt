This is a strong 3, but not quite 4. Still pretty good. I stopped here the last day of my stay in Vegas, after walking past every day of the previous 4, and thinking it looked nice. And it was.

I had the shrimp and chorizo taquitos, which were tasty but a little schizophrenic. The shrimp and chorizo was an odd (but good) combination, even if neither are particularly strong, but the three taquitos were served "glued" to the plate by some good tangy guac...topped with a sweet lobster cream sauce...and then with a vinegar dressed cabbage salad with roasted corn. Lots of stuff going on here, and all of it is good, but it's a lot of fighting flavors. Not that I didn't eat all of it, mind you. That wasn't a problem.

I will say their outdoor patio is nice - I was there on a very nice day, and it was really pleasant to sit outside, look out over the pool, and watch nearly tame finches dart amongst the tables, swooping in to grab the tortilla chips I kept tossing on the ground, and anything people left behind at the table for anything more than a microsecond. I found myself very contented. If I was back, and I was close, I would probably go back for a nothing special type of meal when I want up for anything requiring more effort. But I don't know if it'd make a journey for it, especially considering everything else I've eaten this week.
