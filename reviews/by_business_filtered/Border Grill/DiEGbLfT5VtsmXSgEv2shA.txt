My husband and I enjoyed Sunday Brunch at this Border Grill location.  We were very excited about the small plate concept and were not disappointed.  We both ordered different small plates so we could sample as many as possible.  Some of our favorites were the Yucatan egg benedict, fried green tomatillos, and the steak and egg.  We also enjoyed the Chicken on a waffle - it has a kick to it.  All the dishes were creative in combining flavors and delicious!  We included the bottomless mimosas since we were on vacation in Vegas.  Service was excellent and had no problem with us spacing out our orders of small plates so we could enjoy our drinks and the location.
