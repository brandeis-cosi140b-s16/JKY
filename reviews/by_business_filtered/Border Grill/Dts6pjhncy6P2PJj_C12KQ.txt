I had gone here for a little anniversary dinner with my wife, and all I can say is i have had better service at the hole in the wall diner. We sat down and in a matter of minutes we are ordering our appetizer, entree, and dessert. We felt rushed,like they wanted us out of the place ASAP. We got our appetizer and before we could get half way done our entree's were placed on the other side of the table. When we finished our app, we started our entree and it was starting to get cold. it took forever to get more water to our table as well. So for most of the meal we were thirsty. After the entree's were cleared from our table, the dessert took forever to come. A serious lack of expertise in the Expoditor if there was one. I have Expo-ed before and never have made this much of an error in judgment of time for food service. doubt I'll go back unless there is like a 50% coupon or something in my pocket, maybe happy hour if they have one.
