i think the only reason it's not getting that precious 5th star is due to the price.  i probably wouldn't have flinched at night, but for lunch it was a bit more than i'd planned on spending.  we were looking for something a bit less intense than what we'd been splurging on for dinner, without having to resort to the pitiful food court near the convention center.

the food, however, was incredible.  we picked up some freshly prepared guac to go with our chips and 3 salsas (diverse and fresh tasting).  i had a mint mojito with cucumber-infused vodka (heaven, but i'm not sure when something ceases to be a mojito and is just "with mint and simple syrup" ;)

i ordered a salad of the special menu that was full of tasty things. i can't even remember everything but i know there was rock shrimp and avocado, and ... grapefruit? and 100 other things i'd never put together in a salad but thoroughly enjoyed.  my husband raved about his tacos almost as much.  both dishes came highly recommended by the waiter, who clearly knew his way around the menu.

along with all this good food was outdoor seating complete with misters--exactly what you need on a hot summer's day.
