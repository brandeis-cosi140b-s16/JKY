I can't believe I haven't written a review of Border Grill before now.  I have had dinner and just drinks here many times and have enjoyed each time.  My fiance wanted to go to the Wisin & Yandel concert at the beach on Sunday but we didn't buy tickets in time, so we had drinks at Border Grill so we could listen for free.  Clint was our bartender and he made me a wonderful Mai Tai ($12) and then he brought us free chips and salsa (perfect).  We always have wonderful service and I think it has something to do with the women who own this (you can catch each of them on the celebrity chef competitions on TV now & then). Sign up for their locals discount card (free) and emails about specials.  It is worth it.
