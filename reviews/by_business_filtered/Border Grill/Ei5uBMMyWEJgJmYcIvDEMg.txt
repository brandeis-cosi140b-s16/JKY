I really wish that review scores were divided based on meal times. 

THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE UNLIMITED TAPAS BRUNCH:

This started out really good. First we had the quesadillas, they were everything that I wanted them to be, cheesy with a little spice to it. Then we got the biscuits and gravy, so good. (Did I mention Im from Texas). Then it started to go downhill from there. There was a huevos ranchero dish that was kind of bland and boring. Then we had these salmon sliders. I wanted to like these so badly but the prominent taste was goat cheese and it was too overpowering that I had a bite and I was done with it. The next dish was a PBJ with a jalapeno in it. The waiter raved that it was the best thing ever, he lied. It made me feel regret if anything. The other items we had seemed like the same thing just with different sauce: biscuit eggs sauce. So boring I cant even remember them. Then there was the churros. I will shit you not, these were literally donut holes with hersheys syrup and a nasty orange thing with it. The bacon bloody mary was OK and for an extra $10 unlimited mimosas but it didn't make up for the food.

Susan Feniger is one of my favorite chiefs and was so underwhelmed by this restaurant. It made me feel as if I broke up with someone. Im going to go buy a tub of ice cream and eat my feelings.
