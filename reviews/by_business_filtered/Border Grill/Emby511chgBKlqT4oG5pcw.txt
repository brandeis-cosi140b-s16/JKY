It has been way too long since I've been here. Great place to eat on the strip, but it's not one I'd frequent a lot because of the pricing . I have fond memories of dining here with my Mom. The food was great, I do remember sharing their appetizer plate, it was more affordable and a good selection if you couldn't decide! I need to go back...
