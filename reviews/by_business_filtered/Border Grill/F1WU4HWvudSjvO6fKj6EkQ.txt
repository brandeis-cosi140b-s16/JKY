Fresh unique Mexican food. My family ate here at 9:30 PM. We were tired and have been eating crap food the past three days. It was refreshing and delicious to eat here. Everything is fresh! I got the fish tacos (grilled ahi) and my kids had the carne asada tacos. Both plates were an A+ in my book. It wasn't too much or too little food. The service was excellent. Drinks always full, and I never had to wait for anything. They are kid friendly and do have a children's menu. I recommend this place.
