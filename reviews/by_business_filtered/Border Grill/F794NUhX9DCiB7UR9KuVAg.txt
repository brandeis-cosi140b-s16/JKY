So you get 3 awesome salsa with chips when you sit down. We had a few Cinco de Mayo inspired drinks which were appropriate considering it was May the 5th. My man ordered a chile relleno burger which he loved. I had the fish tacos... I have to say we had just landed and went straight there, I was a little hungry. My stomach hurt after the first taco and I still dusted the plate cause I couldn't stop-too good.
