Had the Sunday brunch.  It was pretty excellent food. All you can eat and for $10 more they have unlimited mimosas. As for the food it was served tapas style.  Was a little concerned about how quick they would get the food out to us but the service  was on point and the food was fresh.  Would definitely go here again.  I only  drop it down one star because it's a little pricy ($35 without mimosas) but still worth it
