Went back tonight for dinner with some good friends and it was delicious!!!     We started with the Baja Ceviche and the Scallops with Peruvian potatoes for our appetizers.   I had the Chicken Tinga Empanadas which I loved.  My friends had the fish tacos and corn tamales.  We all left very full and extremely satisfied.  The servers were wonderful, always there to refill our drinks and see how we were doing even though it was a busy Saturday night.  I would recommend this place to locals as well as visitors to Las Vegas. 

 I have watched Top Chef Susan Feniger and love that I am able to go to her restaurant here locally.  Each time I have gone I have had different selections from the menu and I am never disappointed.
