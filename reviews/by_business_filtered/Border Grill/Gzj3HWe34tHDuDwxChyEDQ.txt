Carmie! Carmie! Carmie! My husband and I went to brunch with another couple today. We were greeted at the hostess stand by two young ladies. The four if us were seated immediately. We sat indoors, there was a wait for the patio. 
Carmie, our delightful server, came right over to the table and introduced herself. She took our drink orders, mimosas for the ladies ($8 extra for endless) and coffee for the gentlemen. We all decided to have the brunch. It is very cool how it is small plates, like a buffet, but you never have to get up from the table. At this point Carmie took over our experience. She anticipated all of our needs, she took the liberty of starting us off with a few things, and when she saw that we were all sharing and passing plates and having fun, she just kept them coming. She brought mimosa refils right on time. Just as my colleague was about to place his empty coffee cup on the table, she was filling it up. IT WAS AMAZING!!!! Before we knew it we had tried one of everything. Carmie asked if we wanted seconds on anything. We ordered two more things and tapped out.  Outstanding service!! The food was so good that I didn't even think to take pictures of it.... everything was incredible.
Must trys: brisket omelet, breakfast fries, French toast, biscuits and gravy & of course ALL THE MIMOSAS!!! Thanks Carmie!!! We'll be back!
