Three star food - plus another star for good service during a busy tradeshow and it's away from the tradeshow floor. I think this will be my standard place for eating lunch during conventions. 

I'm in the Mandalay Bay Convention Center multiple times out of the year - and when I want to eat, I want some form of reasonable peace and quiet. Well - I won't get absolute peace and quiet here during a tradeshow - but what I will get is reasonably healthy lunch that is more reasonably priced that that replicated crap that is served at the Food Court. 

Yes, it's a bit of a further walk - but an extra few minutes of walking, I can usually get a seat at the bar in a few minutes, have a shot or two to take the edge off, enjoy my fish tacos, chips and salsa and then head back into battle with the convention.
