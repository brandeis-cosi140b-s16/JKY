Had the brunch and ceviche sampler plus a large $30 coconut mojito and avocado colada. Food and service was great. Also found the plates charming. Bonus for the portions being perfectly sized. I felt like I was finally tasting top chef food straight out of the TV show and it exceeded my expectations.
