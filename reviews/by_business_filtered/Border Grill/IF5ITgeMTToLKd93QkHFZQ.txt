Went to pick up some tickets at the House of Blues in Mandalay and thought to stop in and try this place out.  Attending conventions at the Convention Center in Mandalay Bay, I usually scurried by this restaurant and didn't stop to take too much notice.  The only thing I did notice was that it was always busy (good sign?).  Amber K. suggested we try it out as it has good reviews on Yelp and since we were in the area, I said 'why not?'  We walked up and were quickly seated and attended to promptly by our waiter Lars for the remainder of the night.  I decided to try the soft shell crab tostada appetizer and roll with the grilled mahi mahi tacos for my main entree.  The food was very nice and Lars also hooked it up with some habanero salsa for our chips in between each course of the meal.  We finished off the night with a "Mexican" banana split which consisted of mexican chocolate, pineapple, and raspberry ice cream topped off with a little bit of coconut.

Overall, the food was delish and I left sastified.  Also, just being locals, Lars signed us up for the Border Grill VIP card which gave "VIP" locals like myself 15% off of the bill every time we rolled into Border for anything outside of happy hour.  Good night?  I think so.  Will be back soon to try one of the many other options available at the Border Grill!
