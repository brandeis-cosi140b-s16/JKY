I have to take the time and write you a 5 star review for our tremendous experience that we had yesterday & for the fact that Amber is a rock star! The food was delicious - the steak & eggs were amazing and the tres leches French toast was fantastic!  But really, Amber was awesome keeping the food & the five million different flavors of mimosas coming for the 4 hours we were there!
