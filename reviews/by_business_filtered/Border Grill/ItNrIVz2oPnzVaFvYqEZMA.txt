Border Grill is great for AYCE and drink Mimosas! AYCE - $35 with Bottomless Mimosas add $8. We sat outside on the covered balcony/patio which overlooks the Mandalay pool. The weather was great! The AYCE has about 20 different small dishes you can pick from. Mimosas had about 7-8 fresh juices to mixed your champagne with... By the time you try them all you're pretty buzzed. I think my favorite flavors were the Mango or Passion Fruit, which I had to get seconds of...

YUM! :
Skirt Steak & Eggs ** really good **
Peruvian Shrimp & grits
Plantain Empanada w/ passion fruit drizzle?
Breakfast Fries
Churro Tots

The service was great too. We were able to order right away each time, and the food came out fast. Can't wait to come back for the skirt steak and mimosas!
