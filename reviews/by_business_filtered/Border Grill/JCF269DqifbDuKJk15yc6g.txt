Best Brunch in Vegas! For about $35 per person, you can experience about 25 different small plates all of them prepared to order. My personal favorites are the French Toast (with berries, tres leches syrup and whipped cream), the oyster taco, the sweet corn tamale and the shrimp and grits. I've tried almost everything and trust me, all dishes are great, I just have my favorites. Service is excellent and best, no wait time on Sundays.
