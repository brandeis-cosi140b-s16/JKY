An elite brunch!

I've always been a fan of Border Grill but didn't even know until very recently they served brunch.  Went there this morning and I am still trying to break out of the food coma I was put in.  It's a tapas-style serving with a huge list of unique gastronomic concoctions.  Some really wild recipes... all very delicious.  The only thing I will say is that I was a little disappointed in the bacon bloody mary, but the food more than made up for that.  It's especially nice to be able to sit out on the patio in mid-November and enjoy the spread in this unusual warm weather.  Definitely try this out... foodies will enjoy it!
