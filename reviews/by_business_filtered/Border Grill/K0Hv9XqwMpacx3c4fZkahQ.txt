I have to start off by saying that my husband and I are food snobs from New York with very critical taste.   With that, we both agreed that Border Grill was probably the best meal we've ever had!!  It was our first meal in Vegas, and we were hungry and thirsty.  Our waitress, Carmie, suggested the brunch tasting menu and some fabulous drinks.  So happy we listened to her.  Everything we tasted was phenomenal and our drinks were on point.  The steak and eggs, tres leches french toast, serrano ham waffle, churro tots...MmmMmmM.... to die!!!!!!!!!!  Carmie was an excellent waitress!!!  She was personable and professional.  We can't wait to return.
