Just a disappointing experience since there is so many other great options to dine in Las Vegas.  I came with a party of 6 and half of us received the free margarita upon check in.  The margarita came before my glass of water - odd.  We were given the entree menus and were a bit hurried about ordering by the waitress.  We ordered.  After the order was placed, one of us in the party inquired out the cerviche bar we spotted when we walked in.  The waitress said they have a menu for it if we wanted it along with nightly specials.  It would have been nice if we were informed this before we were rushed to order because the specials looked a lot better than the boring menu options we chose from.  We all discussed how disappointed we were that the waitress didn't provide this simple duty and we guessed she might have heard us as she went MIA for most of our dinner.
Food comes and still not impressed.  I ordered the Chicken Poblano Enchiladas and it lacked something.  It was edible but not work the price or its place permanently on the menu.  
Again, our waitress was so poor that we all wished the other guy was our server.  
When walking out of a restaurant in Vegas, you want to feel like a million bucks.  Instead we felt like a few schmucks sneaking out of this basement cave.
