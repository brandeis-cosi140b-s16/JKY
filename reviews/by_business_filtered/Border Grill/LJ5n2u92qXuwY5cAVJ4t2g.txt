I feel like this is a Mexican food joint for white people palates but I enjoy it none the less!  It's a good bet if you're looking for a nice place to have dinner, its a good mix of laid back/fancy.  The few times I've been here I've tried the fish tacos which are thoroughly enjoyable but probably not worth the 23 dollars they charge, the chicken enchiladas which are delicious but for 26$? But its the strip so what did I expect right... I've also had the the market veggie quesadilla which is tasty, cheaper, and a good choice if you're vegetarian.  Bottom line this place is worth a visit if you're in the area but I probably wouldn't go out of my way for it.  A lot of their reviews seem to be for their brunch so maybe that's where its at, to be honest they probably deserve 3.5 stars but oh well
