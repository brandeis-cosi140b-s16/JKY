If you're staying at Mandalay Bay and have already hit up Burger Bar and are looking for another casual *RELATIVELY* inexpensive spot (this is the strip after all people), this place is a good spot to try. 

Cucumber Mojtio: Yummy and refreshing
Pomegranate Mojito: Just eh.. kinda had a strong artificial cherry taste. Not recommended. 
Baja Ceviche: Fresh and plenty to share.
Steak enchiladas ($23): Seemed to be an ongoing special of some kind (off the normal menu). Yummy steak with mole sauce.. very very good. If you aren't terribly hungry 2 could probably fill up on this + ceviche and chips making for a relatively inexpensive meal. I couldn't come close to finishing it by myself. 

Service was excellent. Bartenders were friendly. Best of all our waitress asked if we were locals and gave us a VIP card for 15% off everytime we come... every little bit helps in this pricey town!
