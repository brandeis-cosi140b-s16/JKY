The next time I'm in Vegas, I will be stopping here. My friend and I arrived pretty late--part of the restaurant was already shut down. We asked to sit outside and they made it happen. Our waiter was so great. I chose the "small plate" special for $49 and my friend chose the chicken enchiladas. I tried about eight dishes and love them all. Their mole sauce is excellent! And even though they were closing, we never felt rushed.
