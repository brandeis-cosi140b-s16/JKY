One of the best and cheapest brunches out there. For $35 you get unlimited brunch tapas, add $10 more and you get unlimited mimosas. This is a great idea for large groups as you can taste every single item on their brunch menu. Also, If you are tired of your regular orange juice mimosas they also offer champagne with pomegranate or passion fruit. I personally like sweet and fruity drinks so I enjoyed the passion fruit one the most. Must try dishes, the Chilaquiles, the chicken and waffles, the fried green tomatillos and steak and eggs.. Or if you can eat more just order one of each, at the end of the day every dish is unlimited! They also have two locations one at Caesars and one at Mandalay bay, both locations offer a nice atmosphere with good customer service! Must try, you will thank me!
