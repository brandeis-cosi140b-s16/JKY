Am a big fan of both Susan and Mary-Sue. Expected to be knocked out of my socks by these Top Chef Masters, fell short. First the location is way off the main area, not a good idea. The restaurants is classy with a California vibe. We got the complementary chips with the 3 salsas, salsas were OK, chips were fresh! We asked for a spicy sauce and got a good kick in the butt with the habenero chillies. Ordered bunch of appetizers - out of which the baja ceviche rocked, fresh fresh seafood. The other trio of appetizer included plantain empanadas (OK), corn cream tamales (too sweet) and the chicken tacos (best yet!). We also got the Mexican soup, nice! All in all the food was good but not crave worthy. Service was excellent with water refills, recommendations and offering of hot salsa. Best part of got 15% discount for being CA natives, go CALIFORNIA!
