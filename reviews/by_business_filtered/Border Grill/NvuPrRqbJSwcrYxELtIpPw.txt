Border Grill is not a bad restaurant by any stretch. Our dining experience started off great! We ordered the black cherry mojito and they brought out an order of chips and salsas. The chips were delicious! Hot, lightly salted, great flavor. All 3 of the salsas were tasty as well. Our bartender was very friendly and personable, and also gave us a card for 15% off any meal because we are locals. 

After we were seated, the dining experience went downhill a bit. Our server was not nearly as friendly as the bartender and seemed a tad bit put off by us. I ordered the halibut special, which I was not a big fan of. The fish was pretty dry, and the risotto patty underneath it (I'm not sure what it was called), was alternately creamy and crunchy.

The rest of my party enjoyed their meals, however. I sampled the chicken quesadilla, which was very good. 

Entrees ranged between $20-$35, which was a little high, but understandable for a Strip restaurant with a celeb chef name.
