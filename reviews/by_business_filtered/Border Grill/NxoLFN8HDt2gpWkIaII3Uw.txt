First let me say my server was amazing!!! Heather P. You Rock! I was there alone, and thus slightly awkward. She took time to talk to me and tell me about the head chefs and the restaurant. 

I got the baha ceviche and guac. Both were good. Nice smaller size portions, but great for a lunch. The ceviche was a little sauce heavy, but the guac was perfect. 

The atmosphere was nice but not busy (although I was there at 3:30 on a Tuesday). I would definitely come back... Maybe for lunch tomorrow!
