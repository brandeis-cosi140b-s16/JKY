Before I could write this review I had to check the restaurants website to try and remember what I ate there. It was the sauteed rock shrimp. Now...does not remembering what I ate mean the food was forgettable, or does it simply mean that I killed one too many brain cells this weekend. I'll let you make that decision (one is far more likely than the other).  

Something that I always fret about are serving sizes. Serve me a massive plate of food with only a little of what I ordered and like 90% rice won't make me happy, but serve me a dish with a generous helping of shrimp on a bed of rice and greens and I'm a happy camper. I'll camp here more often.
