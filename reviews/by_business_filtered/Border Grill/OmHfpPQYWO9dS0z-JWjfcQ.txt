We were staying at the Mandalay and went here twice- once to the bar, once for dinner. Service is TERRIBLE. AWFUL. Just terrible. The slowest service ever. 

It took asking the bartender four times to get our check, just for 2 margaritas and chips. 
Dinner we gave it another chance but HUGE mistake. I actually left money on the table and never got my food because our waitress disappeared. HUGE disappointment.
