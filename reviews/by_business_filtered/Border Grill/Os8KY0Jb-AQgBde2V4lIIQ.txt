We had lunch at Border Grille on Monday, 10/28 and it is, without question, the WORST food I have ever experienced in Las Vegas.  I ordered the fish tacos and it was awful.  The fish was grilled to DEATH and had absolutely no flavor or taste whatsoever.   I was so disappointed and felt that the $70+ dollars we spent on this meal was the biggest waste of money.  Do yourself a big favor and spend your money elsewhere.  Wish I had.
