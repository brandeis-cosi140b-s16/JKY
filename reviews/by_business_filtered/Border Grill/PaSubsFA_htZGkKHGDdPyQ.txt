I've been here twice ( the other time in Mandalay Bay when an obnoxious teenager spit a straw wrapper spitball at my head!). I enjoyed the food much more this time.

My friend and I don't eat that much, but my quesadilla was so flavorful and she loved her tacos! Their 3 different types of salsa and chips were addicting. Service was good and the atmosphere was pretty cool although I personally hate eating in malls/shopping centers. We ate on the "patio". It's definitely the best choice around!
