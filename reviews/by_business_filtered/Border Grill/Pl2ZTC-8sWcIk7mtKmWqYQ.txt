Came here for the first time, amazing service and place. My friend can't eat gluten and he asked if the chips were gluten free. They said because they were fried with other goods, the manager Jennifer was honest and told us they weren't so she brought us a fresh batch that were cooked in new oil.

The manager made my dining experience amazing. This place is clean, food is delicious, and because of the amazing manager everyone seems really happy who works here.

Thanks Jennifer for the amazing service!
