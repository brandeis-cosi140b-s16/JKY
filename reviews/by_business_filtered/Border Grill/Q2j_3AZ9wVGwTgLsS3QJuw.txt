Autumn M is the best waitress ever! Her assistant Alejandro is awesome as well! The brunch on weekends will bring us back every time we visit Vegas! The service from Autumn is the extra special treat! She's amazing and patient and so professional and knowledgeable about the menu items. We will recommend this to everyone we know going to Vegas! Ask for Autumn, you won't regret it!
