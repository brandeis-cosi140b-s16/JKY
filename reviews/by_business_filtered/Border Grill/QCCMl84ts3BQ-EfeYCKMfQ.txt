The first time I went here I had called ahead and found out they closed at 10 I showed up at like 9:50 the hostess had a few friends hugged and chit chatted with them while my buddy and I stood there. A few minutes later she asks if I'm there to eat, I tell her I am, and then she says oh well we stopped seating at 9:45...Let alone the fact that no one was manning the hostess both so we stood there before she showed up and started reminiscing with friends for a few minutes before that. 

Worst economic recession in over 50 years and we've started closing early?

So we go the next week. Get some Filet with lobster sauced enchiladas, and I mean, the food was so salty that if my dad were to eat it he'd go into Heart Failure. Worse than that our appetizer had some little potato food thing the size of a quarter, and two shrimp. Not worth it! 


Our server was nice and the salsa for the chips and dip is pretty good, but for a mexicanesque restaurant you need better than good salsa and appetizers that fill an infant to get on my good graces. 

Also hostess staff and all staff have to realize that you don't close until customers stop coming.
