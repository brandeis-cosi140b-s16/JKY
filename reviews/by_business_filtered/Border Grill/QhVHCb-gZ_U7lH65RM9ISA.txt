We chose Border's Grill for my daughters wedding reception in April 2015.  We had a casual brunch with several different dishes, which were delish with free-flowing mimosa's.  Not to mention, at a reasonable price.  We made most of the arrangements from afar and the planners were absolutely awesome - helping us with menus and options.  Everyone there was awesome - from the wedding planner (Destiny and crew), to the staff.  They allowed us to bring in our own decorations and had many options to choose from.  If you want a great place for a wedding, party or whatever event, you should consider this venue - truly a great experience and all the guests loved the food, mimosas and atmosphere
