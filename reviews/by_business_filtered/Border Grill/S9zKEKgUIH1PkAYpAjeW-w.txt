silly me went to the reef aquarium at mandalay bay . which is good . while buying my admission ticket i was given a free coupoun for a free maragretia drink with my dinner. so i was like ok i will try this over priced mexican resturant.  oh snap this place is a rip off. while waiting a long time for my free drink which wasnt very good i ran out of salsa and one of the bus boys aksed me if i want gaucolmole so i said yes thinking it was free dip. like the old saying goes theres a sucker born ever minute and im living proof of that. they hustled me in a resturant . i still cant believe i got coned . 

the gaucolmole was $ 9.00 plus tax . my bill came out $ 25.89 including tax . it should of dawned on me why  on a saturday about 6:00 p.m. when i left the place it wasnt crowded and less then  half full. the food was good but not worth double the price of planet hollywood. i said to myself before i even went to this hotel i wasnt going to eat there because its so expensive....
