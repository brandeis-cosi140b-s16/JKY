My husband and I just had an amazing experience here at Border Grill. Our server was Autumn, and she was absolutely great. We asked what the best thing to get here - and Autumn steered us in the right direction throughout the whole meal. She recommended to get the "Ultimate Border Grill Experience" - which was a sampler of 3 appetizers per person, 2 entrees, and 2 desserts. Our food was absolutely delicious! The service was outstanding! Autumn was so genuine and nice, even though we got here later, and stayed way past the closing time.

We will definitely be back and recommend Border Grill to our family and friends! :)
