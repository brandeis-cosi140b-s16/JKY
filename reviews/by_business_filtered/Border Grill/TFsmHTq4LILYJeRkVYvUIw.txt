After checking out the Shark Reef, I was hungry for sushi but I felt that eating sushi after gazing at aquatic animals for the past 2 hours would of been morally wrong.  

Okay, on to the review.  First of all, I'd like to say I love guacamole.  I put it on everything.  Undercooked chicken?  Guacamole.  Overcooked rib eye?  Guacamole.  Guacamole fixes everything and makes it magically delicious.  With that said, I DID NOT eat the guacamole at Border Grill BUT I did see someone who sat diagonally across from my girlfriend and I who was GETTIN DOWN on some guacamole.  I was jealous.  Instead, I satified my palatte by slamming 2 strawberry margaritas back to back and some Baja Ceviche.  The Baja Ceviche was awesome, the seasonal fish and cilantro ailoli gave it a nice flavor!  Unique to any other ceviche I've tried in the past.  Highly suggest it.  I finished my meal with a trip to the dessert menu where I got the Pastel Rufina.  The description says, "layers of puff pastery, sweetened cream cheese, chocolate chunks, and fresh berries".  So I'm thinking this is gonna be some mini dessert.  Well, it turns out, this dessert is MASSIVE.  But luckily, I have a bottomless stomach so I destroyed it without much struggle.  Kudos to our server, she was very helpful and knowledgeble of the menu.  She also looked like a girl I've seen on NaughtyAmerica ....but that's a whole different review.
