Loved eating here. Had a 2 yr and 2 month old in tow for an early dinner. The staff was great in accommodating us. We  both had a three course Border Grill experience with yummy plantain empanadas, corn tamales & a taquito. Both of us had the skirt steak which was cooked to order and delicious. The refried black beans were a great addition to the dish. For dessert, we had the Mexican chocolate cake and a puff pastry dish. Both were excellent. Definitely going to eat here next time we are in Vegas!
