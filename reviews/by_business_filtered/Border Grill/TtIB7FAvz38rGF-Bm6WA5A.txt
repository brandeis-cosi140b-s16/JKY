Was shopping in Mandalay Bay with a friend and wanted to grab a bite and we decided on this place. As we approached the hostess, she said they had happy hour at the bar.....SCORE!!!!! 1/2 price margaritas. Wooooo hoooo, me loves me some ritas! We are starting off fantastic. The bartender came over very quickly for our drink order. I ordered the happy hour margarita and in a jiff, he came and delivered. Talk about fast! They barely had time to drop off the complimentary chips and salsa!
It was not the best margarita. Maybe its' because I make my own with fresh squeezed lime juice, I make my own simple syrup and I add a Grand Marnier floater. This was lacking. I didnt taste any alcohol at all. Boooooo!
We ordered the (me) veggie quesidilla, and my friend the carne asada. The presentation on both was so pretty (see pics). The flavor on the veggie quesidilla was good. I didn't like the "fried"/crunchy feeling of the flour tortilla. I'd ask next time for it just warmed up, but that's me. It reminded me of taco bell and I dont eat there. The guacamole and salsa on the side were very delish. I enjoyed those tremendously. My friend really enjoyed her tacos too. 
I'm glad I tried, and I might be back, but it's not a "have to" place for me. There is a total divey place (name I can't remember) on Durango and Westside that has great Mexican food. It's worth the drive in my opinion. This place is like most places on the strip, flashy and expensive.
