Disappointing. Two Tepid Tamales....
The fish we ordered was ok- but the service was awful. Don't bring me food with no fork or spoon.... how can I eat?
Also, I'm tempted to give this ONE star because I saw the bartender make my $12 margarita with fricken last call margarita mix. That is unconscionably.
Good few of the pools and beach tho.
