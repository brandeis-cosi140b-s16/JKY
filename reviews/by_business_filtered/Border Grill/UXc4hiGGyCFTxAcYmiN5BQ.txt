Love, love, love this place! The food is absolutely delicious, great variety, lots of options.  A little pricey, but well worth it.  

Try the fresh lemonades or margaritas, fabulous!

The outdoor patio overlooks the pool and they managed to keep it pretty cool, even on an afternoon with temperatures in the high 90's.  We ate here two days in a row on vacation we loved it so much.
