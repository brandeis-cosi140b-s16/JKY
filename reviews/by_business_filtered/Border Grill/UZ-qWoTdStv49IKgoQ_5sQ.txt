Very good sangria margaritas, and chips and salsas are tasty. I found the food to be good, but if you're looking for what Californians traditionally  consider to be Mexican food, you may be thrown off. For example, I had beef brisket taquitos with a pineapple pico de gallo, refried black beans, and a red and green rice. My husband had some sort of pork in plantain leaves. So, definitely not your typical taco/burrito/quesadilla joint. 

That said, I think they're going for a more upscale vibe the likes of spots like Rosa Mexicano in NYC. While the food fits, the atmosphere is off for such a place, as there's no denying you're in a Vegas food court.
