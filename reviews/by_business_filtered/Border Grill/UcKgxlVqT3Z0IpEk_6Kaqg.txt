Ok ok ok. So Border Grill actually takes a spin of awesome on Southwestern cuisine-if you go for lunch or dinner! I've been here a few times for their weekend brunch and was less than satisfied. Revert to my previous review to read that nonsense.

But tis true. Their regular lunch menu is superb. I've been here twice in the past two days for business lunches. Tried a chicken salad off their special menu and their Pepper Crusted Steak Salad off their permanent menu-now I'm hooked! I'm a sucker for a hearty salad. Someone at the table said this is their go-to on property lunch and I whole-heartedly agree! The sirloin had a perfect sear. Nice and pink inside. A teensy bit chewy but it tasted fantastic. This isn't a salad for the feint of heart. It's packed full of roasted peppers, avocado, chewy corn bits and sprinkled with blue cheese. Perfection. 

Not to mention their chips are fresh fried in-house and served with a trio of delicious salsas. If in case anyone had an onion allergy, their tomatillo salsa is onion free! Found that out from one of my dining mates. Best of all, it's all complimentary. Which gives you a reason to splurge on their guac ;D 

Touch√© Border Grill. Way to prove a girl wrong.
