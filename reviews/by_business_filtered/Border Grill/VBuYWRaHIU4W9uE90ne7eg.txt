If you're at the Mandalay Bay Beach and pool, check out Border Grill for some fresh eats.  

I was most impressed by the way they make their tortilla chips - I haven't had anything like this since Mexico!  The drinks are eclectic and the food is gourmet, fresh and healthy.  I vegetarian-ized the turkey tostado salad and it was yummy, as were the sweet corn tamales.  

No blown mind experience here but definitely a nice lunch.
