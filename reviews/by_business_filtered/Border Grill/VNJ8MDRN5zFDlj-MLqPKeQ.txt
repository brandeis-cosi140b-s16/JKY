Seriously NOT impressed. $20 for nachos?! Yes, there were a lot of them, but still. Read the sentence again. TWENTY DOLLARS. For NACHOS. That's just wrong.

And the green corn tamales were COLD. Maybe more like lukewarm, but still. Lukewarm tamales? Blech. Not to mention they were about as big as a person's thumbnail yet three of them cost $10.

The only shining moment in this experience was the peach sangria, which was so good it made me want to cry. Extra star for that.
