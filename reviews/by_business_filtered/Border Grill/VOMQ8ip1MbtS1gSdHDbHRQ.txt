My friend has a VIP club card to this place and, as result, got a 2-for-1 coupon on the weekend brunch today.  I can honestly say it was the best deal I've had in a long time, and that was about $18 (including tip) for all-you-can eat food plus mimosas (regular and pomegranate)! The champagne brunch normally goes for $29.99 per person, but we had the VIP hook-up.  This is a tapas-style presentation, so you just order to your heart's content--heaven!  We had chips and salsa, cinnamon apple pancakes, guava empanadas plaintain empanadas, fresh fruit plates, carne asada tacos, green corn tamales, machaca chilaquiles, chipotle shrimp BLTs,  and coconut French toast.  Ay yai yai--muy delicioso!  The plaintain empanadas were not that great, but I would definitely recommend the green corn tamales, carne asada tacos, and chipotle shrimp BLTs.  We sat out on the patio, had great service throughout, and our waitress never blinked an eye when we kept ordering more food and mimosas!  I love a great deal on great food and that's what we got today.  Buena suerte!
