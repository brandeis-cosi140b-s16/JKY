Great place for delicious mexican food.  I had lunch here today and have had dinner here about 3 or 4 times even before Susan Feniger was on Top Chef Masters but now I have a better idea of why the food is so good!  I had the shrimp fajita tacos on their specials menu.  Delicious!  The shrimp were so juicy with a hint of spice.  We also had the pork tacos which were also amazing.  The pork is cooked for 3-4 hours which makes it very tender.  We also had the chicken enchiladas and fish tacos.  If you like spicy ask for the diablo sauce which is a habanero salsa.  
The specialty drinks are dangerously good.  Sometimes they have the pozole soup on special which is amazing.  Pretty much if you are craving anything mexican, you can't go wrong here!
