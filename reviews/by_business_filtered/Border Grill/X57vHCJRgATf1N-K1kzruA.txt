Great food and atmosphere. The menu is pretty big so there's something for everyone. They have some great specials that compliment the menu rather than detract. A little pricey but it is located in a casino so no surprise. The outside patio is also quite warm even at night, didn't feel uncomfortable at all in a light sweatshirt.
