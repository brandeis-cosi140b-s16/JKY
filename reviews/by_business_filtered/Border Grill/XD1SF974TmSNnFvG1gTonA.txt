too hot tamales celebrity chefs who travel regularly to Mexico but another meh meal at the grill the other night...carne asada enchiladas and fish tacos Ensenada meh certainly not worth 19 & 23 dollars respectively...not again even for convenience as there are plenty other options in town...should have tried the Baja ceviche as read that was good?
