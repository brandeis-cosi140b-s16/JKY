This new location is gorgeous and the service is excellent.  It is located right next to Joe's Stone Crab and is easy to access from the Forum Shops valet that is north of the Caesars main entrance.

My group all had the tacos, which are little smaller than a regular taco and crispy like a taquito.  Each taco plate is $14-$19 and comes with 3 tacos, and a good portion of beans and two types of rice.  The potato tacos I had were flavorful and had a variety of textures with the creamy potatoes, corn, and crispy shell.  I would absolutely order these again.  I also loved the coconut flan that was served with pineapple.
