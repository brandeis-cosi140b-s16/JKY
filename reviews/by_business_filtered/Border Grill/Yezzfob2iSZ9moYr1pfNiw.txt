Sat down at 11:35...still waiting for our food at 1:03pm. Server sent over the manager with some weak excuse that they're down to 1 kitchen - wait, what?! 

Server said, "I'm trying to find your food." Was it lost somewhere? Did the two chicken soups, quesadilla and taquitos go in adventure somewhere, never to be found? Every table around us that arrived after us has eaten and paid...I'm getting HANGRY...
