Very cool place with a great tequila selection and good food too!! Service was very friendly and they do a pretty good job on the margaritas. I could have sat there all day eating the chips and 3 salsa they give you. They also have a HOT salsa that you can request. Great flavor!
I really liked the setup, as they have a to go window and a bar. The restaurant it self is very large. Hey, it's in Mandalay Bay, so of course it's just fabulous!
