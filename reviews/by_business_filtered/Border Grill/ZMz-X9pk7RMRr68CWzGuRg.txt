SO good. Had the tacos which were out of this world. Also had the spicy bean dip-- which was majorly spicy. I thought the spot was perfect for a quick casual work lunch. My coworker really enjoyed it and felt like we got a nice break from the Convention and Vegas craziness.

The service was also very good. They were very attentive and hannnndsome!
