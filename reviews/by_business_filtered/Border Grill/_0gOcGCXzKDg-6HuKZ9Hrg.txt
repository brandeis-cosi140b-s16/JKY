The food was good. I am not quite sure it is worth the 20 a plate but it was good. We had the carne Asada tacos and chicken enchiladas. The service was very slow was about 30 mins after we were done to when we had our check. With so much to do in Vegas you hate waiting at a restaurant for no reason. The chips and salsa were very good.
