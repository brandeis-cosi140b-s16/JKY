Came here for lunch one day and ordered tacos for lunch. The tacos themselves were just ok nothng too spectacular.  The sides (rice and beans) were dry and i didnt care for them all that much.  The chips and salsa that get were sadly probably the high point of the meal.

For the price, this place is a bit over priced.  I had hopes for this restaurant but was disappointed.
