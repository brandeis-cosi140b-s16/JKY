I've been to BG a couple times, but it's been about five years since my last visit and I've honestly forgotten about the great food. Well, I'm really glad for my visit last week and the wonderful experience we had. The food was delicious and the service was insanely fantastic. Our server, Jessica was the most thoughtful, kindest, and simply amazing. Everyone seriously deserves high praises for the top-notch service!

Border Classics ($19): Chicken Panuchos (Black bean stuffed tortillas), Green Corn Tamales (Sweet corn, sour cream, salsa fresca), and Plantain Empanadas (Roasted plantains, organic black beans, poblano, cotija cheese). I absolutely loved the panuchos; so good! The tamales were pretty great considering that I don't usually like sweet versions. The empanadas were okay.

Wagyu Beef Sopes ($14): Guajillo chile marinated Wagyu beef, corn masa "little boat", and mango red cabbage mint slaw. The meat was delicious and tender (although a bit sweeter than I prefer), plus the fixings worked well. It was interestingly just one sope and the price is a bit steep for it.

Donation Level: Silver Platter ($4)

FIRST
"Chorizo" Beef Tartare: Quail egg and potato puff. Very good beef tartare and I loved the puff - wish there was more!

SECOND
Gaucho Steak: Grilled ribeye, chimichurri, crispy garlic potato, and huitlacoche butter. This steak was very generous in size and cooked well. The whole dish was super flavorful. I loved the potato! Just really good steak.

THIRD
Smoked Chocolate Brownie: Cinnamon smoke, chocolate sauce, and almond ice cream. The stack of brownie was covered in one of their short glasses, filled with smoke. The cup was removed as soon as the plate hit our table and you could still see the smoke swirling. Very cool. The brownie was delicious and I loved the addition of smoke. Great ice cream, too.
