Warm taco chips and 3 excellent dips were served.  Ann's entr√©e was a chile relleno (a roasted poblano pepper, manchego cheese, panela, cotija cheese), tomatillo salsa, Spanish rice and refried black beans.  I settled on Yucatan Pork - achiote pork roasted in a banana leaf, grilled pickled onion, guacamole, fried plantains, refried black beans, Spanish rice and 3 handmade corn tortillas.  We have enjoyed both of these entrees in the past and were not disappointed this evening.  I had a few extra dollars left to use on our gift certificate so we ordered half slices of flan and a tres leches cake with passion fruit and prickly pear sauce.
