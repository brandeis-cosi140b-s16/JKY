Very happy with every aspect of this place. I asked the hostess what there specialty was? She informed me that they had won an award for their quesadilla. When the waiter came over to greet us he recommended the homemade guacamole which was amazing, and he furthered what the hostess had told me about the quesadilla and he recommended the steak which is the actual one they won an award for. We both order that and it was everything and more the steak was prepared perfectly just a great meal overall great service absolutely will go back next time in Vegas. The one thing I didn't try was the monster size margarita but I seen it being passed around at other tables next time I'll start with that
