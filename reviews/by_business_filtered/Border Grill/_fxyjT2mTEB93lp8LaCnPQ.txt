Phenomenal Restaurant!!!

I have returned to the Border Grill numerous times and my experiences could not get any better. The  Pescado Veracruz is to die for.  Every meal I have eaten there has been perfect. The servers are attentive and knowledgeable and a manager has come by my table every time to ensure I am satisfied.  This is an A+ operation and my favorite place to eat in Las Vegas.
