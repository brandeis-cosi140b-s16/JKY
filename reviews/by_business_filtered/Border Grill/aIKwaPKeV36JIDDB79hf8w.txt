I was really excited to eat here, after discovering that Border Grill uses organic meats and is listed on restaurants.com!

My mom and I had the Sangria Suprema (and for $11) we didn't think it was very suprema.  My  BF and bro had the watermelon lemonade.  They loved it, drank it in 5 minutes, and were sad that there were no refills.  We ordered the pre-fixe dinners.  Next time I'm going to eat the Plaintain Empanadas, the green corn tamales and the short ribs.  We all thought, that of everything, those were the stand-outs.

Mexican Choloate cream pie and banana cream pie went down veeerrryyyyyyyyyyyy easy also.  I would definitely return.

The manager was super friendly and our server Autumn knew her stuff.
