My advice: Skip it. 
We were in the mood for Mexican food so we headed to Border Grill. The menu looked promising, so we decided to give it a try. We were seated on the outdoor patio. Suddenly a man at a table near us started complaining (loudly) about his meal. Our party tried to ignore his rant and enjoy our meal. The chips, guacamole and salsa were all pretty good. I enjoyed my mojito and my friend enjoyed the first few sips of her sangria (after awhile she said it was "like licking a candle"). During our drinks the man at the table near us continued to complain and we noticed that another table near us was speaking to a manager about a problem with their food. We ordered our entrees and our food appeared less than ten minutes later. Not a great sign. My husband ordered the shrimp and portions of the plate were cold. My friend ordered the pork and she said it was okay...not great. My vegetable enchiladas tasted a lot like something you could order at Chevy's. I'm fairly certain that the food was pre-made and just dumped on our plates. Overall, I'm bummed that we wasted a meal in Vegas on this place.
