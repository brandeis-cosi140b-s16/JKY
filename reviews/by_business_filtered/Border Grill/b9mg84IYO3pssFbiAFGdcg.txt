We had a lovely beer-soaked lunch on the covered patio here last weekend. The chile relleno burger called to me, but I couldn't rightly order a burger at a Mexican place like this. So, I opted for the shrimp tacos and did not regret it. The shrimp were plump, the tacos spicy and the sides of beans and rice were light and fresh. My husband had the chilaquiles, which were amazingly good. We had to physically restrain ourselves around the chips and salsa, and the delightfully oniony guacamole.  

My only complaint (and the reason for a star loss) is that they charge 50 cents a person for their water. But I didn't learn that from the waiter. He just showed up and started pouring. Nope, the note about the extra charge was buried in tiny print on the menu. I know it's just 50 cents, but a) that adds up over time and b) it's just bad form to sneak stuff like that on people. It would have been nice if the waiter had stated the charge up front and let us decide whether that was okay.
