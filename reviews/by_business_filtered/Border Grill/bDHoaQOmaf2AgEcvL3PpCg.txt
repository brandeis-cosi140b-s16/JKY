We went there for the all you can eat brunch and mimosas on Saturday, 03/09/13 with a party of 7.  We made reservations 15 minutes before arrival as suggested by the restaurant when we called a week before.  They seated us promptly on arrival. The food was fantastic along with the service. Chef Mike even came out and greeted us and gave us some recommendations on what to try. We tried the bacon jalapeno pb&j sandwich and loved it.  I know it sounds disgusting but it tastes amazing. 

Food recommendations: Skirt steak and eggs, biscuit and sausage gravy, machaca chilaquiles, and churro tots.

Drink recommendations:  They had four flavor of mimosas: Peach, pomegranate,  rasberry, and oj.  The mimosas were unlimited for an additional $5.  

They hooked us up with a 15% discount.  You can get it by joining their membership. It's free.
