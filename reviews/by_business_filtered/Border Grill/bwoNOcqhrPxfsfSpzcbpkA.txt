I love this place!  Eaten here a couple of times while in Vegas, and we have always been able to get a table very quickly.  Service has been variable, but often a little slow.  Love the cucumber jalapeno margarita, most of the dishes that I've tasted have been very good.  I have had the achiote pork and the pork mole, both good.  My friend had the special roast duck with bbq sauce the last time we were there, and that was fanastic!  This place is definitely an upscale spin on "traditional" Mexican food, but I love that everything tastes really fresh and healthy.
