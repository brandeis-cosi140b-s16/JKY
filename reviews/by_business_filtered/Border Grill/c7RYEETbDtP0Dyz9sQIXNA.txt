Top Chef Masters Mary Sue Milliken and Susan Feniger are the founders of Border Grill.  Border Grill does everything "fresh."  We started out with the homemade guacamole that is featured to support charity.  Even at $11, this is a bargain.  I wanted to lick the plate to get every last morsel.  Best guac on the planet.  We tried the 3 ingredient margarita and just WOW!!!  Such great flavors.  I could have drank many but opted for only one.  My husband had the fish tacos and declared them to be sheer perfection.  I had the chicken tortilla soup and it was, without a doubt, the very best I have had anywhere.  I also had a crispy kale salad and it was by far the star of my meal.  I could eat buckets of this stuff.  Absolutely delicious.  We will be coming back here every time we visit Las Vegas.  We have eaten at their Mandalay Bay location previously and feel the food was better at this location.  Excellent service too!  This place is a HIT!
