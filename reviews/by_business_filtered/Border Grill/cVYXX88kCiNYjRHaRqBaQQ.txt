This will be our 'go to' eats whenever at Caesar's casino or shops.  The food and Happy Hour (Monday to Friday, 3-6p) was as the other reviewers documented.  But what made our visit standout from all the other surrounding places to eat is:  it's tucked away for a more private intimate dining experience, and probably the best bargain in the area.  I deducted a star rating because it took so long to get our bill paid & processed.
