Walked in here during the afternoon during a weekday to enjoy a happy hour drink(s). We sat at the bar and were immediately greeted and given a minute to decide our orders. After ordering a Sangria I did notice there was a Yelp Check-In offer for a free House Margarita! Score! The bartender had everything whipped up super quick.
The Sangria was alright. It had a strong syrup taste but it was strong liquor-wise as well. I finished it off and moved onto my house margarita. The house does only come in one flavor, but it was good! Strong, but not gross, good balance to it. 
I also ordered the coconut shrimp and those were great. Good breading on them and even though I only got three, they were huge.
