Yesterday I attended the Doraemon Launch Party during the Licensing Expo because I was working as a Guide with the girl who actually played the Doraemon character. The staff were so friendly, accommodating, and attentive to us while we were there. It was very difficult for my co-worker to walk around in her costume and they were gracious enough to let us use their office for breaks since the original location where we were supposed to take breaks was a little bit of a walk.

They offered us plenty of drinks and even made us a food plate. The quality of the food itself is excellent. I used to eat at Border Grill when I used to work at Mandalay Bay years ago and hadn't been in a long time. I will definitely make it a point to bring both my local and out-of-town friends to the restaurant more often from now on. 

Thanks to the Border Grill staff for everything. You ROCK!!! :-D
