Spectacular place for private dining! We came here in January to celebrate my husband's 30th birthday.  Because we were a party of 25, I reserved a private room and worked with the event coordinator on a pre-set menu.  That in itself was a lovely experience.  The event coordinator was infinitely patient with my constant additions to and subtractions from the number of the party and happily accommodated one of my guests, who was battling morning sickness and could only eat certain foods, by letting me order a special entree for her that was not on our pre-set menu, at no extra charge. 

The coordinator's nearly-angelic patience extended to the staff.  No one even blinked an eye or cracked a frown when 90% of our dinner party showed up almost an hour late for our reservation!  And the food was absolutely spectacular!  The chips came out crackling hot and the green salsa was so fresh that I could swear I caught a whiff of the grass from the field where the vegetables were grown! (presuming, that is, that vegetables for salsa are grown in a field, which they are probably not, but I digress...)  Our starter was a Caesar salad, which was really really flavorful.  We had a selection of three main courses - the grilled skirt steak, the chicken poblano enchiladas and the chille relleno.  The skirt steak was juicy, tender and really well seasoned.  The enchiladas had a delicious spicy sauce.  I didn't try the chille relleno, but it looked great.  For dessert, we had fresh berries with mint and whipped cream, which came in cute little yummy edible baskets.   I also highly recommend the house-made peach lemonade.  

Overall, an absolutely fantastic experience - highly, highly recommend!
