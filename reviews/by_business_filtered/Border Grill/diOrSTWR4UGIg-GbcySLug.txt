I have to say that with the reputation I was expecting better. I was stuck on the strip for a convention for a couple weeks and I ate here twice. The first time, I would have given three starts, but the second is what gets this two start rating. 

The first time I got the ribeye steak that was great, but the side (purple potatoes) were really starchy. The second time I got tacos. The carne asada was ok and the shrimp was fishy tasting. The guacamole is good, but nothing amazing. The ceviche was good. Really, for the prices, compared to other food I experienced, this was the most disappointing of the trip.
