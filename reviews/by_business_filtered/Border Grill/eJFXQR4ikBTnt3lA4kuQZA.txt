The food here is ok. We came in a party of 6 with 2 kids for the Sunday brunch. Overall we mostly enjoyed the hash dish as well as the pb&j with bacon and jalape√±o. 
Based on the food I would go back however based on the service I would not. 
15 minutes just to get water. Two in our group had bottomless mimosas which were only refilled once in almost 2 hours. I understand that service suffers when they are busy but they were barely at half capacity. With so many great brunches in Vegas to choose from this one is ok. I give it a "meh"
