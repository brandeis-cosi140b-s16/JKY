I had their brunch buffet ($30) and added the unlimited mimosas ($5).  
It was not like normal buffets.  The brunch buffet menu had 18 dishes.  You can order as many of those dishes you want for the brunch buffet.  I tried nine of the dishes.  The steak and eggs were pretty good.  I also like the Egg Benedict dish.
