3.5 stars

Good food, but kinda pricey. We went to Border Grill randomly since we were staying at the Mandalay Bay and wanted to grab a quick dinner. It honestly reminds me of El Torito Grill or any other Mexican restaurant that's on the fancier end. We went on a Sunday night around 7pm and found it decently full, but with no wait. Keep in mind this was Labor Day weekend too. We weren't looking for a full-on meal and most of their dishes were $20+ so we ended up ordering the baja ceviche ($15) and the carne asada quesadilla ($19). Both were tasty, but a little too pricey for what you're getting, which is not much, in my opinion. I know it's Vegas and it's a very nice restaurant so I can't really blame them, but I doubt I will return. It's just Mexican food. I can get both dishes for cheaper and tastier elsewhere.

The two highlights were the complimentary chips and salsa (they give you 3 different sauces) and the service. Our waiter was nice enough to even pack our leftover chips and salsa, which was awesome. Not really a must if I'm ever in Vegas again, but Border Grill is good and would make a nice date place so it's a solid 3.5 stars in my book.
