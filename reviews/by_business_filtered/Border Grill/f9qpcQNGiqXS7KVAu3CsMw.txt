Came here for brunch on my anniversary. No question about it, I would give 6 stars if it was an option. Brunch is unlimited tapas style plates for 34.99 and unlimited mimosas for $10 more. We loved every dish that we ordered, including a "secret menu" barbacoa slider which was definitely the highlight of the meal. We tried every flavor of Mimosa that they offer, the blood orange is the best! Our server Rachel S. was awesome, we never waited long for anything and she gave us some great locals spots to visit in the future. Would definitely recommend to anyone who wants to have a good brunch on the strip!
