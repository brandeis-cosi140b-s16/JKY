Amazing!  I had the carnitas plate and it was so good.  They also had a great tres leches iced coffee that as good and strong, it came in useful for the concert we war scheduled to see right after dinner.  Loved this restaurant and i will definitely go back, glad theres one closer to me in los angeles!
