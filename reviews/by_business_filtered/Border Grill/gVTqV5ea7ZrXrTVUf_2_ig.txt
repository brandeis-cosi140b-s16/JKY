Restaurant week restaurant two where the food was so good and the portions so big I could barely eat for 24 hours following and took some of my meal home! Lol
Manuel was the server and he was great... Very attentive and made great recommendations. I got the skinny mango margarita and it was really good but not enough mango flavor. The tuna ceviche like appetizer was great as the tuna was really fresh and the flavors popped. The date salad had too much lime for me. The seafood enchiladas were great with a fresh slaw on top, very filling and very good. The steak was fatty but the nachos underneath it were gooey and yummy. The whoopie pie dessert was nice and light but the cake was dry without a lot of chocolate flavor. But the horchata cinnamon milk and the caramel that came with it were fabulous... Could have drank a whole glass and the caramel wasnt heavy so added a nice touch for moistness. Definitely enjoyed the meal and saw some other things on the main menu I want to try! 
As a big top chef fan it was nice to try this place. It isn't near the other Mandalay restaurants so it's easier to park near the convention center than the garage and we sat outside because freezing inside but the fan outside did little to keep us cool. The view of the Mandalay pool at night was really a nice touch though.
