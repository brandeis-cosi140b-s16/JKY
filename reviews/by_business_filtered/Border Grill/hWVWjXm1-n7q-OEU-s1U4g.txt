During my time in Las Vegas I ate at some really incredible Restaurants (check my other reviews), Border Grill was not one of them.

I went with a party of 6 for a Saturday morning brunch. We had a really nice view of the pool, with semi-outdoor seating. The atmosphere was nice, but that was mostly accredited to the weather..not so much Border Grill itself.

The service was good, but nothing special.

Now I can save you some time by telling you my entire group tried everything on the brunch menu, and I can save you time and money by telling you everything was average at best. The pancakes were dry and flavorless, the Yucatan Egg Benedict was boring and heavy, the Huevos Rancheros was okay but nothing special, the biscuit and sausages gravy was...again flavorless. 

If you're staying at the Mandalay Bay, you might as well go here because it's close. If you're staying anywhere else, it's not worth the trip.
