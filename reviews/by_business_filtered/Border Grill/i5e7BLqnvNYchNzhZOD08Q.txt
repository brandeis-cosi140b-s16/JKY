Met my colleagues for lunch here after my flight. I love the outside seating, and I will say this was some of the nicest service I've ever experienced. From the host to the waitress, everyone was phenomenal. 

Was a little concerned about gluten cross contamination, so I had the caesar salad without croutons. This is my old standby, and it was delicious! Everything had a nice presentation as well.
