Okay, so there I was, this past June, in Las Vegas,  for the Licensing Expo. I had no idea of the reputation of this place, I just knew it was supposed to have really good Mexican food.

 I had the shrimp tacos.  They were very good, but kinda salty. They had three kinds of salsa. Oddly, the mildest one was the tastiest. ( I LOVE spicy food.)  I enjoyed the food, but I suspect that I did not choose the "WOW" items on the menu...

The place was extremely busy and full, and thus, kinda loud. Our waitstaff was  distracted/forgetful, and not as on the ball as I would expect. Must have been a very busy day.

I see mention of bottomless mimosas and all you can eat tapas....THAT has my attention. Maybe next year I'll get to check them out.
