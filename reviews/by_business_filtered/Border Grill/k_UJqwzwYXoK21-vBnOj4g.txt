I love the Border Grill.  Every time I visit LV, I go for the brunch.  I give it 5 stars for the overall experience and because when I like something there, I usually REALLY like it.   As an overall rating for others though, I would probably give it 4 stars .   

At $34.99 plus $10 for unlimited mimosas, I think the brunch is expensive but for my dollars, it delivers good value.   I expect to spend 2 to 3 hours being served small plates and trying new and old flavors of mimosas.    The food and mimosa menu is constantly changing, so if I get something I really like, I pretty much keep ordering that until I'm full.  A couple of years ago, I had a grapefruit mimosa there that was so good, I stopped eating so I could drink more of them!  Champagne with grapefruit, honey and a little gin.   So very good.   So good that I experimented until I got the recipe down for myself. 

I don't eat beef, chicken or pork, so my options are a bit limited but like I said, when they hit their mark with something, it is fantastic, like the SEASONAL FRESH FRUIT SALAD - housemade granola * lime zest * cayenne yogurt * bu√±elo cone .   Not only the flavors but the different textures of this dish are perfect.   

The beauty of the small plates is that if you don't like something, you can just stop eating it and get something else.   Even though the  menu changes and they may not serve something I really liked previously, it's fun to try new dishes and take the time to savor and rate them.
