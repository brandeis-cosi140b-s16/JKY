OK...I admit I was skeptical of trying this place.  Celebrity Chef Mexican themed restaurant.   I mean....how good can food be if the concept is Mexican?  I've had the best and the worst Mexican around from trips to Mexico and living in Phoenix for 6 years and they all taste fine (it is hard to mess up).  First of all let me say, this is not traditional Mexican.  This is upscale Tex-Mex with a side of Spain.  They have the usual things you'd expect like Chips & Salsa, Guacamole, Enchiladas, Taquitos and fried ice cream.  They also have things like Ahi Tuna Ceviche, Peruvian Ceviche and Brisket burritos.


I tried a bit off everyone's plate and I must say....everything was delicious.  Worth every penny.  The service was also top notch!

I'd shy away from the drinks here....overly sweet and far too expensive (even for Vegas)
