When you go for trendy decor and miss, you end up with Border Grill.  The lighting is terrible and while menus in plastic sleeves is a thrifty approach, they are barely legible.  Interestingly enough,  the bathroom is hidden in another floor. Having said this, the brisket tostada is worth the trip. The pork belly taco is a work of art.  Unfortunately, the good gets lost in the other problems.  Save your $ and find a good taco truck.
