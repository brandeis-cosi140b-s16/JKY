I had lunch and dinner here during my stay at Mandalay Bay.  Border Grill is home of one of the top chef masters (but what Vegas restaurant isn't right?).  Everything is home made in the restaurant and fresh.  We tried the guacamole both times and it was so yummy.  We ordered Margaritas and the red wine sangria.  For lunch we split the pork carnitas (shredded pork) and it came with rice and black beans.  The pork was cooked well, but it wasn't shredded but cubed.  I thought it would have been shredded already.  Besides that, it was very good.  For dinner we each had the skirt steak and that came with beans, tomato and cucumber salad, and an amazingly delicious handmade tortilla.  The steak was cooked and seasoned well.  The sides (salad and beans) were awesome!  But the best part of it was actually the handmade tortilla.  When you wrapped the steak, beans, and tomato in the tortilla that really made it.  The ambiance was so-so, they need to figure out how to give it a better atmosphere.  The lights were too bright and the way the dining room was set up was awkward.  The prices were a bit higher than I care to spend at any Mexican restaurant, but its Vegas.  I'd go back for lunch or dinner if I am in the Mandalay Bay hotel again.
