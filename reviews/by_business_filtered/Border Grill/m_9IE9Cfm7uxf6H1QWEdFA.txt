I spent a wonder four days in Las Vegas recently after a period of time since my last visit.  A friend encouraged me to go to Border Grill saying I would not regret the long walk to get there from the casino I was staying at.  I will say Border Grill was my favorite meal while I was there.  I had the daily special of the smother pork burrito and I have to say it was the best burrito I have ever had.  The pork was extremely tender packed full of flavor.  The dish was visually appealing and quite deceiving.  ha ha.  It is a large portion but you just can not stop eating it. My friend had the fish tacos and I never thought I would like a dish like that but she insisted I try it.  To die for!!! I thought the fish was nicely seasoned, crispy and just the right amount of ingredients blended together.   I also had the sangria margarita.  Yum!!! I am lucky enough to be returning in two weeks for another four days in Vegas and I am definitely going to make border my first meal when I arrive.  Fantastic job Border Grill. Nice staff, great food, best view on the patio a must see in my opinion.  See you soon.
