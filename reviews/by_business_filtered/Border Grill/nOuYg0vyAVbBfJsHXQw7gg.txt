We came twice during our trip because it was that good.  
Our first visit was for lunch and our bartender, Trevor, made me something awesome that fit my tastebuds after I was unsure what I wanted to drink. And he nailed it. He was also able to recommend exactly what we wanted for lunch.

We came back for dinner the next night for their ceviche bar. We had great service again. A nice new find.
