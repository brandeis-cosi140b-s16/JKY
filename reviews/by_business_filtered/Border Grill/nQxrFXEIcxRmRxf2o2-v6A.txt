It was a delightful day and we decided to sit on the patio which was the perfect choice.  I was here with my family for a sad occasion.   My mother had passed and we were in town for her funeral.  Our server Alan was so accommodating on such a hard day. We were going to have lunch but he recommended brunch and i am glad we took the bait! The steak and eggs is a must but I suggest medium rare.  The bacon peanut butter jelly biscuit was an unexpected treat.  My Little ones Susie and Jonah were acting up and our server brought some chips and crayons to calm them down.  He really took care of us. Jonah spilt his milk all over the table and into his lap and Alan and his server assistant cleaned it up without hesitation.  A manager stopped by.  She was soooo sweet!  We even had a chef stop by.  I can hardly believe it. We even made a joke about being royalty.  I give this place my highest rating. Make sure you save room for the French toast and churro tots!
