The red rice came to the table room temperature and under seasoned. The sopes came to the table with guac on it, yet there was no mention of guac on the menu. I guess it wouldn't be a problem if I liked guac, I don't. The server politely had the kitchen redo the sopes with no guac. This was good, but over priced for the flavor. Overall, I don't recommend this place. The Mexican food in L.A. is MUCH better. Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill out scores this place by far.
