By far my favorite meal of my most recent trip to Vegas. We came for the $35.00 a person unlimited brunch and we all agreed that it's probably better we don't have one of these nearby at home because that would be dangerous. The food is all delicious and the service was absolutely great. I cannot wait to come here again! $10 mimosas were also a spectacular value. This restaurant also has a VIP club you can sign up for online a you get 15% off your bill. Absolutely worth coming to for the brunch. This place is delicious and overall a great value!
