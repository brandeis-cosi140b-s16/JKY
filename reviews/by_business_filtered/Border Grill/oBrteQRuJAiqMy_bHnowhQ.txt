Three words for you:
Brunch; Allyoucaneat; Tapas

Did someone say all you can eat brunch tapas?!? 

We went on a Sunday morning, and the place was surprisingly empty. This was one of the best brunches I've had as it played perfectly to my dislike of commitment / deficit of attention, plus the food was super flavorful, perfectly cooked, etc.

Between the 4 of us, we tried almost everything, I think. Table faves included the Chilequiles, Huevos Rancheros, Chorizo and Egg taco, Steak and Egg, Guava Empanada, Yucatan Egg Benedict, and Coconut French Toast (for dessert, of course).

So all that is $25 each, and for $5 more, you get bottomless mimosas-- The orange mimosas were boring, but the pomegranate and passion fruit were quite tasty. 

Our server was great too - had our next mimosas out before the one before it was empty... kept the pace up faster at first, and then slowed down as we got more and more full, attentive but not pressuring. Great atmosphere sitting outside overlooking the Mandalay Bay pool area, too.

All around a win - I'm already looking forward to going back!
