I ordered the Spicy Shrimp Tacos, which consisted of three shrimp tacos topped with guacamole and cucumber slaw. The dish included rice and beans, but I opted for rice only. Does anyone else despise menu items that are deceivingly labeled "spicy"? Since when did "spicy" become "not spicy at all"? (insert eye roll here)

After some eavesdropping, I learned that you could do a triad of taco options. I would've done shrimp, pork, and carne asada if I overheard that before I ordered.

The waitress was friendly, but the hostesses are completely clueless. I stood at the hostess table for a few minutes before they realized I needed a table. 

Due to the unnecessarily high prices (each plate is at least $15), I'll opt for one of the many other Vegas eateries the next time I'm in town.
