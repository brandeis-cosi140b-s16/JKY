Both dishes were excellent.  From the specials menu: Lamb Tacos and Chicken Enchilada.  The Enchilada had a roasted pepper sauce and over easy eggs on top.  Such a perfect combination.

There were many unique margarita options as well.  Service was thorough and snappy.  Plus they provided endless fancy pitchers of water, and who doesn't need that while in Vegas?
