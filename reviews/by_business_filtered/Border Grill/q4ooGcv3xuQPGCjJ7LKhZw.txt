I have been here a few more times since my last review and it's still the same great quality every time I go!  It's been remodeled so the place is nice and new.

We came around lunch time on a Thursday and we were seated right away.  The waitress and staff were SO friendly, definitely the best service that I received on my trip.

We ordered their famous watermelon lemonade and peach lemonade and both were GREAT!  The watermelon one is a little better though.  They do pour you distilled water and they leave the carafe at your table so you can refill your water if you need to.  But they charge for it tough...it was only a $1.00 if I remember correctly so it's not a big deal.

We ordered the guacamole, tortilla soup, green tamales, and an order of their steak enchiladas.  Everything was FANTASTIC!  The food is so flavorful and they use fresh and exotic ingredients.  Also the waitress knew that we were splitting everything so she had everything split into two dishes...a really nice touch.

The bill wasn't cheap though.  I think we spent around $85.00 including tip but it was well worth it.  I love you Border Grill!!!
