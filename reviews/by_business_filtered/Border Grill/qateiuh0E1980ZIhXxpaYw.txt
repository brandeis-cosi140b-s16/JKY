Had the best experience here yet in Vegas. My boyfriend got the all you can eat brunch. It was well worth it and there were many options especially because he was gluten free. A lot of the places in Vegas don't even know what the means or what gluten is. Our waitress was phenomenal and I got bottomless mimosas and she just kept bringing all these fabulous concoctions over. It was the best that we had while in Vegas. I got the steak quesadilla and I was beyond impressed.
