One of my favorites on the Strip.  Gr8 food, ambience, view, service and value.  Love the brunch cooked to order,  Regular menu is creative Mexican dishes that will explode unique flavors into your palate.  Drinks are the bomb.  Cerviche, shrimp dishes, tamales, fish tacos, enchiladas-all good.  Come hungry and bring binoculars.
