Got no complaints. I showed up here for a lunch alone during a conference and the special was a braised pork taco plate. I checked the toppings closely (don't eat tomatoes or weird things) and it sounded great. As soon as I was seated someone brought me chipotle salsa, which I devoured (two of them!) with chips. When the tacos came out, there was guacamole on them & I was so confused. It said it nowhere on the description. I'd already ate the beams but he immediately took it back and had them remake it (even more beans and yummy rice!) 

THe ambiance was upper scale mexican, and I sat outside so I could look over at the Mandalay Pool area. The large fan will keep you cool enough and the seats are totally comfy.
