I love (!) Susan Feniger, but it seems like the price-gouging in Vegas turned this place into a yawn.  Way overrated for upscale Mexican, but still an okay meal if you are stuck (nay, trapped) in the Mandalay Bay and need to eat.

I still can't fathom why restaurants get away with $9 tableside guacamole service out of the cost of 50 cents worth of ingredients.  I should just hand over $10 bucks, have them punch me in the face and then tell them to keep the change.  Guac was perfectly fine, but not for $9.  Crab nachos were a good sized portion, but light on the crab.  Again, no surprise given that this place is stingy when it comes to the good ingredients.  Carnitas tacos were tender and succulent, but ridiculous at $17.  They were literally $2 taco truck tacos.  Mango margarita was delectable at the time, but not memorable.

I don't know, kids.  Maybe I'm old and grumpy, but I don't feel like I'm any stingier with my dough.  I just want to pay out the gills if the food will absolutely warrant it because it's going to blow my mind.  Border Grill didn't blow my mind so much as my pay check.  I'm over it.
