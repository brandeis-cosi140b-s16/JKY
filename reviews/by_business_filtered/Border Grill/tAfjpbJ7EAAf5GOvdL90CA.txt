Margaritas... chips... guacamole, what more can a girl want out of life? We arrived around 7pm on a Sunday night sans-reservation. There was a 30-minute wait, so we grabbed a seat at the bar for some drinks & guacamole. I started with the Blanco margarita and the boy had a Cadillac. I really liked the Blanco, it was crisp and refreshing, everything a margarita should be. The guacamole here was great, it had a heavy lime flavor & wasn't overly spicy, read: very Karen C. friendly.

For dinner, I went with the Fish Tacos Ensenada, and they were delicious! I skipped the beans, and they instead served them with 3 different kinds of rice... all were so flavorful. The boy had the Saut√©ed Shrimp, which I admit to stealing a decent amount of because it was SO good! The sauce was so flavorful and seasoned perfectly. The only complaint is that the red rice on both of our plates was a little too salty, but other than that, it was great. It definitely isn't crazy authentic Mexican, but that's not what I was looking for, so I'm down with that. 

I like the ambiance here, and would have liked to have been sat outside, but there was a huge birthday party so that was a no-go. Very random, but I love the glassware they use. Overall, I'm very glad we checked this place out!
