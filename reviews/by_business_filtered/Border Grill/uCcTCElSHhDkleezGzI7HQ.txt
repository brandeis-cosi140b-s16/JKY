The food here is good, and the presentation of our meals were kind of fancy.  Everyone at my table really liked their meal.  The atmosphere is just okay, but I heard they have outdoor seating?  I wish I would've known!  I love sitting outside.  Food and atmosphere gets a 4 out of five star rating.

I have a lot to say about the cocktails, I'd give them a 3/5 rating.. maybe a 2.  I came here with my husband's family and I knew I was in for a pretty boring dinner.  Might as well have a couple martinis to make the visit more bearable!  The espresso martini tastes amazing, I had two of them.  They had a very spicey southwest taste to them that was fantastic and unusual, but WTF, where's the alcohol?!  I usually am pretty comfortably buzzed after two martinis but I didn't feel any love from the two I had here at Border Grill.  I sat through the rest of my dinner and day with the inlaws totally SOBER and pissed off about it.  They lose a star for being stingy with the alcohol.
