Bought a Restaurant.com coupon to try this place out and Im glad that I did.

Great food. Great vibe. Convenient location. Excellent service. About the only thing that I didnt like about the place was the weakness of the specialty drinks. They were actually very disappointing. But other than that, I would recommend to anyone I know to try it out. I know Ill be back again.
