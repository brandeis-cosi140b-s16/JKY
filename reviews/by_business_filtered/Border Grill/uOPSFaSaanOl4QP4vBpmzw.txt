We walked to hell and back to get here... all the way from the Mirage! It was long but we were happy to get seated immediately and have a frosty peachy sangria. It was delicious and came in a large glass. Yum! Very good for a sweet sangria lover. We also started with guacamole, which was good. Loved the chips here, as they were just salty enough. They bring you 3 kinds of salsa, and our waitress also brought us a very hot version, which my friend enjoyed more than I, as I'm not a spice lover. The guacamole portion was huge! 

I ordered the plantain empanadas, and my friend ordered the vegetable quesadilla. We didn't think we'd be able to eat an entree after all those chips and guacamole. Plus the heat had gotten to us and we weren't as hungry as we could've been. Our waitress recommended the empanadas, as I was on the fence about what I wanted. She described them as sweet and salty. The "dough" instead of being dough was from plantain, and they were stuffed with black beans, cheese, and poblanos. They were really delicious! My friend enjoyed her quesadilla, which was huge and came with more guac and sour cream, plus pico de gallo. 

We ordered a brownie dessert to share, and it was large! It came with ice cream and was rich and delicious.

Our service here was the crowning jewel. Jamie was our server and she rocked! She was personable, gave great service, chatted with us and gave us great recommendations. She was the best server we had in Vegas. 

We'd definitely come back (and take a cab next time)!
