For my girls-only brunch in celebration of my 30th birthday I chose Border Grill. I think for it being AYCE and having unlimited mimosas for a few extra bucks it is not a bad option. However, it is still just sitting at "okay" for me based off of a second experience.

Since I had come here last (2012) they have upped all their prices. What used to be $5 for bottomless mimosas is now $10 (BIG price jump). And what used to be $29.99 AYCE is now $34.99 AYCE. Again, another big price jump.

As for the food and what I had....

Chorizo & Egg Taco - Still good, and still one of the better plates on the menu.

Chilaquiles - OK. I've had better elsewhere.

Bananas Foster  Crepe - Not good. Came out luke-warm, and not tasty.

Salmon Slider - Very good. Salmon smoked nicely, and with the jalapeno bacon and goat cheese, with some spicy sauce, it was delicious. Only down side? The bun was dry.

Eggs Benedict with pork on a biscuit (can't remember the name) - Was actually good, with an over-easy egg to break into the biscuit, mixed with the slow-cooked pork inside was a good combo, but the biscuit was over-powering the meat. Smaller biscuit, or more meat please (more meat would be better).

I did not indulge in mimosas, however my friend did and they have quite the array of flavors. Although she seemed to enjoy the Peach flavor the most. I did have endless cups of coffee, which is served with sugar and cream.

Service was attentive and congenial, but food was slow to arrive, and some plates went missing, only to appear because our server had to go hunt and find them.

Overall I think I may have had my fill of Border Grill Brunch and I will have to branch out and find a brunch in Las Vegas that fulfills my needs better.
