OMG!!!!!! I LOVE, LOVE LOVE THIS PLACE! I've been here for brunch a couple of times now and it's never disappointed me. Everything comes out in tapas size so you can get to try many things. Everything is so flavorful and just so damn good! They also have like 8 different flavors of bellinis. I'm a pro so i've tried them all. :D If your a vegas local, you get a discount! I love that they treat us locals good! Service is always on point! I have no complaints at all! This will forever be my most favorite brunch spot (the location in Mandalay Bay btw) in Vegas! I've also been here for dinner to try it out and it was really good too! But the brunch.....man oh man!!!! :D
