So had dinner here before going to see the lion king. wanted to try it because I was a fan of mary sue on top chef masters. Great decor in the restaurant, and our waiter was very friendly and helpful when it came to making decisions on food. The food was very tasty and good portion size. Great place for dinner and def recommend the skirt steak.
