Wow this place has gone downhill! I ordered crane asada tacos and they brought out what they claim is wagyu tacos which were horrible. The house made tortillas were undercooked. Tortilla soup had so many onions it should have been called onion soup also no lime with the soup. The beans were cold and nasty! The kitchen doesn't like to do modifications here so don't ask obviously there's a chef with an attitude back there who needs to go. It's no wonder the place was empty. This place used to be one of the best Mexican restaurants in town and I used to recommend it to everyone. Just goes to show when ownership gets big (Susan) and popular and has multiple restaurants and gets corporate  they don't pay attention to the places that got them there make sure to avoid this place and go somewhere else for dinner. Boooo border grill shame on you!
