3.5 solid stars
After a long day in Vegas, we were ready to pig out for dinner!


Ordered
1) Guacamole and chips (the chips came out warm and fresh) were delish! 4/5

2) Skirt steak: 3/5 my expectations were higher..not the greatest plate on the table; the spice/seasoning on the steak was not my cup of tea

3) Yucatan Pork: 4/5 this plate was delish! I would order this plate next time.

Overall, solid food.
