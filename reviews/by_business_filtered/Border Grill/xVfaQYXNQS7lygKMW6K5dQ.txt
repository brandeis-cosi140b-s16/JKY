Brandon M.  Took amazing care of us for our 20th anniversary.  He made a fabulous recommendation that allowed us to sample virtually everything on the menu!  Every single item was delicious!  I don't like guacamole but yet I loved theirs!  My husband and I were able to try dishes we wouldn't have ever ordered but LOVED!  The ceviche course - perfection!  The scallop and shrimp soup/rice dish - amazing!  I cannot recommend this restaurant highly enough or Brandon!  He was so sweet to send us home with anniversary desserts since we were beyond stuffed.  Thank you Brandon!
