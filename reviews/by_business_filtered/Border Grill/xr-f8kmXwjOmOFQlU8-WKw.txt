Pretty new but off to a great start I think.  Service was outstanding, from menu suggestions to attentiveness.  Sampled some apps and ceviche  which was halibut tonight.  Very good with just the right level of citrus.  Guac  was solid but not to the praise level I saw in other reviews.  Maybe just an off nite or maybe I'm spoiled at home with my options.  Chorizo queso  was very good and not greasy like I've had many other places.  Ribeye sope  was very good.  Wish I had room for dessert as options looked good.  Thanks yelpers  for helping me.find this place.  PS it's on the street level.of Forum.Shops by first entrance when coming from Mirage.
