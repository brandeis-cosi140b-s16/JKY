I have been dying to try this place after I saw Susan on a Food Network competition. Overall, the menu and each dish were constructed with a lot of thought. We ordered barbecue brisket flautas, cumin grilled skirt steak, and pablano chicken enchiladas. I was able to try a bit of everything. The flautas were enough to eat as a dinner meal for one. They had a great smokey flavor, a hint of spice, and were deliciously crunchy from being deep fried. The grilled steak was cooled perfectly to medium well, the cumin based rub was very flavorful, and paired well with the accompanying arugula salad and sweet corn. The enchiladas were fabulous I probably could have picked my plate clean. The pablano enchilada sauce had a beautiful deep green color and the perfect amount of heat. They were stuffed full of moist chicken and the sweet corn relish on top added a perfect sweetness to balance the dish. I wish we had ordered something from the ceviche bar everything looked great. I'm rating Border Grill 4 stars because I felt like the overall atmosphere was lacking a bit and I am disappointed the chile relleno with goat cheese was not on the menu. But, if you are craving Mexican food made wiyh quality ingredients while in the Forum Shoppes this is a great choice, just be prepared to spend a little extra moolah.
