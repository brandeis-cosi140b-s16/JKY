I ate at the restaurant on Sunday at 8pm this week.  Here's what I found:

Price  - The price was perfect, not too expensive like everything else in the Shope's, but not too cheap that the food quality suffered.  It was just right!

Food - The Mexican was premium home-made quality.  I enjoyed everything from the home-made guac to the soup (not too heavy, not too light) that the server reccomended.

Service - My server Alex (with glasses) was friendly, engaging, and had dead-on reccomendations.  He was prompt when I needed service, and left me alone when I wanted to eat and focus.   5 star service, really!

Environment - Just right for a Mexican place in a casino.  I felt comfortable in my jeans and dress shirt, drinking a beer, while people at the next table were dressed finer then I was.

Bottom line - have a meal there when you're in Vegas, it's just the right place for lunch or an early dinner!
