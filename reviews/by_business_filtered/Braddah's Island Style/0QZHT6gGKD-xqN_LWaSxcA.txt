This place really is like the Hawaiian Chipotle! They give pretty decent portions for the bowls and burritos. I have tried the 3 types of meat so far - Steak, Kahlua Pork, and Chicken - and the steak was by far my favorite. It's really flavorful and a bit on the sweet side. The pork was very tender but not as flavorful so I can't say it's my favorite. You can add sides such as beans, veggies, lettuce, guacamole (at extra cost), and three types of salsa.

Prices are reasonable (~$8) and service is fast! The restaurant has a cute dining area as well so it's good for both dining in and take-out. Don't forget to get the free bit of coconut bark when checking in!
