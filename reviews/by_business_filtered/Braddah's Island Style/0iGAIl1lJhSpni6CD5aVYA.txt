If you like Hawaiian plate lunches, you'll enjoy this variation on the theme.  Your choice of meat and side ingredients/toppings served to you in a bowl, as a taco, wrapped burrito style, or as a salad.  If you're not into chicken, pork, steak or fish, you can also get grilled veggies in lieu of the meat.

After several visits, it's clear the meat is always cooked well and tender and they always offered samples.  The toppings are fresh and tasty, and there are also additional sauces in the dining room if you want to add some additional flavors or heat.  The staff is courteous and the portions are large.

If you're in a hurry and don't want the usual fast food options, Bruddah's is a cool addition to the valley's Hawaiian food choices.
