I have been here a couple of times and the staff and food are awesome.  The staff is super friendly and helpful.  If you have not been there before, they offer a sample of their meats to try.  I like all the meats, but my favorite is the huli huli chicken.  Hubs and daughter like the Kalua Pig.  We have only tried the bowls, but next time I will probably get a burrito.  

If you like sweets, they have coconut bark for dessert.  It reminds me of "Christmas Crack" (Saltine Toffee Candy), but with coconut.  

I hope this restaurant is successful and sticks around.  I will be back!
