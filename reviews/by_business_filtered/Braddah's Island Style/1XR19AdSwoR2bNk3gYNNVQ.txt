I would describe this place as a Hawaiian style Chipotle where the meat choices are prepared and seasoned "Island Style."  Great for lunch or dinner. My favorite would have to be the fish bowl. The fish is grilled perfectly and is absolutely fresh and deliciously prepared. A must try. Also they have an incredible dessert... Coconut bark which no one really knows about.....till now!!!  To die for!
