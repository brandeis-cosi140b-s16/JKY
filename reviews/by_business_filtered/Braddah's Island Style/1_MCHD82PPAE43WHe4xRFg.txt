SOOOOOO GOOOOOD !!!!!!

We ordered a salad with grilled fish, an order of tacos and a box of coconut bark.
On the tacos we ordered 2 pork with pineapple verde salsa and 1 chicken with the tomato and Maui onion sauce. With the grilled fish salad we did the mango and corn salsa. The coconut bark was so good it almost made me weep.

I'm ready to go back today and order it all again.
