This place is great all around! 5 stars for the food and 5 stars for the customer service. As soon as we walked in, we were greeted by Tea. She was extremely nice and patient. It was our first time, so without hesitation she gave us samples of the meat. You can't go wrong with any one of them because they were all very yummy! I've heard people compare it to chipotle which is understandable because of how you order, but Braddah's has a lot more flavor. They make it all from scratch every day. 

My boyfriend and I each ordered a bowl. He chose the steak and I chose the chicken. We had steak/chicken in every bite! Nothing about this place disappointed me in any way. Maybe next time we'll get a burrito or a taco. Can't wait to go back. I would definitely recommend this place!
