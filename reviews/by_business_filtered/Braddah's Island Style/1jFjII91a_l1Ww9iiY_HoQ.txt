I enjoyed their services! It was my first time here with the hubby and we were impressed. Since it was our first time, they offered free samples of their meats for us to try out before creating our meal. I liked them all! The kalua pig, pulehu steak, and chicken were really tasty and seasoned perfectly without being too powerful on the palate. I decided to go with the kalua this trip and I'll be back next time to try steak or chicken next! :) It's similar to a chipotle where you decide to do either a salad, bowl, or tacos and add whatever you please. Oh and don't forget to check in to receive your free coconut bark, it makes a super tasty treat after consuming your food :) I will be back again next time, I really enjoyed it here.
