From 8/11/15 

This was our first time trying these guys, and after hearing good things we decided to give them a chance. We ordered our food from Bradduhs via Postmates, which was super convenient.

We ordered the Pulehu Steak with grilled veggies; my boyfriend got a burrito bowl, I got the 3 Soft Wheat Tacos with Guacamole on the side. 

The flavors were pretty powerful! Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad tasting- just a bit strong for my palette. My boyfriend, on the other hand, loved the spices on the steak. 

These guys weren't bad, I will try them again, maybe next time I'll  just get something different.
