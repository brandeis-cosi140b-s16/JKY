Braddah's Island Style location make's it convenient for locals and non-locals to locate at the corner of Rainbow and Sahara next to Harley Davidson's.  Lots of parking and a drive-thru make's it an easy access.  The staff is friendly and the Aloha spirit is truly present among all it's team members.  The menu is truly healthy and presents the island style in a unique fashion.  Kalua burrito's and taco's, brown rice with nori and assortment of Hawaiian salsa's.  The menu is easy to read.  Don't forget to try the Coconut bark.  If there is a good Hawaiian diner in Las Vegas--the locals will find it and they truly did, when I was there, it was packed.  Onolicious!  Got my vote!
