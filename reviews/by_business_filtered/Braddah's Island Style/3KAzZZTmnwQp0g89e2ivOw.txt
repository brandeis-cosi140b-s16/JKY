Super friendly service.  It was my first time there and they offered me a sample of some of the meats.  Things were off to a great start...

I went with a bowl with Pig and Beef, both were delicious!!  I got a ton of veggies in my bowl, so I was feeling pretty healthy with this meal.  Everything tasted great.  The inside is nice and clean and there are outdoor tables (but it was 110 outside, so I opted to stay inside).

They also had Dr. Pepper as a drink selection, that is ALWAYS a plus!

Everything was fresh, the portions were large.  They also offered a yelp deal and that was the way I found them in the first place.

The friendly and helpful service was definitely appreciated.  Very well trained staff.

I'll be back the next time I'm in Las Vegas.
