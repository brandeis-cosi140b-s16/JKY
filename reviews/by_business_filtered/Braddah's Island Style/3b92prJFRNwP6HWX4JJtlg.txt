We decided to try something new tonight so we stopped by here on the way to the movies for a bite to eat. As we overlooked the menu, the sweet girl at the counter let us sample all their meats & hubby and I decided to share a kalua pig salad & he also got a steak taco. Both were deelish! The corn salsa was pretty good & my husband chose the tomato one which is their spiciest salsa, I'm not big on spicy. Their ranch was different & I didn't think I would like it so I asked for it on the side but we both ended up enjoying it so we poured it all on top of the salad. So good! Last but not least, hubby bought the coconut bark for us to try & OH MY GOSH!! AMAZING!!! I can't wait to go back just to have another bite of that little piece of heaven in my mouth. So freakkin good! Basically we loved the meal & we will definitely back. Oh & I forgot to mention this in the beginning but they all greeted us as we walked in the door & all of their workers were so friendly. Loved that! ;)
