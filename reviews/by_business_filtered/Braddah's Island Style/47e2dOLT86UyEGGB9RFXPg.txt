It's basically Chipotle of Hawaiian food. I know other people have said it and I tried to think of another term but that's just really what it is.

I remember when this was Yayo taco. That place had some history, seen some shows in there, but it was a dump. I was very pleasantly surprised to see how nice of shape this place was in. Gone were the old wooden tables with etchings carved in from decades ago and replaced with booth seating you can actually sit in. Things were just clean and that was a big positive.

The staff was super friendly. There was no pressure from the staff. They let you sample the food too if you have any questions.

The food is really good as well. They have a few different options for meats and there is more customization when it comes to adding some heat to your meat. Don't think you could go wrong with whatever you order.

Overall, a nice place to grab some lunch and a welcome break from the Chipotle grind. Definitely check it out.
