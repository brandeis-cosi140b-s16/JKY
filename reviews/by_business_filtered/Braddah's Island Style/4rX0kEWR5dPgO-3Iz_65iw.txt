Me and the family ate here twice during a 5 day stay in Vegas.  The food is very tasty with lots of options to keep up the variety.  We only had the bowls and the soft tacos, but both are great.  They let you sample all of the meats so you can get exactly the taste you want.  For me the steak was the clear winner, but the chicken was also very good.  Lots of sauce and toppings choices as well.

I wish they had one of these in Phoenix, we'd be there several times a month!
