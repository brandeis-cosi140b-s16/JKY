After a failed attempt at getting $1 Italian subs from a near business doing a grand opening special I finally decided to give Braddah's another shot. Have you every had Chipotle's, Caf√© Rio, and Qdoba? It's basically like those places but using Hawaiian inspired ingredients. Honestly I can see this place doing real good, I mean Chipotle and likes are pretty popular and Braddah's isn't that bad. It actually got busy after I got there.

You first choose what you want a burrito (flour or whole wheat tortilla), a bowl, a salad, or 3 tacos (soft flour or crispy corn). Then you choose your meats. They'll let you sample the meats, they were very delicious. They have huli huli chicken, kalua pig, pulehu steak, grilled fish, and grilled veggies. Then you add various non-meat items.

There was a Groupon which I remembered after I got there and quickly bought. I decided on two burritos. Burrito #1: Whole wheat tortilla stuffed with pulehu steak, seaweed rice, black beans, charred pineapple verde, mango and roasted corn, lettuce, jalapenos, lime, and cilantro. It was GOOD. Burrito #2: Flour tortilla stuffed with huli huli chicken, grilled veggies, black bean, tomato with grilled maui onions, charred pineapple verde, sour cream, lettuce, lime, and cilantro. It was also GOOD. Both of the burritos could've used more heat but that's just me. I don't think I've ate anything like it back home but I really liked it.

They are decorated in island themed things, with I believe a drive thru and seating inside and outside. The service is very friendly. Plus I saw that they're planning on opening more locations around the Valley.

Weird, my big fingers gave them a 3 star rating. My bad.
