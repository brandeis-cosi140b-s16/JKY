Hawaiian version of Chipotle? Sure.... But it's not as good. Maybe it has something to do with me going at night? I didn't even end up finishing my bowl and I NEVER do that. Usually if I don't enjoy something, I'll still trudge my way through eating it because quite frankly it's not that bad... Usually. 

I ordered the chicken bowl with all the fixings. The chicken was dry, the rice tasted like its been sitting there all day, and everything just had a strange taste to it. Like I said, maybe I went at a bad time... But unfortunately I'm not tempted to go back and try again. 

The coconut bar was pretty good though.
