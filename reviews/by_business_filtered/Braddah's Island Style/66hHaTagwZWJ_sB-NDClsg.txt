The two star is because I like the bark but the food was not good the Kalua pig was salty and I love salt I had the nachos and the black chips tasted like someone left the bag open all day stale and the nori rice was mushy which I hate mushy rice..but one thing that lived up to all the brag was the bark which was good but not sure I would drive to just get that?!?
