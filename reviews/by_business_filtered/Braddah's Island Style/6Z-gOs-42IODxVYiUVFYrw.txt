Onolicious!!  Seriously good grinds. Da Kalua pork is so good. We have gotten bowls, tacos, nachos, you name it we have tried it. My kids love the seaweed rice as much as I do. All the salsas are so good and spicy but not melt your face off spicy. The last few times we have gone they were all sold out of the coconut bark but last night they weren't and we got a pound of it and holy #%**&!!!! Is that stuff good. Highly recommend this place for good local eats. Fresh, healthy and delicious.
