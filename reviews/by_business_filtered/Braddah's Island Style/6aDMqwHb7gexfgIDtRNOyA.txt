What a great find! I was offered samples of their chicken, steak, and pork right as I walked in; which were all delicious. We had the burrito with pork and tacos with steak to go; excellent service and a clean atmosphere. I will definitely be returning to try their other items. Highly recommended! This place has great flavor and a unique twist to the usual places you find everywhere.
