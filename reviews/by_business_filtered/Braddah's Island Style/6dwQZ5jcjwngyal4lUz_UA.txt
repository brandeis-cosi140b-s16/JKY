Okay, I feel like I just never feel Hawaiian fast food, it just doesn't taste super great to me! But alone, with nothing else, the steak&pork was really good!! 

But I did get a bowl full of extra items to go with! I had a groupon, but it still kind of cost a lot because I was with my family! It was a bit too expensive for what it was. 

I'm not really sure about my entire bowl, but the sauces that I paired them with made the whole bowl way way better. I included a pic of the 2 sauces I liked the most with my bowl; it really tones the flavor down and makes it combine nicely :) 

In case you didn't see the pic, here are the two sauces:
Coconut Colada Pearl 
Pineapple, Lime & jalape√±o  

They have a really great, friendly staff!!! They make you want to move to Hawaii, they're so nice! They are a friendly, super clean business ! 

The one thing that I absolutely loved was the COCONUT BARK. hell, I hate coconut..but their little chocolate brittle was hella tasty! Yum Yum Chocolate lovers! $3.50 for a small, but still, not bad at all :)
