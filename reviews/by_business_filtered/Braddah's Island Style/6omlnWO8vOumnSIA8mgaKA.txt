I had a problem with an order of their coconut bark, I felt there wasn't enough coconut on the chocolate, when I called and complained, a friendly employee by the name of Jeremy was extremely polite and even offered me 1/4 pound box of coconut bark free.
he also said he will talk to the chef that makes the bark and see if he can add more 
coconut to the chocolate. I just wanted to say thanks to all the friendly employess
and great food at braddah's, I will definitely be back for the food and their coconut bark.
Thank you Braddah's and Jeremy.
