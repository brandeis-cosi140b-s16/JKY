Chipotle is a distant memory to me now that I have been to Braddah's! The pig and mango corn salsa was awesomeness rolled into a soft warm burrito! The coconut bark was a delicious finish! My husband enjoyed a bowl with the most delicate & flavorful fish in town! We are hooked! Staff was helpful & let us taste test to make our selection perfect (so thanks Jaime!) we will be BACK!
