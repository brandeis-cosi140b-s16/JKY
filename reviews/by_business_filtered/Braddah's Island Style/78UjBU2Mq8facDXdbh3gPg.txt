Braddahs is like a more flavourful Chipotle. The coconut salsa just makes Braddahs ten times better, it ties in all of the flavor in one bug happy bow. (this is their hottest salsa. I don't like spicy at all but it's just that good that I would pour it on and eat it with a contented grin and sniffles from the heat)

Nowadays tho every time I go to Braddahs, I've been more and more disappointed. The biggest letdown is that every single time I've gone recently, they are out of ALL the salsas,   I would have been happy with any salsa even if the other ones are on the sweet side. It's a little dry without salsas but I expect that's just a preference. I don't understand how every single time I go they are out of something that is so integral to the flavor! 

Today I go in and of course they're out of all salsas..boo but OK I'm used to it by now. I order a salad it's smushed into a small plastic container. By the time I get home my salad is soggy and limp from being smushed into a tiny container. Not happy. Pretty sure I'm not going back.
