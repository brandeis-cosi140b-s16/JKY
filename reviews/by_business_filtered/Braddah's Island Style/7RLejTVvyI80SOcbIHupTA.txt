Tried this place with a Groupon today at lunch and we were very pleased!  We ordered pork burritos and they were huge. I read a few reviews on the portion sizes being on the small side but not with the burritos.  The service was also outstanding.  They offered us samples of the meat when we walked in since we have never been here before.  The pork was definitley my favorite but the chicken was also really tasty. 

Check this place out for the big fat burritos and great prices. And don't forget the coconut bark - you'll be hooked.
