I've been here on many occasions: hungry, drunk, hungover, sober, and just plain very angry-hungry.

First time I've been here, I was like, "Oh Chipotle, but Hawaiian!" Yes, kinda, not really, No. Ok maybe the idea of building your own food is like Chipotle. But enough about Chipotle. Braddah's is better cause it's Hawaiian food!!!

Step by step process is super easy and self explanatory. If you can't read, the employees will help you out. If you don't know what you want to get (meat-wise), they will give you a sample too. 

Food tip: GET THE KALUA PIG!!! You can do it as a burrito, bowl or tacos. BUT if you get the crunchy tacos, expect your tacos to get soggy.

Pretty cheap if you get the Yelp Deal or Groupon. It seems like they always have it. 

Would come back here, again. Maybe come back here very hammered. JK. LOL.
