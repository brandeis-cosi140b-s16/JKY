great flavor, as a gourmet cook I know how you have to treat pork to get as much flavor as they have . really rich, not abig fan of the beef (sweet flavor not my thing), the bowls are amazing ...love the seaweed rice, reminds me of that flaor you get when eating rolls at a sushi place. chicken is awesome.
