Maybe I went at a bad time but the food seems to be going down in quality, my chicken was undercooked and my burrito was a lot smaller than it was the time before. The food is good but every time I go it seems it's not as great as it was. It sucks because I used to love this place but now I'm leaving unsatisfied most of the time
