We went to braddahs and I would say it was very good. This place can be compared to a chipotle grill. You choose from burrito, bowl, salad. I tried the bowl with everything in it and got the grilled fish. I will say that the portion of fish was only 2 ounces or so. The meat that my wife chose was the steak and she got plenty of it. The size of the bowl was nice and the options of toppings are more than chipotle with option like fresh cut habanero, bean sprouts, and pineapple blend. 
We ended our meal with a piece of coconut log which is caramel, toffee, chocolate slabs topped with coconut. This stuff is the candy version of crack.. It seriously is amazing and worth the trip alone. 
I give it a three star only because the fish portion was very small. The prices were sort of up there when you add Guac, and generally speaking the base food in which you order besides the Coconut Bark is generic as the Las Vegas area has thousands of Mexican food restaurants.
