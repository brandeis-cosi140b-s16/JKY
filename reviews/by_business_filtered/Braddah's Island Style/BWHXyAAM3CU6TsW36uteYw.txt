My boyfriend and I are regulars here so we get our usual bowls. We always ask for half and half of the meats which doesn't cost extra. 
This time we came in and there were two new girls who took our order. She charged both our bowls with extra meat even though we both said half and half.
I told one of the guys (who knows we're regulars) the mix up and he made it right with us immediately - he's the bros for that! Still love this place and we will be back!
