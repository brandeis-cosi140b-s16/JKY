Today I went in and ordered 2 sets of tacos. The guy that helped me was really rude. I asked for steak tacos and one with kalua pig. The steak tacos didn't have a lot of meat so I asked for extra and he threw literally 3 extra pieces on there. At the end I asked for salsa to be added and he tells me I'll put it on the side and fills one of those small containers with salsa. Seriously I have 3 big tacos. Come on. I wanted it on my tacos. I'm the customer and it should be what I want right??? I know people have bad days but he was really rude to me. He was nice to the other people who were there but he seemed to have an issue with me. I was nice. I didn't want to have a scene in the restaurant so I let it go. The guy that helped me was the only white guy with a beard and he said he manages all 3 of the restaurants out here. I've been there 3 times before and was helped by the really nice young lady. She always has a smile. Unfortunately after the service I received today I will not be back.
