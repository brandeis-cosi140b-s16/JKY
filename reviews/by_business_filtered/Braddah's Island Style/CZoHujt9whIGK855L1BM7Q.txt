I looked at the food options as I told the manager that it was my first time, and she took out a bowl and gave me a sample of each of the different meats they had - I didn't even ask!  Each was good, but the pig was juicy and awesome.  The seaweed mixed with rice was delicious, too.  They give you alot of food for the price, though I wish they didn't charge $1.15 for a small helping of grilled vegetables.  Still, the food was good and the staff were so much friendlier than I would have expected.  I look forward to going back!
