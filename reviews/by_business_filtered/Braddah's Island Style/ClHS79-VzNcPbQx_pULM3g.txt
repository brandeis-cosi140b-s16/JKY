I saw an ad for this place, and it sounded pretty good. Exactly like a Qdoba, but with a bit of a fun decor. We were greeted enthusiastically when we walked in the door. That was nice. 

I got the chicken in a bowl, with the brown rice...I was not feeling adventurous enough to try the seaweed rice...and the charred pineapple verde. The portions were massive. I ended up taking half of mine home with me. The flavor was pretty good, especially the guacamole and with the lime juice that I squeezed over the top of it all. I was disappointed in the pineapple verde though. There was not much flavor to it, but there were lots of other flavors competing with it. 

My husband like his bowl, ended up getting all three salsas on his and said that it was tasty, but with no real spicy kick. 

I think that I would try this place again, but only if I am in the area. It is too similar to Qdoba/Chipotle for me to go out of my way to come back. The food is flavorful, but it was not that hot temperature wise. I like my food to come out steaming hot, and this was luke warm.
