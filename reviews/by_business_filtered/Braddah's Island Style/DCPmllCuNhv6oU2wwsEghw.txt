So i went here to try out this place and i was kinda skeptical when i saw that they served tacos. So i went and tried the chicken bowl and needless to say it was ok the chicken tasted the best out of everything else. Come to find out it was a mexican hawaiian fusion thing and that kinda does not sound right. So upon eating i thought it was not worth the $17 i spent on mine and my husbands bowl. They would charge extra for toppings and sides that could be put on top of your food for free. Overall i was dissatisfied with the food here and never again i will eat at this place! My husband and i already can forsee that this place will go out of business. I would say go to Aloha Kitchen where there is Authentic hawaiian food without the mix of mexican.
