I was really excited to see a Hawaiian Restaurant opening really close to my house..man what a disappointment...If you're looking for a traditional Hawaiian Eatery then this is not the place. Dont get me wrong the food is good and the workers are friendly but if you want Hawaiian food then you're better off somewhere else. If you want a burrito or taco then come try this place. Its stuffed with Hawaiian Style Meat along with a fusion of toppings. 
Kind of reminded me of ordering food at Chipotle. Good luck to this business..


Sorry I dont think I'll go back even if it is across the street.
