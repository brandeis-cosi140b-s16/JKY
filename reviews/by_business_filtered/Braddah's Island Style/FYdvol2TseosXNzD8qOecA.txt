I saw this place on Groupon and thought that it looked interesting, so we gave it a try. I am so glad I did. The first thing we noticed when we walked in was the clean modern decor. I was very impressed. Very spacious dining room and outside seating. The menu consisted of tacos, burritos, bowls etc. Your typical Chipotle menu, but what made it stand out was the meat selections were all Hawaiian local style preparations such as pulehu steak, kalua pig, huli huli chicken and grilled fish. The girl behind the counter generously offered a sample of the kalua pig which I found to be delicious, tender and juicy. We ordered 3 huli huli chicken burritos, a kalua pig bowl and a kalua pig burrito along with a kids menu cheese quesadilla. The kids meal comes with tortilla chips and a drink. Although we were thoroughly impressed by the food and the service, what really pleased me is that they pay attention to the small details like the cutlery, napkins, and to-go bags. All of these were pretty "high end" when it comes to disposables. The napkin was nice and thick, the kind you would get at an actual nice sit down restaurant. The cutlery was sturdy and the to go bag was not some cheap plastic bag, it was a nice, large, sturdy shopping bag with handles. 
I know this place is new, and I really hope they make it. I know I will definitely spread the word and keep coming back especially during my lunch breaks at work because they ingeniously also have a DRIVE THRU! Yay!!!
