Employees were not that helpful and a bit rude. We waited a few minutes for them to notice we walked in the door. I thought the food was pretty good (I tried a grilled fish bowl) yet it was under-seasoned and none of the hot sauces they offered had any heat. (One was kiwi and the other was raspberry I think). Prices and portions were reasonable and similar to Chipotle.
