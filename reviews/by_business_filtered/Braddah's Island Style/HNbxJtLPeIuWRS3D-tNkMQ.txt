Finally got a chance to try this place out. The guy at the register was super nice, asked if it was my first time in, it was, and gave me a sample of the chicken, beef and pork. I originally planned on getting the 3 tacos but the samples were so good I doubled my order to get 2 of each so my boyfriend could try them too. Got a combination of soft and crunchy tacos but the crunchy taco shells are amaze-balls. Will definitely be going back for more.
