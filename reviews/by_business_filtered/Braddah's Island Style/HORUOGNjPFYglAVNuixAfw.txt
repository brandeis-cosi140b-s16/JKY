This place is just as the review says-- OK.

Service was lackluster. Most of the young men working in the store were on their phones most of the time we were sitting and eating our food. I find that pretty tacky, to be honest. Maybe I'm just not on that Island Time like they are.

I had the fish tacos and my husband had a steak bowl. The food had a nice fresh taste about it. It felt like we were eating really healthy and clean. The fish was good. I would definitely order it again. My husband's steak left a lot to be desired.

I have heard the coconut bark is amazing, and I would go back to try it, however my husband's words when leaving were that he would choose Zaba's, Cafe Rio or Chipotle over that any day. It was just "ok." Sadly, not as good as the Instagram pics make it look.

I think the service and the tiny excuse of napkins were really the drag down for us both.
