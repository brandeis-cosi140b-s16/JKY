Took the family to lunch today and it was the first time for my husband and had a fabulous time! Thank you Tea for a wonderful experience. The food was awesome and now we are addicted to the "Bark!!!" Love the island music. It made for a great eating experience/atmosphere. Definitely love the fish and seaweed rice! Will be coming back to visit again soon! Thanks again for a wonderful meal.
