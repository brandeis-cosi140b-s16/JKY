I am never going to chipotle again. Seriously. Not when a place is serving up burritos like this for the same price. Let's just put it this way: eating a Braddah's burrito was a transformative experience if you're a burrito addict like me. I had mine filled with pulled pork and steak, black beans, seaweed rice (GAME CHANGER), all the veggie toppings, roasted corn salsa, and spicy salsa fresca and lime juice over everything. The steak has a light, sweet curry flavor that is unexpected and 100% delicious, and that pork is everything you want from a Hawaiian barbecue: juicy, salty, and nothing overpowering that pork flavor. And that rice. Ohh, that seaweed rice. Divine. I think it was cooked with coconut milk...I definitely was getting notes of coconut from something. Put all these things together, and you get a Hawaiian party in your mouth. It was like the way more interesting islander cousin of chipotle, and once you try it, you'll probably never go back. 10/10. Also the staff was super friendly and cool and they give discounts to UNLV students! I'll be back for sure!
