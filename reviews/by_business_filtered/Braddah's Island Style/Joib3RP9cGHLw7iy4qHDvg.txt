Awesome concept. The flavor of the hulihuli chicken was authentic. My wife had the pulehu steak bowl. I like that they only serve brown rice, with or without the seaweed. Super friendly service. The restaurant is clean, and the decor is like a vintage plantation house in Hawaii. The Coconut Bark is a must try. It is dangerously Ono!  Dieters beware!
