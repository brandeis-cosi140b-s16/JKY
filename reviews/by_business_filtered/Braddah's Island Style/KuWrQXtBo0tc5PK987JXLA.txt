Ughhhhhhhhhhh. I wish I was able to comment on other reviews. 


Yes this place is chipotle STYLE.... But 100 times better. And just in case all you yelpers didn't know... Chipotle was previously a subsidiary of McDonald's. Last time I checked McDonald's isn't usually the healthiest choice out there. 

Honestly I come here at least once a week. I can't say enough good things about this place. My 2 year old son doesn't like meat. But every time we get the fish from braddahs he eats it all!! And some!! Food is always fresh, the staff is always friendly, portions are always large and the price is reasonable. I've been going here religiously for over a year now. Chipotle has never tasted the same.


For those who say the food is greasy here.... You probably got the pig. Which is not greasy but fatty. Because it's PORK. And it's slow cooked. 




The coconut bark is amazing. Seriously. Get a box and you won't be able to stop eating it.
