Food and service were excellent! My husband and I went here on our vacation because we had a groupon and it had great reviews. The manager or owner was extremely nice and gave us samples to try. The set up was fast casual similar to Qdoba or Chipotle which we love. I had a salad with the Huli Huli chicken which was delicious (also enjoyed the sample of Kalua pig). The coconut bark was a sweet and salty unique dessert which we both loved. I would definitely recommend this place and hope they franchise since we don't even live in the area!
