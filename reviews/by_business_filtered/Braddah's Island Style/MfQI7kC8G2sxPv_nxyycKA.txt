Tried it for the first time tonight, and boy am I glad I did. The pork burrito was amazing.  Checkin on yelp and get a free small bag of bark... Next time I will be getting a box of bark!  The sauces were not as hot as depicted on the menu, and I was expecting a little more heat.  Overall, one of the best "build your bowl/burrito" joints I've ever been to.
