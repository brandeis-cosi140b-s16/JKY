Quite impressed with Braddah's...wish they had em in San Diego! Happened to ask if they were in some way related to Chipotle and sure enough, they owner used to have some conncetion. It's like Chipotle but w an island twist. Loved the steak bowl with rice and cabbage and their mildest salsa they got. Think it's tomatillos with pinapple or something. Service was excellent! I came in late one Sunday evening and the gentleman in the kitchen prepared me steak, even though they had already ran out. Any other place, I would've been told "sorry, we are out of steak." I walked out one happy customer! :)
