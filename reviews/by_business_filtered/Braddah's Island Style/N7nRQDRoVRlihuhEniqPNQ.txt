Always impressed. I was on my way to an appointment, and noticed this location (I just ate at the Centennial Hills location for dinner last night) and so With my daughters prompting (begging) we decided to stop by for lunch. 

The kalua pork is my favorite. I also love the charred pineapple verde salsa. So much yum. I made sure not to forget the coconut bark this time, and I was not disappointed. It's a chocolate salty caramel treat with a bit of crunch in the middle. Very rich, and a little goes a long way. Don't forget about the "hot" sauces! 

I love this place! And so does my picky daughter. Awesome restaurant! Oh, I almost forgot to mention the super friendly service. All of the staff are pleasant and helpful. Great find. :)
