This place is tasty. I have come back about 4 times I believe. I've always gone through the drive thru but my last visit, I wanted to see what it was like inside. It's a nice ambiance and the people are nice. My only gripe is that when I pay for guacamole (just like I do with Chipotle and other similar places), I expect a whole scoop full like Chipotle does. The woman whom served me was scooped less than a quarter of the spoon for my burrito. That really didn't sit well with me. Especially, not to mention, when I went through the drive thru the time before, I paid for guacamole and it never made it in the bowl....or better yet, maybe it did but that is how chincy the portion was--too small to not even taste that it was in there. Service is important to me so stars are sacrificed even when the food is tasty. I hope this makes a difference for future visits.
