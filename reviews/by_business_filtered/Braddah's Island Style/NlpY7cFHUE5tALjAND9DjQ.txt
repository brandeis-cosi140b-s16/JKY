This past Saturday was my first dining experience here. A lot of my friends visited before and said the food was really good - they described it as the "Hawaiian version of Chipotle." Because I haven't tried Chipotle, I didn't really know what to expect. Walking into the restaurant, the first thing I noticed was the warm and friendly atmosphere. Since I said I was a first timer, the lady let me sample the meats which were all very tasty. I decided to get half Kalua pig and half Huli Huli chicken in bowl with brown rice, beans, spicy sauce, lettuce, cheese, and then added a little mango pineapple sauce they had by the condiments. The food was very delicious and definitely lived up to its hype! Not only that, but the staff were extremely sweet and gave great customer service which made my experience here all the better.
