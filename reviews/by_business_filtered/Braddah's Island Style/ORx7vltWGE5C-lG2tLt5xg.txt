Great food! Now I did say "howgoesit" to the server and she had no idea what that meant but I'm being nit picky haha. The food is absolutely delicious. Every ingredient in my bowl did not disappoint. I really liked the pork. The coconut bark is an amazing dessert and worth the price. I'd definitely go again. Budget around $10 for a meal and another $5 for an order of the bark
