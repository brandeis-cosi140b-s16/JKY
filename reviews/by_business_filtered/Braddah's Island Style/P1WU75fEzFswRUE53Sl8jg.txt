Two words. Coconut Bark. 
I reminds me of toffee, accept delicious, because I dislike toffee. A must try!


The Staff is very friendly, and the food portions are generous. The style is similar to chipotle, or Zaba's Mexican Grill as you go down the line and pick your food options. The meat options were tasty. My Favorite by far is the Pork. Delicious and flavorful. The other meat options were not filled with gristle either, and this is a major plus for me. Chicken, steak, and fish are also up for grabs.  

Finally, you can toss some sauces on the food to add some extra kick. I tried a raspberry hotsauce, and a pinapple jalapeno sauce. Both taste great, and do not overpower the food, but add to it as a compliment, unlike most hotsauces that take over the flavor..
