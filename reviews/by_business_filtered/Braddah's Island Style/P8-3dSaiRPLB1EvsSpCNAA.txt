I love this place. I would have never heard of it until my daughter starting working there. The place is amazing. The people there are so nice and so friendly. Even the Customers are Friendly. It very relaxed and chilled in there. Clean. Food IS to DIE FOR. OMG. I am so addicted to this place I can eat there 24/7 365 days a year. It is just Amazing. I am a regular customer there even when my daughter is not working, I still GO there. It is amazing atomsphere, with tables outside and nice music of all backgrounds and styles. I just am a number one Fan, and when asked, I say GO TO Braddahs on Maryland .. its the BOMB SPOT. Good hang out place, and good place to just unwind, do some studying, quick notes, jotting down days end, just enjoying the lovely Island aroma of the good food they have. Very clean, and the food is not sitting out looking OLD and stale, they keep it fresh and ready. Nice.. very nice. going tomorrow to get my craving fixed. Check it out.. BRADDAH's Its the bomb. Good for family, kids, students, dates, gatherings, whatever.. its All for You. Nice.
