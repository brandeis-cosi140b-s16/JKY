Despite the other raves about this place I find it just all right. It's good but not something I'd go out of the way for. I guess I end up comparing it to Chipotle, and in comparison I like Chipotle better because the flavors are bolder and the portions are bigger there. I want to try the grilled veggies but I don't really want to pay more for them because it's already pricey to me. 

I will need to at least go back and try the dessert.
