Braddah's is a decent change from Chipotle. All of their meats (chicken, steak, pork, & fish) are packed with flavor.  It somewhat makes up for their seaweed rice, which is always dry and pretty bland.. This I'd have to skip. Like chipotle, you can choose from burritos, rice or salad bowls, and/or tacos. Their "toe-curling" sauces aren't the best.. They are oddly sweet and taste like fruity jellies more than hot sauce. And the coconut colada pearl is.. Interesting and something you should try when you go. My boyfriend and I add their spiciest salsa to make up for the lack of spice.
I give it four stars because the meat alone is great and the food tastes fresh. Also the employees are extremely friendly and accommodating. They will gladly explain items on the menu and let you taste test  the options before you decide which to get. Also UNLV students get free drinks with a rebel ID :-)
