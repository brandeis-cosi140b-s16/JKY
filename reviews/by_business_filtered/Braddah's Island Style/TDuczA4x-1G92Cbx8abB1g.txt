I usually enjoy Braddahs, but this time around the service was sub par.  I always get a pig bowl and I love the papaya ranch on top.  On this trip the lady that made the bowl was very unfriendly which is strange because I'm accustomed to such friendly service.  One thing I value at a place that I frequent is consistency.   The papaya ranch was nasty.  Literally nasty.  It was not even the regular consistency.  It tasted weird and was watery.  The date on the lid was 7/12.  I asked if that was the date it was made and the lady got snippy.   I told what was wrong and she said she'd report it to the cook.  Went to the grill and told the cook what was wrong.  Then he got nasty and said that doesn't mean there's anything wrong with it.  As a consumer I didn't ask for that nonsense.  When I tell you the food is not up to standard I expect you to fix it.   Not make excuses.  I don't know if they're under new management, but these folks are making you look bad.   I'm hoping this is an isolated incident.  Guess we'll see.  I took off 2 stars for poor service and yucky ranch.
