As everyone else has mentioned, this is the Hawaiian version of Chipotle. No need to re-invent the wheel and create a different concept for ordering when it's effective. After eating here a couple times, I have to say that I prefer this place to Chipotle. I love the island flavors especially the huli huli chicken and kalua pig. Top it off with seaweed rice and pineapple mango salsa -- on tacos, burritos, or bowls -- and you have a clear winner in fast food.
