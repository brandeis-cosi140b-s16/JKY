This place is amazing when I first went here I was like another place with crazy creations.. Now I come here like a regular the food is good especially the chicken this is in my weekly spot for lunch I love this place don't go all out for the flavors try a basic combo before going  all out but it doesn't matter if you get something. You don't like you'll probably end up liking it or loving it lmao lol
