Thanks Yelp for helping me find this Las Vegas Gem! I was staying at a timeshare near this location and saw the interesting food and good reviews. 

We stopped in for a quick dinner after a long road trip from Denver. My Dad and I drove over and picked up 2 bowls for us and 2 for our girls. We all loved it so much that we ate here again before we left Vegas. 

As others have noted it's like a Hawaiian Chipotle.  The meats:Chicken, Beef and Pork all were great with a lot of flavor and a decent amount in the bowls and burritos.  They even gave us a quick sampling of each when we all came back. The salsa had good flavor but was not very hot. Maybe it's because we are fire eaters here at the home of Chipotle but it still was good. I liked the crunch of the cabbage and bean spouts, it added a nice texture to the bowls. The fresh lime wedge helped to create a nice pop of citrus in your mouth to go with the other quality ingredients.  

On our first visit it was near closing time and when my Dad ordered the standard rice the employee noticed it was looking stale in the bin, called for another batch to be brought out to fill his order. I know almost all other restaurants would have just given him the older rice and not seemed to care, thanks for making your customers orders top quality all the time. 

Don't forget to check in here as the free coconut bark is outstanding.  If you haven't tried it, open the check in offer in the store and try a bit as you will probably want to buy more, it's just that good!
