Omg this place is great I usually get the brown rice, chicken with cheese, sour cream and cilantro, last time I went they were out of cilantro and was so great and gave me extra meat and bark to substitute for not having cilantro ( can you say awesome). It was my first time having their bark and I couldn't believe how amazing it was I cannot go without it now. Will deft go back again and again for it.
