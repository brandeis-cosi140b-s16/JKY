My friend described this place as the "Hawaiian Chipotle" but it far exceeded my expectations of that description. I was greeted by the lovely lady that works here, and I felt so welcome! Knowing it was my first time, she offered me samples of the chicken and pork, two of the most popular meat options. I was torn because both were super succulent and heavy with flavor. 

I settled on the bowl option, which was piled with brown seaweed rice (flavorless but healthy) and pork. The mango corn salsa has a good kick in spice, which I would recommend. You have to notice what other options there are, i.e. guacamole, sour cream, limes, because they will not necessary list out what else you can put in your meal. The meat was STELLAR but the whole bowl itself was just a solid four stars.

Lastly, you MUST try the coconut bark. I was hesitant because I'm not a fan of coconut and they had their holiday peppermint bark option available, but I wanted to try the original... plus there is a Yelp check in special where you can get 1/4 pound of coconut bark for free with your meal. OH MAN. This is the best bark I have ever tasted, like everything is just perfect from the amount of coconut and chocolate to the gooey caramel on the bottom. Make sure to eat this while it's chilled!

Wonderful experience, and I'm jealous of all the UNLV students who have convenient access to Braddah's!
