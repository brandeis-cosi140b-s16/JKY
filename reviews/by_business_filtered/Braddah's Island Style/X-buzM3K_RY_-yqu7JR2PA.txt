This place is still great!

I get the Burrito with Flour Tortilla, Kalua Pork, Seaweed Rice, Black Beans, Cabbage and Lettuce.  For Salsas, I got the Mango & Roasted Corn and Tomato W/ Grilled Maui Onion.

Coconut Bark - Awesome!

I went here with my wife about two weeks ago for some dinner. We came around 8:00pm.  I have to admit, this time I was screaming and dying inside.  I didn't get as big as a portion as I normally do with my Kalua Pork.  The food was still good, however I was a little disappointment.   

Consistency is key here.   I will give this place another try again, this has to be a fluke!
