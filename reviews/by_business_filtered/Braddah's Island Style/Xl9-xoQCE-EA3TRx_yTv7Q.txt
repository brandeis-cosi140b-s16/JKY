I live right around the corner from here so finally after putting it of for 5 months since moving here with my boyfriend we decided to try it. I got the chicken burrito and my boyfriend got the pig burrito. Mine was decent and my boyfriend raved about his, even after we were walking home!!

You have to get pineapple salsa verde. SO GOOD. Also try the seaweed rice, didn't think I made a good choice but it was!

Then at the end you also get the coconut bark which is great. Almost bought a pack to take home but I had to use self control.. Lol 

I would recommend going here instead of chipotle one night and just try the difference. Huge proportions for a decent price. Can't beat that
