Today was my second time here. I barely got of my car and the owner, was like "Welcome back!"  WOW, not that's AWESOME!! 
As soon as you walk in you get the same greeting from everyone. When you get to the counter they ask if this is your first visit or a welcome back. The first time I got the corn tortilla tacos and had the 3 different meats. Chicken, pulehu steak and kalua pig they will pile on the toppings. Today I had the salad bowl with chicken. 
Even though I've only been there twice, it's very good. And "NO" it's NOT authentic Hawaiian style plate lunch.  I would say this place has a Chipotle concept.

So...call it LocoMex :)
