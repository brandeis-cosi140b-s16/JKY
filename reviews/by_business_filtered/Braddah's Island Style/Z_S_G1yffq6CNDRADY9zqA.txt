I would probably give this place 3 stars if they weren't so darned friendly!  

Here's what I love about Braddah's:
- The service.  ALWAYS super friendly and accommodating! 
- The seaweed rice.  Very unique (and yummy) flavor.
- Their chicken and pork.  The steak is too sweet for me, but I love their chicken and pork.  Very flavorful and tender.
- The coconut bark.  Man oh man if I didn't think I'd blow up to 400 lbs, I'd be in there buying this stuff every day.  Soooooo good.

Here's where I think Braddah's could use some work:
- The tortillas.  If they made their own tortillas, or even just bought higher-quality tortillas, their tacos and burritos would taste 100% better.  Until they figure this out, I'll only be getting a salad or a bowl.
- The salsas and sauces.  The regular tomato-based salsa is pretty ok, but I haven't been impressed with any of their other salsas or sauces.  Blah.
- Pricing. It's nice that their pricing is simple until you realize you are paying the same price for your little salad as you are for a giant burrito.  And since I really hate their tortillas and will only get a salad or a bowl, I feel pretty jipped.

So there ya go!  Will I go back to Braddah's?  Yes.  Can they make some big improvements?  For sure.
