Chipotle meets the Islands.   I purchased a Groupon and was able to order more than my usual amount of food.  Staff are super helpful and offered us a sample of the meats.  Both the kalua pig and huli huli chicken are delicious - couldn't make up my mind.  Had three tacos with each meat - with their rice, salsa, guac and cabbage.  Fantastic value and totally yummy.  Portions are HUGE - I think it is a matter of which fixings you want as I couldn't eat more than one and a half taco - and I can eat!   Coconut Bark is a must.  Delicious food - friendly staff.  Definitely a must try.  Take your time to review the menu before you order - many yummy items.   I hope this place comes to California.  Check it out!
