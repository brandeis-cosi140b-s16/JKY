So my first try here and can't pass by some new pig. Had some errands to run and didn't want stuff to get soggy and they had no problem putting the pig in a bowl so I could make the tacos later. Sweet. They let me have a few samples and the steak and chicken were great but give me that pig!!
Mahalo!
