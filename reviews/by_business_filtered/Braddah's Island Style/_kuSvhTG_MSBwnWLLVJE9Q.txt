We stumbled upon this place while looking for a lunch spot after hiking one afternoon. Upon entering we were welcomed by a very friendly staff who asked if we had ever been there before and when we said we had not, they offered us a sampling of some of their meat options - kalua pig and huli huli chicken. After reviewing the menu, you will immediately be able to tell that this place reminds you of other burrito, bowl, and taco places where you can build your own meal, but this definitely comes with the aloha flavor. 

Step 1 - Choose your setting - burrito, 3 tacos, bowl, or salad
Step 2 - Choose your meat - huli huli chicken, kalua pig, pulehu steak, grilled fish or grilled veggies
Step 3 - Add rice, black beans, grilled veggies (extra charge), guacamole (extra charge)
Step 4 - Choose your salsa - charred pineapple verde (mild), mango & roasted corn (medium), tomato with grilled maui onions (spicy)
Step 5 - Add more toppings (included) - sour cream, cheese, lettuce, jalapenos, cabbage, lime, cilantro, bean sprouts

Overall, I was very satisfied with what I got. The meats are flavorful and the portions are good for what you are paying for. They also have a number of other island flavor sauces that you can add as well - their version of hot sauces. Looking forward to the next time I can go back to try some of their other options and I've heard their dessert is very good too.
