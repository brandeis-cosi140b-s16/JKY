Two years ago, I didn't really have a pleasant experience at Braddah's and I was quite disappointed. I knew they were doing well based on awesome reviews here but I never had the desire to try it again. 

Well, that was a fail on my part because I missed out. Yesterday, I decided to finally come back and ordered the same bowl I got two years ago. This time, they were generous on their meat, the steak is much more flavorful, toppings were on point and the bowl remained warm and not cold from the various toppings. I also had the chance to try the Coconut Bark & although I am not a huge fan of coconut, I thought it was delish, chewy and not too sweet. 

I had a cold yesterday and was studying for my final so thanks to Braddah's for a yummy dinner cause it made me feel much better! Glad I tried you again and I will definitely be back. :)
