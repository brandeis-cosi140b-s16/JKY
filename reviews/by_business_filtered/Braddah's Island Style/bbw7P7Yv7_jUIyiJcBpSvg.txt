I found this place through Facebook friends and their posts. The food is great. I liked the fish tacos and the Kailua pork bowls the best (I've been there twice). The beef is also good, kind of sweet. I didn't like that they charged extra for vegetables, but other than that, no complaints. The food is good and when they knew it was my first time, they let me sample all of the meats so I could choose what I wanted. I would never have known about the pork otherwise. 

If you're not watching your diet, try the coconut/toffee/chocolate dessert.
