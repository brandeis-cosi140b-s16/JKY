I've been to this restaurant a couple of times later in the evening and I have to say that their food is outstanding! Fresh and tasty and healthy! The laid back atmosphere is definitely Hawaiian and even the decor makes you feel right at home . The people who work there are super nice and they keep the place clean and they are very attentive :-) you should definitely try it out :-) you wouldn't really call this fast food although it does arrive fast but it's definitely better than a lot of the other places in the area no matter what kind of food they serve :-)
