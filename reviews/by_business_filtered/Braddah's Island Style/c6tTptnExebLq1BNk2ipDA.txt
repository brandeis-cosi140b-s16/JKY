Great food!!!! I had a bowl--definitely the best bowl I have had in a long while! On top of that, my very FAVORITE part of the meal was the coconut bark--yumm!!

They also support the military which is a bonus.

All of us were happy with the food, service, and music playing in the background. 
The person in charge (I think his name was Josh) treated us very well, telling us he would clean up after us and they were just very hospitable...couldn't be happier!
