Was just ok. Not bad not great.  Very similar to chipotle.  Slightly more options for toppings...but for a vegetarian chipotle has more options (tofu sofritas) not just veggies.  Meat eaters have fish as an option at braddahs though. Ingredients didnt seem super fresh...browning sprouts and brown guac.  Also a bug on the floor but hey that happens. Chipotle is healthier (non gmo and no artificial ingredients, for those who are health consciious) so overall i choose chipotle, due to better veggie options and healthier ingredients.  Only way id choose braddahs is if it happened to be much much closer than chipotle.
