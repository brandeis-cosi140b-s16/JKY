I noticed Braddah's Island Style by driving around, I wanted something different for dinner and wanted some place new to try. Glad I stopped by here to try their food. The workers were really friendly and asked if we have ever been to any of their locations my husband and I both said no we're newbys. The gentlemen handed us a bowl of the different types of meat they have to try. We both instantly fell in love with the pulled pork. I ordered the salad with pulled pork and it was delicious and filling. 

Think outside the box and try this spot!
