Love the food here. I always try something new but the calua pig is so awesome. They also sell there hot sauces which is nice I always pick them up when I'm there so I can use them for my dinners and lunches when I'm at work. Only down fall is the cost but they have earned a 5 star for service and quality of food. I'm glad I'm not a jerk because if I based my experience off price they would only get a 3 star. But keep up the great and outstanding work on the food and you will maintain a 5 star in my book. Thank you for making sure you food is so so good.
