This place is great! Love that they opened one in the North West. Now I don't have to drive all the way to Sahara & Rainbow for some Braddah's :) 


It's like Chipotle but BETTER and with Hawaiian meats. The Kalua pig and chicken are my favorite but the steak is good as well! Just like at chipotle, you pick burrito, bowl, salad or tacos. Choose your choice of rice which is brown w/ seaweed or without. Then choose whatever toppings you want. 

Make sure you try the Coconut Bark! Also ask for their different sauces to try with your food!
