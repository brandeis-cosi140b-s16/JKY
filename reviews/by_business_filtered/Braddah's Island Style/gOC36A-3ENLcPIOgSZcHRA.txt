A Hawaiian version of Chipotle. 

This place is hands down amazing. Their Kalua pig has so much flavor and everything tastes fresh. It's nice that they offer so many options to customize your order so people with the most particular tastes can be catered to. The coconut bark is the best part- absolutely amazing. I swear I am addicted. If you want to eat somewhere with good quality Hawaiian food with a Mexican twist, go here, you won't be sorry.

5 stars.
