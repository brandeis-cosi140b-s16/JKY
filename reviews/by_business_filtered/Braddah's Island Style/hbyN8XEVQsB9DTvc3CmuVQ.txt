Imagine Chipotle had a Hawaiian baby brother (or sister), and then add a little bit more awesomeness, and you essentially have Braddah's. Their food is so good, you'll want to go back that same day for another meal. The chicken is so juicy and tender, and while the pig can be a little salty, it's another option that's hard to pass up. 

When you go, you must do two things -- order some of the coconut bark and try their signature sauces (bottled and available for free use in the dining room). The coconut bark is AMAAAAAZING, and may actually result in addiction. The sauces are the same way, and all are unique and a tasty addition to your food. My personal favorites are the white pearl sauce and the raspberry one. You can buy them to bring home, too!

I know we're strangers, but just go to Braddah's. Trust me.
