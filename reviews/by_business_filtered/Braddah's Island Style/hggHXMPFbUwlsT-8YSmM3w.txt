Amazing Coustmer service! They have us samples the min we walked in. There pork is so delicious. And there coconut bark is something to talk about...salty cracker bottem topped with toffee then followed by a semi sweet chocolate. The then topped with coconut and a pink Himalayan salt it makes you want more. I recommend this place to anyone who loves food :) and island  food at that.
