One of my favorite restraunts in vegas period. Think of it as a Chipotle style restraunt with choices of bowls, burritos, tacos, and other choices. You also choose meet from kahlua pig, steak, and other choices. If you've ever had aloha a go go, this is NOT it. This is more of an authentic hawaiian food. They will give you coconut bark with a check in which is a sweet caramel coconut mix. Definitely worth a stop.
