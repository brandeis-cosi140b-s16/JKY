OMG! Totally delish, but better yet, they have great gluten free options! The Kailua pig and fish are gluten free.  It is nice to have more then one choice.  I had Kailua pig on a salad bowl. The kicker was the seaweed rice in it. Everything was fresh and tasty.  If you are looking for something different then the norm, you gotta try this place.   PS although not gluten free, my table mates said the "Bark" was to die for!  I will be back for sure.
