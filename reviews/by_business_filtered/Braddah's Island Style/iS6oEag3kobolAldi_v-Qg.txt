After having driven past Braddah's numerous times, I decided to try it out for lunch.  When I walked up to the entrance around noon on a weekday, I noticed that the line went almost out the door; this is usually a good sign.  There were about 7 or 8 people in line.  Because everything is kind of labor intensive to make, it took about 20 minutes to get to the front of the line; not good for business people on a lunch break.  

I decided on the Huli Huli Chicken Salad with various fixings.  The setup reminded me very much of Chiptole, but with a Hawaiian vibe.  Also, decided to pick up a small box of their coconut bark which was very tasty.

The seating area was pleasant and clean with a few others eating their meals.  My chicken salad bowl looked delicious, but I was very disappointed that the chicken was somewhat dry and had very minimal seasoning. Boo!  Even with the other toppings this, didn't even rise to the level of a tasty salad.  I had to resort to adding salt and pepper to my salad, which is very rare for me.  

But before I started to eat my salad, I realized that I'd forgotten to pick up my small box of coconut box from the cashier.  So, I went up to the counter and patiently waited for the worker to recognize me and ask what I needed; I would assume that's normal protocol.  I realize she was busy, but instead of asking what I wanted, I was totally ignored.  After three other customers paid, I finally spoke up and asked for my small box of bark.  Braddah's, your workers need to pay more attention to the customers.
