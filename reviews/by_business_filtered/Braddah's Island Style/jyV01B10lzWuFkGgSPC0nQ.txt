I used to come here allllll the time to the point where the workers knew my order by heart. It was until they started getting stingy with their servings is one of the reasons why I stopped. They used to have free drinks for students if you presented your ID, that's gone. They used to have a sauce bar, that's gone. They used to give generous amounts, that's gone. Their food is only worth it if you have a coupon now a days.
