Im not sure it worked out right......I didnt really look at the price but i told the woman I saw the place on Yelp and she was very appreciative.  I told her I had a Yelp $10 coupon and she marked it "used".  I ordered two bowls and two drinks.  She said the total was $21.??   I was talking and helping with drinks etc and it didnt occur to me til later.   That would make two bowls and two drink more than $31.....could that be right?  

It was good though.
