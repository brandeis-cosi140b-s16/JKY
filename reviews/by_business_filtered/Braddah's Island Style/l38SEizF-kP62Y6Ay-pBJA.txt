Tried this place out with a Groupon a few days ago. Food was decent. Like a Hawaiian spin on Chipotle. Husband did not appreciate all the little upcharges (extra for grilled veggies) but he liked the flavor. We went on a random Tuesday night and no one was in there, which was a little concerning. The manager let us try all the meats and did his best to try and make it a pleasant experience but you could tell his workers were either new or lacking serious motivation. Too many choices to make, confusing signs (basically read the menu from right to left), and nothing to write home about. We may or may not be back. I'm still on the fence.
