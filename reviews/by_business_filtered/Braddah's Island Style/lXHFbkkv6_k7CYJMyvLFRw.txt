We walked in and were greeted immediately despite other customers placing their orders. When we mentioned it was our first time here, we were offered samples of huli huli chicken and kalua pig, which were both very good. We opted for chicken bowls with seaweed rice and then proceeded to pile our toppings of choice including mango corn salsa which was so tasty! 

The employees here are very nice and patient and explained each item we had questions about. Many people have compared this place to Chipotle and while it's the same ordering process (choose an item and then choose toppings) and presentation (tacos, bowls, burritos), I think Braddah's is better than Chipotle in regards to taste and speed of service. I definitely cannot wait to come back here.
