They are darned near perfect. I go there almost weekly and they always take good care of me and my infant daughter. The bowl is the way to go. Pork, Chicken, and Steak are all about equally good, though the steak can occasionally be a little tough. Generally, it's all excellent and very freshly cooked. Coconut bark is like crack too.
