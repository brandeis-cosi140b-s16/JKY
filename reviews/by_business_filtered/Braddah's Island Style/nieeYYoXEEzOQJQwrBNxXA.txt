Came here because I was curious as to who was now occupying the old Slidin Thru space...  Very friendly people, offered a sample of the meats so I could decide.  The pork was very good, reminded me of what you would get at an actual Luau in Hawaii..  The steak? Not so much....   I chewed, chewed, chewed until the piece of steak lost its flavor and I felt like I was chewing on meat bubblegum. I choked it down and decided steak wasn't my thing.  Chicken was good but not any different than what you would get at Zaba's or Chipotle...  Ordered a Pork and Chicken bowl, the black beans that came with it tasted like they literally came straight out of a can, no seasoning detected.  The portion also seemed small for the price... I get about twice the amount at Zaba's. enough for dinner and leftovers for lunch, even though the bulk of It is cheap rice and beans, I feel like I am getting a good deal when I can have two meals for the price.  Probably wont come back, sorry
