We decided to give this place a try after kraving some kalua pork and tacos. Never heard of it being used in tacos; so this was a must. Stopped by and we were immediately greeted with an "Aloha." Perfect scenario so far... As we approached a guy (forgot his name) he asked us if we are new here and offered us a few samples of their really great meat choices. 

All in all I loved the experience, food was great! I got the kalua pork and hulihuli chicken taco. 
Here's a tip: read their menu before walking up to order... simple and a fun way to get creative.
