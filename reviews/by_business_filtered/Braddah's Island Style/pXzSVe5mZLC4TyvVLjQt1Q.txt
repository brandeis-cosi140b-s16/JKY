I have read and heard a lot about Braddah's and I've been dying to try it. Boy am I glad I decided to go here with some of my friends!

From the time I walked in, I was greeted in a friendly manner by the staff and promptly asked if I had been there before. I haven't previously, and I was given a sample along with my friends to try their various meats. Honestly, when I tried all of the various meats, they were all so delicious... I had the hardest time deciding between the steak, chicken, and pork and I just decided on getting the chicken and steak, but the pork will have its turn in the future!

The ordering style is identical to Chipotle. If you haven't been to a Chipotle, what you essentially do is tell the first person what kind of dish you want along with your meat. You'll go along the line and say what items you want and don't want on your dish. At the end of the line, you and the people making your dish have made your masterpiece! Just a reminder, just like Chipotle, if you get a burrito bowl, you can get tortillas on the side, which is a definite plus in my book. It seems like you can't pile it up as high as Chipotle, but the food is still nonetheless delicious. Take a visit if you're craving delicious food!
