Awesome place!! As everyone said the huli huli chicken and the kalua pig is awesome!!! I had the kalua pig in my buritto and that bugga was ono aka GOOD!!! Being born and raised in Hawaii its been a long time since i had great kalua pig. Wifey had the bowl with the huli huli chicken. Just like Quidoba where you choose what goes in the bowl. If its your first time they will offer you a sample of the kalua pig and huli huli chicken. Buggah is ono!! Highly recommend!
