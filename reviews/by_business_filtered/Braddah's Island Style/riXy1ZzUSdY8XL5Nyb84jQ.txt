The coconut bark is wonderful.
Everything else is Chipotle-style as other reviewers have described, but with the 808 twist on it.
I used my $20 Groupon here for dinner for the b/f and I and we still had to pay.
I had the steak bowl with seaweed rice, black beans, mild "salsa," and lettuce, along with bottled water and a small order of coconut bark.  I liked the beef, finding it to be tasty and the combo of ingredients was very hearty.
Mel had one side of the steak and one side of the chicken (low carb day for him) and a bottle of water.
Our orders came to about $22.
My bowl of food was so big that I took half home because I had to leave room for the famed coconut bark, which is wonderful.  Did I already say that?  It is. It reminds me of Almond Roca, which I love. If I come back here, I'm getting that again.  They also have holiday coconut bark for sale now, which is made with white chocolate.  Mahalo!
