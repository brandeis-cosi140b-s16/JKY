We tried it last night for the first time. The food is amazing, it's simple but you have lots of options. They have their own hot sauces that compliments everything on the menu and everything in your fridge. We couldn't leave without buying a four pack to take home. There are few places in town that have service and over the top friendly staff that seems to come natural to these guys, some places seem like they try to hard and it's forced. Not here they all seemed to love their job, I thought they were all partners/owners. I can't wait to eat there again soon.
