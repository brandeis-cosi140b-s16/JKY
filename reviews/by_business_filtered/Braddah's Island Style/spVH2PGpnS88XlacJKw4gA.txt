So disappointed in this place. We used to go all the time to get their bowls. Tonight they gave us literally half the amount they normally give us. Usually I'll have some left over to warm up. Tonight we were still starving after we ate. At least we saved room for their coconut bark. Too bad they were all out! And to finish it off they charged adult price for the kids burrito. Last time we'll be going there.
