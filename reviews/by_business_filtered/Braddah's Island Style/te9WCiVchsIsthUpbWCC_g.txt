Hey everyone this place it's amazing it's like a Hawaiian chipotle!!! Me and my girlfriend ate here late at night with a big group and the service was so nice and inviting for this type of restaurant. We had a bowl with huli huli chicken and the coconut bark witch was amazing. Great place, good service good food!
