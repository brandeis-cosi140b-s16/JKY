The food was your typical Mexican style ordering with Hawaiian choices of meat.  Pulehu steak was awesome which was marinated and has that local island flavor to it.  I really liked the kalua pig.  Overall the food was great.

Front staff at the rainbow Sahara location could use a little more customer friendly training.
