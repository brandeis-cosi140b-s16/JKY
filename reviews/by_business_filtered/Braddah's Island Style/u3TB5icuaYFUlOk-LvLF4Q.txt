I really like this restaurant. I wouldn't say the food is 5 star (only because 5 star for me is Sushi, or food at high-end restaurants), but the quality of service and the price for the quality is definitely 5 star for me! I got the $7.50 for $12 Groupon, and I've eaten here 3 times. If you can get a coupon or deal and eat here, you will be . The Bowl they give you is 50% bigger than Chipotle's bowl, and the beef is seasoned well. There meats are definitely more flavorful than Chipotle. Plus they have grilled fish for people looking for healthier protein alternatives. 

The Kitchen Manager, Jean, also came out to speak to me and really took time to understand and value my opinion on the food.  Buy the Groupon $7.50 for $12 and check this place out. It's a good find you won't regret!
