You know what sucks? Ordering something at their drive thru and expecting to get what you ordered to only get home and have many things missing from it. Their food is so good but their drive thru DEFINITELY needs to step up. My salad was almost $12 and for something that pricey the food/order should be up to par. They should also change their packaging for their to go salads because it's not really fair to pay the same price for something smaller than what you would get inside.
