This was my first time here. We went through the drive thru. It was an easy process. We also didn't have to wait long to get our food. I got the Kalua pig in a burrito. Pretty much everything in it with the tomato and Maui onion sauce. Got home and got settled. I took my first bite and it was amazing. The Kalua pig was amazing. I don't know how else to describe it. Each bite was just as good as the first. You must give this place a try! Definitely coming back to try the pulehu steak.
