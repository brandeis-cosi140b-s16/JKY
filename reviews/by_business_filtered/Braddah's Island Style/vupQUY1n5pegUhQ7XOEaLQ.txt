No way !!! This place is nothing special !! And for what you get it is expensive !!! Went one time , think it would be cheep . Left the place hungry !!! I have come to conclusion that a lot of people in vegas don't mind paying big money for just ok food !!! Read my other reviews !!! Sorry I crossed this place off my list !!!
