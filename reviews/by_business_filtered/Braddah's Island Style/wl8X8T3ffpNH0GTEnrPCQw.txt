What a great addition to the UNLV proximity lunch spots. Braddah's functions similar to a chipotle with a burrito, bowl, salad, taco assembly line; however, Braddah's is not a knockoff chipotle. The rice, salsas, and meats all have an island flavor to them which gives Braddah's its delicious and unique identity. Both the steak and chicken taste amazing; still waiting to splurge on the kalua pig. Call me crazy, but my favorite thing about this place has to be that they carry cabbage as a topping option. Love it! And at last, dessert. If you're on the fence about the coconut bark, get off and buy it. Start with a 1/4 pound because you will probably eat the entire box no matter how big it is. Seriously, this stuff is dangerously good. To top everything off, they take care of students, and that goes a long way. Keep up the good work Braddah's.
