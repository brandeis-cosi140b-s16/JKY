paid $16 for a pork bowl and a small box of coconut bark that had three pieces in it.

last week i paid $12 for the same thing and was not notified of a price change. this is fast food, why are you charging students $16 for a small meal? lost me as a customer and my other colleagues as well. i can get a more filling meal at cafe rio just yards away for half the price.
