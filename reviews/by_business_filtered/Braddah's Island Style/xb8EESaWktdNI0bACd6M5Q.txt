My hubby and I were looking to try something new and we were excited to try this place. The staff asked us if this was our first time and treated us like royalty from there out. We sampled all their meats and sauces before ordering. Our meals were delicious and enhanced by the yummy sauces on the side. We ended up buying the raspberry and mango sauces afterward. When we were leaving they gave us some coconut bark for stopping in.  Holy cow! That stuff is addicting. And my husband doesn't even like coconut. Two thumbs up from us!
