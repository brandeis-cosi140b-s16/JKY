Just came in for a quick bite, as this is my current favorite taco spot.  Ordered my usual three soft tacos.  The associate who took my order was Tea.  She's pretty awesome.  Personable, friendly and genuinely nice.  Made the visit that much better.  The food...its freaking awesome.  I wanted to highlight the team here at the Rainbow location.  Great food, great people, great experience.
