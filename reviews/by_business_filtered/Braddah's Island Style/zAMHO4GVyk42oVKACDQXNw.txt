My wife and I really wanted to like this place.  You could deduce it to a bad day but we truly didn't enjoy it as much as we wanted to.  

The staff is very friendly, hence the 3 stars.  

The food... Was ok, just ok.  Mind you that this was our first time, so we really didn't know how to read the menu.  The nice guy behind the counter (one of the workers) kept calling their concept as "Hawaiian Chipotle".  

The problem with that is-that-it is just like Chipotle, especially when there's a Chipotle Restaurant less than a mile down the road.  It shows unoriginality, which is not good for business.  Honestly, if I wanted Chipotle, I'd go to Chipotle.  

Regardless, although this place is not for us, I recommend  others to try it.
