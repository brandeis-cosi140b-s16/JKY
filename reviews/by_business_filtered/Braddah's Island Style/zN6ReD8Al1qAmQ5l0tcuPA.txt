Friends of mine mentioned to me  this place is GOOD. So I had to try it. You know what, this place is GOOD. It has the same concept as that other hispanic restaurant around town.  But BRADDAHs has GREAT hawaiian style food here. I ordered a burrito w/ PULEHU STEAK, PINEAPPLE VERDE SALSA & SEAWEED RICE all wrapped in a  wheat tortilla. The steak was FLAVORFUL and TENDER, the salsa was REALLY GOOD and the seaweed rice was just as GOOD. DEFINITELY GOING BACK! Almost forgot, you have to try the COCONUT CHOCOLATE BARK dessert. IT IS TO DIE FOR! It reminds of when I was a kid eating and enjoying ALMOND ROCA. BRADDAHs ranks among my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas.
