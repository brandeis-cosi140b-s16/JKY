First of all their customer service is out of this world. I don't think I have ever met such a joyous person in a fast food setting. I walked in like 5 minutes before they were closing (thinking they closed later) and Tea, greeted me like I was the most important customer she's seen all day. I literally downloaded the Yelp app on my phone again so I could specifically shout her out.

Second of all the food is ridiculously good. I had three of the biggest tacos for like seven bucks and ate all of them in one sitting. I'm a tiny human and these filled me up without making me feel sick. I think it's because their ingredients feel light weight and fresh. I don't get any fried food taste. 

This is my new favorite place! Great work guys.
