I loved this place when it first opened in centennial. But tonight I just wasn't happy. When we walked in it smelled bad... It smelled like an out house, so right away my appetite was gone. We both Order our food and I couldn't help but notice the brown, wilted (not fresh looking) vegetables that had been sitting out for hours. I wanted guacamole but it was dark brown on the top...I was hesitant on getting any other toppings so I ordered the grilled veggies which cost extra. We had to wait for them to prepare them. And as they scooped them onto my bowl I couldn't help but notice they were completely raw still. Not grilled what so ever. My husband got a burrito and the girl couldn't roll it up without all the filling flopping  out so she just wrapped another tortilla around it. All the food was stone cold and just unpleasant to be honest. Really sad. This place was good. Not sure what happened, I won't be back.
