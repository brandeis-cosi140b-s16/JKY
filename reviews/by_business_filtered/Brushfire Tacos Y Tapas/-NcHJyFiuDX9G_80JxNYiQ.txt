Decided to give brushfire a couple more tries. They've definitely earned 4-stars compared to my first review of 2-stars. Their food is great but not $10 a burrito great and you don't have to put aioli in everything. Seriously, I know it's "trendy" but mayo doesn't belong in 90% of your menu. I do hope you pay your employees well or else it's just hard to justify paying $12 for a burrito and drink.
