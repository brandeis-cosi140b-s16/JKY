We have been going here since they opened and recommended them to tons of friends. We even have a previous five star review. The cashier today added a 20% tip on the square reader without mentioning it and bacon burrito a couple of weeks ago didn't have a single piece of bacon on it. No response via their contact info to resolve when I tried. Please review your receipt before signing will update if owner responds this time
