For a small stand-alone shop I was expecting very good value for the money. I don't set a rating until I've been there at least twice. 2  steak tacos couldn't feed my 44 pound 7 year old and when I asked him why he said the flour tortilla is is hard and crispy and there's not enough meat.  Sure enough there must have been 6 maybe 7 little pieces of meat, and for some reason the tortilla was hard and broken. Come on, even my 7 year old knows flour tortillas should be soft and supple. These should be called street tacos and cut the tortilla size to 4 inches because that's all the meat that fits in it

I ordered fish tacos and I couldn't find the fish in the damn thing. There's a picture you decide for yourself where the hell the fish is. Absolutely pathetic, so this place gets two stars and they should be happy with that. However based on other reviews I will stop by for a breakfast burrito or tapas just to try something else out. But for now, their steak taco sucks and their fish taco is even worse. Simply not worth the money they're asking for.
