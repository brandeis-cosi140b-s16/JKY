Food is about a 3.5 but the service is not the best. We went in the day the had promoted (for a month) their $1 taco day. Put a reminder in m phone and took the girls from work they without notice canceled it the girl at the window talk to us like we were morons! We showed her the Facebook post and still talked to poorly. Then once we made a comment on the post on the Facebook promotion saying we were there it was taken down no apology... I just think it's bad business.... I'd rather go spend money at a sit down that actually knows how to run a place than a place thy can't even run a Facebook lol but as well the food is a little over priced for the taste not by too much but for two people you can easily spend over $25 there are much better places to spend your money!
