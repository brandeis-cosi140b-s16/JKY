This place was very disappointing.   I got there as they opened and excited for fresh, delicious food based on reviews.  I must saw the service was good and the employees were very friendly.   However, that's where the good stopped.  I ordered the steak flight meal.  For my side, I chose the cilantro lime rice and it came with 1 steak taco, chips with salsa, and a regular soda.  The first thing I tried was the rice and boy was it bland and very mushy.  The majority of it was so mush iy was in a big ball of goo.  Now on to the taco.  I immediately could tell that it was cold, the tortilla was not previously warmed and made for a terrible meal.  80% of the meat was fatty nd could not be chewed thru.  The guacamole was brown tinged and definitely seemed it was from days prior.  Blaaahh!!!  On to the chips, there can't possibly be anything wrong with them right?!?  WRONG!  The chips were even stale and not crisp at all.  This visit was a big fat fail.  I would never return.  Mind you that this place is not cheap.  My meal was $8.65 for junk!!  It was so disappointing!!  Hopefully,  if you venture to try this place you will have a better experience and some fresher food!
