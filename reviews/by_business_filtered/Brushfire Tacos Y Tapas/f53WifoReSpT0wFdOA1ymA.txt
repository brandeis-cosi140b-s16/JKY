I had never even heard of Bushfire Tacos until I saw them on Groupon. After my first visit, I can say I'll be back. The gal at the window was pretty friendly for an early Saturday morning. Especially given my orders are never straight forward/easy given I eat a mostly plant based diet. I ordered one veggie taco (no cheese) with a side of bushfire salsa and some chips and guacamole. Loved the variety of vegetables on the taco and the salsa was fantastic! The chips were deliciously light and crispy. The guacamole was good, but nothing special.

My friends tried a couple of other items too:
- papas bravas: smelled delish and received 2 thumbs up
- breakfast burrito with chorizo: received an "it was ok" response

Of the 5 of us dining, everyone enjoyed their meals and said they'd be back. Give it a try!
