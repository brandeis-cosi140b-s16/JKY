I just visited for the first time a week or two ago. I thought the food was good, but was somewhat unimpressed. You pay quite a lot for portions that aren't that big. You also wait a fairly long time for your food. I think I definitely prefer Chipotle for taste and even value, but I think the food here seems more authentic.
