I had the bacon breakfast burrito. It was smaller then a typical drive through Mexican burrito, but was slightly cheaper. The salsa rated 4 peppers was not that hot, so next time I'd go with the hottest one. I normally don't like mayonnaise, but the spicy mayo was actually pretty good. Overall,  not bad.
