The first time my wife and I ate here, about a year ago, she got the bacon burrito and I got the chorizo. Man was that a mistake on my part. The chorizo was very dry and had a gritty texture to it. My wife's bacon burrito on the other hand was on point. One thing to note if you are eating here before 10:30 in the morning is that if you are looking for a wide variety of breakfast items you will not find it here. You've got your choice of a bacon or chorizo burrito, bacon or chorizo taco which is just a smaller version of the burrito or lastly you can get a bacon or chorizo bowl. 

When I saw that there was a Groupon for this place I jumped on it, since I was still intrigued with my wife's bacon burrito, to give this place a second shot since it is a little on $$ side. 

What I love most about this place is the spicy mayo. They put that stuff on almost everything and it is absolutely to die for, minus the chorizo. I generally stop here any chance I can on my way to work and pick up a bacon burrito with extra spicy mayo. The bacon burrito is by far the best breakfast item on their menu! 

My wife and I have also tried their carne asada, aka steak, tacos which were very impressive for their price, but keeping in mind that you will probably buy two or three to fill up. You can also make this a flight where you will then add a tapas to your order, my personal recommendation is the shrimp en fuego which is absolutely to die for or you can go with the empanadas which are always cooked perfectly. Keeping in mind if you are big eater like myself you'll probably want to throw and extra taco in with your flight so you aren't left looking to snack when you get home. 

Would I recommend these guys to friends or family visiting? Absolutely! 

Personal side note:
Although they give this a $ rating I would give them $$ rating because of how much you have to buy to fill up.
