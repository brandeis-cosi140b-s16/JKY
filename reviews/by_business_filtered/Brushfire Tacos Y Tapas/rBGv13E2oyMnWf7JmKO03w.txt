One of my guilty pleasures!! About once a month (sometimes twice :O) i frequent for tacos and i love to see all the improvements and menu changes!! When my out of town friends visit i bring them here! The food is delicious and the staff is fantastically friendly (especially for being in such close quarters!! ) I can't write enough about the flavor of the chicken tacos and the guacamole!!!
