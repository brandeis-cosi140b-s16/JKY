If I was just reviewing tapas I would give a much better review but I've tried quite a few things on the menu and everything but the tapas is sub par. I've tried chicken pork and beef taco and every time the meat is always overcooked and they just aren't that flavorful. I tried a side of rice and beans this week and it was so bland and blah, I didn't take more than 3 bites before throwing it out.
Tapas on the other hand is good and could be great if it was consistent. I've had the croquettas a number of times because when they're good, they amazing but 3 or 4 times they have tasted like nothing. 
Service has always been pretty good, everyone is always super friendly and wait times don't seem to be that bad. The one time I did call my order in, the sides of salsa and sour cream were left out. 
Its a great concept, I just wish the tacos, rice and beans were better because this could be such a simple solution to those nights where coming up with an idea for dinner seems nearly impossible.
