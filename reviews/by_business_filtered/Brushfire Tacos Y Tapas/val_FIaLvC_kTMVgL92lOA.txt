This place was tasty. That's the only thing they had going for them. Portions are ridiculously small for the price. Pretty sure I didn't order off of the kids meal... Took 20 minutes to get my order. For $10 I got 2 tacos 1 empenda, a tiny soda that was gone before I got my food and chips and salsa... Oh wait... When I got to work I found out they forgot my chips. What a waste of space. Zero stars if I could.
