I love this place! I usually get the veggie burrito. It's amazing! It's a little pricey if you ask me, but the burritos are big enough to split out save for later. I like the "flight" option. You get a drink, chips and salsa and a tapa. It's a small drive thru place, so it's great for grabbing something quick. They use very fresh ingredients.
