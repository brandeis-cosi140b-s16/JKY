I have eaten here 100 times over the last two years, not kidding. The food is great! There are a few reasons I stopped going: 1, it is VERY overpriced. As in, you will pay 8 bucks for a burrito half the size of a chipotle burrito and 5 bucks for a street taco that you would have to eat 4 of to be satisfied. Don't get me wrong the food is good, but if I take my girl here we end up spending 30 bucks to go through a drive through for 2 people. Way too much money for fast food. 

The second reason I stopped going was this: I also don't like the idea of being peer pressured to tip someone for handing me my food through a drive through window. It teaches unwarranted entitlement to a young person that they are deserving of tips for doing nothing tip worthy. It has happened to me several times here, and since I work hard for my money I don't like the idea of giving it to someone else for no reason just because they have their hand out and think they deserve it.

Now trust me when I tell you that I am not a cheapskate and I am a very good tipper. I enjoy tipping people who rate a tip and don't mind paying more for better products. However, this place is using a product pricing system and tipping system that is WAY above their caliber and status of restaurant.
