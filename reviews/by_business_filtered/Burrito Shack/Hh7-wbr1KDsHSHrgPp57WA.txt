The Burrito Shack will not disappoint you. Don't let the exterior fool you. I live in the area and pass the Shack on a daily basis. Seamed to be closed until I learned their hours of operation,  6:30 - 2. The burritos are all ways freshly made and the staff as cheerful as can be. Always a pleasant experience.
