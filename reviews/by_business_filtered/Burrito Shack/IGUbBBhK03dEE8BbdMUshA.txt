Don't let the exterior fool you, Burrito Shack has the best burritos and is the best kept secret in town! Blink and you'll miss this hidden treasure on the east side of Power Road just south of Ray, but it's a fantastic family run business in Mesa and well worth a visit if you like good Mexican food. Open for breakfast and lunch, you can't go wrong with any choice you make! My favorites are the Gilbert breakfast burrito and the California burrito for lunch. They are good sized burritos and can be quite filling so try the small size instead of the "shack size" if you're looking for a smaller portion. My biggest piece of advice? Call ahead! They are usually pretty busy and you'll find yourself waiting for your order (which can be brutal during the summer). Call ahead to place your order and save at least 10-15 minutes of waiting. Check it out and you're guaranteed to have a great meal and a warm interaction with their friendly staff!
