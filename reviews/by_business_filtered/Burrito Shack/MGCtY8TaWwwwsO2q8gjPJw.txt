Stopped in to this place and it was hopping.  Seems like a lot of ASU Poly students frequent this place, and after eating here, I see why!  Got a beef burrito, and it was good sized, and the beef was spiced right. Great hot sauce made every bite delicious. Prices were lower than I expected, I will definitely be stopping by regularly from now on. I don't mind the shack part, but be aware it literally is a shack!
