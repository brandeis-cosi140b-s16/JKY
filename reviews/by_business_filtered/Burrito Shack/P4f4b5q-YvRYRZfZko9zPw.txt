A friend of mine will occasionally bring burritos from this place to work, so I've nibbled on their food occasionally.  I wasn't overfond of their bean burrito, but their 6 Pound Burrito, served enchilada style? -Yum- and I'm not even all that fond of green chille.

As Matt S. said, it's literally a shack. But who cares? They've got really good burritos.
