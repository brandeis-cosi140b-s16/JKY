Tried after driving by many times. I ordered the steak and potato burrito with onions. Everything seemed fresh but I was disappointed because the meat was pretty bland. The hot sauce was runny, mostly flavorless, just spicy. My son's ground beef soft tacos were good, he enjoyed them. My mom had the ham breakfast burrito and it was probably the best thing out of what we ordered. I won't be coming back though, too many other good and consistent spots for burritos!
