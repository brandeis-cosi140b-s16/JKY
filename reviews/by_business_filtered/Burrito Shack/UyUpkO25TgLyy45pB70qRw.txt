Found this place looking on Yelp for a good Mexican food spot. All the reviews looked promising I'm a firm believer that hole in wall spots have the best food. This place did not disappoint.  I had the best chorizo burrito in life.  They also make a tasty Arnold Palmer. The customer service was great as well. I'm only in the area two more days and I definitely plan on going back. Only sad thought is they aren't open tomorrow (closed on Sundays).
