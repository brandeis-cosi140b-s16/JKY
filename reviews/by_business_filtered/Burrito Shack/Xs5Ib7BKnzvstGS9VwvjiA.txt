I've been wanting to try this place for a while because I've heard great things about it, and when I finally got the chance to today, I'll tell you that it definitely met my expectations.  I'm always looking for a good burrito, and when I can get it from a place that's literally a shack, that's an even bigger plus!

The burrito shack is located on the side of a dirt road, and if you're not looking for it, you'll definitely miss it.  When you get there, you order from a window and have a variety of options to choose from.  They have a good number of ingredient combinations for their burritos, and for those of you that like to customize your food, like I do :) they have a separate list of ingredients you can add, such as cheese, jalape√±os, etc.... They also have two burrito sizes, small and large, and for people like me that can never finish a full burrito, this is a blessing! Now, if you're looking for authentic Mexican food, this place may strike you by surprise at first because it doesn't seem like it is, but the burritos are just as good as some of the best places I've tried in Southern California.  

Recommendations on what to order: 
- machaca con papas - amazingly delicious! I added cheese, guacamole, and onions to it and loved it! The machaca is shredded beef and really flavorful, and the potatoes are cubed so it's pretty filling.  
- green chili pork - also really good! You don't even need salsa for this one because it is so flavorful and has a nice kick at the end
