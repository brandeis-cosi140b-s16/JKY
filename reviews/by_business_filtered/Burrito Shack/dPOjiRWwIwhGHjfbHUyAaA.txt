Wow, I almost feel bad rating this only 2 stars since everyone else rated it so highly, but honestly, I was NOT impressed and I will NOT be back.

I drive by here ALL the time, and have always thought, "if a SHACK can stay in business, it MUST be good!"  Well perhaps I had too high of hopes for a shack afterall.

I ordered the chicken burrito (my staple at any fast food mexican place), and I was surprised when the girl taking my order said there were beans, cheese and pico inside along with the chicken, but I figured, hey, I'll try it since that's how they make it.... and again, if a shack of a business stays open, they must know what they're doing.

Well, after taking my first bite, I realized that I not only was I glad that there were beans, cheese and pico, but it was actually the best part of the burrito.  Although this was a "chicken burrito" - the chicken itself was dry and tasteless and totally ruined the burrito.  I ended up picking out most of it and just eating a "bean, cheese & pico burrito" instead.

Another gripe, they gave me their "hot sauce" along with the burrito, and similar to the chicken, it was bland and tasteless.  Wouldn't call it mild, much less hot.

Sigh...  Very disappointing meal I must say.
