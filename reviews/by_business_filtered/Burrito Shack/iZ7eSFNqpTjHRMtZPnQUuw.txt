Their enchiladas [red] rival some of the best New Mexican food I've had...and I'm a multi- generation New Mexico native born and raised .  I crave their red chile.  

Only occasionally in the area for work related reasons (I have an office/Fire Center at Mesa-Gateway Airport) I have no issue eating lunch there every other day while working there.  But when I get a craving and I am not wanting to cook it myself and I am not in the area, I am so willing to drive the 35/40 minutes one way  from home just to get my fix.  Yes, with places like Dick's Hideaway/Richardson's relatively just up the street from me, I would drive to the Burrito Shack just for their red chile (burrito, enchiladas, or burrito enchilada style).

I have not tried their green chile but if it is as good and authentic as the red, oh watch out.  

They are known for their burritos for good reason too.  They are quite large and the ingredients quality.  

The price is sooo right here.  Very reasonable for the very generous portions.  

This place is nothing fancy.  It has "patio"/outdoor dining but nothing indoor.  It is almost literally a shack.  During the summer I recommend calling your order in ahead and picking it up to avoid the wait in the heat as their Order/Pick-Up window is not an enclosed air conditioned situation.
