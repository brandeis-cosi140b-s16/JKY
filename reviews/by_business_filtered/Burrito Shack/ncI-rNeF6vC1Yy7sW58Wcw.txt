Came for my all time favorite breakfast a breakfast buritto. Amazing green chili! Being from the Colorado/new Mexico area I am a huge fan of green chili and this is the best I have found around here. Flavor is incredible and spice is just right.
Unfortunately the eggs in the buritto were a real let down and I think could use a big improvement. Overall pretty dang good though.
