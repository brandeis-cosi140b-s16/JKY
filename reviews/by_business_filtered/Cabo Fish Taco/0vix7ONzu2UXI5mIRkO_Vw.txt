Seriously guys, why is the fish SO DRY AND BLAND. 

I really, really want to like this place. I mean, Cabo Fish Taco - I love Baja California and I LOVE LOVE fish tacos (favorite food, for real, look at my profile). And it's in my hood among other places I frequent. Part of me thinks I'm just being a fish taco snob, but several visits and outside sources have confirmed my original conclusion, this place has terrible fish tacos.

Please remedy this situation. I want to like you, so much, just learn how to grill fish.
