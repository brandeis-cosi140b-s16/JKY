As a Charlotte resident for a little over six years, this place has pretty much been a go-to throughout this time. I'm surprised that I haven't gotten around to write a review about Cabo until now.

The place is pretty loud especially during peak times (Friday and Saturday nights) but it has a fun and funky vibe. If you plan to go during peak times, be prepared to wait. However, the plus sides are that they text you when your table is ready and there are a number shops and bars to stop in while you wait.

In my recent visits, the waitstaff has been SUPER friendly and accommodating. You automatically start off with a small-ish bowl of corn salsa and chips. Personally, I recommend getting one of their signature margaritas. I usually stick with the skinny margarita. As for the tacos, I'm a fan of the BBQ mahi mahi tacos with rice and beans. The rice and beans aren't the greatest but a sufficient enough side choice for myself.

If you are a fan of fish tacos and a laid back time, Cabo is a good choice!
