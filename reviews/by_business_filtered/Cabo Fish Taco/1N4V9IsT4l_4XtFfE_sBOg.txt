I would recommend hitting this place early it can get pretty crowded at night but you can usually find a spot at the bar if you just want to grab some grub and a few pops.  The staff is helpful and they will make any dish to your preference: allergic to dairy, no problems; don't like tomatoes, done.  The name gives it away, the fish taco's are pretty darn delicious.  The portion sizes are large and reasonably priced and with $2 longboards & tecates to wash it down, that's a pretty sweet deal.
