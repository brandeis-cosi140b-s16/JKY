Hands down, the best place in Charlotte (in my opinion).  I have heard others say Crazy Fish is also very good, but if you're like me and you like a cool vibe atmosphere, amazing tacos, and incredible margaritas-this too will become your #1 favorite place in the Queen City!  Always busy, but just get there early and have a margarita or a beer and people watch in NoDa.
