I lived in Charlotte for three years and, unfortunately, I did not discover this restaurant until 6 months before I moved away. Oh what a pity! This is in my top 5 of restaurants in the country, which includes top restaurants in Vegas and NYC. I am planning a trip to Charlotte this summer just so I can eat here. The lemon grilled shrimp tacos are amazing. The green tomatillo salsa. The shrimp and crab dip. My mouth is watering just thinking about it! Looooooooove Cabo! I wish they delivered food mail order!
