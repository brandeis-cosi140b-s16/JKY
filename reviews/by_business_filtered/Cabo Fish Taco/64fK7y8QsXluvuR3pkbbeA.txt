Cabo I really wanted to like you... I have given you a few tries before writing this review. 
You do have a few things going for you.
1. Great location
2. Interesting Tex-Mex decor 
3. A really nice outdoor seating area

Let's start with the staff, the bartender gave me the wrong change ( not just keeping a buck or two for a tip- maybe it was a mistake) and fought with me for about 5 minutes before I had to show him the price of my drink in the menu. I think my waitress hated me or just hated life.
 The salsa is corn based- okay, I can get that you want to be different, but the salsa is bland and simply tastes like canned corn. Our chips were stale. The queso would have been okay, but it was cold, which made it form into solid cheese- not very good on stale chips. 
I decided to get fish tacos- I figured with a place called ' fish taco' I couldn't go wrong. My shrimp tacos were really boring. It seemed like the kitchen ran out of ingredients  I think they were beer battered, to be honest I couldn't really tell. My whole tables meals came out at different times and our sides to our meals were incorrect. 
I would have told my waitress that our food was incorrect, but I couldn't find her for the rest of the night, until our checks came.... $12.00 for two bland and skimpy tacos. No thank you! 
I really don't like to give bad reviews, but I can't find a reason to return to Cabo Fish Taco.
