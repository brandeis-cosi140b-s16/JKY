WOW this place's food is DELICIOUS. I had shrimp tacos with a jalapeno & cheese mashed potatoes. DELICIOUS. The salsa seems more authentic than the typical American style with less liquid sauce and more chunks of tomato & other veggies. DELICIOUS.
Service is average. We were originally going to Crepes Cellar but they were closed on Mondays (didn't know) so we went across the street. 10:35pm (close at 11) and the staff let us in to eat. (Points from me!) And the place still had a good number of people!
Good for a casual meal with friends and family. Definitely worth a visit or two or several.
