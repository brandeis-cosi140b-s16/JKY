Never thought I would ever say this....but I have found fish tacos as good as the ones I grew up with in California. Cabo is a fun and cool hangout in an already cool and eclectic NoDa neighborhood. 4 stars because my wife was not a fan of their margaritas, but if you are in downtown Charlotte pop over to this place, it's worth the wait
