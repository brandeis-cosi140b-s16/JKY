We have been there several time since we relocated in Charlotte 18 month ago. We have never been disappointed with Cabo Fish Taco. That place is great, has good fresh food, a nice atmosphere and friendly staff. You may have to be patient to get a seat that place is packed early for dinner during weekend. You'd better come for lunch, or for dinner on a working day to avoid queueing to get a table.
