We put in our name and waited 25 minutes, while groups of various sizes, who came in after us--were seated ahead of us. When I checked back with the hostess and pointed to an empty table near her she said, "I'm sorry. I can't seat you there. It's a fire hazaard." Then proceeded to seat another party there. We finally left. Won't be back.
