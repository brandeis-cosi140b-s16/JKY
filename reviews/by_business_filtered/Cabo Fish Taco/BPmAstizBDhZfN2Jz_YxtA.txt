Don't know what all the rave reviews are for. Had fish tacos today for lunch and they were bland - like having fish & chips on a tortilla, except the fish in real fish & chips is better. Also had soup - chicken & jalapeno; also boring, though better when we added some of the corn relish and some bottled hot sauce. Everything needed salt - and more flavor.

And what's up with no salsa on the table, just a corn & tomato relish? Which was mostly corn.

My fish tacos are way better! Can't believe Guy Fieri liked this place - he usually has better taste.
Won't go there again.
