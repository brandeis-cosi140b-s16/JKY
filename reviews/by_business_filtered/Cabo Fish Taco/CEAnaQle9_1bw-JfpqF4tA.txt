After hearing everyone I run into rave about this place, I just had to check it out!

Parking is tough. After driving around in circles for a while, we finally made it inside. The atmosphere was great for a Saturday night...had to wait a little while for a table so we sat at the bar and had some cokctails - I had the 3 amigos which was pretty good.

Once we sat at our table (about 45 mins later) we started off with the guacamole - it could of used a little more salt, but hey, that's what salt shakers or for.

I then had the carne asada tacos - steak was cooked and seasoned perfectly!
My girlfriend had the Mahi Tacos and those were delicious! 
For side we black beans & rice as well as the avocado past salad, both very good.

I can't wait to go back try a bunch of other menu items that caught my eye!
