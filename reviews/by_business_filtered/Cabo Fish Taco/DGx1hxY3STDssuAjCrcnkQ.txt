I had the "special" which was a grilled scallop taco with pineapple salsa and the jalapeno/cheddar mashers.  It was tasty but it didn't blow my mind.  However the crab/shrimp dip with deep fried pita triangles was ON POINT.  I could eat that all day, everyday!

Service was very attentive even on a busy Friday night!
