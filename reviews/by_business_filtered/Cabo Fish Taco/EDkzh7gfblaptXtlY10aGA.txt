Thanks Yelp for reminding me that I added a photo for Cabo forever ago and need to get my butt in gear with writing a review! 

I went here quite a few times my time in Charlotte and always enjoyed it. You got superb people watching, cold beers, a decent patio area (albeit more mosquitoes than I care to have around me at one time) and reliable food. As for the inside, I have no clue about it and really don't remember it that much. Hmmmm....that can't be a good sign. But I blame it either on beer or the fact that I always sat outside (even in the fall, again, big hmmmm). The first thing I ever ordered there was the BBQ Mahi Tacos and I never strayed from it because I loved it so much. But I think more of that was due to the tortillas than anything, you could put an old dirty show in one of their tortillas and I would eat because I'm nasty like that. And now I'm in FL craving Cabo, anyone want to overnight it? Thanks!
