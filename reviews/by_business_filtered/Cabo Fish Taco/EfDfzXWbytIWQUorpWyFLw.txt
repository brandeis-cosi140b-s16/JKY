Cabo is more like a 3.5 for me, but I'm going to give it the benefit of a doubt and round up.  I went for the first time for lunch the other day after hearing about it's awesomeness from pretty much everyone.  I enjoy the concept - fish tacos are great!  The corn salsa was mild, but different and good.  I got the tuna tacos and thought they were good but not phenomenal.  There were a lot of flavors going on and I don't think they really complemented each other.  Also, the tortilla was a little dry/crunchy.  I'd prefer a little softer, otherwise it equates in my mind as stale.  The service was good, but we did go at a less busy time.  I enjoyed the strange green people art on the walls.  I will try to avoid this place during peak hours but will go back if I'm looking for something different during lunch.
