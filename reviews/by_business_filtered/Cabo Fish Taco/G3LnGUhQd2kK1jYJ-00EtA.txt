Ate here while visiting Charlotte for the week after seeing all the reviews. All I can say is, Amazing. I love how you can pick any two tacos and mix and match them. Salsa was on point, beer selection was great, service was excellent. Had no idea what to get since it was my first time there, but the waiter was more than helpful and gave me plenty of suggestions. It is kind of pricey, but the food is worth it. Also, they have plenty of tvs for any of your sports needs. I definitely will be a regular once moving.
