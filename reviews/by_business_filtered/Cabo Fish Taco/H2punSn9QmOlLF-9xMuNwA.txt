Well I finally made it out to Cabo Fish Taco and I must say I left with a sense of maybe this place is overrated.  I mean I don't want to be too harsh because all aspects were great but great in conjunction with any other mexican restaurant.  I know I may need to try some other dishes and I will eventually but for now I'm not jumping for joy for this place.

The interiors aren't anything to get crazy about, very NoDa, shabby chic like most business in the area.  Not a bad thing, just is what it is.

Our waitress was gracious and pleasant and kept up with our needs very well.
