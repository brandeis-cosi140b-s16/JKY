Love! Amazing service and PHENOMENAL food! BBQ Mahi Mahi is to die for. Only complaint I have here is waiting. I usually always wait 45 minutes. Sucks, but can't complain because this place is poppin'. Wish there was reserved restaurant parking as well. Food definitely makes up for it though. Love this spot so much.
