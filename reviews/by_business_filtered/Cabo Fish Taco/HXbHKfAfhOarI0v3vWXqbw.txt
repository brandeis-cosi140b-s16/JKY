Cabo has been receiving a lot of mixed review lately. Some say that the food has been over hyped and that the food didn't live up to it. Today I dined At Cabo Fish taco and I must say that most (not all things) were actually really delicious. 
I'Ve been to Cabo many many times and for the most part I loved it. Today was no different. We walked in around 5 and was sat quickly. We ordered The Cabo Roll and Blackened Mahi Tacos. We got the signature corn salsa and chips which would have been been nice if they were a little warm. The salsa needed a little salt. Overall I like the jazzed up idea of the corn salsa. There has been dispute about how they don't get the whole non-tomato based salsa idea. Well let me tell you this: most restaurants that offer a salsa that is slightly blended usually arrives via sysco trucks in a jug labeled Pace Picante. Im all for FRESH foods, not a product that is heated and cooled and shipped thousands of miles!

The Cabo roll was filled with cheese and rather large chunks of both crab and shrimp. It was tasty but the guac needed onions, lime juice and instead of rolling the ball in cilantro it should have been mixed in. maybe a little salt too.
As always the tacos are always a favorite. My personal fav is the Diablo shrimp, today however we ordered, and loved the blackened mahi mahi. The fish was perfectly cooked not dry or over cooked at all!!! 
I absolutely love their sour cream and lime sauce they use on almost everything... nom nom nom.

I know service is kinda wonky but today they were on par.

love Cabo will be back.!
