Lunch date with my hubby .   This is our first time here. I had the lemon grilled shrimp tacos and my husband had the chicken fajitas.   I could not taste the LEMON GRILLED" flavor and the chicken fajitas seemed to have a Teriyaki sauce flavor.  

The chips are thicker than I like...we ordered a white cheese queso and a red salsa.  The queso tasted more like the yellow cheese dip to us.   The red salsa was very good.  

Overall, we found it to be a very friendly, chipper, quick turn around restaurant and will order something differently on or next visit.
