Meh.  Yeah, that's about right.  The atmosphere at CFT is fun, and I really like the vibe in NoDa.  That being said, the food and the service at CFT leave a lot to be desired.

We ordered fish tacos (what else?) - I had the blackened Mahi and my friend had the breaded whitefish.  The whitefish on her tacos was completely bland, and the breading was far too thick for fish that was to be served on tacos.  My tacos were better - the Mahi-Mahi was actually pretty tasty - but unfortunately nothing was hot.  The rice and beans were lukewarm, and the tacos didn't even come out that hot.  Not appealing at all.  The corn salsa that is served to you when you sit down is really unimpressive, too.  The chips are tasty, but the salsa is totally worthless.

The worst part of CFT was the service.  I don't know if she was just having a bad day, but our server was down right rude.  On more than one occasion I thanked her for bringing me something (my food or a beer) only to have her say nothing in return.  I was not at all impressed.  Moreover, I would have liked to have ordered another beer.  I just wasn't given the opportunity to do so until we were done with everything.

I will probably go back, for I did find the atmosphere to be fun, but if it isn't better on the next visit then I think I will be done with CFT.
