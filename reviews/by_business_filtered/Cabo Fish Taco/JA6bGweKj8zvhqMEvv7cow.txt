Love me some Cabo!  There are a ton of tacos to choose from and every one I've ever had has been delish. Generally my wife and I get two different ones and share. Today's visit brought us beer battered Tilapia and BBQ Mahi. Most of the tacos come with minced cabbage, tomato, guacamole, cheese, and some yummy, creamy sauce drizzled on. They start you with some corn, tomato and pepper salsa and chips which is not too spicy but is always fresh tasting. Today we augmented with some queso that was hot, cheesy and tasty with a peppery finish.

The atmosphere is funky like most NoDa places and we've always found the service to be fast and friendly. No pretentious hipster vibe here as everyone seems to be deemed cool enough to be treated well by the staff. Always a mix of clientele from the tattooed and pierced to the khaki'd and buttoned down. Nice beer specials too and it was all I could do to lay off the $2 drafts before heading back to cubeville this afternoon!
