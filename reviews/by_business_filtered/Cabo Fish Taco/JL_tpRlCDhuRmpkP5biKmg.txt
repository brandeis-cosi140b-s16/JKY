Having for some reason been here twice now, I've come to the conclusion that Cabo makes it's fried seafood tacos well and everything else is decidedly meh. I've tried two of their specials, which though well seasoned, were just hopelessly overcooked.

Still my fried shrimp tacos were solid and the tecate tall boys are like 3 bucks so it's not too bad.
