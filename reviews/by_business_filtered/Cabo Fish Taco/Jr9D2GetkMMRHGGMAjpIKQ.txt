Visited Cabo Sunday at 1:00 PM. Place was packed to the gills. Got seated (party of 7) in less than 7 minutes. Service was incredible, food was expertly prepared and beautifully presented and we were served faster than McDonalds. I was amazed at their organization which flowed gracefully our entire visit. Our waiter never let our glasses get low but didn't hover. He was very kind to our 2children and treated everyone with upmost respect. I would give Cano 7 of 5 stars if I could. This was many of our parties first visit but you can be sure we will return every chance we get. Their creative,relaxing, decor and attention to detail is a true gift to NoDa and great reason to visit this part of Charlotte. I can't wait to visit other businesses in this part of town. CUDOS
