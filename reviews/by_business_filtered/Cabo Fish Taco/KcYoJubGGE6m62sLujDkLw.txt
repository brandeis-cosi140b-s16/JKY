I had the shrimp tacos and was really surprised. The tortillas were made fresh which is a huge plus. The tacos were also a nice size, plenty of nice sized shrimp. A little disappointed in the jalapeno mashers, they were literally mash potatoes with jalapenos and cheese on top, I don't know I guess I was expecting something a little more unique, but it was still good. $2 beers and good service, can't beat it!
