Cold chips they say they do not make them to order

This place is terrible where did they get the fish? Did not look like any fish that I have ever had. It was so bad I took two bites and left . First what is Cabo about it? and what is fish about it?It takes more than a few pieces of frozen fish on a tortilla shell. Lets see if Taco Bell can do better ?Guy you must have been drunk if you liked this place of course I have never seen him visit a place that he said he did not like?

No No No I should have contacted my credit card company and disputed the charge. What a waste...
