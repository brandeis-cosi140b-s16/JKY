3.5 stars. 

I ordered the shrimp tacos with rice & beans. I'd give the tacos 4 stars, everything else 3... 

Taco orders come with 2 sizable tacos & one side. Mine came with lightly battered & fried shrimp, tomatoes, guacamole, shredded cheese, shredded cabbage (coleslaw style, minus the dressing), and a delicious white sauce on a house-made, slightly crispy white flour tortilla. 

The rice was slightly overcooked and the beans slightly under, without much flavor. Also, they serve chips with a mixture of corn, tomato, cilantro & lime juice which is particularly hard to eat. Salsa would've been nice...

Go for the tacos - they got the name right.
