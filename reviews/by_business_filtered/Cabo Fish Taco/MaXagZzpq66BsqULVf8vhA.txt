As a first timer, I can honestly say that my expectations were blown away by this place. I could seriously eat here every day for the rest of my life and be totally okay with it. I love Mexican and I love fish, so I am predisposed to like any place that combines the two.

While visiting friends, they drove us around different neighborhoods and pointed out Cabo Fish Tacos while we were in NoDa. While they were at work the next day, I went back right as they opened at 11am for an early lunch. The service was amazing (granted they weren't exactly swamped at the time), and kept the water and chips and salsa coming all meal long. It didn't take very long to get our orders.  My boyfriend got the grilled mahi mahi and the steak special taco and I got a grilled mahi mahi and a BBQ mahi mahi. First: the shell. Awesome, a little puffy, not overly greasy, although a little flimsy on the BBQ taco. Second: The fish. I can't think of any place I've ever been where I've gotten that much fish (and great quality fish at that) in a fish taco. At first I didn't think two would fill me up, but they definitely do! I am not a huge BBQ person, so I preferred the grilled, but they were both excellent. I got the rice and beans as a side, and they were a little spicy compared to what I'm used to and whatever spice they used kind of stuck in my teeth, so that was the only "miss" of the meal for me. 

I'm bummed I don't live in Charlotte because this would definitely be a regular place of mine. I will definitely be returning next time I'm in town!  Hopefully I'll get to try some of their awesome looking margaritas next time too!
