Everyone gives this place 5 stars but my experience wasn't that great. The only seating they had was at the bar and the chairs were pretty uncomfortable. They didn't have a blender so they only serve on the rocks margaritas. I'm a blended marg girl...disappointing to say the least. Also the tacos weren't that great. BUT I AM from Texas so I'm pretty picky when it comes to tacos... I will give this place another shot though.
