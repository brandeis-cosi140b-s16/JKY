This is our second trip to Charlotte and the first to this very cool area of the City.  Lots of renovated old brick buildings; a very cool vibe.  Cabo Fish Taco is a located in an old pharmacy building.  Fair sized bar in the back but mostly tables for dinner.  The wait staff is friendly and relaxed but very attentive.  And the food.  I had the signature BBQ fish taco.  Fish perfectly cooked, the spicy and sweet seasoning just enough to compliment the fish.  I actually found myself slowing down so that I wouldnt finish too quickly.  The bar has a good selection of microbrews.  Overall, this is a big win for the area.  Highly recommended.
