My husband goes down to Charlotte often for business and on one trip the group he was went Cabo for lunch, it was the middle of the week and it was also 1:30.  They all raved.  
So one night three of that large group and spouses decided to get together and go.  It was a saturday night in Aug.  The place was packed, there was no place for us to wait, they told us atleast an house wait but to check in 30 mins.  We went across the street to a bar and had a drink while waiting, one person from our party went and checked in after 30 mins, they told us 45 more mins.  We then went to finish our drink they walk around and browse in some stores.  We had to stand across the street and wait, there was no place to sit because there were sooooo many people waiting.

We finally got a table, it was right near the bar, which was packed, and had people's butts sticking in our face during our whole dinner.  The place was so loud we could barely hear the waitress.  For as busy as the place was we had ok service.  They had NO chips, ran out of them.  

We ordered the Cabo roll to start, my husband that doesn't usually like crab enjoyed them, as did the whole party.

We all enjoyed out dinners, they were very tastey.  We all said we would go back but never again on a Saturday night and I am sure Friday night is the same way.
