Yes, another four star review from me.  But the place was great. Excellent service, good food and nice selection of microbrews to match.

I ordered the salmon tacos. Fish was in chunks, lightly seasoned with cabbage, cheese, guacamole and queso sauce. Tortilla was chewy, but still good and didn't "dissolve" after one bite.

Also ordered the guacamole and chips. Homemade and very good, but a little too pur√©e for me as well and would have liked a little more cilantro, but still good. Hard to screw up guacamole.

Ordered a couple of local beers and enjoyed each. Sat at the bar and again, find the best service at the bar.

Small place and packed on a Thursday night. Cool place to check out a "local" Charlotte hangout.
