I'm not quite sure how it gets such good reviews. Every time I come I get bad service and bad food. I gave up but a friend wanted to go just for a margarita and queso. The queso was cold and chips were stale. Service also sucked. We got the check (finally) and left without eating to go somewhere else. No one who works here even smiles at you!  We also sat without touching our chips, queso, and guac and no one checked on us at the bar.
