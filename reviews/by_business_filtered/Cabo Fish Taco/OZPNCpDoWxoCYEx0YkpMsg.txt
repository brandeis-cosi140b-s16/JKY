Am I missing something here??  I've been anxiously waiting to visit this place because I've heard so many positive things about it.  Heck, it's been featured on the food network!  So I finally went today. 
Got there around 6:30 pm on a Friday evening and the tables were filling up quickly.  Cute decor, island music and nice youthful ambience.  I was feeling good...but not for long.  
Chips and pico were served. Took a quick glance at the menu and knew what I wanted.  Fish tacos!  What else?  The place bears the name so it must be their specialty, right?  Wrong!!  I ordered the blackened mahi fish tacos.  ($10.50 for 2 tacos +1 side).  They were wrong in all senses of the word.  Where do I even begin... 
Ok, so the plate looked nice but the fish was dry and warm (I like my food hot unless its supposed to be cold).  It had absolutely no flavor.  Blackened is supposed to be very flavorful people!  The fish chunks tasted like stale, warm, low-sodium canned tuna with a hint of, I don't know, garlic powder maybe??  It had a smear of avocado, a few shreds of white cabbage, a few shreds of cheese and a drizzle of "white cilantro sauce" which was so scant that I couldn't even taste it.  It was decoration, I guess.
For my 1 side I chose the refried beans.  Yuk!  Tastes like cheap canned beans.  I ordered a dos XX special lager on tap and it was flat and watered down.  Even the beer was a hot mess.  And here I am in shock!  I'm not quite sure what all the hype is about. This place was not very good at all.  And I don't plan on going again.  Ever!  If I want good fish tacos, I'll go to the pros... Authentic Mexican.  I'm done!  What a disappointment!
