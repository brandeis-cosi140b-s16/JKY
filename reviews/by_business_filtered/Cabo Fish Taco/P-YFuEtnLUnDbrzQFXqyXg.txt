This is our favorite date spot. We are here at least once every other week, and Cabo never disappoints!! Located in the cute NoDa district of Charlotte, Cabo Fish Taco has a laid-back, southern Cali vibe with 2 bars tucked inside and outdoor patio seating. There isn't a bad spot in the house. The patio is heated for colder weather. 

The food is unreal. When you are seated your server will bring you their house-made salsa and chips. It is so fresh and tasty. I love to try their weekly specials, one of my all-time favorites being the Wahoo taco. Their season jalape√±o mashed potatoes are so delicious! This is available in the colder months. We always start with the crab dip appetizer, no one can beat their crab dip.

Staff is friendly, and service is on point. They also have a great drink selection, and a great margarita menu. My favorite being the Azul margarita!
