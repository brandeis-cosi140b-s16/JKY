This place is AMAZING!! The atmosphere is great, the staff is super nice, and the food is absolutely out of this world! We went on a Sunday, our wait was 20mins until we were seated. We ordered the Queso dip which was served with chips, the spicy mixed with the cheesy was a great taste combination. We also had the BBQ Mahi Mahi tacos. They were cooked to perfection and the combination of tangy and the homemade slaw was perfect! Definitely going to come back again. In the summer they have an open patio which we will be visiting!
