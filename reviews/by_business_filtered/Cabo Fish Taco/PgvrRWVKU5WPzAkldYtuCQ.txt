My wife and I stopped in at Cabo Fish Taco on a recent visit to Charlotte, NC.  We split an order of the Blackened Mahi-Mahi tacos and the Beer Battered Shrimp tacos.  Both were very tasty; however, I preferred the Shrimp tacos out of the two.  We each were able to select from a choice of several sides which we did,

Our waitress Heather was very prompt and courteous and was very good about checking in with us.  Chris, the GM, came over to our table and once he found out we were from out of town / state, he sat down and began giving us recommendations on local eateries as well as brew pubs.  Chris was very cool!!

Definitely would go back, and definitely recommend!!
