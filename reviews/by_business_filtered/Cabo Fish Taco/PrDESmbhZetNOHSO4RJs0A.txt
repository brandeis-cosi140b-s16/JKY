Had higher expectation for this restaurant.  It was so loud, that it was hard to carry on a conversation.  Guacamole was very delicious, but the chips were stale.  When we asked for fresher chips, the waitress said, "there all like that."  Burrito was good, but not great.  I'd try it again.  Maybe they were having an off day.
