After two years, I figured it was time to update my review!

My husband and I love Cabo and consistently come here about every two months or so. There is typically a wait. Though, they will take your phone number and text you when the table is ready. That way you can explore NODA some while waiting. We don't usually have any issues finding parking on the street somewhere.

We came to Cabo last week and split the BBQ Mahi Tacos with the avocado pasta salad side. The avocado pasta salad replaced the Jalapeno mashers and I gotta say, this stuff is awesome! I could just eat a plate of avocado pasta salad!! I love that when you split a meal here, they will put it on two separate plates. Totally not a big deal for them but it's just the small things that counts for me! The tacos came out and unfortunately the sauce was a bit off this time and the fish portion in the tacos was smaller than normal. Still, awesome flavors. 

Over time, I have come to realize that there are some items on the menu that I think aren't as good as some of the rest. If you are coming to Cabo, I would stick with the fish tacos as they are what Cabo is known for (literally). The crab dip is spot on delicious but we rarely order it unless we have another couple with us to help eat it!

Typically there is drink specials every day and they have a very nice selection of local beers.
