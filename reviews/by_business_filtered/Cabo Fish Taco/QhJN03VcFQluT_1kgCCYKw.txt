My friends and I arrived at 6:00pm on a Friday and the place was nearly filled, but luckily we were seated after arrival. The waitstaff checked up on the table frequently and brought more chips and corn salsa once we were out. Chips were salted and the ingredients in the corn salsa were fresh, however,  the salsa was spiceless. We ordered guacamole for the table and it was good, also not spicy. I expected my tuna burrito to be pretty bland judging from the corn salsa and the guacamole, but the cilantro sauce added the spiciness I was after. The tuna was delicious! I also had the Cheapo margarita and that was very smooth.
