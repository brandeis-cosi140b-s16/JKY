I love the Silver Surfer Margarita here. Service can sometimes be spotty but I can overlook that for this place. Lots of beers on tap too! The NODA area is a great place for a night out. Live music, great food and fun people. Cabo is definitely one of my favorite casual restaurant/bars in Charlotte to hang out with friends and people watch. The food has been inconsistent lately. I've been sticking to the Shrimp Tacos. The complimentary chips have been really stale and nasty lately. Love the bigger space and two bar areas as well as the outside seating.
