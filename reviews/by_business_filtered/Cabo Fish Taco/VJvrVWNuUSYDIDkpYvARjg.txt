Great burritos, god awful service.  It seems like they do some kind of misguided communal attempt at serving here, and then none of the servers communicate with each other so we ended up with multiples of some things and none of others.  Worst of all the servers seemed annoyed with US when we corrected them.  

Listen guys, theres a reason that 99% of restaurants have one waiter per table, BECAUSE IT WORKS.

On the brightside, the burrito I had was pretty damn good, so was my girlfriends, though I dont remember which ones they were, the fact that 2 different ones were good leads me to believe they have their burrito game on lock.  

Unfortunately I dont think I can suffer through the awful service again, but if it ever gets fixed, I'll definetly go back more often, shame really.
