Absolutely loved it!  Great local tap beers and wonderful shrimp tacos.  I would recommend the grilled shrimp over the fried, but that all comes down to preference.  I hear it can get pretty busy on a Friday/Saturday night so I would suggest going for lunch or on a week night.  If you don't mind a crowd then go anytime!
