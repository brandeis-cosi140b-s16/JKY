have been wanting to go to this place every time i go to the Johnston YMCA.. but only coz i dint wanna bury myself in guilt for eating out just after gyming id drive past!
yest finally hubby n me decided to give this place a shot! the place has a nice upbeat feel....rustic furniture and good music with dim lights give it a nice atmosphere! we ordered the pita points with guacamole! that was nice and fresh. then got the bbq mahi taco! oh that was yumm...i was excite dto taste the mango bbq sauce and the white cilantro sauce! am ot too fond of the fish taste being very evident in dishes...this was just perfect!
we also got their dessert special..a white choc craneberry cake! it was heavemly..i licked the plate clean!
