I love everything about Cabo, their food is beyond amazing. I have been a frequent visitor of the location in Blacksburg, VA and upon moving to Charlotte I was super eager to give this one a try as well. They have a slightly different menu but for the most part it's the same. I tried their sweet chili tofu tacos which was something new to me and they were amazing. I am usually not a huge fan of tofu but these were delicious and the sauce was sweet with a hint of spice but nothing overwhelming. My bbq mahi tacos were actually a spicier than the tofu. I always like to get their margaritas as they are delicious and they have a wide selection. There is normally a wait but the restaurant is a decent size and you usually don't wait as long as they say. Plus, it's totally worth it.
