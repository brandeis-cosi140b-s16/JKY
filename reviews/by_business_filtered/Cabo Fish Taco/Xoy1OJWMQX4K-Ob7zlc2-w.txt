After reading all of these reviews... I am surprised. I think of Cabo as "mine" just because I LOVE IT so much!! So to see others talking badly is strange.
Ok..the cold corn salsa is supposed to be cold! Does anyone heat up chips at home? I don't, but at any rate the chips always seem fine to me.
The wait staff is very rushed and busy, because as MANY people have stated...the line is ALWAYS out the door. 
Cabo is my favorite place to eat when I am wanting something special. It's a great date spot. I always get a fish/shrimp taco plate. The mexi-slaw is to die for!  I actually came across this post trying to find the copycat recipe! :)
