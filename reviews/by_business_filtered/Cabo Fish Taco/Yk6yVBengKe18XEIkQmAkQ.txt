If you're looking for a casual mexican dinner this is a must-visit restaurant.  It is quite loud and can be tightly packed at peak dinner hours, but worth the experience.  Upon being seated, a bowl of chips and side of tomato-corn salsa will be brought to the table.  The salsa is good and different from the more traditional pureed type, but the chips are nothing special - cold, thick, and relatively tasteless.

I've only ever ordered the tacos here.  It's not stated on the menu, but you can combine any two tacos for the taco plates.  I chose the BBQ mango and Tavaru Wahoo tacos.  The BBQ mango is super saucy and flavorful, and the Tavaru has a stellar honey-wasabi sauce.  All of the entrees are served with a side and I chose the Nopalio salad, which was a cold mix of black beans/cactus/spices.  I've also had the mexi-slaw in previous visits and was pleased with its very light dressing and topping with sunflower seeds.

In addition to great tasting fresh food and generous portions, the prices can't be beat.  $10 will buy you two very large tacos (seriously the most stuffed tacos I've ever had) and a side.  This is definitely not the restaurant where you leave hungry.

Several "double decker" cake slices were listed as daily specials, but I was too full to partake.
