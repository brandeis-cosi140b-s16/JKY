So yum!!  Good casual vibe; reggae music playing and an outdoor patio for people watching.  The Cabo Roll Appetizer was filling...should be shared for 3 or more.  I actually REALLY liked the corn salsa w/cilantro & diced tomatoes...it was refreshingly different & more sophisticated than a typical red salsa from a jar.  Beer Battered fish tacos were just ok...put your money on the tuna or the bbq mahi tacos.

LOVED Loved Loved the Tavarua Tuna Tacos...I came in thinking that the seared tuna thing has been cliched to death, but their tuna tacos had a really nice flavor, enhanced by their wasabi tuna & kiwi-pineapple fajita sauce.  I think I'm in love.
