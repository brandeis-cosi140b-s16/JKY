Not only the best mexican in Charlotte, but the most fun place to eat it.  Chicken Quesadilla is awesome (I have ordered it as both an appetizer and entree in the same meal before, it is that good), colorful waitstaff, good margaritas and large selection of mexican beer at a good price.  A few months ago they had a waiter that looked and acted like captain Jack Sparrow and somehow pulled it off (although he kept calling me darling).  No reservations, be prepared to wait (only downside).  Skip the queso.  Fish taco is also solid.  Make sure you don't go on a gallery crawl night or it will be a 2+ hour wait.  Also, the hostess here is typically rude and the times they give are meaningless (we were told over two hours and called within 15 minutes) - I wish they would just take reservations or get a decent hostess)
