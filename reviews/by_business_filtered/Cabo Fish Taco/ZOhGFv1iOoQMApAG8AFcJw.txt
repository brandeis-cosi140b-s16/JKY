Wait, did I just step into a beach island club, or a restaurant in NoDa. I can't tell. There's some crazy loud music that's not *all* bad, and there's a nice breeze on the veranda, and food that resembles baja mexican, but, ehhh not quite. So, I don't know, I'm confused. I want to like it, it's so close. 

Atmosphere: 
This is the only real reason to come here. As far as places go in NoDa, it's got some sense of style and some decent music that jams out onto the patio. It's a noisy place, so if you're a big whiny-baby that can't take some loud conversations over top of some fairly loud music, perhaps you'll be better off somewhere else, because the food won't make it worth it for you. 

Food
Leaves a lot to be desired. The teriaki sauce dishes are pretty terrible. I keep forgetting that and ordering them, then throw a little fit inside myself for not remembering. The salsa they bring out at the beginning is fresh corn salsa that is ok, but they give you a heap of it on a tiny tiny children's toy of a plate, so you focus like Frodo trying not to dump it all over the table each scoop. 

Service: 
Nothing special. Some nice folks here, they do their job and nothing more. 

Celebrity most likely to enjoy eating here: 
Perhaps someone from the Jersey shore. They seem to like noisy clubs and their spray tan makes me think they are mexican. 

Half hour to live and I have to get my last meal here: 
I'd just eat the free salsa and get drunk on some mojitos.
