Cabo Fish Taco is super tasty... I've been there twice but this is my first review and both times was great! The downside.... if you're super hungry, go early or be prepared to wait. I've been to NoDa several times and this place is always crowded.... I'm talking 45 min wait or so.... But it's no big deal because they tell you your table is ready via text so we just went across the street to get a drink and an appetizer and problem solved. I wish they did take a few reservations for big parties.

Their food is very very good. The fish tacos are the signature dish and the best part is that you can mix and match the fillings. There's a ton of sides I've had the nopalito salad, the beans, the avocado salad and they are all very good. The beer battered shrimp/fish were my favorite. 
I also had a burrito on my other visit and it was also very good. We had queso and some sort of crab dip as an appetizer and they were both good. Their salsa has corn and its super yummy. 

The service was good too.... prices are very reasonable and you get giant servings of food so can't complain.
