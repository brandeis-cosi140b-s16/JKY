Been here a couple times. This place is very average.
The first time I had something fried with the cilantro white sauce - I thought the sauce was way too much and the fried fish was flavorless - did not ever want to go back. Needless to say, I returned. The salsa is very bland, literally just a little bowl of corn and diced tomatoes? I tried 3 of the tacos on my recent trip - the lemon grilled shrimp easily the best but in the larger scheme of things just average, the bbq mahi tacos ok - a lot of flavor, seemingly none of it fish, and the beer battered shrimp tacos pretty Captain D's-esque. The pecan pie was nice and gooey, but the flavor was a tad too sugary. And the red velvet cake was tasty with a good middle layer, but a strange gelatinous top layer.
