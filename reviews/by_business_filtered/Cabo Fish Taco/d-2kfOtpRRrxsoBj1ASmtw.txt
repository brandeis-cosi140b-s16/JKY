Ok, so I travel to CLT every month and have been doing so for the past 3 years. My weekend spot is always Cabo to reconnect with area friends. My experience last was horrible, not the food but the service. I chopped it up to maybe that waitress had a bad day but I was still going to tell her manager. This past weekend, I connected with a friend there who really wanted to try it out and I put our name down for a table. They text you when your table is available. I realized I received a text msg 2 minutes earlier. We go in and the hostess is talking to someone with a red bull can in her hand about what I don't know but we waited for about 35 seconds (yes, I timed it) to finish talking.  I finally after about 10 more seconds, said "Hey, we have a text, I think our table is available?"The hostess looked at us, KEPT talking and turned back around. I say "excuse me" She says, "Yes, I heard you but I'm talking to someone else" AND SHE TURNS BACK AROUND. It was by the grace of God I didn't slap curse her out. I was about to leave however, my friend wanted to stay and someone immediately walked us to a table. All she could've done was acknowledge us if that convo was that important. I immediately called the manager, I think his name was Walter, who was very apologetic. Get this, he was already kind of aware of the situation and offered us a free appetizer. I declined it but my friend asked for queso but rest assured, I will NEVER go to that restaurant again. They just lost a faithful customer of 3 years who travels down to have a good time at that restaurant.
