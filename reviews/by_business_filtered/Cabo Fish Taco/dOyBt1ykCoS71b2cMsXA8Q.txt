The Good, the bad and the ugly.  Are you ready?  My waitress forgot my bloody mary, but she did bring me water.  Hey, thanks.  The chips were cold, cold like the bag was sitting outside.  The pico they serve with the chips had sad winter tomatoes and canned corn in it, also served refrigerator cold.  BRRRRRRR.

I ordered the special, wasabi shrimp burrito, it was not made with love. The flour tortilla was cold, it must be really cold in their kitchen.  The shrimp inside the burrito were good, if you took a shrimp bite it was warm but the burrito wasn't consistant, so some bites would be cold cheese and cold flour tortilla.  MMMMMMM, yum.

It is such a cute little place, maybe I will stick with drinking margaritas. As Homer Simpson would say, "mmmmmmm. donuts/beer/erotic cakes."
