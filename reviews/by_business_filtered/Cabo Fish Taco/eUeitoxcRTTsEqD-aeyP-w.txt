I had heard such great things about this restaurant so I went about 1 month ago and waited a full hour to get a table. I was completely disappointed. For starters, the hostesses were completely rude and out of line by being so disrespectful. Secondly, the food was just ok. I got chicken tacos that were dry and flavorless. I was also annoyed that the service was poor because they were very busy, I guess they just needed more servers that evening. Either way, I will not be returning.
