If you haven't been to Cabo, GO! I originally discovered this place in the Blacksburg location, but got a chance to go to the Charlotte location recently. First off, the complimentary chips and corn salsa are amazing! Be careful not to eat too much of it because your entree will be plenty of food as well. Take that note with the appetizers too. Every bite is overflowing with flavor and your belly will be so happy and full. My favorite app: shrimp & crab dip and my favorite side: jalapeno & cheese mashers.
