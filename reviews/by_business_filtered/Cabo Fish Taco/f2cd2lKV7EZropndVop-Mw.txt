1 star for many reasons: SO LOUD, sat us outside and there's no vent that actually keeps cool air in, the salad was horrible, and the waitress was the worst ever.


I (did) love cabo fish taco but last night was a really bad experience. My friend got there minutes before me (so a table for two) and they refused to sit her. It was a weeknight (a Wednesday) at 7pm.

I got there and she told the hostess that we were both there and she then told us we would have to wait. Mind you, there wasn't a wait when my friend got there. So, we had to wait even more. They got our name and phone number.

10-15min later, they texted us so we came to the door. The hostess ignored us as her and her coworker were telling a patron about seating options for a large party. She looked at my friend (who she has now seen 3-4 times) with the look of "what are you doing here?" I've never seen such  a horrible waitress before.

Also, the salads are horrible. I got the tuna one and it was gross. Not worth the $12. Just stick with a margarita and queso.
