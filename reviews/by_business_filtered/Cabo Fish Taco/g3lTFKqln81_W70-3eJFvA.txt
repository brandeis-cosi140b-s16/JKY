I love fish tacos but good ones are hard to find!  We had the bbq bacon wrapped scallops as an app, the avocados were so fresh and the slaw they came with was yummy.  The complimentary corn salsa that came with the chips was full of flavor.  The blackened mahi tacos were delicious with just enough toppings and the tortillas were great!
