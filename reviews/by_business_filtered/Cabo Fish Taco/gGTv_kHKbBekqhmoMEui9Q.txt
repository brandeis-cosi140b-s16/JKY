I'm surprised to see this many reviews. Cabo is ok at best. I had 2 tacos for lunch which were good but nothing to rave about. The steak and shrimp were my choices. Neither were overlooked or chewy, like I said decent. The corn salsa is not a can't miss. Overall, I won't be back and I can't see anytng special about this place. $12 for two tacos, no drink.
