I went wtih two local friends and an out of towner last night to Cabo Fish Taco. We had an amazing time. They have a great beer list that we checked out during a brief wait at the bar for a table. Our server Brittany was fun and incredibly efficient. She was patient while we laughed and talked and ignored the menu as well. We split their queso which was a hit all the way around. I had one of their specials which was a snapper taco and picked the refried beans and rice as my side and it was fantastic. All of us loved our meals and will definitely be back. It's a great, fun spot while you are out and about in NoDa.
