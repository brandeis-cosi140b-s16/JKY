Well the tacos at Cabo are delicious! I got the special terriyaki seabass tacos and the steak tacos and both were awesome. There were tons of taco options and the prices were very reasonable. 

My only complaint was the sound level- it was so loud inside that when we left, my throat hurt from yelling at my friends during dinner. The music was up so loud that, as patrons, we had no option but to talk louder to hear eachother. Even the waitress had trouble hearing us to take our order.
