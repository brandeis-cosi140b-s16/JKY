My first time here tonight. I'd heard the food was good but wanted to be the judge myself. My main dish was the BBQ Mahi and it didn't disappoint. The combination of the BBQ sauce and spices kept my taste buds working throughout the meal. Refried beans had adequate texture to compliment the Mahi. Service was prompt and attentive to my needs. The Buckshot local draft beer helped top off the meal. I will return to this establishment to get deeper into Cabo's menu.
