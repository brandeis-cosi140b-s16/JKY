This place is awful.  I had heard good things about it before going, and thought from the name that it would be really fresh and authentic.  I couldn't be more wrong.  You get chips and salsa to start - but its not even salsa.  Its a bowl that looks like they threw a handful of canned corn in the bottom, chopped some tomatoes and onions on top and then added in some picked cactus.  It was vinegary and just bad.  I asked if they had some other salsa, and they brought me a ketchup flavored bowl of yuck.... On to the main course... I ordered the beer battered shrimp tacos, thinking the seafood tacos would be their star dish.  The tortillas were fried, the shrimp had no flavor, and it just tasted greasy and bland.  This place probably stays in business because it is one of the onyl restaurants on the block.  Save yourself the money!
