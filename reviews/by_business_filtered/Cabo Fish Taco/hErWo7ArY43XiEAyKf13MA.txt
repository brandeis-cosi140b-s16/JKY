I have no idea how this place has good reviews.  They are NOT "authentic".  They have VERY LITTLE food made in house.  If you want classic salsa (instead of corn salsa) they literally give you Pace Picante (yes, I asked b/c it was pathetically obvious).  If you order a salad be prepared to have a bowl full of roughly chopped veggies that you have to cut yourself (an entire huge tomato in quarters... Bell peppers and red onion in 1 inch think chucks).  The tuna (ordered medium) is dry as toast... Although my boyfriends tuna burrito is a perfect medium.  The margaritas are watered down and the chips are stale (and definite not home made).  The cheese dip is heavy as a brick and tastes (and looks like velveeta).  What else is there to say?
