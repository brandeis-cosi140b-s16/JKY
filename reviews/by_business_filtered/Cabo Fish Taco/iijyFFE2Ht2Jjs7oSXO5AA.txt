I went to Cabo in 2010 with my wife and it was just a bad night.  Neither of us liked it and we didn't return for two years.  That being said, I've missed out on two years where we could have enjoyed Cabo Fish Taco!  I went twice last week and both times it was fantastic!  Cheese dip was average, Guac was wonderful, BBQ Mahi and the Tavaroo tacos were phenomenal!  I'm excited to try some more new things soon!

*quick edit update:  they are using wahoo right now in replacement of the tuna due to oil apparently.   Had the Tavaroo tacos again and it is still wonderful.  Wahoo is a white fish and it was very fresh.  Still a safe order!  :)
