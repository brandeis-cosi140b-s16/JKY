I've heard great things about this place and I was dying to see what all the hype was about.  I came with some friends on a Saturday evening around 7pm, and let me just say BAD timing.  The place was packed and we had to wait almost an hour to get seated (there were 5 in our group).  There are 2 bars and we were able to grab beers and chat while we were waiting, but it was so packed there wasn't a whole lot of room for us even in the bar area.

After we were finally seated our food was served to us by a frustrated little man.  He seemed agitated and he wasn't very pleasant.  I had the signature tacos, one with beer battered white fish and the other was beer battered shrimp just to make sure I got my fill of fried goodness.  I ordered the jalapeno and cheese mashers (mashed potatoes topped with shredded cheese and chopped jalapenos from a jar) which I thought were pretty tasty.  My tacos were decent but seemed to be lacking flavor, maybe needed more sauce of some sort.  They seemed dry and I nearly choked on the lettuce and tortilla shell because it felt like eating paper.

Parking is extremely limited especially on a busy weekend night.  The prices are decent and they had a fairly good selection of beer on tap.  Overall this would be a great place to stop in for lunch but I definitely won't be back for dinner.
