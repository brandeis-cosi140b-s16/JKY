I had a fish taco craze last year and that was pretty much the only thing I ate for about a month. Still, I am not a self-proclaimed taco connoisseur and will not pretend to know everything there is to know about the dish. 

I will tell you that in my short-lived taco-eating career, Cabo Fish Taco definitely tops the list of delicious tacos I've eaten. And I've tried all kinds. Korean bulgogi tacos to Vietnamese pork belly tacos to traditional carne asada tacos. 

Seems to me that there are three main components  to the taco: 

1) the protein 
2) the case (wrap)
3) the garnish

While most of the tacos I've eaten have excelled in 1 and 3, few have been able to come up with an astounding 2 the way Cabo Fish Taco does. I would describe the "case" as a crisp soft shell. It's a light and fluffy, doughy bite with a crisp finish (literally). Reminds me of the Indian puri. Then you get this magnificent choice of beef, chicken, blackened mahi-mahi, lemon grilled shrimp...the list goes on of meat to flavor your taco up. Loved the shrimp in particular. Finally they sprinkle on an assortment of sweet, sour, tangy or creamy toppings that are powerful and enticing. Even after you inhale the taco though, you don't feel like a beached whale. You could eat these all day!

They also have some sick margaritas (see photo)

The one area that disappointed me greatly was the quality of the appetizers. Yes the guac is fresh avocado - but unseasoned and plain? The "queso" tasted nothing short of Moes Grill's mass-produced queso. They could've tried harder on the easy parts!
