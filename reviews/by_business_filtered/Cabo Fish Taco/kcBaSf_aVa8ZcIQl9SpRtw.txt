Fantastic atmosphere in a funky area.  Start at Cabo for a yummy fish taco dinner.  Whatever flavor you like, they have it!  The service is top notch!  They have a faine assortments of local brews.  I personally eat low-carb so they brought me everything without the rice.  I skip the tortillas which were homemade but looked/felt they might have been a bit tough and chewy.  Terrific dinner, head over to Growlers across the stree for a home brew and down the way to Amelies for a dessert (to go, because I am a pumpkin in the evening), and you have yourself a fine evening planned indeed!
