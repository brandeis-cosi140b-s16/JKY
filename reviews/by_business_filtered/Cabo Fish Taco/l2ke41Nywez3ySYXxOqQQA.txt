I used to be in love with Cabo Fish Taco. Over the last couple of years though, I've become disillusioned. 
It is way too loud inside, you can barely hear yourself think. I always chose patio seating instead. 
The chips are very thick, it's kind of awkward. The corn salsa is delicious though. My last visit we added the salsa verde and it was so salty we could only have a bite of it. 
The tacos are okay, they seem to have lost flavor over time. 
Out of previous positive experiences, I'm not going to write Cabo off, but it won't be my first choice.
