Was just down here on vacation, and I will be going back next time I am in Charlotte. This place is just simply amazing for food. I had some shrimp tacos that I loved. The app I had was average, and the beer selection was average as well. The waitress was just above average. If they just improve a few things, this is a 5 star place, but the food enough is reason to come back!
