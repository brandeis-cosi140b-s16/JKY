I've always been amazed this place has been around as long as it has and gets mentioned so much as a "must" place to eat...its average AT BEST, everything except for the tacos is decent to fair (and how bad can u screw up a taco?), and the service/wait staff, even after all these yrs they've been open, is spotty at best, I.E. the kind of service you'd expect in a new place, not one thats been open for yrs like this place...plus its WAY overpriced for what u get
