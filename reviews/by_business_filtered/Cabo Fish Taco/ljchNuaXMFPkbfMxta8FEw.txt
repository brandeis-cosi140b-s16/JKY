Fresh corn salsa with tortilla chips.  The tacos and burritos are all excellent, as are the desserts.  The red velvet cake is a delicious multi-tiered confection with thick frosting.  I was disappointed to find that they have stopped serving the mashed potatoes as a side but the pasta salad was a nice substitute.
