Super long wait, but worth it. You don't have to sit in front of the place. They will text you when your table is ready, so go to the bar next door and have a drink. Everything we tried there has been good. It's one of my favorite places to eat in Charlotte. The whole NoDa area is nice. Well worth eating here.
