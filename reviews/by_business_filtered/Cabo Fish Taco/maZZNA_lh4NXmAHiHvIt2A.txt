My wife and I stopped here today after hearing good things about the place.   We were disappointed.

Although the service was fast and our waitress was very nice, the food was mediocre.

Firstly, the guacamole was obviously out of a container.  We suspected that they use the exact same pre-made brand that you find in the grocery store.    They tossed some fresh chopped onions and some other stuff on top, but they weren't fooling anyone.  (By the way, the charged more than 6 bucks for the stuff.)

Secondly, the chips they served were stale and under-salted.

Thirdly, the refried beans were also out of a can.   They had the EXACT taste and texture of the Old El Paso brand refried beans that you can pick up in any grocery store for $0.99 a can.   Of course, Cabo will charge you considerably more.

Finally, we have to talk about the fish tacos.   We tried 4 varieties of their tacos, and they were all bland and uninspired.   The fish was overcooked, the sauces were just gross.

They used fried flour shells and cheddar instead of traditional corn tortillas and cojita or queso fresco (which would be the more authentic way to go with this sort of fair).  Personally I didn't mind the flour shells, but my wife thought it was blasphemy.

Lastly, a word to the chef:   Wasabi and Mustard are not the same thing.  -- The honey-wasabi sauce tasted exactly like the spicy mustard you get from a chinese restaurant (which is generally just ground mustard mixed with water).  I could be wrong- maybe the other flavors screwed up my taste buds- but that tasted just like any generic honey mustard sauce.

I don't mean to bash these guys too much.   The meal wasn't awful- it was just awful for the price.

Also, I need to knock down their rating a little bit, because they just don't deserve their current 3.5 stars on Yelp.

My wife wants you to know that you can get better food at Chipotle.
