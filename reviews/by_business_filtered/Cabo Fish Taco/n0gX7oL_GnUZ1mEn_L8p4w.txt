Hmmm... I wanted to like Cabo so much! But sadly, my sister and I's visit on Friday night fell short from the get go, but wasn't a Pompei-esque meltdown either.

I believe the sour taste started as we waited about 2-3 minutes for anyone to notice us standing at the "wait to be seated" sign, despite the place being 3/4 empty. 

When we got seated, it was obvious our poor waitress was having an off night for whatever reason, but she dropped some chips and "salsa?" with us, and took our orders in a decent time frame so all was well with me. Now the "salsa" is DUMB. Lacking in flavor, tomatoes and spice, this is basically a cup of corn with a few diced tomatoes and some parsley on top. At least that's what it tasted like. Seriously, bring me some damn salsa, none of this corny junk. Turns out though, if you want some salsa, cough up $3.95 and expect it to be green. :'( Not cool, IMO!

I got the BBQ Mahi Mahi tacos and it was moist and a good portion, but the white sauce everyone is commenting left me asking "where is it?". I mean, it was definitely on there but I couldn't taste a thing. Sad day. My sister chose the steak wrap and she didn't say a word from first bite to last and that says it all! :D

As sides, she got black beans and rice which she didn't eat much of, and I tried the jalepeno mashers which are basically chunky mashed potatoes with diced jalepenos and unmelted cheese on top. Weak attempt at a side, guys. Get with it.

For $20, it was ok but I won't be rushing back soon.
