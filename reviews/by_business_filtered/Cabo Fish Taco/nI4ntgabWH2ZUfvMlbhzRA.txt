Thanks to other yelp reviews,we knew to arrive early to score a seat at the bar (5:45 sat nt)   and we did! And not moments later the place was packed,like 1 hr 45 min  wait  packed.       Since we scored such golden seats we took our time ordering.  Red stripe for my friend,dos equis draft for me and queso dip to share.  I could have licked the bowl of queso clean it was so good. The free corn salsa was good too. Mild like alot of reviewers mentioned but its fresh made and FREE!  
She ordered the tuna burrito and I got the tuvaroo(incorrect spelling) with jalapeno mash -  both were excellent. Prices are just right too. The honey wasabi was different and delightful :)  
 the bathroom(right behind our seats) was nicer than expected and matched the nice decor of the restaurant. 
Oh and the host at the door was sooo nice,he made us feel right at home when we walked in.  reminded me of one of my fav  new orleans restaurants, Cabo fish taco is a gem!
