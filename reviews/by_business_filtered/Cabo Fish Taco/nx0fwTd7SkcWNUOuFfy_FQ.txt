There are a couple things that usually deter me from eating at Cabo Fish Taco when I head to NoDa for dinner. 1. There are often tons of people waiting outside for a table and I usually don't want to join them in waiting. 2. I don't really like any seafood, so the idea of a fish taco doesn't appeal to me. 

Still, Cabo is a really cute restaurant and I want to support local spots in NoDa. I've tried the chicken tacos, which are all right. I need to go back and try some more non-seafood options like the chicken or veggie wraps.
