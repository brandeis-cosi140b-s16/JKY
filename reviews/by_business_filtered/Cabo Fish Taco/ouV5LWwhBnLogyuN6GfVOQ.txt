Let me say first of all  that I'm writing this review with a heavy heart, but I feel the need to be honest.  I have eaten at Cabo Fish Taco a few times before and I have usually really enjoyed the Baja fish tacos and margaritas.  This time, however, was not the same.  The corn salsa was bland and room temperature. The Baja fish tacos were just not good...that's all I can say.  The typically long, crunchy strips of cabbage were replaced with mealy mush that I guess was supposed to pass for some kind of coleslaw and the usually large buttery avocado chunks on top gave way to a sad little spoonful of browning guac at the bottom.  The fish was super fishy and not in a good way.  I always get the nopalitos salad because I'm obsessed with pickled cactus, but this time I found one slice of cactus amongst an entire bowl of bland black beans and chickpeas.  My boyfriend's Rasta Pasta came without shrimp because they were out (wtf??? no shrimp in a seafood restaurant??) and the sauce/chicken had way too much jerk seasoning that overwhelmed the other flavors like peppers and pineapple.  Our waitress was crazy busy and overlooked our empty drinks more than once, then let us sit for 15 minutes while she attempted to settle our tab.  The margaritas, I will say, were strong and tasty...just like I like 'em.  All in all, I was exceedingly underwhelmed and disappointed that the food has gone so far downhill.  Perhaps the biggest kicker of them all....it was my birthday.  Booooooooo.
