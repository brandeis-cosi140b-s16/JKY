I love fish tacos, and after reading all the blah yelp reviews, I was worried about this place. Turns out--nothing to worry about. This place is great! One thing I did take from the reviews was to stay away from CFT's standard fried fish taco. Instead, I went for the grilled mahi mahi taco, which was very good.  Also tasty was the Mexican slaw with pumpkin seeds that our friendly waitress recommended. 

A big thumbs up for the decor, too. CFT is located in an old renovated building with brick walls and old wooden floors that is festively lit and full of warm bright colors. I really thought the design elements of the space added to the experience. 

Sure, it is not exactly Ocean Beach San Diego, but it is pretty darn close and a really fun atmosphere with great service. It is definitely worth a visit.
