My favorite restaurant in Charlotte! The epic tuna burrito has truly changed my life. I take every person that visits from out of town here to try it. They have a lovely patio that they can close when its cold. The Bloody Marys are some of the best I have ever had. They change up the taco specials daily and the taco shells are amazing! I love that you can choose a specialty taco and substitute any meat, for example if it comes with tofu and you want chicken they will do that for you. I could ramble for days about how much I love this place and I wish I could give them more than 5 stars!
