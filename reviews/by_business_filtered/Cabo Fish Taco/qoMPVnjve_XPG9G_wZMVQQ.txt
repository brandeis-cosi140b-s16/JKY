This was the second time in a row that I was sadly disappointed in Cabo Fish Taco. First, I had the Mahi 
taco and it is was so fishy to the point I couldn't eat it. I wanted to try Cabo again, as I thought it could have been a one time event type situation. Last night I got tuna tacos and again it was so fishy I couldn't even eat it. This tells me the fish Cabo gets is old... 
I will never return and will not recommend to anyone.
