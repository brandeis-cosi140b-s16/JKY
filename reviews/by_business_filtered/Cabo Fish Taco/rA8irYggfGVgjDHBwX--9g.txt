Have been here 3 times and the food never disappoints.  I had the shrimp fajitas and will get fajitas from this day forward....SOOOOO GOOD! I would suggest a new salsa for the chips they start you off with...it's like a corn relish with no flavor. And the sweet tea wasn't very sweet. Every place has an off night especially as packed as it was. I would still come back, definitely! It's a great "hang out with your friends" kind of place.
