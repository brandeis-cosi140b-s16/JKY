Having moved to Ohio, I can only say that I REALLY MISS CABO FISH TACO. We made a trip back to visit Charlotte and this was the first place we visited. 

PS. You can make the honey wasabi sauce at home- 1 part honey, 1 part wasabi paste. It really is that easy and has made the lack of Cabo a bit more bearable.
