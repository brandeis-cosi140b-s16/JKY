Corn salsa is OK, some people love it though. 

I got the special, teriyaki salmon tacos, and they were awesome. Best fish tacos I ever had.  They came with a wasabi sauce that was rather mild in flavor but satisfying.  The other fish tacos are pretty good.


Great atmosphere!  I will be back.  They always have decent drink specials too.
