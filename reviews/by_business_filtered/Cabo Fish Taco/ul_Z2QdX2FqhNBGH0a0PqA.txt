Just had lunch today at Cabo FIsh Taco.  I had the wasabi tuna wrap.  There is only one word to describe the dish:  WOW!  It had to have been one of the of the best fish dishes I have ever eaten.  The portion was huge- I had to take half of it home along with most of the rice and beans. The service and ambience were awesome.

So why only four stars and not five stars?  I had a microbrew.  A pint cost $6.50- or over half the cost of the main dish.  While it was good, I will stick with Diet Coke next time.  But rest assured, I will return!
