Visiting from out of town and decided to check out NoDa. Very happy that I chose Cabo Fish Taco. I sat at the bar to have a few drinks and ordered some food. I had the BBQ Mahi Tacos with a side of pasta salad. The tacos were excellent, not too much bbq so you could still taste the mahi. Pasta salad was also amazing; might be too spicy for some, but unlike anything I've had before. Overall the food and service was excellent and I will be back.
