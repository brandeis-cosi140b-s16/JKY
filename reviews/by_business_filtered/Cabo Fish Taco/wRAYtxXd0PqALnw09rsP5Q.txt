THE BEST FISH TACOS I'VE EVER HAD! 

So last Saturday I tried this place for the first time after hearing all these great things about it from friends, and it definitely lived up to my expectations. IT WAS ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!! 

I've had the lemon grilled tuna and grilled salmon tacos, they were both great, but the salmon one was to die for! The cilantro white sauce really perfects the dish! You also get a side with the order as well; I chose fruit cup to be a little on the healthy side. I thought 2 tacos wasn't going to be enough for me because I have such a big appetite, but it was very filling. Good portion size! 

This is definitely a place to check out. I want to go there again very very soon!
