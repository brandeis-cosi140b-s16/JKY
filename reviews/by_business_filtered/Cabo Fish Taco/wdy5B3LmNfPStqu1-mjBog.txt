Two and a half stars, Ok but not so great.

Another Sunday fighting the crowds at Ikea - I recently bought two complete kitchens from them what a Pita!! - from there to the nearest home depot. I'm rarely at that end of town so I ask the young man behind the counter what's a good place for brunch in NODA and he says .... Cabo Fish taco.  Great idea! 

We get there about 2:30, the place is busy but not unmanageable. Mexico and Marley theme joint, my partner asked if it was a part of a chain. Told her, no but it wants to be. We get a table immediately, the waitress is very friendly and attentive, although the bar was slow getting the drinks out. 

- Salsa and chips. Boooring, the corn heavy but too light on onions and spice mixture is no salsa and chips are cardboardy - I'd be surprised if they're not packaged. 

-The skinny Margarita got two thumbs down but I was cozy with my Negra modelo. 

- Mahi taco .. with tangy bbq sauce? The sauce was tasty but out of place, it overpowered the whole dish. Mahi, which in Fla we usually call dolphin is a strong tasting fish that can even be served blackened and it's flavor will still come through. Here it was so bland it could have been a chicken. It wasn't bad but the mahi taco tasted like bbq chicken taco so I'd call that a fail. My companion said she would have liked it if it hadn't been for the sauce , not me.

- Honey wasabi Tuna wrap, hu menu says burrito. Exact same result, wasabi/honey is the only flavor that came through and the wasabi tasted more like sharp yellow mustard than like wasabi.  And I'm a wasabi eater, at home I even use it on cold chicken or cold roast beef.  Tuna, unlike mahi is easy to overpower but still that was another honey/mustard chicken wrap not a fish burrito.

The refried beans and the mashed potatoes with jalapenos were the best thing of the whole meal. Price was reasonable. Would I go back? No, it wasn't bad but the food was Charlotte-grade boring.
