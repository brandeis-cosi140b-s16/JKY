This is one of my go to restaurants in charlotte. When people come into town to visit this is usually one of the first places I recommend due to its uniqueness and killer food. This is far from a chain which is exactly what I look for in a restaurant. 

As you'd expect from the name, their fish tacos are nothing short of incredible. I've had nearly all of the tacos on the menu including many of their specials. My favorites continue to be the Tavaroo Wahoo and the lemon grilled shrimp. You really can't go wrong though. 

A solid choice for anyone looking for something out if the ordinary.
