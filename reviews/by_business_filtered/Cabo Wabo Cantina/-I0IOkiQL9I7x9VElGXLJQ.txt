We sat right away for a party of 3. The server was attentive considering we went on Spring Break and the place was packed for breakfast. The have great patio seating so you can people watch. Can't mess eggs and toast up too much. Also had the chicken chiliquiles over fried tortillas with an over easy egg on top with melted cheese with a mild.sauce. That was good.
