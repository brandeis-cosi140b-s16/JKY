Went on Saturday afternoon.  Sat on the outdoor patio with a fab view of the Bellagio fountain.  The Waboritas are fantastic.  Had chips and guac.  Decent size, but like everything in Vegas the price is a little steep.  Sammy Hagar showed up, worked through the crowd...totally cool.  They gave away a free shot.  Didn't need it after two Waboritas.  Would go back again on my next trip.
