LOVE this place. Decent service, AMAZING drinks, and great location. Can view bellagio fountain show while on patio, and the food is AMAZING. the Sopas con Carne is the best food i've ever eaten. Their fajitas are pretty amazing as well, and their abondigas soup is perfection. Don't forget to try the dreamsicle! it's amazing
