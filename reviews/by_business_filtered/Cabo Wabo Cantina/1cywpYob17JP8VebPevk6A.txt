As far as people watching on the Strip is concerned, Cabo Wabo fits the bill perfectly. It's right out front of Planet Hollywood and across from the Cosmopolitan. 
My sister and I visited for lunch on a beautiful Vegas day. We really could have sat out all afternoon in the sunshine checking out the crazies walking by, with our margaritas and mojito's. 
Food is not amazing and service was slow on this particular day but we were in no hurry so it didn't really matter. It did take a while just to have our drinks arrive. They were worth the wait in the end!
