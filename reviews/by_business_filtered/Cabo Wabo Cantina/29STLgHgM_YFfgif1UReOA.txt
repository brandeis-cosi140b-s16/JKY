Surprisingly good food. It is fun to sit outside and especially nice to hear great music on the patio and be able to see the fountains at Bellagio and people watch.  Loved the music and comedic talent of Shawn Eiferman.  Have followed this guy for a few years now and he is great and often has mega talented people playing with him too.  He is what living in Vegas is all about. Music and good food any night of the week.  His music is worth the trip to the strip!!
