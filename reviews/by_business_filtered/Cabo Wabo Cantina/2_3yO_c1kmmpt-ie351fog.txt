We stopped in here on our last trip to Vegas. We wanted to grab a few last cocktails on The Strip before catching our flight home. 
We went to the bar; the counter seats were full, but not one of the 30+ tables had a guest seated. We let the hostess know we'd like a table since the bar was full. She asked us if we would be having lunch there as well; we just ate and were not interested in dining, we just wanted drinks. Both of the hostesses that were there informed us that they could not seat us at a table if we only wanted drinks. I MIGHT understand this if there was a high demand for tables, but keep inmind that NO ONE was seated at the tables. They couldn't spare one table and serve us drinks?!?!
We asked "you're really going to turn down paying customers because we don't want food?!".....her response "it's our policy; we can't seat you if you're not ordering food too."

We went a few doors down to La Salsa Cantina, and had a couple of delicious margaritas & food was not mandatory. 

Why in the world would you turn down a paying customer?
