I was really expecting more for being in a pretty decent location in Las Vegas.  The food was really sub par - I had three styles of the soft shell tacos and two were very dry.  Also when I ordered a "bottle" of Miller Lite from the menu it came in a can... I know its only Miller Lite but if I order it in a bottle I expect a bottle...

The service on the other hand was very good, attentive and on top of things.  There was no "push" to turn the table and get another tip which was nice in that type of setting.  Unfortunately the food was not very good and with so many other choices in the area I don't know if I would venture in to give another meal a shot.
