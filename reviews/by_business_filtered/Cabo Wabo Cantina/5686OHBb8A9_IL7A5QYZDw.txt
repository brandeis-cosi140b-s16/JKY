This place gets a two because it is insanely overpriced, and the portions are small. The food tastes fine, but not great.. Cabo Wabo  has a nice patio on the Vegas strip, but I could eat better somewhere else for the same price or cheaper. I will say, they do have decent margaritas. 

Oh and avoid the nacho appetizer. It's literally one dozen nachos for WAYYYY too much.
