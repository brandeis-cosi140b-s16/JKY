Most of the reviews for Cabo Wabo pretty much say it all.

-yes, the food is a little pricey for what you are getting....But come on people you are in Vegas and nothing is cheap in Vegas.

-Yes the drinks are served in plastic cups, but who cares it still does the job required so no complaints here.

-Yes the view is pretty as it over looks the strip.

-No the service does not sucks....at least for me it did not. Our waiter was very attentive and nice and offered us great deals and coupons. 

-The food.....Yes it is bland and kind of overpriced for not so great Mexican food ....but again, you are in Vegas. I had ordered some kind of salad. I think it was a chicken tortilla type salad. It was super greasy and upset my stomach. The chips and salsa dip was ssooooo good. I wish I can have some right now. My tequila shots were great and did the job....I only wish I did not have beer right after since I got wasted....

-Another plus was that we were seated right away......I was kind of between 2 and 3 stars since my meal was not so great, but the service and drinks pretty much gave it a 3...
