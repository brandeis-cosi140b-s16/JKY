The place was dead at 11pm last night so we assumed this is a daytime place?

The waitress was attentive but we had to track her down at the end to get our bill.

The nachos with chicken were good with a delicious Queso sauce. (about $14)

We also got the Taquitos which were okay. 

The weekly special was a $7.50 Fireball shot but I got the Key Lime Pie martini was too milky, strong, and sweet.

Overall, this is a good place to get a quick bite and drink if there is no wait.
