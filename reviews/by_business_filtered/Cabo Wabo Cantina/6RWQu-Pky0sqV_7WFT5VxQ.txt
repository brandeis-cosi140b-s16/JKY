This was a fun environment. The food tasted good, just a little pricey. My husband had a quesadilla that was coated in a Parmesan cheese that was great! I had the appetizer chicken taquitos that made for a nice small meal. You did have to pay for chips and salsa which I'm not used to. Our waitress was friendly as well.
