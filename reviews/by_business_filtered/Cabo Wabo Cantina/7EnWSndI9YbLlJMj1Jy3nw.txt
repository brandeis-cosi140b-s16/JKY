The food was not that good; I ordered the Chicken Fajitas and chicken was dry, re-fried beans were yuk (canned re-fried beans would have been tastier). Service was okay but our drinks went dry twice before anyone came over to refill. 

Great atmosphere if you have an opportunity to sit out on the patio overlooking the strip. Order the Chips & Salsa and a drink and that would be the best experience of this place.
