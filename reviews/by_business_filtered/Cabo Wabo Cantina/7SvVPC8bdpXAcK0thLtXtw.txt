Cabo Wabo is pretty average as far as mexican food goes. Don't come here expecting to be blown away bu the food. The atmosphere helps a lot with your experience.  They play current pop music but then could have a band one night and then a solo artist the next. The patio area is open and has a pretty good view of the Bellagio and Cosmopolitan.  

I was there with a small group of 5 and we only had to wait about 15 minutes on a Saturday night. Not bad. There is no complimentary chips and salsa but we ordered some anyway along with guacamole. The chips were above average and I would buy a bag if they sold them. The salsa wasn't bad either. Once everyone at the table realized the guacamole I ordered was $9, they stopped and let me eat it. I also ordered a bloody mary. One thing I have found recently is that mexican joints have some of the best bloody marys. This proved to be true once again.

I had the chicken sabana which was like nothing I've ever experienced at a mexican restaurant. My wife had the carnitas tacos which she could not finish. Not because they give you a lot but there was a strange taste that did not agree with her. I tried a piece and was glad I ordered what I did. 

With that said, if I'm in the area and looking for a cool atmosphere with decently priced food, I would try them again.
