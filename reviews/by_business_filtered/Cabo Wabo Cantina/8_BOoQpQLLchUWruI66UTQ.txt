Husband and I went for our anniversary weekend and stopped here for lunch. Jordan our waitress was super friendly, had time to answer my questions (first timers at this location), and didn't seem rushed as she went from table to table making sure all clients were taken care of.

I ordered the fajitas and they were amazing.  The chipotle rub on them was different in a good way and the place was packed as it was the NFL playoffs. 

I also ordered a margarita that was very strong! No weak ones here! So there is an outdoor seating area that usually has a waiting list, but the inside is comfortable as well.  Feels like spring break at this restaurant/bar.

Have fun!
