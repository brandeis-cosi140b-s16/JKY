For a chain, I thought this was actually pretty good.  Decent amount of food for what you pay for.  We had a couple of the special Caborita's - really tasty on a hot day - and we didn't get suckered into paying for some cheap ass souvenir glass with this one (unlike another spot on the strip recently reviewed by me).  We tried the Nacho's with the Carne Asada - HUGE order of Nachos, but we were starving and eat every bite - hold the jalape√±os for me, but everything else on that plate was really great.  For lunch, I had the Carne Asada taco plate - with rice and beans - after the gigantic nachos, I could only eat the tacos and did a tasting of the rice and beans - everything was really good and some points for a nice presentation.  No waiting, service was quick and our waiter was always one step ahead of us with water refills and checking on us during a busy Memorial Day weekend visit.  I'd go here again and try more things on the menu.  Cool Millenials with those fake cigarettes that only blow vapor where everywhere - so you know it must be hip! LOL
