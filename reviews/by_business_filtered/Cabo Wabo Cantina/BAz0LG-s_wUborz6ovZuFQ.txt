Stopped for breakfast. Had a Denver omelet with crispy potatoes. The toast was dry and lacking butter; asked server to bring some to the table. Salt shaker pours too freely, and you have to shake the hell out of the pepper to get anything. Server (Garland) was attentive and the food was good. Checking in on yelp gets you a free house margarita.
