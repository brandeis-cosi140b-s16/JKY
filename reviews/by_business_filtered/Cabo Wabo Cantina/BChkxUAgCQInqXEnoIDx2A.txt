I came into into Cabo with my fianc√© and friends. Our server was Yesenia. She was on point with everything, went above and beyond for all of us. From appetizers, to meal, and drinks. She was very attentive and friendly, made us all feel very welcomed and important. The margaritas were very tasty and Sammy  tequila shrimp amazing.
