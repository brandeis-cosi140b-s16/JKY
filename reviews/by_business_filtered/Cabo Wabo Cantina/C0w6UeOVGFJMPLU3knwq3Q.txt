Location is awesome, great view & great people watching on the strip.  But that's where the positive ends.  Don't go here for the food.  Even after not eating all day and being drunk and starving, the food was still horrible - bland, dry, just overall bad (got the chicken burrito per the waitress's recommendation).  

I would only go back for drinks on the patio... take your money elsewhere if you actually want to eat good food.
