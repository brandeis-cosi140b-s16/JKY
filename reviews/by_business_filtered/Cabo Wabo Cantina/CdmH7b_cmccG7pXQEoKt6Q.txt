Not a terrible place, but not a great place either. I came here with my sister who came a year before and said "don't expect much from the food but they have strong margaritas" Well I hate margaritas but i ordered one anyway because, well, I'm in Vegas. 

The rita was ok, i don't remember the food but it was a nice place, just not my kind of people, we did go back but only because we were staying there and we saw a concert there. the patio was the best part of this place because you can sit over the strip and people watch.
