Horrible Horrible place. The service is ridiculous! The host was the extremely rude and made it seem as we were bothering her with our presence.  It seemed as if they didnt want you to come in so she can text on her phone and chat amoungst themselves.  For the great service is Las Vegas im sure this place can do better then need to re hire a whole new staff and start fresh.  Even the security guard was disrespectful! When I tried to walk by him to squeeze through he wouldent move and inch after asking.  Overall this place stinks and you can choose a way better place. DONT GO TO CABO WABO!!!!
