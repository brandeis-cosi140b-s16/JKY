Had I written a review several years ago - this would be 5 stars.  This place, however, just did not measure up this trip like it has in the past.  We had terrible service that was beyond slow.  Their current happy hour also includes only beer and fireball concoctions.  No happy hour margaritas???  And the beers were expensive, so while it was buy one get one - you were paying twice as much as you would in some other bars on the strip.  I'd only visit again with a coupon from the people advertising on the street.  So many other great places, don't waste your time until this place gets its act back together!
