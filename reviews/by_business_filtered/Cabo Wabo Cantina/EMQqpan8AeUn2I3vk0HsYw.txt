This review is for the margaritas only. We were wandering around the Miracle Mile shops and decided to get ourselves a yard long drink. YUM. $20 for 42oz of goodness. =) The server there (i'm sorry I forgot your name) was sweet, and friendly. She also let us try every drink before we made our decision, AND she color coordinated the straws to match the drink. (nice touch).

We got the Dreamsicle and the Vida Loca (taste like blue otter pop). Both were delicious. Creepers too. You don't taste any alcohol for a little while, then you feel a little flushed. Great combo! And great drink to have while you're strolling the strip.
