The food was pretty tasty and the atmosphere was fun. We were in early Sunday and they had a great entertainer playing guitar and singing, it was very enjoyable. We had a couple of margaritas, a couple of shots, a salad and Sammy's Shrimp (Which was fantastic by the way) and our waiter was great. The whole experience sounds great right?

Well it was until I got the bill. 160 pre-tip. The lesson we learned was not to let someone else pick our tequila shots for us lest we pay 14 dollars per shot.

Par for the course in Vegas I guess. Still, I would go back looking for Mexicanesque food, just that I might fill up on chips and beer buckets.
