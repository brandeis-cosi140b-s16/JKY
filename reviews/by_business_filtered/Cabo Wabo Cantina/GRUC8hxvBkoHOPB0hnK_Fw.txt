Came here the day we were leaving Vegas! I loved the food especially the fish tacos ! We got free margaritas because of our yelp check in. Two things I didn't like . We walked in through the inside of the mall and there were like 4 hostess standing at the entrance talking and didn't acknowledge my 4 friends and I  so we walked in then one girl followed us and asked if we needed help . My friend said yeah we'll do we wait for you or do we sit ourselves ? She said no you have to wait for is and laughed . So we just went to the outside entrance.When we got there it was half and hour before lunch so we decided to grab drinks meanwhile I asked one of the 4 outside hostess if they had micheladas. She literally stood there is a "uhh idk what that is" and a smirk . I mean???? Common!! By then I had seen it under the menu and told her. What do you mean? It's on your menu!! Cabo wabo please hire people who know the menu. Our waiter tho was amazing! He brought us chips and was very attentive !
