The 2 stars is based on the service specifically, nothing to do with the quality of the food. The food itself was delicious. I went last night with a girl friend and our server was Homero. He was nice but really pushy. I'm currently over 9 months pregnant and it's pretty visible... My friend and I ordered waters and she got a soda, but the server went on and on about the margaritas for what seemed like a few minutes when we had already established that neither of us was going to be drinking. It was pretty busy but it took quite a while for us to get our water. 

My friend ordered the tortilla soup and when they brought it out there was no spoon, so she politely asked for one. The food runner who brought out the soup and our server kept asking, "Are you sure it's not on the side of your bowl?" and frantically looking all over our table as if they've recently had a mass amount of spoon thieves? Weird. 

The price of the food was as expected for being on the Las Vegas Strip. But $9 for some guacamole? Beat it! I should have brought my own avocados.

When the check came, Homero had no shame in handing it to us while very bluntly POINTING to the tip section and said, "Here you go, ladies. And so you know, any tip is appreciated." At that point, it was tempting to not even leave a tip. That was pretty rude.
