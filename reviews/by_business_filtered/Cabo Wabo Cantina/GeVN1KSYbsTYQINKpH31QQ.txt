This place is awful... 
Lucky for the owner that it is on Las Vegas Blvd and looks happening and good... because otherwise they would have no customers. The food is overpriced, not good at all and the service is even worse (rude!!!!!!!).  I unfortunately ate here twice and my experience only got worse from the first time. Would never come here again! Save your money and eat at Taco Bell instead!
