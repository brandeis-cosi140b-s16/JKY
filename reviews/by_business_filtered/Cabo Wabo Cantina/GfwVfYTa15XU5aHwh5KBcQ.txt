Decided to try some nachos at Cabo Wabo Cantina and maybe spot Sammy singing I can't drive 55, but no such luck, he wasn't anywhere to be seen.  The basic nachos were a bit on the expensive side $15.95 and we added pork to bump it up to $17.95.  I thought the nachos were tasty with plenty of jalape√±os, cheese and cheese sauce, guacamole, sour cream, refried beans and plenty of carnitas.   A nice little touch when u check in and order an entree, you get a free house margarita with what else but Cabo Wabo tequila.   We had a fantastic waitress, Deanna, who took good care of us.
