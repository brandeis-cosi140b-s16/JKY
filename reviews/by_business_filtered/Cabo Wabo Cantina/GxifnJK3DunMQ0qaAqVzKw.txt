When you spend the money to go to Vegas you have expectations. You expect for the most part that you going to have a good time. Your going to get some good service and that your going to eat some good food.. Its Vegas Right? Wrong!!!!!! Cabo Wabo is a Mexican Cantina right on the strip next to the Planet Hollywood. I went in there to grab some dinner and have few beers on my way to do a little gambling.. The place overlooks the strip so I thought it would be fun to sit outside and watch the action from the overlook. The bar was only about 60% full so I felt lucky to have beat the dinner rush. What Rush? you ask.. Exactly.... there was no rushing anywhere. The waiter took 20 minutes to acknowledge me. When he finally did I ordered a beer and the Cadillac nachos.. I sat there for another 10 minutes before the guy brought back the beer. He apologized for the wait and said he was just busy, but the truth is the whole bar was not busy and I watched him talking to other people doing whatever... and it was him that was not busy at all.. That by itself would not be enough to piss me off, but I waited another 25 minutes for the nachos and when they arrived they were the most pathetic greasy and poorly executed terribleness I have ever seen.. They were some kind of stuffed tortilla concoction with a dollop of sour cream and some guacamole. A real disappointing dish.. To make it worse I was out of beer. I tried a couple of the nachos but they were so shitty I just decided to cut my losses and leave. I paid the bill, $21.62 by the way for shit nachos and a beer and left.. If it was not bad enough that the food sucked and the service sucked. I had to endure an hour and a half of Sammy Hagar music.. For a Vegas strip venue this place does NOT Rock in any way shape or form. Cabo Wabo is a just skip it and go on to Hard Rock Cafe for me..
