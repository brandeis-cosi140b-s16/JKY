Horrible service! We bought two appetizers and one margarita (all of which were very subpar) and left $60 in cash on the table. After leaving we were chased down, and my husband confused about what was going on went back and paid again. When he caught up with me in the casino and realized I had definitely left cash we went back to speak with a manager. The manager was rude and allowed our waitress to yell at us and falsely accuse us of not paying. He told us they were checking to see if they could find the cash - but after 20 minutes of waiting we finally left. I am EXTREMELY upset and will never eat here again. I will also tell everyone I know and anyone who will listen to stay away from Cabo Wabo. So unprofessional!
