NOT REAL MEXICAN FOOD! I wouldve to say that their food here is not real authentic, their services here is horrible! Took me 20 mins just to get the bartenders attention to order my food to go and to top it off it wasnt even busy! Being a restaurant on the strip and in the miracle mile I would really think their service would be top notch.
