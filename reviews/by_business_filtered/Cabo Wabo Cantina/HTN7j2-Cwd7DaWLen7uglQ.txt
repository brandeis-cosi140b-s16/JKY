I was there Sat for lunch. The food was NO bueno!  my friend had a Bloody Mary, she said it wasnt that good.

I had an enchilada and a taco de carnitas........I might as well have just gone to Taco Bell and saved the money. 

The service was not the best either........... I had to ask one chick/hostess who clearly heard me the first time ....... where the restroom was at.

I would never go back to this place.

Yes, the outside seating patio is nice but thats about it for this place.
