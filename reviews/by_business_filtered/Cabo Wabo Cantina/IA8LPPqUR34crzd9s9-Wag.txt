Although the margaritas were tasty, they were pretty expensive!! And honestly I had a hard time finishing my grilled fish tacos, they just weren't  that great, my dad had the lobster enchilada and that was ok, I also tasted the Cadillac nachos, all in all nothing special. Good location mediocre food over priced drinks. Nothing surprising here
