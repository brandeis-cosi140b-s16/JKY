My boyfriend and I decided to stop by while in Vegas, and although he wasn't too crazy about the place, I absolutely loved their tacos. Not to mention their bread pudding is the BEST! I must admit the service was a bit slow, it was very crowded and they didn't have enough people. But oooh well, the food def. made-up for it! Will def. be stopping by again the next time I'm in town.
