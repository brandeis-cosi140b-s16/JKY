Went here with a few friends from work and was expecting the typical chain type Tex Mex and was pleasantly surprised with the food quality. I had 3 soft chicken tacos with the rice and beans and they were really good. My 3 friends all enjoyed their meals as well, so chalk one up for Cab Wabo. Service was decent, we went for a late afternoon lunch and it wasn't crowded so we were waited on in a timely manner. Waitress was attentive but not overly friendly which is fine. As with all food on the strip, there isn't anything inexpensive anymore, this place is no exception. But overall I'd say give it a try!
