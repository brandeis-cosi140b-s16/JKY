If you want to experience the Vegas strip this is your place. Sit outside facing the street and be entertained for hours. Check in and get the free margarita but don't expect anything fancy. Chips were too thick for my taste and the burrito bowl was fair but it was enjoyable to sit outside. Loud music and a good location. Jessica, my waitress was very attentive and helpful and I would probably come back for the atmosphere but not the mediocre Mexican food.
