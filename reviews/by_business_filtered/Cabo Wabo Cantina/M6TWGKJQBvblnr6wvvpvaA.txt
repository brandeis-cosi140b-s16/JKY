This was a nice little pit stop for us on our way down the strip. We knew we had dinner reservations in an hour, but we were starving and stopped in for a drink and some chips and salsa. Yes, that's all we wanted...but let me tell you, the salsa was freaking delightful. The waiter was pretty nice, especially considering we were only ordering chips and salsa for food! They have great drinks, prices are decent, (I mean you are in Vegas), and again the service was pretty good too. We would for sure stop in again :)
