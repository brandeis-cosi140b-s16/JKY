I loved this place! They have super fun frozen drinks and there wasn't much of a wait at all if you are willing to sit inside.

I had the Ahi tuna burrito, it was absolutely delicious. I was with four friends and they all really loved their food too. One got shrimp fajitas and it came with a ton of shrimp!! 

The only reason I am only giving them three stars is because our waiter was AWFUL. He wasn't friendly at all and made us feel like we were inconveniencing him when we asked for anything. 

I get that most of the people that go in are tourists so they don't need to be friendly to ensure repeat business but a little smile goes a long way.

Overall, the food and margaritas are totally worth putting up with the crappy service.
