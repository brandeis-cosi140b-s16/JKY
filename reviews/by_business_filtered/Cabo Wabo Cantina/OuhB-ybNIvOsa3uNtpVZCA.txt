WORST EXPERIENCE I HAVE EVER HAD!!!

What an AWFUL place!  The service was TERRIBLE, the food was way overpriced, and the experience was just average.  There are so many places better than this in Vegas that this should be your LAST choice.

To start, it took the waiter about 45 minutes to come over to our table, and that was after we had gone up to the host and asked for service after the first 20 minutes.  We ordered drinks and food at the same time, and we never saw him again until we tracked him down and demanded the check. 
   On top of all that, he got the orders terribly wrong, forcing us to send a dish back and wait another 15 minutes for it to be remade with the correct meat (I was given Carnitas and I am Jewish and don't eat pork).

The final insult was when I received my credit card bill and saw that I had been charged three times what my meal cost.  When I disputed the claim, the receipt I was sent had food on it that I did not order, and DID NOT HAVE MY SIGNATURE ON IT!!  IT WAS NOT MY BILL!!!  The waiter had given someone else a bill with my credit card number on it!!  They REFUSED to refund my money, even though I offered to pay for the food that I HAD ordered.


NEVER GO TO THIS RESTAURANT!!
