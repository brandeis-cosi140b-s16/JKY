First timing dining at a Cabo Wabo, and will definitely visit again!! Our service was polite and frequent, Brian was very responsive to our needs which is always good in a large group including a baby. The food was delicious and came out not long after we ordered which is awesome because they were starting to get busy and had a band playing.. Summer the Manager was also polite and attentive. Definitely recommend to anyone looking for good food, good drinks, and excellent service!!
