This place gets a bad rap. You have to take it for what it is. A Mexican food chain. It's not going to be authentic. It's going to be average. Get a drink, it'll taste better. Our food was good. My husband and I got the fajitas for two. Enough to fill both of us up. 

Server was hardly seen and it took 10 minutes just to get drinks, and that was from another server who saw that we had been waiting for another while. 

Also, they leave the doors open to outside. There was a serious breeze coming through which made it pretty cold. I would have much preferred to sit outside with a heater than inside with the cold! 

Also, if your bill comes to $24.11 and you give them $25 they will automatically keep the change. Our bill came to $6.11 after our groupon and gave $10. We only got the bills back. Not cool.
