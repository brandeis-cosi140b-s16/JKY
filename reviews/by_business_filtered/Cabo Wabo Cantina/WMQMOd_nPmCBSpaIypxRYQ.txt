The inside of the place looked like a glorified Taco Bell, I was really disappointed with the layout and feel of the place since it is a celeb owned restaurant. The nachos were terrible and made my husband sick, but I got the Carne asada tacos and they were really good and I was fine later. We also had tons of food we wouldn't normally eat and drank a lot more than usual. (I think it finally caught up with him and made his stomach hurt) I ordered guacamole and chips as a side and it was SO good. I wasn't able to eat even half  of it, but I wish we had one close by just so I could get the guacamole.
