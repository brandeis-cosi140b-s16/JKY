My husband and I visit Vegas often. This is our go to place for happy hour/reasonably priced Mexican food. You have the option to sit indoors or outdoors. We always sit outdoors which allows you to do some people watching and look around the heart of the strip. 

We order the Chicken Fajitas which are pretty delicious. We also checked in to get a free Margarita. 

What I don't like is that they now charge for chips and salsa which they never did before.  It also does take a long time for the waiters to attend to you.
