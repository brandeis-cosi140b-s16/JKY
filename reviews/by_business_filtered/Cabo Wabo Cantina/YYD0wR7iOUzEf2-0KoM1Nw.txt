We stopped by on a Saturday night and to my surprise got seated right away. We sat on the patio which is dead center in the chaos of the strip but still a very good atmosphere. There was live music that night which was nice. I used the free drink coupon offered on yelp which saved me $10, I got the tortilla soup and my boyfriend got the fajitas which were very good. Overall it was a good experience and not overly priced which was a plus.
