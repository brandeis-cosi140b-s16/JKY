I LOVED this place! the atmosphere was great. Over looking the strip and people watching. Before we were served I asked the waitress about the free Marg when you Check In and she said she would honor it even though the coupon to pop up on my phone. She suggested fish tacos and they were amazing! My boyfriend got a wet carne asada/chicken burrito that was good as well. I think out of the two days that I was in Vegas I got my biggest buzz there lol off of two margaritas! I will def be back my next visit!
