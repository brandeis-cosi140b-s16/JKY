Went here twice on our three day stay. Margaritas were good but I think they made me sick :( Food was awesome! Ordered the breakfast burrito with chorizo the first day and the breakfast nachos the second day. Our female server was awesome the first day and our second day male server sucked! Shouldn't have to ask for water three times to start the experience off!! Luck of the draw I guess?
