I've been to Cabo Wabo a couple of times and while it's pricey for what you get, it's Vegas and that's how every place is.  At least at Cabo Wabo, you can sit outside and people watch while you eat and drink.  The tacos are fairly good and the drinks don't have to be sweet if you ask for them to be that way.  Service was pretty good and I'll definitely be back.
