I hosted an UYE at Cabo Wabo tonight, and I have to say the staff couldn't have been more helpful.

There ended up being about a dozen of us, and while the hostess earlier in the day told me that any groups over 6 couldn't be seated together on the Patio, but Roladno the manager made sure we had a place for the crew.

Donnie our waiter was one of the best I have had in a while, he took care of the entire crew and even took care of some minor issues we had.

I booked the UYE there because the las vegas advisor said they had $1 drafts from 9-11p, well when we got there they said it was just for the 4th, but after explaining to them that we have scheduled the event based on that happy hour, they decided to honor it for us. (thanks again guys for going above and beyond)

I personally didn't order anything off the menu (liquid dinner FTW), the few things I sampled were really good.

My only major complaint was that the misters on one of the umbrellas was broken so only about 1/4 of the group had misters, but that is about the only complaint I have.

I would recommend the place, the food is decent, the drinks are good (bonus we got free Cabo Wabo shots at the bar during a Hagar Song), and the staff will go the extra mile, on the strip you can easily do worse, but it's hard to find better
