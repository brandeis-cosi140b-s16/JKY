We went on a Monday night late so it wasn't too busy.  We were seated right way in the balcony area.  Restaurant is located outside of the Planet Hollywood Hotel and the Miracle Mile Shopping area, so it's the perfect spot for people watching and the views of the nearby hotels were great.  Our server had a few tables going, but made it a point to greet us right way to get in our drink orders (most important).  We didn't have to wait too long for your entrée to arrive, all piping hot!  I had a chicken burrito, enchilada style and the others have the fish tacos, 3 huge tacos!  All very yummy!

OVERALL EXPERIENCE:  Fun atmosphere!  Food is tasty and plenty.  Would've liked to hear more of Sammy Haggar's music playing.  Priced moderately.

When in Cabo, Mexico, check out the restaurant there.  Good food, authentic.  The décor is awesome.  There is a hugh wrestling ring right in the center of the restaurant for Saturday nights Nacho Libre matches!  Now how cool is that!
