The band was amazing! Great cover songs and crowd interaction.
The queso was mediocre (and you have to pay for chips and salsa).
The portobello mushroom fajitas were fantastic!
Cocaritas had a great taste, but lacking in booze.
The service was decent for a busy night and the food came out FAST! 
Like, not even time to go wash my hands fast.
Shout out to Danny for being a great server and fixing our order after I had made a mistake!
Extra shout out to the hostess who when being asked, "What's the difference between here and Las Salsas?" said, "This place is better and Las Salsas kind of sucks." (We walked by there on the way out and are very thankful for your advice!)

These are all things that should have at least guaranteed 4 stars, however, the margaritas were incredibly weak. I'm a light weight and did not feel anything! When paying $42 for a pitcher, I shouldn't be able to taste the sweet n sour mix over the tequila!
