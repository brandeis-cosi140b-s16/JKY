Came to cabo wabo today and danny the chunky  server with  the gay tattoos did a awesome job!!!!! I asked make me the most authentic mexican Margarita you can make. And then  he brought me some shit that looked like it was made at 7-11 . But it was the best damn Margarita I ever had. And he kept them coming til I passed out in the  ph parking lot!! 


FANTASTIC SERVICE LOL !!
