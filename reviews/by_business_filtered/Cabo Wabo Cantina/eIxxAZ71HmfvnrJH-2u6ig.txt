I bought a groupon for this place because I figured I could just get some drinks with it. We got there and told the hostess we just wanted to drink so she pointed us in the direction of the outside bar...well there were no seats in the bar, so we wandered around and eventually sat ourselves at the inside bar. The BF and I got a couple of their 'signature' margaritas. They were pretty terrible. I had the prickly pear margarita and it was very strong and tasted fairly terrible. Also, they put some super spicy stuff around the rim of the cup that was really unpleasant and was not mentioned on the menu. The drinks were 12$. This was ridiculous. I would not come back here again.
