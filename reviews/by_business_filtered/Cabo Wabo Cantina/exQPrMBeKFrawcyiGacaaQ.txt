This restaurant was great. Groupon brought us to this restaurant. Even though we used it we still ended up paying 120.00 for 4 of us. Cheap? K. The fajitas were great. The shrimp was delicious. Right off the Strip. They have an outside patio even tho it was too hot for us. It was 108 that day. Really do recommend this place.
