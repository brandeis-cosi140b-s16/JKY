Looks like a tourist trap....

My friends are big fans of Sammy so they wanted to check this place out.

- it was cold and drafty inside. It was a very cold Thanksgiving week but come on... keep your patrons warm
- Music was... top 40. Sammy probably would shoot himself if he heard it.
+/- there was a group of obnoxious tourists standing up on their chairs and screaming every five minutes. I get it...it's Vegas but what's the point of that act?
