My Girlfriend and I came here for a quick lunch while wandering around the strip. they have a fairly large and crowded patio that might offer some good views so long as you don't get stuck in the corner by the server station. The food was mediocre at best by my Phoenix standard for Mexican food. The service was a little slow as well.

As far as reasonable eats go on the strip you could probably do better but not without waiting.
