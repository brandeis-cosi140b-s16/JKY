If i could rate Cabo Wabo a negative score I would. 

We arrive just in time for Karaoke, which I would give 5 Stars.  But that's where the good ends. 

We were not actually sat by the hostess just pointed toward the tables. No menus, so I'm assuming the frat boy waiter assumed we didn't want service. When I asked for menus he looked at me like I was nuts. Then 5 seconds after getting the menus he asked us, "so are you gonna order something?" Really?

He never asked us if wanted drinks, I went up to the Bar to get mine. For a weak 8 oz margarita it was TWENTY DOLLARS!!!! For a pre-made Slurpee with house alcohol!!   

I would never go back there again. They treated us like trash and we did nothing to deserve it. 

And to top it off I accidentally left an expensive souvenir behind, when I returned they didn't have a lost n found they said "we just throw it away". I tried to express the whole experience to the manager, his response was "oh well". 

WOW - worst service EVER!
