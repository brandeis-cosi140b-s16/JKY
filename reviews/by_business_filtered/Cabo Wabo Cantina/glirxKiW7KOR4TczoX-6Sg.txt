Not a lot of value in terms of bang for your buck but what you end up getting tastes pretty good and the house margarita was exceptional as they use Cabo tequila. A check in on yelp (no prob) gets you a free margarita on the rocks and then the AAA coupon book from the mall that gets shoved down your throat nets another 20% off your bill. So, it became reasonable but after tip, we still spent $40 for tacos and chips and salsa. But we got free margs that are normally $10/ea and we enjoyed the service from the staff.
