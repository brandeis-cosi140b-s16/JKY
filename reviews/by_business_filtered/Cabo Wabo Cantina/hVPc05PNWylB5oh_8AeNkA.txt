Came here for lunch. Waited 20 min for a shaded outdoor table & got one half shaded. Asked hostess for a more shaded table, she said i had to wait... um isnt that what i just did?? Came inside, waitress took over 10 min to greet us. Drinks we ordered sat at the bar for over 5 so I got up to get them. One corona was warm. My crispy taco fell apart in the first bite, shrimp taco was super watery. Bad experience, will not come back.
