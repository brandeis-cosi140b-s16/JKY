GREAT FOOD
Great view
TERRIBLE service

We sat first, couple to the right got served their drinks before us, we ordered an appetizer, guy to the left sat after us and got his appetizer before us.  Our waitress THEN came back w/out drinks to ID us after about 10 mins of waiting. I was not a happy camper. Appetizer never showed, dinner came, and unfortunately it was really good. BUT I'd never go back.  Go to Border Grille or the Mexican place in the shopping center across from the Wynn. 

But don't go here.
