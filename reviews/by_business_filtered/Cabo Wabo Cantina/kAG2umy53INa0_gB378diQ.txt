A scrambled egg quesadilla sounded really weird to me, but I agreed to try it. We split the breakfast quesailla and added a side of guacamole. Shockingly, it was extremely tasty. I am glad I added the guacamole, because it really brought together the flavors in the quesadilla. It was served with a side of potatoes and a semi spicy sauce. Great start to the day. To accompany the quesadilla we each got a drink.  I went with the Desert Pear Margarita and Brian went with the crazy, alcohol fueled Can't Drive 55. Both were great choices, but I would suggest getting a pitcher.  You get more bang for your buck.
