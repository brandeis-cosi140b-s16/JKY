Oh my....stopped here to sit outside for lunch.  We ordered bloody marys.  They were DISGUSTING....probably the worst bloody mary I have ever had.  It tasted like dish water.  Gross....not a good way to start off a day.  Then I ordered the taco salad.  It tasted like something from Taco Bell....dont get me wrong...I love me some Taco Bell but not at a place not called Taco Bell...yuck.  They did have some good chips and salsa.  Also, the outdoor area was cool despite the sweltering heat.....so MEHHHHH
