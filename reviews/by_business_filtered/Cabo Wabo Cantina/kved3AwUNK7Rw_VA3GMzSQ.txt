I'm not hard to please but this place was disappointing. I seen it the last time I was walking on the strip and it looked like a fun place with a good atmosphere. I'm back in Vegas and wanted to grab some food on the strip. I specifically looked for this place... We found out, got seated, ordered our drinks and waited on our waiter to take our order. That's pretty much how the rest of the night went. Just a lot of waiting. I ordered the quesadilla plate. The quesadilla was great but the beans and rice were horrible. No flavor, very very bland and so was the guacamole. Margaritas were alright, overpriced but I guess because you're eating on the strip, you gotta pay for it. The waiter finally brings the check and we got fed up with waiting for him to come pick up the money, we walked it up to the register at the front. The hostess started calling our waiter and saw he was at a table with 2 other waitresses flirting. Smh, then she says "sorry he's too busy flirting". Never again..
