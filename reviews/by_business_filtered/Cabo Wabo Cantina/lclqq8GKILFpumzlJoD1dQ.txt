Skip this place. Overpriced tourest trap with the worst Mexican food we ever tasted. The nachos con queso were $8 and had nasty chips probably out of a bag and microwaved cheese sause (not good) with a skin on the top. For around $20 each, we expected the burritos, tacos and enchiladas to be top notch. Instead, they tasted like something a 16 year old threw together. Thank goodness they had bottled beer...couldn't ruin that. Taco Bell is 5-Star compared to this place. Sammy would die if he knew how poorly his restaurant was being run.
