Great view overlooking the Bellagio fountains if sitting outside. chips and salsa were good. Carnitas platter was decent but nothing special.  the beans were tasty but rice was not impressive at all.  Maybe the food would have tasted better or been more impressive if I was a drinker, but I am not. If your looking for good Mexican food on the strip this is not it.  Keep walking.
