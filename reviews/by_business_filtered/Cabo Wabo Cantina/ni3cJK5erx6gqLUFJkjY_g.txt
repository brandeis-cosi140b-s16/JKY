It's chain-restaurant Mexican food a la Chili's.  What do you expect?!  It's Sammy freaking Hagar!
That being said, first I had to walk about 10 miles from the parking garage to the restaurant (I hate Planet Hollywood!).  Then I paid $40 for a house margarita, a shot of Patron and a plate of "fajita nachos" that were just Eh.  I was there on a rainy Monday night, so can't really speak for the atmo -- it was dead.  I'm sure if it had been nice out, sitting on the Strip-side patio would have at least been good people watching!
