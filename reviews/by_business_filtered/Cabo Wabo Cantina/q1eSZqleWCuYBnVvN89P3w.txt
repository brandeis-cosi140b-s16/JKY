Loved this place. Service failed to tend our drink for over 10 minutes on behalf of a new employee but, this infraction was quickly noticed by the excellent management and things were made right. Our meals were comp'd and put on rush. Otherwise, great location, great view, and great food. A bit pricy-- That's to be expected on 'The Strip.'
