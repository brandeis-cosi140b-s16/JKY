I am sort of surprised by the negative reviews of this place. My husband and I are in our 20s and this was a great dinner for a night when we didn't want to spend hundreds of dollars.  We split the double order of fajitas for $30 which is and incredible price for vegas.  The patio is fun and lively.  If you sit along the outside bar, you can watch the fountains. They will refill your souvenir glasses for something like $12 which is also a good price.  The food was good and it was a great atmosphere. Obviously not a gourmet place, but that seems pretty obvious as you walk up...
