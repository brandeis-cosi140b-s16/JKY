I was expecting something more out of this place. The location in lake tahoe was fabulous, so why shouldn't I get the same food as there. Boy, was I wrong. Our fajitas came out well done ( bad move on taste and texture), when we explained to the manager that we'd had fabulous food at the other location... He was quick to inform me that the owners are not the same, and therefore the food wasn't the same. I don't think I will make this mistake again. He did offer to cook the fajitas to temperature, however, he made it seem like if you want meat that is still flavorful and juicy, you would need to request it. I also notice that the beef used was nit of the same high quality as the tahoe location. Tsk tsk . If you're reading this and want good food, this isn't the place.
