As many times as I have been to Vegas and passed by this place and seen people walking around with those ridiculous guitars filled with alcohol, I thought its about time we give this place a try.

Your in a Mexican joint so you must get a margarita and we decided on the Cabo-rita. Yes, that is the name. Kinda clever and kinda not. The margaritas were decent, decent amount of alcohol, and a decent lime mixer was used. Not too bad for a trendy touristy joint like this.

We just landed in town and we were looking for munchies, so we got the following appetizers:
* Lobster Taquitos - I actually like these a lot. A little too much. I would definitely order it again next time.
* Some Grilled Shrimp in Butter Sauce Dish (forgot the name of it) - This was excellent as well. The only negative was there wasn't more of it on the plate.

Overall, Cabo Wabo Cantina has good food and decent drinks. I can definitely see myself hanging out on the deck outside, getting smashed drinking margaritas, and eating good food. The only negatives to the place is the wait staff can be a little slow at times and our waitress would hide out so it was difficult getting another drink. All things considered, I give Cabo Wabo Catina 4 stars.
