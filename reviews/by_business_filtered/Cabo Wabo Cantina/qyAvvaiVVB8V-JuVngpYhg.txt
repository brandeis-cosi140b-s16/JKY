Loved this place. Sat outside and people-watched on Las Vegas Blvd. Fish tacos were delicious and served with a side of refried beans and rice. The Cabo frozen margarita was AWESOME, both the original and mango version. Wonderfully refreshing on a 97-degree afternoon. Server was very good. Only reason I didn't award them 5 stars is that I found the menu items a bit pricey, even for Vegas. Even so, I would go back, if only for their margaritas!
