This review is only for the bar that faces out into the shops at planet hollywood. I'm giving it 4 stars because I loved the convenience and never had to wait! We would just walk up and get a shot or a drink on our way out of the hotel! Several times we had a really sweet young girl who said she was new, a few times we had a woman was kind of a...well...you know.  We got frozen drinks, fireball shots, regular margaritas and one time the coconut margarita I had seen on yelp.  Everything was fine but the last one. It was borderline gross and the caramel that they put on the glass to hold the coconut dripped all over me, my clothes, my purse and then the end table in my room.  I was bummed because I had been looking forward to that drink for months after seeing it on line. That drink could have been awesome, they need to rework the recipe for it.
