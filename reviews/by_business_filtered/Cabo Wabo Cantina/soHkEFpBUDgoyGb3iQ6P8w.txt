It took a long time just to get our drink order. The menu items average around $15 a piece and the margaritas were $11. The margarita was just average. The chips and salsa were below average. I got the "Street Tacos" and the meat in the taco was not good and chewy. We got to sit outside and view of the strip earned them a star. I would not recommend this to anyone unless they wanted to drink an average margarita with a view.
