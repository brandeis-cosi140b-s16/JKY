So this place was ok.Maybe its better at night.I personally prefer diablos but even the last time I went there our bartender was a douch! The staff here is actually great our waitress outside still had a smile on her face when we wanted to move inside and the bartender inside was super nice and cute! She even made me exactly what I wanted, since I didn't like any of the drinks on the menu. Best of all I left my phone there and they somehow called my boyfriend and said they found it! So A+ for staffers and B- for food, overall that's a pretty good average I guess?
