TERRIBLE SERVICE! TERRIBLE MANAGEMENT! I wish I had read the reviews to this place! What a huge mistake!  We ordered 2 large margarita's and 2 waters, about 10 or 15 minutes go by and the server returns to take our order when she stil has not even brought us our water or our margarita's, we place our order and she say's she'll be back with our drinks....about 20-25 miutes later here is our food being brought out by someone else, still no water, still no maragrita's yep kind annoyed so we begin eating I mean we're hungry right, the waitress passes by again and again we finish our food STILL NO WATER & NO MARGARITA'S Well now we are done eating and STILL NO WATER & NO MARGARITA'S  well by now I obviously ask to speak with a manager, well he could care less and the jerk (the manager, tall guy dark skin dark hair maybe 23 or 25) thought we we're gonna pay for our margarita's ummmmm excuse me and when did either one of us drink one??? so yep payed for our food full price had dry mouth and left so if you go to this place good luck hope your not thirsty!
