Very bad, rude and bitchy service. My cousin and I baught drinks while on our way out and our server at the bar was just so rude! She's fortunate I don't remember her name but I think she was one of the supervisors (because she was telling people what to do and ppl came to her for things) and she was not pleasant. The way she talked to us was just bitchy! I do t know how else to explain it.

Las Vegas is one of the most popular vacation cities and you need to work on your customer service because you never know who's gonna write about you on Yelp!
