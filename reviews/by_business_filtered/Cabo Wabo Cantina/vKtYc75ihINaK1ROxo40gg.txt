Happy Hour Mon-Thur 3-6pm

Happy hour specials aren't great.  $3 street tacos and beer and shot specials starting at $5.  I like cocktails and apps so this is not the happy hour for me.  We ended up ordering Shrimp Nachos, Maui Rocker, Sammy's Toasted Colada and Strawberita.  Food was good but they were nachos.  Kinda hard to mess up nachos.  Drinks were strong and tasted great.  We sat at the bar but they also have an outdoor patio.  Our bartender was nice, more so after she found out we were locals.
