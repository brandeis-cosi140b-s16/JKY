We were initially told about 30 min of wait time but luckily we were called with 10 min!!We got a table outside on the patio. Great ambience with music playing in the background and the Amazing view of bellagio and Eiffel Tower.

We ordered nachos platter and chicken enchiladas. The food was good but not great. 
The server was so kind and we Got free margarita as part of Yelp checkin. It's Vegas what can you expect

The patio table was too small and it could barely fit for 4ppl and their food!!
