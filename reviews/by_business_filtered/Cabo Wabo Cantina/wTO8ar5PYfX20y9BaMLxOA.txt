Better than a few years ago. Food was warm and well covered with toppings. Not fancy Mexican. Very simple. Would tell everyone to also stick with the basics and drink a couple of cervezas. It will help improve food quality. Location is nice to see folks walking by and bellagio fountains. Three stars because simple Americanized Mexican food.
