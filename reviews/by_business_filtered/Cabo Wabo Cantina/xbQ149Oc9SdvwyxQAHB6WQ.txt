Place is super expensive. At $20 a plate they can at least bring some chips without charging extra. 

It's loud and big. If you can't get a patio seat consider just pushing on. 

However, the tortilla soup is amazing. The service was excellent. 

Fish tacos had great presentation and texture but low on flavor. Nachos were standard. 

I rated it 3 considering the price.
