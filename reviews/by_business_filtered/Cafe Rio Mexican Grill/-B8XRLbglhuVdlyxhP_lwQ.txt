2.4/5  - How can you make Mexican food without any flavor?

Ordered the BBQ pork burrito. Heard a lot about and read a lot of great reviews about this amazing BBQ pork. Turns out it is shredded pork with a very bland ketchup/honey sauce on it. I understand it's a chain and you aren't going to smoke the pork or anything that would add flavor during the cooking process but to skimp out and get the cheapest tasting BBQ sauce? Why even try? The other meat choices are shredded beef, shredded chicken, steak, and grilled chicken. The shredded beef didn't look too bad but the shredded chicken was sitting in a bunch of grey water and looked like it came out of a tuna can. 

The employees screwed up my order a little bit, but I forgive them due to the environment they have to work in. When someone orders extra meat or cheese they all have to scream "extra meat" or "macho man" or something else incredibly obnoxious that I couldn't understand. You can see by their face they are miserable doing it and I don't understand who they are doing it for. Does a customer exist who takes great pride in everyone within earshot knowing the standard is just not enough for them? If the owner or manager of the restaurant is reading this review, KNOCK IT OFF! It's not funny, clever, or whatever else you think it is. 

If you are looking for better quality Mexican food in the same price range first go to Baja Fresh (or Una Mas in the Bay Area), then Qdoba, then Chipotle.  On the way back I thought about whether there is any reason I would ever go back. The only thing I could come up with is if you really want BBQ and your wife really wants Mexican and you want to be nice and compromise and get a really crappy BBQ Burrito then maybe you go here.
