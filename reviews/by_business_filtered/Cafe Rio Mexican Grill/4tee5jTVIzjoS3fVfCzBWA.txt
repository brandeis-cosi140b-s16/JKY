We walked in past nine in the evening and the manager, Jim, was excited to see two new patrons.  He had us try some samples of the horchata and this mint lime drink.  Everything was fresh and made from scratch each day.  He was very excited to tell us about all the great things and helped us figure out what we wanted to eat. We ordered the carnitas burrito with everything (they have fresh jalapenos) in it, including the enchilada sauce on top. It  was very filling, tasted fresh and had lots of flavors.  We also ordered the carnita tostada, with the whole wheat tostada.  It was more like a big salad, but it was pretty good.  I would get shredded beef next time because the carnitas did not blend well with the other flavors of the tostada taco.  Jim is right; the horchata is the best in town.  Would stop by just for that.
