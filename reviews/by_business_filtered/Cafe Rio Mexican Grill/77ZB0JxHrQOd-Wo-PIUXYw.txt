I'm a dual citizen and have lived in both Mexico & the U.S. so feel I'm qualified to say Yolanda's pork tamales are the BEST I've had in a restaurant! This isn't a fancy place & no liquor license, so if you need Mexican beer with your meal, get the take out & take your food home. The staff even sings! I always give a Cinco de Mayo party (not a big holiday in Mexico but good excuse for a party in May!) and this year I'm ordering dozens of tamales from the Cafe Rio!  PLUS, I'll be back soon!
