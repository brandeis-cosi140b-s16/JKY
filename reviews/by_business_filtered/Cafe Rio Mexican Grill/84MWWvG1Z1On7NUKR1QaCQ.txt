Cafe Rio just isn't up to par for Mexican food.  I ordered 3 tacos with steak/guac and a small drink, total $14!  Seriously, way over priced tacos for so little. The tortillas may be homemade but I can get tortillas just as good or better at other Mexican food establishments.  I had asked if I could get cheese on the top of the tacos, it would've cost extra.  You got to be kidding me!  The lettuce was poorly cut, huge pieces that makes it hard to eat it in a taco or even a salad.  Really messy prep area and the staff pretty much lazy about how they prepared the tacos and other guests meals.  People were not that friendly nor seemed to like their jobs.  Good location to be in, yet not worth the trip.
