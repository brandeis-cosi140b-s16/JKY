I decided to come in around lunch time on a Tuesday afternoon. As I was entering, a couple of businessmen were leaving and talking about how busy it gets because of their specials. I knew what they meant when I saw the line but I figured it must move quickly, so I decided to wait...it was lunch after all and a place being jam packed at that time is generally a good sign.

The special on Tuesday was tacos for $1.75...beef, chicken, or pork. I ordered one pork and and one beef. With rice, beans, and a drink, my total came to just over $5. Not bad at all. The beef was really good, the pork a little disappointing. Too sweet for my taste. I was happy with the rice and beans and the horchatta hit the spot. Oh..and the TORTILLAS!! Best part of the meal. 

I ordered my food to go and took it back to work to eat. In the end I exhausted almost my whole lunch break (I was gone for 25 minutes). You can send your order in ahead of time online so you don't have to wait. That may be the way to go for someone who has a short lunch break. I may try that next time.
