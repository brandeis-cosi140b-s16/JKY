Since when do enchiladas not come with enchilada sauce? The description online clearly states "Fresh Corn Tortillas stuffed with Cheese, Sauce, and your choice of Meat. (I chose Steak) Topped with additional Cheese and Sauce, then baked in an oven. Served with Black or Pinto Beans." I ordered the enchiladas for a to go lunch order. When I got back to my office, I discovered I had received 2 corn tortillas with a small amount of steak inside, no sauce, no cheese, the beans were cold, nothing was baked. The meal was very dry and very disappointing. Since there are literally hundreds of good Mexican restaurants in this city, I will not be eating at Caf√© Rio again. The quality of food is nothing like Chipotle.
