I just finished eating my take-out dinner from CRMG on Camelback.

Don't get me wrong, there is a lot of food left, unfortunately it's in the trash can.

What I noticed behind the counter was a lot of confusion among way too many high school employees.  It looked like they opened last week, yet they opened at least 6 months ago.

I used CRMG online ordering tool.  That worked.  I ordered the beef nachos and a beef burrito.

When I dug into my nacho's I didn't like that there was barely any cheese.  Also, they seem to use cheddar which once it cools changes your nachos to NACHO.  Impossible to separate.

I gave up on the nachos quickly - no flavor and a pain to eat.  Time for the burrito.

What the burrito lacked in flavor, it made up for in size.  What flavor was there, was not what I expected.  I ordered with a medium verde salsa - which it appeared to have - but it also had some kind of enchilada sauce.  The two combined to be inedible.  I ate less than 20% of the burrito before trashcanning it.

All in all, it was a wasted $18.50

Under no circumstances can I envision a return.
