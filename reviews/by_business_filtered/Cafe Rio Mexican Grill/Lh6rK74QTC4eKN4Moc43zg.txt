Fun and tasty! We stopped in at Cafe Rio Mexican Grill (odd name, great food) and were very satisfied with the food, the service and the general atmosphere of the restaurant. The staff was very attentive, clearly motivated to do a good job with the new restaurant and it is a bright and cheerful place, fun to visit. I had the enchilada which had a good amount of very fresh chicken, the sauce was very good, just right on spiciness, and the pinto beans and Mexican rice were as good as any I've had. Definitely on my list for return visits to sample more of the menu.
