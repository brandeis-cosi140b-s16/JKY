I'm giving my rating based on the customer service.  I start ordering and automatically realize that the asshole making the food was exactly that...an asshole.  I felt that I was inconveniencing him when ordering my food.  I was flustered because of his negative ass energy.  He didn't crack a smile and looked like he hated his job.  That's not my damn problem, hunger is.  He just rushed me to order and it shouldn't be like that.  Next time if he's there, I'll walk out.
