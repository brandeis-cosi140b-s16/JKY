Cafe Rio is one of my favorites! Everything I have ever tried here is tasty, flavorful and always fresh. Their tortillas are homemade and if you're lucky, you will be able to catch them rolling and pinning on the way to the hot stone.

The tacos, burritos, enchiladas are great but my all time favorite is the sweet pork quesadilla.  It is just perfect and made just right to order. Dependent on the day, I may cheat further with chips, salsa and queso.  Boy, do I love mexican food!  YUM!
