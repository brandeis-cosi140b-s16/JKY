Heck yes!! Since moving to the west valley I can only dream of Cafe Rio in Gilbert, but no more! This location is still a drive, but its much closer. I'm still hoping they open one near west gate. 

Cafe Rio how I love thee, let me count the ways. I was first introduced to it by my boyfriend who went regularly in a different state and swore I would like it, even though I'm not a fan of Mexican (yes! I said it!) I ordered a chicken salad with pinto beans and all the fixings, extra cheese (shredded). As directed by my man I chose the tomatillo ranch dressing. 

Taste buds delight!!! Fresh quality ingredients. No iceberg lettuce here! Great meat, and no fat/gristle like Chipotle loves to charge you premium prices for. Everything is delicious. I've been going to Cafe Rio now for 4 years and I'm still having a love affair with their salads. I keep meaning to try a burrito but I just can't pass up the crisp coolness of the romaine lettuce and cilantro. Mmmm.
