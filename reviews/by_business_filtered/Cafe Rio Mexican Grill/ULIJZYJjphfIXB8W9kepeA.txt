Shock & Awe.

It must be in their business model somewhere. You'll be shocked when you get up to the register and $12+ for a simple chicken salad with a tortilla. And once the shock value wears off and you finally take a bite of your salad you will be in awe that you didn't pay half the price elsewhere for a better salad. The only thing that was enjoyable about the salad was the cilantro vinaigrette (which by the way when I asked for an extra side I was given two options. "Do you want the $.50 or $1.00 extra?" How about this is an $11.50 salad and an extra side of dressing is the lube before I get violated in exchange for some romaine lettuce?
