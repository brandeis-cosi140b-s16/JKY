I should have read some reviews before because I am disappointed in the fact that I paid $12 for a damn steak burrito and a side of guac. Which I had to add salt to. Food was meh. I guess I expected it to have some boldness to it. It's was okay. I'd come back if it was in the $5-$7 range, but definitely not $12!
