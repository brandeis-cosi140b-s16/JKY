I love the food at Cafe Rio...but this review is for their online ordering service and general customer service. It was terrible! I don't think I'll ever order online again. Not only was my food cold, but it was terribly assembled, my chicken enchilada had barely anything inside of it and half the order was missing. I guess it's part my fault for not checking while there, but you just trust that they're going to make it correctly. :(

Sad state of affairs - lost a lot of respect for Cafe Rio today. It seems they pay even less attention to guests' online orders than they do to guests who are ordering in-store. :(
