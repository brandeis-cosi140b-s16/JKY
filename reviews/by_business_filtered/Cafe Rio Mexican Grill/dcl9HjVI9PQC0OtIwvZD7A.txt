Great food, I would come here for the handmade tortillas. The service on the other hand is terrible. On the 4 occasions I have been here I have always had some problem with the service. They do not communicate with each other well. I wanted a veggie salad and the first guy put meat on it, than the cashier charged us for the guacamole (which comes with the veggie option) and she charged us for the meat after we told someone 3 different times that it was suppose to be veggie. 
It is a cool environment but service needs work
