I loved this place.

Now I was first expecting a little resturant. When I went in, it was kind of like a chipotle, but better tortillas!!!

You have the tortilla makers, then the food prep, then the cashier. Our cashier was adorable! Loved her, I think her name was Chrystal. She was very sweet and made sure our order was right since it was our first time there. 



First bite was DELICIOUS!
will certainly be going again!!!
