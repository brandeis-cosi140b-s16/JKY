Honestly I only get one thing here every time I come in and that is the sweet barbacoa pork burrito enchilada style. It has the freshest ingredients in just taste so damn good! Today I went for broke and ordered extra meat as well! I can now die a happy man. My wife loves their horchata and a couple other unique drink offerings.
