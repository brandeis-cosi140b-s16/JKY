So I was in Vegas on business and my client took me to eat here (at the Vegas location).  It was awesome!  When I got back to AZ i Googled them to find a location close to me.  Well there are none that are really close to me, but I went out of my way to eat here and show this place to my wife.  For some reason it was not as good as the location in Vegas but it was still very good. Whenever I am in their neck of the woods I will hit it up.
