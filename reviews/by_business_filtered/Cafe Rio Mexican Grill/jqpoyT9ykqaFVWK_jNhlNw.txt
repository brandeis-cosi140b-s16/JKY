Came again on a Tuesday but I swear the sign today said that the tacos were $1.95. I opted for a burrito and was fairly underwhelmed. I got the beef which was good, but when I got it enchilada style I asked for mild sauce, not knowing it was green. My fault I guess. You know when you get mild and it ends up having a little spice? Not here. Mild = tasteless. if there is a next time, I'll have to get the medium or something hotter.

The people behind the counter scream things to one another and then they all repeat...I think it's supposed to be entertaining but it's obnoxious. Maybe I'm just yelping while grumpy...
