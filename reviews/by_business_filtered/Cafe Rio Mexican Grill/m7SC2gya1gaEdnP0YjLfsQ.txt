This restaurant has the worst customer service I have ever experienced. The person serving me rolled her eyes when I asked to not have cheese on a tortilla (I had never been given a choice). The other person literally did not guide me through any choices (he said "what do you want?"). Then he walked away in the middle of serving my sister. Awful awful. I asked for a manager and the person at the cash register looked at me like I was crazy. I will never go back. This place needs a manager and a major customer service overhaul.
