I've never been here before but my boyfriend sold me on this place with " it's similar to Chipotle but with tortilla soup". I'm not one to ever turn down tortilla soup so I was game! Besides the soup I also ordered a kid's quesadilla. 
All seemed to be right in the world until I had a spoonful of soup and it was ICE COLD. 
Do you know how long you need to keep a vat of hot soup off of a heat source for it to get cold? A really long time! Which tells me NO ONE was checking the temperatures of the food and no one bothered to notice the heat source wasn't on. 
So after my first bite of cold soup, I took it up to the cashier and I got a deer in the headlights look. Like they were confused about needing to fix my problem. 
I was asked if I wanted them to warm it up. Seriously? NO. Do you know what that's going to do to my avocado? 
So they offered to make me a new one from scratch. I sat down and ate my kids quesadilla and my boyfriend wolfed down his burrito. Then I was done and bored and still hungry and I didn't have any soup. 
So I went and asked for a refund. They assured me it would only be a few more minutes. At this point I had waited almost 10 min for new soup. No thank you. 

What could have been a Rock My Socks sort of experience turned into me vowing to never come back here again. The food wasn't edible, the customer service was horrible and I can't trust a place that does not check the temperatures of their food since I have no desire to get food poisoning,
