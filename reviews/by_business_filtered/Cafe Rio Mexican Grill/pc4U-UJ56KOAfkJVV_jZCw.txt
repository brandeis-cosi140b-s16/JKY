Cafe Rio used to be one of my favorite places in town until last Saturday.  I have been going to Rio in UT for many years every time I go skiing there and when one opened in Phx I have been a very loyal and consistent customer.  I took my girlfriend there on Saturday the 25th for her first time and because of the awful service we received from the two males and one female working at 1pm she said it was the worst meal she has ever had.  To start off the staff was standing around, not acknowledging anyone and throwing everyone's food around like they were pissed off to be "forced" to be working there.  The staff didn't care about the quality of food they were serving so the tacos my girlfriend ordered were soaking wet to the point she couldn't eat them and my burrito looked like it was thrown down a flight of stairs.  I took a picture or my burrito because of how bad it looked.   The female threw pico at my burrito then threw the tray so hard down the line it folded the container. Everyone in line with us was getting the same treatment and everyone was talking about how poor the service was.  Also because the staff had no care whatsoever the food quality was also terrible and questioning me ever wanting to go spend my money there again.  

I wrote this same letter to Café Rio's corporate through their website and I haven't had one response letting me know that their employees probably act the way to go because the company doesn't care so why should they.  

Don't waste your time or money going to the Café Rio in Phoenix!!
