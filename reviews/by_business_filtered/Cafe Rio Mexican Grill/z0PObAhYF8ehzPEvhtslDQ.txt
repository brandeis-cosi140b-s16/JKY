Gave it another try and I am already regretting it! 

They do not listen, they go 100 miles an hour....shredded lettuce is no sheared lettuce at all...Pieces are so not nicely chopped ... 

Instead of chicken quesodilla my boyfriend got open quesodilla. He was not happy. 

Please slow down - at least when it is not so busy and listen to your customer.
