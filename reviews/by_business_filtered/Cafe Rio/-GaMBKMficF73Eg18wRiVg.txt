Ate here today, b/c it seemed like a real popping spot full of people when we actually ate next door the previous day. It was a little disappointing. I guess I ordered the most popular burrito, the Sweet Pork Barbacoa which don't get me wrong, it was good, but it wasn't as impactful to me. I ordered the burrito, with sweet pork, enchilada style with green sauce in and out, the presentation was good, price was roughly like 8$ I think, pretty standard, but I got the feeling that the sweet pork was a little TOO sweet as I couldn't get to finish the burrito b/c I got kind of tired of the sweetness? I hope you can understand what I'm saying. I was impressed that they have like a crap load of hot sauces mounted on the wall to choose from, but I tried using some with the sweet pork and the tastes just don't mesh well together. So i'd just skip it. This place was alright, but if I'm going out to Vegas I've got better options to hit up...
