Worst location in town, no questions about it... We walked in and the restaurant was empty, no wonder! The staff was rude, my husband paid $15.98 for 4 chicken tacos, barely any meat in them, I had a quesadilla and two drinks the total $32.27...really? We like the mint lemonade, of course the machines were off.... Terrible place... Never again
