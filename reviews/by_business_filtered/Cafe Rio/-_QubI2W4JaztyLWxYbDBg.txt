This place is simply fantastic. This is my whole family's #1 choice on any given night.  That's because every single item here is delicious, the prices are reasonable, the atmosphere is lively, and the staff are great. The drinks selection is amazing, too, with a station set up with a variety of flavors you can add, and "specialty" drinks like horchata and fresh lemonades.  My brother obsesses over the specials over the day, but on just about ANY given day I'm craving the Pork Barbacoa Salad.

You know the place is good because at ANY time of the day, the place is almost full.

Seriously one of the best casual dining options in Vegas.
