How can anyone not give these guys a 5 star?  Cafe Rio invented the sweet pork burrito and nobody...and I mean NOBODY can do it better.  I moved here a year ago from Utah where Cafe Rios are as abundant as Micky Dees .... and I was so happy to see the Cafe Rio sign.  

I eat there to much.  Its a 30 min drive to get there from where I live, but I love that I don't ever have to wait in line as long as I did when eating at the Utah ones...

Let me help you with what to order:  No serious if you are reading this...go there TODAY and order this - 

Sweet pork burrito with black beans, hot sauce, enchilada style with pico and guac ... no lettuce (unless you like lettuce ... I don't)
