I love this place. I used to be a huge fan of chipotle but I feel like every time I go they make their burritos smaller. This place has a huge burrito and I get mine enchilada style (smothered) which since it has barbacoa comes out to 8.25. I love to get tortilla strings on the side so they add some crunch when I need it. They have a delicious house dressing that is beyond amazing. I like to add that inside my burrito even though sometimes they stare at me for my choice but hey it's absolutely delicious. Homemade tortillas that you can see them make in front of you if you during prime hours. Fresh delicious ingredients. Don't be afraid to mix sauces and ask for extra cheese.
