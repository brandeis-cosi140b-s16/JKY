My experience here today was sub par to say the least. 

This is my 3rd time eating here. My problem is not with cafe rio or their food but the girl who served us. 

I'm very big on customer service and it was bad and made me mad enough to leave this. 

I asked for a quesadilla meal. She moves on the the next person , my wife and says. "What else. Doesn't ask me what kind of meat or "did you want anything else but cheese on there"  or anything. So not knowing how things work exactly I figured she'd ask me what kind of meat I wanted in a second.....Nope sure didn't. So I didn't get a chicken quesadilla like I wanted. 

Not only that. There was a new trainee there. Who was standing there not knowing what to do and this girl is just throwing stuff around and not taking the time to show this girl anything! She asked her a questions " hey how long are you supposed to put that in the warmer" basically begging to be trained. And she blows off the question and goes and does something else. 

I hate leaving bad reviews and this is my first one because I don't want to harm other businesses, but this girl needs to go!!
