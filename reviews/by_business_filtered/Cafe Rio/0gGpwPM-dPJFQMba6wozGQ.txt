BAD Service, GOOD Food, just as many other reviewers have stated. What's even more shocking is the lack of effort in improving service as I do not see one response from management on yelp. I guess that's what you get with a chain restaurant.

[CUISINE]
Drinks: I am completely obsessed with the mint limeade here. So so yummy!

Chicken Quesidilla: Not super cheesy. More meat than cheese. Very Yummy.

[DECOR] 
I really like the decor if this fast food restaurant. They have hanging lanterns, colorful chairs and it feels like outside inside. Very Cute.

[SERVICE]
They don't explain anything on the menu for instance they'll ask if you wanted your burrito enchilada style but not willing to explain what that means. Your just supposed to know apparently. Also they didn't mention guacamole is additional. Found out at the register it was $1.25 extra which was no problem but they should have mentioned it. 

[PRICE]
Cheap $7-$9 but the service was so bad it may be awhile before I return.
