If only they had this place in Southern California, then I would never have to hear another suburbanite talk about Chipotle! 

This place is great! If you're looking for  authentic authentic Mexican food, obviously you won't find it from a chain restaurant. But their food here is DELICIOUS! I highly recommend the sweet pork barbacoa! For a drink, definitely have to try their mint limeade...sooooooooooooooooooooo good. The mint limeade is half of the reason I come here. 

Another great thing about this place is their staff! Everyone was super friendly and cordial. It's nice to walk into a place that has staff with a smile on their face...just makes the whole experience of dining somewhere a little more enjoyable.
