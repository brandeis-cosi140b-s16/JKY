This place is the ultimate place for an awesome great tasting american style mexican food. 

I was introduced to this place by a knockoff in vegas, that was soon replaced with the real deal and have yet to find anything in this place i do not like. 

Everyone I have brought here has loved it and become a fan. The enchiladas are awesome and my wifes favorite. I like a pork burrito with mild sauce black beans and rice....the flavor will stick with you forever. 

I highly recommend this to anyone! I do wish they would open up more locations in the valley so I can let my other family members in surprise fall in love.

I even had them cater our wedding rehearsal dinner...
