I'm giving this 3 stars for the food only, not to hop on the train with all of the other reviewers but the staff really does suck. We watched 3 workers talk about how one of them was feeling ill and about how much ibuprofen she had taken that day...all while she prepared our food right in front of us. Seriously? I understand you having an off day but keep it professional. They continued to talk about what time they were all off and how the day was just dragging for them. All while we stood there. We love the food but next time we'll see if the other location on west sahara has better staff.
