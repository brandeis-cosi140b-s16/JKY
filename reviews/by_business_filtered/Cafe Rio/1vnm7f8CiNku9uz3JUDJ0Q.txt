I am sorry but I prefer Neveda Cafe Rios the this Lakewood location. First off this Lakewood location doesnt have salmon tacos what a bummer and second I dont know what's up with the staff? They tend to be rude as if though this is their first time working customer service or they just dont care.  They lack management and it reflects on the poor service. I most likely will not come back the food isnt that great to endure rude service. They should really look into who they hire or whom ever is training cause someone isnt doing their job and it reflects..But onthe plus side they offer free child quesadilla for kids under 6. So yah to free stuff.....oh and they should make it a habit to refill their drinks when they are empty, been here three time and I swear the horchata and mint tea where empty....
