Cafe Rio always hits the spot. Excellent burritos, especially if you get them with enchilada sauce. So far, I've had the Fire Grilled Chicken Breast and the Sweet Pork Barbacoa; they are both delicious. In the case of the latter, you might want to shy away from it if you don't want your food too sweet.
