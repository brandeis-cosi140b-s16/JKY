I owe it to Cafe Rio to write a review!  Hands down the best pseudo fast food mexican food in  Las Vegas!  It is far better then Chipotle, Baja Fresh, or Roberto's combined!  Everything on the menu is amazing- although the serve huge portions so be sure to head there with an appetite!  The best  on the menu in my opinion is the salad- I am a chicken fan but the pork is excellent as well.  Even the tortilla soup is amazing (if you are looking for something on the lighter side!)  The staff is pretty comical as well- they sing and chant to the first time customers and to the patrons that have earned a free meal with their "frequent eater card".  I heart Cafe Rio!!!!
