Cafe Rio's concept is similar to Chipotle, but Rio offers a few more options (e.g., salads, enchiladas).  I would have gotten the three tacos with fire-grilled steak... except they were out of fire-grilled steak.  The person who ordered in front of me got fire-grilled steak... so I guess he got the last of it.  It was around 6pm on a Wednesday, so I'm not quite sure what that is about.  

Anyway, I ended up ordering a pork barbacoa taco and a chicken taco.  The barbacoa taco was fantastic... but super messy and just kept dripping all over the place.  However, I can handle a mess when the taco is this good.  Unfortunately, I can't really say the same for the chicken taco... but I did see that they offer an upgraded chicken, so I guess I must have ordered the chicken that they know is not their best chicken.  Strange thinking there.

The chips were out of a bag, but the queso was pretty good.  It had a little bit of a canned (or bagged) cheese taste, but the added peppers, onions, etc. made it pretty good.

I will give this place another shot when I'm back in Vegas, but only after checking out all of the other options.
