My friend talks about this place all the time. So when I came to visit..this was the first stop.

The food was really good, the service was far less. The only complaint on the food is they are not as generous as Chipotle with their guacamole. 

The girl at the counter had serious sass.. Having worked in her position for four year- I would never mock a customer. You could tell she was local.. haha
They put chicken next to my burrito so they would know it had chicken, even though it was a vegetarian burrito, so I said: " I did'nt ask for chicken", and they all looked confused and all started asking each other "is there chicken in here", "hey did you add chicken" to each other. I thought that was taking too long, you either A. Let me check or B. Just make a new one without all the question asking. Since they didn't get the memo I just said "I'll check it myself and just let you know". They didn't get it, so I repeated myself. (It's wasteful to instantly make a new one, so I wanted to make sure it was right before they threw it out.). The girl at the cashier proceeds to mock me and say, "GUYS, She'll check it herself, she'll check it herself" in a very rude/ mocking manner.... Oh well, sadly many people don't have great customer service.

Regardless of the rude employees, Cafe Rio is very yummy and if I stumble across another I would go back.
