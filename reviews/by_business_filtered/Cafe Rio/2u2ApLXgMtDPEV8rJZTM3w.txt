My first visit here and I had the salmon tacos plate. The menus are on the walls where people wait so you are staring at the menu and people think you're staring at them. Bizarre.
I was charged for chips but didn't order them and I think she tried to charge me for a side of dressing the other employee said comes with the salmon. Geez! 
So that happened and the overcharge was quickly remedied. But now I'm soured on this place. The tacos were very good.
