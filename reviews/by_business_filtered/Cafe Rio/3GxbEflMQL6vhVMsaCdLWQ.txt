So tired of children working behind the counter that have "ZERO" sense of urgency!! I'd say food is great but, when they make u wait in a line for 30 minutes only to find out when you finally get to order that they ran out if grilled chicken or presume you don't care to get the yellow cheese on your quesadilla (all white cheese with no informing you they ran out of that too) management is clueless and when they read this they are going think "I must be doing something right - look at my numbers!" 
Hey Mgmnt - Imagine your numbers could be even greater than that fool! Get it together as I only come here now when the wife insists! As for running out if product, maybe place a sign on the door that let's customers know not to wait in a 30 minute line only to be let down then pissed off. These same experiences have happened to me MANY times. Chipotle is in same center - do consider it if you see more that 8-10 people in line!!
