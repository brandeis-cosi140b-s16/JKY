So I came here once a week, but now I will never touch this location again.

I waited over 20 minutes for MILD SAUCE! What made it worse was I was asked 6 TIMES what sauce I would like. No, I'm just standing here watch you cook for 20 minutes. Like really?!

And gotta point out, the entire staff at this location look like they been sneaking food. It's not enjoyable as a customer watch a cashier sweat from pressing buttons.
