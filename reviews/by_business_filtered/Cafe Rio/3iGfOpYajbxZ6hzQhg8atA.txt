I wasn't too thrilled with this place for two reasons. First, I went to the restroom before I ordered and saw an employee walk out without washing her hands. I'm sure this happens at restaurants everywhere but to see it was a turnoff.

Second, I didn't like the way the workers yelled out "mooorre meat!" whenever someone ordered extra meat. It was hard to enjoy a meal and talk to my friends with people yelling that the whole time.

The food was pretty decent, nothing to rave about. I also ordered the pork barbacoa salad based on the comments of many here, but found the pork too sweet for my taste. The sweetness was countered nicely by the vinaigrette dressing, however.

I think there are better places to go in the area. So I'll try them out and hope I don't hear "mooooorre meat!" in my head for the next few days.
