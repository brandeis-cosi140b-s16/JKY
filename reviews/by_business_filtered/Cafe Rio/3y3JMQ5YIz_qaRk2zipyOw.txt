Just another Mexican Fast-Food Chain in the Valley? Alot like Chipotle, Baja Fresh, Rubios and the like. Pretty decent but NOT at all REAL mexican food. A watered-down Americanized version at best.

The Meats were good but kinda scarce on the tacos & burritos I had- Too much with the beans already. and the whole thing was just kinda blah!!

Nothing to write home about definitely nothing I'd go out of my way for again.I did like how they had quite a variety of hot sauces for you to try including habanero & Atomic!! :)
