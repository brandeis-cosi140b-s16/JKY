I visit this location pretty often and coincidentally I'm always helped by one of these three employees Marry, Ramtin, Rambod, the customer service I get from them is exceptional and even with the high volume of customers they seem to always find a way to smile, be polite, and get me out in a timely manner, I stopped In today for my usual amazing salad and on the way out I asked the cashier if I could leave a tip and she informed me that they weren't allowed to accept tips so my next option of showing my appreciation was this. You guys are awesome and from one customer service employee to another when all else fails just smile  keep up the great work your appreciated!
