Okay, so I am a regular at this location.  The last 5 times I visited location they were out of items at 7pm that they should not be such as corn tortillas, orchata, and tres leche desert to name a few.  So very disappointing.  Today however, my kids were disappointed as the rice they love was hard.  As we headed to the drink area I noticed the specialty drinks were AGAIN off.  I asked for assistance as orchata was the drink we wanted, the manager said she could make some which was nice, however in the mist of her making fresh orchata, another customer was redeeming his stamp card and the cashier was arguing with him about how many stamps he has and who can use his card(his friend with him apparently not allowed to use his card )loudly in front of my children.  As we waited for another 8 mins...finally I interrupted and asked for my drink, which was given and a free meal next visit...so overall experience again was disappointing, manager handled the other guy and myself accordingly, but the workers there seem very unhappy and unwilling to value returning customers.  This is the only location that seems to have these types of issues.  hopefully they turn around the customer service and have menu items in stock. #wheresthecustomerservicegone? #ijustwantcaferioback
