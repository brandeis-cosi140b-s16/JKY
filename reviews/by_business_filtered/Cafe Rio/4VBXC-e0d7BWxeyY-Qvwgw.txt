Wow. Who knew this place would know how to pack a mean burrito and taco salad. Delicious! I went in around noon and the line was almost out the door! So I guess come early? I waited about maybe 20-25 minutes before I got to order. Not bad. 

Anyways, the lighting is a little dim once you step inside, but plenty of seating both indoor and out. (: Nice because who wants to sit inside when it is a nice beautiful day outside?! Anyways yes. I went with the top most favorite order. Sweet and Sour Barbacoa burrito and the taco salad. 

What a surprise! Everything is so freshly made. The tortilla, the burrito, the salad. All in front of your eyes. Can't get any more fresh than that! The taste is like explosion in your mouth. Seriously it's packed with flavor. Sweet and sour from the barbacoa but tangy from the enchilada sauce and their house sauce. Yum! Taste even better with hot sauce (;

The portions are huge too!! I def had to eat my burrito over two meals. So if you are on a budget and wanting a meal to last all day. Come Here! It's good and def worth it!!
