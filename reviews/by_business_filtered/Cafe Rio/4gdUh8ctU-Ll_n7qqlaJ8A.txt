Cafe Rio is for people who don't like going to taco shops or taquerias and love bland fresh-Mex Americanized variety; but there is still a few bright spots in this joint. You won't find menudo with tripe or ceviche, but you will find shredded beef salad within a flour tortilla bowl, topped with a mountain of romaine lettuce and cheese. But don't let that scare you, there are a few items worth trying.

There are two gems in the place: sweet pork barbacoa and flour tortillas. If you dislike pork, I would probably stick to chicken then (a bit dull though). Get the sweet pork barbacoa taco; the only item I really love. The only meat that has good flavor, although a bit sweet. The flour tortillas are soft and tasty. But for the love of Lady Gaga, please don't get the salmon tacos, they're bland and overpriced. To make up for their overall boring food, they have a lot of hot sauces to try.

Service is no nonsense cafeteria style, and you better speak loud because the workers are degraded to yell whenever somebody gets a free meal or is notified of a first-timer. Ugh. For a place that dubbed itself a Mexican Grill and has invested in the decor, they sure don't play Mexican songs or any song that has Spanish words. Instead you will hear Neil Diamond and American oldies. Bottom line: enjoy the barbacoa while listening to Mr. Diamond.
