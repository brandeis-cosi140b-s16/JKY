As much as I love Cafe Rio food I will never be returning to this location. Cafe rio has an option to order online. I placed my order at 5 pm online and I leave work to get there shortly after. When I get there, there's only 2 people in line. The 2 people received their orders and left. Now it was only me and I asked if they could fulfill my order. They told me the promised time was 545 so that's when they would have it ready which was a good 20 minutes away. Basically what they were telling me is that it would have been more convenient for me to wait in line and order then to order online when there was NO ONE ELSE THERE! The manager sensed my grief and told me they would start my order right away. Well it was not 540 and my order wasn't even ready yet. I had paid online and I couldn't just give them $28 bucks especially with the service being so horrible so I had to wait. 545 rolls around and I still haven't gotten my order. By this time I'm pretty irate and all they can say is they had other take out orders as well. When you tell me it will be ready by 545 it better be especially since you wouldn't accommodate me and get me out the door quicker. The manager didn't even say anything and didn't even try to make the situation better. Save yourself the hassle and DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT order online! Actually don't even come to this location, just stop by the Chipotle instead right next door.
