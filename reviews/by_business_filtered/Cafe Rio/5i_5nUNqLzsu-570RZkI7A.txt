Ok Cafe Rio, I'm very disappointed with you. 
I eat or at least used to eat at Cafe Rio about 1-3 times per week. 
I can agree with some of the other reviews regarding customer service, but I always ignored it because they generally make my food correctly. Plus the food is good and portions are huge. 
Well, I recently took a break from dairy, which makes me very sad, but it is what it is. 
Considering I usually order the grilled chicken tostada with creamy Ranch type dressing I was pretty nervous that it wouldn't taste the same without dairy. My friend recommended I get avocado instead of sour cream. Great idea, right? 
So I order my salad, no rice, no cheese, no sour cream, no dressing. Oh wait can I sub avocado for the sour cream? 
Counter guy: doesn't answer, just puts it in my bowl. Ok. Great. 
I get to the checkout and the cashier tells me it will be $. 95 to add guacamole. So I ask her, even though I didn't get cheese, sour cream or dressing? She doesn't reply and just adds the extra to my total. 

Normally, I may have said something, but I'm so tired of having to argue or complain to receive appropriate customer service. 
I think I'll give my normal Cafe Rio another try (on Eastern) but if I get the same treatment I may just be over this place. Obviously they don't care about my business. 
It's frustrating because the amount of guacamole that you receive is paltry. I mean for a dollar I should at least get a full scoop. 
I used to rave about this place to anyone that would listen, but now I'll take my business to a place that can accommodate my dietary restrictions.
