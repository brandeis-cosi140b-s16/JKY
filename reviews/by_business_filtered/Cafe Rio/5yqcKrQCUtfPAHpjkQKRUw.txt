Like the other reviews. YES IT IS A HIT OR MISS.... more miss than it is a hit to me & my family. 

I'll talk about one instance I came by myself. It was around 7:30pm on a slow Friday. Good for me, no long lines. I get served my sweet barbacoa pork tostada, & I get to the part where they ask you what sauce you would like. (I usually get mild) so I said mild, the gentleman then informs me "we don't have any at the moment, actually just the hot". Well I'm a person that hates anything spicy. I asked "so I don't really have a choice?" 
"Yea we don't have any" 
3 things wrong with that 
1. Why didn't you inform me before I started ordering what if I'm a stickler & can't eat my food without the ONLY sauce I like 
2. Why didn't you offer me an option like "would you mind waiting for a new one" but instead nothing, didn't even bother asking the people in the back to make any!!!!
3. No apology for not letting me know in advance or for not having it PERIOD!! What a moron. 

Already dissatisfied, I get to the cashier, PAY. & not a single time did anyone ask how I was doing, not a single smile from the employees, or an apology for not having an item that pretty much everyone uses. 
I get it you guys are 2 hours away from closing but don't treat me like I'm a customer that will ignore something like this. Mind you I'm more upset about the customer service than them really not having that sauce. 

Ps. I've never had a great experience at any of the branches, but this one seems to get my blood boiling every single visit. I just wish there was one closer to my house than this.
