Okay, they even get orders wrong as a walk in. I specifically asked for grilled chicken enchi's and she puts shredded chicken in them! Really? Next to that, customer service...horrible. Everyone in there looks so down and out, just slumming away; no smiles, speak to you very emotionless. One girl even says to a man that walks up to the counter "ya what do you need?". Where is management at this place? I thought about asking to speak with a manager but seeing as how the employees are mummily (ya I made that word up) serving guests, I couldn't help but think that they are a reflection of how their management is allowing them to act, so it probably wouldn't be worth it. Such a shame the staffs personality and service doesn't match their delicious food.
