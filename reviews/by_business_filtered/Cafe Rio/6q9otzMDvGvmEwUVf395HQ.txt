Frequented this location since it opened...initially it had lots of promise but it continues to slide down that slippery slope of carelessness, indifference, and apathy that many restaurants get when staffed with minimum wage teenagers who don't care one bit about the job they're doing...fast food restaurants should learn from places like In-N-Out and Chipotle when it comes to the people they hire...but alas, you get what you pay for and the Cafe Rio franchise is getting back what they invest in their personnel...nothing!
