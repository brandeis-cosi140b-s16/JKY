I was skeptical about this place at first, but after visiting it is definitely a place to keep in your quick outing rotation (off-diet, of course).  The layout is a little crowded and there is almost always a line but after eating the food you will see why this place is consistently busy.  Fret not, the line is quick!  Seating leaves a lot to be desired but we almost always just order to-go or order online for pick-up so it's a non-issue.  Side note:  Be careful when entering and crossing between the seats and the soda station (the main walk to the line) as I have almost been ran over by children and adults rushing for soda.  I dunno, maybe there was a soda shortage and I missed the memo.

People who make the food are attentive, quick, and friendly.  Awesome.  Every now and again we will get someone on the register who is usually not with the program like the rest of the staff is and has to ask three or four times what we ordered and even still will try to charge us the wrong amount.  It's not from confusion from the rest of the team, however -- I have caught the person at the register often joking and not paying attention to the customers.  Serious downer, but I am pretty firm (read: attention-grabbing because I want to GTFO of line and EAT!) now and it helps.

What to order: Fire-grilled chicken nachos.  Extra cheese.  I like when they yell extra cheese, sue me.
