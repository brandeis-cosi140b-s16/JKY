If I could give zero stars I would. This place is HORRIBLE, the attitudes of the employees there are terrible. If you're so unhappy working in food service then don't work in it. You walk in & you immediately become and inconvenience to these employees. Along with the horrible attitudes & shitty looks the food was awful. The tacos were a soggy messy, the girl slopped salsa on the tacos not even attempting to drain the excess liquid, it was basically taco soup, disgusting. The quesadilla they didn't cut & grease was everywhere. I will NEVER set foot in another cafe rio location. I can do a better job myself at home. Everyone there needs to be fired.
