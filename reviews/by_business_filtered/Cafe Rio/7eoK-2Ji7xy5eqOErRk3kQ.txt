I have been going to Cafe Rio for a couple of years now and have never been dissapointed. I typically get the Pork Barbacoa burrito and have to say that is the best burrito of that style I have ever had. The price is a little on the high end for a burrito, but you won't have to eat for the rest of the day, the burritos are that big. The staff is friendly and the food is fresh. What more can you ask for.
