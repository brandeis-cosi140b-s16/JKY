This place is a clone of Chipotle and Qdoba.  The main difference is price.

A burrito and a soda here is over $10.  The same order at Chipotle or Qdoba is around $8.

Their big thing is "enchilada style".  Too bad it's an extra dollar.
Guacamole, extra charge.
They even charge for sour cream (it's not even good sour cream, tastes like it came from Vons).

There is really no reason to go to this place when both Chipotle and Qdoba are available.
