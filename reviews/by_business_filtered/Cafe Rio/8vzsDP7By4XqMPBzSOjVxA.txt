3.5 stars.

Comparable to Chipotle's style of ordering, kinda.  Staff was friendly.

I'm sad I didn't get to try the freshly made tortillas; they looked REALLY good.  

Tostada - not what I thought it would be.  Flat taco shell with salad on top.  Lime dressing/vinegarette was really good, though.

Nachos- I swear I saw him pile on the meat, but when we ate it, it seemed like there wasn't a lot?  Maybe the meat slices were thin.  I noticed that with the grilled chicken, they were cut pretty thin.  

Next time, definitely quesedilla and tacos.

Drinks were awesome.  Half lemonade mint and half strawberry, like a strawberry mojito, minus the rum.

Overall, pretty solid.
