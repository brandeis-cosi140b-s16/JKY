This Cafe Rio cannot get orders for groups right.  I have tried through their Catering line, online, and over the phone and they NEVER have gotten the order correct.  This time, the order was placed online and paid for online.  Pick up time for 11:45.  The order was not ready at 11:45 or noon for that matter.  And the person behind the counter asked for our list of food we ordered instead of reading it off their computer!  They received the online order because they received the payment.  The order was not ready until 12:30.  We asked for a manager and were denied.  This is going to corporate.  No, we will not be placing any group orders every again and will we tell everyone at the office about our experience.
