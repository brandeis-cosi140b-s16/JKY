Cafe Rio, as a chain alternative to Chipotle & Baja Fresh, you rock. You have tasty, handmade tortillas. You often have mahi and regularly have wild-caught salmon. Your hot sauce selection is unrivaled. BUT, your UNLV location kinda sucks. The last 4 times I've been in, you've been "out" of salmon, regardless of the time of day--even on a day where you advertised your SPECIAL as fish tacos (um, take down the sign if you run out). You were entirely out of napkins in the entire shop on my last visit (and no staff offered a creative solution like, I dunno, a roll of paper towels?). And when I ask for a veggie burrito, a tortilla stuffed with rice & cheese doesn't cut it. The sign says "guacamole" is inside, but you never even offered it.

I think we're gonna have to break up.
