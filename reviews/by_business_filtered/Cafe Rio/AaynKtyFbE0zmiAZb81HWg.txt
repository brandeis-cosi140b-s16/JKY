Cafe Rio is one of the few mid-price lunch places that's worth a  20 + minute drive. I'm not much of a veggie eater, but I could eat their salad every stinkin' day (the cilantro lime vinaigrette is like nectar from heaven).  

When I'm feeling like I can spare the calories I go for the enchiladas, either chicken or the sweet pork barbacoa. Ask for extra cheese and everyone behind the counter explodes in praise, "extra cheese!" Hot, sweet, cheesy and drenched in red sauce, they are always gone so soon from the old-style foil tin they are served in.

But a highlight, of course, is the handmade flour tortillas. So tender and almost flakey. How do they do it? What evil pact has Cafe Rio made to be blessed with such good food? We may never know, but in the meantime, go early and often.
