While I was home in Idaho, a new restaurant was opening, called Cafe Rio. Being Twin Falls, Idaho, a sleepy little town, this was a BIG deal. Lines were out the door, but my sister and I decided to brave the crowd. 
I was so glad we did.

Fast forward one month to my first paycheck back in Phoenix, and my roommate and I are cruising along past Phoenix.. Tempe.. Mesa.. and find ourselves in Gilbert, for the sole purpose of getting a salad.

Now, this is not just any salad, but it is one of the most delicious taco salads I have ever had. Lettuce, tortilla strips, cojita cheese, rice, beans, salsa, sour cream, guacamole, and meat of your choice (pork barbacoa. ALWAYS choose the pork barbacoa!) nestled in a warm tortilla that was made right before your eyes, then drizzled in the house creamy cilantro dressing. Uh-mazing. 

I can only testify to this one dish however. (Or I suppose the tostada.. exact same, except instead of the flour tortilla, a small corn tortilla). The first time I went I got the quesadilla with chile roasted beef. It was okay.. I wouldn't have been back if it wasn't for me trying my sister's salad, which we have established is enough for me to spend my finite resources on (cash, gas).  The service here also leaves a bit to be desired, but whatever. I'm not here for the ambiance (although some very nice art pieces), or the clientele (lots of families), or the reading material (The Beehive). 
They do have a customer loyalty card - buy 10 meals get 1 free- which seems to be a dying art these days, which is just too bad, because Cafe Rio has made a loyal customer out of me!
