Oh man, I am a happy camper since finding this place! My mouth is drooling just thinking about their homemade flour tortillas, made fresh right in front of your eyes *dying*...and with me being a picky eater I love how you can see the food being prepared in front of me; that way I know what I am getting and I know it's made accurately. 

The chile roasted beef is to die for. It tastes like a pot roast that has been slow-cooking all day at Grandma's house. Just add in some cheese, veggies and a side of pico and you have yourself heaven in a aluminum takeaway container (which is awesome by the way). If you can't finish your dish just throw on a lid and you're good to go. 

I recently ordered the queso dip and it was stellar, their chips are delish and I'd have to say my favorite dish are the tacos right now. Oh and get this - order any adult entr√©e and get a free kids quesadilla for your little munchkin. Say what? That's right....FREE food. How awesome is that?

It does get super busy here and that's my only gripe....but hey, they're serving awesome food, can you blame them? No. Soooo much better than Chipotle. They're popping up like crazy around the valley so do yourself a favor and check them out.
