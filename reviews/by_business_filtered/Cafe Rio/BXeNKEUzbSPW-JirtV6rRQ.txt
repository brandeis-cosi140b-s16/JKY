My husband and I went to the one on Baseline and Gilbert. We have never been to such a filthy establishment, the waitress out on the floor could not keep up with the overflowing garbage cans, tend to tables, all of the Teas at the drink station were out, I asked for them to be refilled but that did not happen as she had more garbage to tend to. The floors and tables were all a mess with left over food, hardly a clean place to sit. My husband now refers to it as "the place we got dog food from" I hate to even give this place 1 star, but I have to for a review.
