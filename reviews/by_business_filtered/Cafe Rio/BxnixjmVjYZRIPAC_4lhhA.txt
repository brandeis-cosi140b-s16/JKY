The food here is really good.  I reccommend the steak tacos.  YUM!  However, I only gave it 3 stars because the organization is crap!  You seriously have to repeat your order 5 times before you check out.  Since my husband usually goes and gets a table with the kids and I do the ordering, that means I repeat 5 orders 5 times.  You do the math!  Im exhausted by the end of the line!!  Just kidding.....It's just more frustrating than anything.
