The food here is standard Cafe Rio fare -- bland, fresh, and high quality -- but the one star rating is deserved because this restaurant CAN NOT handle any type of crowd. The lines here are outrageous and I agree with the other recent reviews. PLEASE, corporate, PAY ATTENTION AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS LOCATION!

It wasn't always like this. Cafe Rio was a quick and easy place to grab a business lunch or to get takeout on the way home from a long day at work. No longer. After my most recent visit 2 nights ago (and a nearly 45 minute wait in line at 8 pm!!), I will now not only actively avoid dining here, but I will be sure to spread the word to everyone I know. 

People are not exaggerating about the wait times. The problem is, you never know just how long the queue will take when you line up. The employees are so slow and nobody tries to expedite the line. Cafe Rio is supposed to be a "quick service" restaurant but now it's anything but. 

There's no excuse. Zero. Zip. None. 

All I can figure is that Cafe Rio corporate and this location's manager just don't give a crap about losing customers. 

We used to go at least twice a week. Then that whittled down to once a week, then a couple of times a month then about once a month. Now it's gone to none. 

Maybe that's your plan, to get people to stop coming to your restaurant so the line will move quicker. Congrats, Cafe Rio! Here's to at least two other people (as well as all of our friends and coworkers) who will never set foot in your restaurant again.
