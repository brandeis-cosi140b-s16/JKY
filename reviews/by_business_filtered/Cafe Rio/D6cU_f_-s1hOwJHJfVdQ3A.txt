I've been here enough times to get my free meal (10 times, 11th meal free). It's one of the better places to go if you're looking for a bite to eat near UNLV. While I wouldn't call it authentic Mexican food, it does make for a good lunch. I pretty much see this place as a Chipotle 2.0. 

Their highlight seems to be their pork; more specifically, their pork burrito. It has this savory sweet flavor to it that is actually quite tasty. The burritos are pretty large, too. They could easily be boxed up and saved for a second meal. Unfortunately, I'm not looking to gain my Freshman 15 back, so I have only eaten this once. Their salmon tacos are also a good choice, if you're looking for something lighter.

Now, I'm a college student. I almost eat out for my weekday lunch on the daily. Therefore, I strive to be cheap, but not dollar menu cheap. This place is kinda pricey if you go off their general menu and get a drink. Be prepared to pay $8-10 if you do. I usually go with their daily special, which usually comes around to a more reasonable $6-7, plus you get a drink with it. While their daily specials are not as tasty as their burritos, they get the job done for me.

Keep in mind that this place is right across the street from UNLV. It can get pretty packed over the lunch hour. I've seen the line go as far as reaching the front entrance (15 min wait). Just a tip.
