2 out of 5 star average rating and you think this location would try to step up their game!  We go to this location out of convenience  but tonight was the last straw. We always get the pork and more often than not the pork at this location tastes pretty bland and dry. Don't know if they've got the wrong recipe or what. They also seem to run out of things quite often. I'll be traveling a little further from now on if I ever need a cafe rio fix.
