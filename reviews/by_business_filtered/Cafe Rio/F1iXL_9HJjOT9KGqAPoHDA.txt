went to pick up when I got there they never place the order then they messed up the order one time and had to redo it and then realize they still messed up the order the second time had to wait about 30 minutes and my order still wasn't even right and the lady in the front was catching an attitude at first...food was good but not worth my time if that's how they treat customers and if they can't even get it right even the second time....pathetic
