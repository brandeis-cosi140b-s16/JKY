Went here for the first time last week and I am big on taco salads so that's what I got , very delish. The dressing is bomb and my chicken was really juicy, I had enough food to have lunch the next day. My husband got a carne asada burrito and it was gigantic. A little pricy but you get your money's worth with the amount of food you get. Check it out and see what you think!
