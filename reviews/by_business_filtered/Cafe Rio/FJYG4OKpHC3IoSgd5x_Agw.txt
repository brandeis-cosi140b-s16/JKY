Love this place, Always a pleasure going in. I love how everything is freshly made to order as you're in line. The queso and chips might be straight from heaven.  I took two of my buddies to cafe rio for their first trip (they're from back home) and they destroyed a couple burritos and raved about the flavor. 
Enchilada style is the way to go
