I used to eat at Cafe Rio in Gilbert Arizona when I lived out there.  This place rocks!

LOVE their sweet pork!  Get it in Tacos, Burrito, Salad, what ever great!

LOVE their chile con queso!  They give you a ton of chips with it.

Bottled Cokes from Mexico!!

This location was right across from UNLV so there are a ton of college students there which gave it a fun vibe.
