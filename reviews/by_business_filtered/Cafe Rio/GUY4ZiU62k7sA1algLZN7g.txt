I went to Cafe Rio (located in the same shopping center as Costco on Decatur) on a Friday afternoon, around 4pm. I flew into LV that morning and had just spent over three hours waiting at the DMV down the street, so I was really ready to eat anything. The restaurant has a pretty large space, but I feel like they really packed in the tables. Thank goodness it wasn't busy that afternoon. Since I was there during the day, there was a whole lot of natural light coming in through the windows, so it was nice and bright. The music was alright, but a little more solemn than I prefer, but whatevs. I honestly can't imagine being here late night if it's busy. It would probably be really crowded, dim and loud with all the chattering and the music.. 

There were a lot of drink choices (I just drank water, though): Strawberry lemonade, mint limeade, southwest limeade, and Horchata (which most people go crazy over). 

I ordered a sweet pork enchilada with medium hot sauce, black beans, tomatoes, lettuce and rice. The pork was too sweet. The medium sauce that came with my order was not hot at all and was totally masked by the sweetness of the pork. There were a lot of additional hot sauces available on the counter with the utensils and napkins. A LOT. I tried putting more on my enchilada, but I didn't taste a satisfying difference. 

The service and food prep was super fast. They put the meat on the enchilada, folded it, put sauce on top and threw on the beans, lettuce, tomatoes and rice. The add-ons were nice, but presentation could have been better. I mean, they literally just throw it in your tray. I didn't feel that the enchilada and the experience were worth the price I paid.
