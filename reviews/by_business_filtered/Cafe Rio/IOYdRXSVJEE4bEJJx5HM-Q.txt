YUM!!! From the outside, it looks like its a restaurant with waiter service from all the outdoor seating. My first time here I discovered that it was actually an order and sit down! I really enjoyed eating here. First of all, the sweet pork was SO delicious!! Flavorful, tender, and flat out delicious. I really like how when ordering, you watch everything that they put on or into whatever you are eating. When we ordered our nachos, they slapped on a ton of cheese and put it through the  toaster which I loved. some places give it to you where some of it still has cold cheese on it! I would totally come back to try the other things on the menu!
