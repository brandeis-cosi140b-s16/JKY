Looking for an authentic Enchilada but instead found an uncooked tortilla with stuff thrown in it and sauce literally slopped on top and on the sides of the to go bowl. Was rushed through the line, not allowed to ask questions or see the food on the line, made to feel dumb when looking for the hidden silverware tray... too bad
