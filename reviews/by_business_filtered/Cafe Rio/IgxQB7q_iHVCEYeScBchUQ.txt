I went in this place yesterday. As I was waiting in line I was just watching the workers on the line. And I noticed. The lady making the tortillas bend down touch the dirty water bucket with her gloves on then continue to make the tortillas and not even change her gloves. If that wasn't bad enough. I turned around to notice the other girl filling a take out order drop a receipt on the floor and reach down and pick it up off the floor with her gloves on then continue to make the take out order without taking off those gloves after touching the dirty floor. I then pulled the manager aside and who came over was a teenage boy that said he was a manager but I was sure he was not. After telling him what I witness and I didn't want to make a scene since there was a line full of customers. He didn't seem to care what I had to say. Seems to me that the ppl that work here don't care about cleanliness .. Totally grossed out and I hope the health dept catches up to them soon so then maybe they will take it seriously.
