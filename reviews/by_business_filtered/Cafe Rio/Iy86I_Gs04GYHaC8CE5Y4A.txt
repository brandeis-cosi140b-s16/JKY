Let me start off by saying I love cafe rio. Most of the locations I've been to, especially the one near UNLV and the one on eastern, have always been good. This is my second time here at this location and I will never come back to this place. 

Reason why is because when I tried to order my usual salad, they weren't able to put the coconut shrimp on it because they could only put that on tacos. Honestly, it's not a big deal to me. But when you tell me it's against the policy to put shrimp in a non taco form even when I INSISTED on paying for it on the side.. That's so freaking absurd!! I've been and dined in cafe rio plenty of times and not once have I heard of this kind of policy! There were no signs indicating it at all. When I couldn't get my coconut shrimp, I asked for steak.. Then they told me it wasn't ready and they still have to cook it. There were no people at the restaurant and you still have to prepare steak?  After 7-8 minutes, I finally received my salad. The staff, overall, looked so dumbfounded besides the cashier. She was nice lol. 

Ugh I don't know about you guys but based on the reviews here as well, this location is a joke. You're better off going to the Robertos across the street.
