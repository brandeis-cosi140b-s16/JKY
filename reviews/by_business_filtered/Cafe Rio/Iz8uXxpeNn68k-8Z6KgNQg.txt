Really like this cafe rio. Went for lunch on a thursday a little after noon. Me and a buddy just beat the noon rush by about 5 minutes. I got the barbacoa pork nachos and the sweetness of the pork is perfect with the hotness of the hot sauce. It's a big meal so bring your appetite. This location is consistent with the other two locations I frequent, the one on Blue Diamond and Decatur, and the one on Eastern just north of Silv Ranch. Everything has been great at all of the locations, this one was just convenient to where I happened to be. 

It's a solid price for the amount of food and the location and service was spot on.
4 solid stars. Need to try their steak burrito, enchilada style and make sure it compares to the other locations.
