Stopped by this place in Vegas when I was out at EDC.  Decent Mexican food in the middle of the desert.  I got the chicken tacos and all of them were pretty good.  You get a plate of beans, rice, and your food from this place for ~$6.  

A bright spot about this place - they messed up my order when I got here because I asked for just the chicken tacos but they gave me something else (I think it was steak instead).  They were so nice to me about fixing my order - they gave me the correct food and threw in beans/rice for free.  I'm always a fan of great customer service and free things, so when you throw in both I'm a happy camper and generous with my stars.

Definitely check this place out if you're in Vegas!
