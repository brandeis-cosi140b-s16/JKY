I came here back in 2013, was not that impressed so I decided to give it another chance with the BOGO coupon they have. They must not pay the staff very much because they all seemed really miserable, it was not even that busy. I wanted a chicken burrito with chicken, beans, rice, guac, cheese and salsa. I had to ask them to reopen the burrito to put in the salsa and guac since the guy wrapped up the burrito before I had a chance to ask him to add it in. The food did not even taste that good. I guess I should stick with Chipotle. I miss San Francisco and the mission style burritos...
