Overall the food is pretty good, and definitely fresh. As a first timer I wasn't sure what to expect but I was satisfied with the quality of the food. The only problems were being rushed. I'd say there were 5 people in front of us. I dont coinsider that a lot, but the way they rushed us through the line, I guess the employees do. I ordered the chicken enchiladas. Delicious but since I was rushed and didnt understand how they organize the line I didnt get all the toppings I wanted. And the enchiladas were served in a foil tray with beans and rice. When I asked for black beans, I didnt realize they weren't going to strain the juice, so I eneded up with kind of a soupy mess that made the enchiladas soggy. But the chicken was really good and the veggies very fresh. I'd give it another go.
