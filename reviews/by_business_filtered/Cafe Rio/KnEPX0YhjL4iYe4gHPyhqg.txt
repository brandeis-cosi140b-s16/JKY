I heart this place!

Want freshly soft flour tortillas? This is the place!
Try their grilled chicken salad with their house dressing! To die for! Salad is laid into a cheesy giant soft tortilla shell...sooooo good!

Let me tell you their chicken soup is the yummiest ever! Big chunks of shredded chicken breast...tasty...perfect and hits the spot on a cold day!
