What's the deal with Cafe Rio? I asked myself this question many times as I whizzed by this little Mexican joint on Maryland Parkway in the heart of the University district. I was always on my way to Einstein's or Chipotle (which are both in the same general area). I let my curiosity get the best of me one day and asked a friend to meet me there for a quick lunch get together. I wish I had picked somewhere else to go.

So, the decor has little to offer, it's dark lighting inside was actually quite off-putting to me. As I approached the menu, all I could say was "meh" Minus their "award winning" pork the menu seemed same-ol, same-ol. 

The place definitely wasn't packed, so I was wondering where are all these people who say this place is SO-O great? Anyway, I ordered two tacos, one pork, one chicken. My friend opted for a salad. The tacos were soggy - I couldn't believe how quickly they just dispersed juice down my arm as I tried to eat them. As for the taste - the chicken was okay, the pork - better, but nothing I can rave over.

I'm guessing this place being so close to university gets great reviews from students. I can say I did enjoy the way they heated the tortillas. However, I'd just rather have Chipotle and I doubt I'll be returning to Cafe Rio any time soon.
