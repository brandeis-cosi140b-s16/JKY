I've been here a few times recently and every time it's been a similar story. Before I get into that, I'll say that I personally prefer Costa Vida to Cafe Rio (they're sister companies) but that's more of a loyalty thing than anything else.

The food is good. The pork is amazing, everything tastes fresh, the tortillas are homemade. All positive things.

The service at this location leaves something to be desired. It's not that the employees are necessarily rude, but their English is difficult to understand. Normally I wouldn't complain about this at all, but 50% of the reason for this is that the barrier between the employees and customers is RIDICULOUSLY high. I'm an average height and I have to stand on my tiptoes to communicate with the employees. That's not alright and it needs to be changed. If that small detail was changed I think the whole experience would be significantly better because we wouldn't have to repeat ourselves (both customers and employees) like ten times to be understood.
