This was my second visit to a Cafe Rio in the last week.  Both locations, LV and Cedar City, UT, had a clueless staff.  Really, a total disaster, except for one individual at the Cedar City location, who actually cared enough to make sure we finally received our food.  

I thought I'd give them another chance at a different location (this LV location) and found very similar results - bland, over-sauced, overly sweet, zero-heat (both senses of the word), lack of organization, incorrectly charged, clueless and careless staff.  I'd go to Chipotle any day over Cafe Rio.  And yes, the wait time was horrible at 7:30pm on a Sunday.
