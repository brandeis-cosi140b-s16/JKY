Rio is really really good. I came here on a lunch break one sunny afternoon and this place might be my go-to lunch break place from now on. I had the barbacoa burrito. I can see why it's award winning and everyone loves; however, I felt it was a little too sweet for me. It was still a really good burrito, though. I especially like that they put some cheese on the top of the burrito and melted it.

The ambiance, the service and the food all make for an enjoyable lunch. Next time I'm trying the steak. It looked delicious!
