My family just moved here from Denver and have always enjoyed Cafe Rio.  Our only complaint with the chain has always been the rush the employees seem to be in.  They need to understand the difference between fast service and rushed service.  They seem to be preparing our food as if they know how we want it.  When we stray from the norm, it usually ends up in an incorrect order and some sort of attitude.  Until now the quality of the food outweighed the poor service.  The Gilbert location is out of control!  The poor attitude and lack of customer service and language barrier has changed our outlook on cafe rio.  Chipotle here we come!
