Congratulations on providing the WORST customer service experience. This store location is the the weakest link of all chains! The workers need to learn the basics: listening skills, responding properly to customers, avoid talking about personal life in the presence of customers. Perhaps others stores can teach these workers how to speed things up and bring in quality customer service. 

This experience proves: In order to have a truly successful business, one must have more than great food. Cafe Rio please step up your game! You are the closest store to my home. I wish the store manager would get it together and reconstruct the business because as of today you are selling yourself short! Cafe Rio has freshly made GOOD food! They make handmade tortillas on a daily bases. They are AWESOME but it's unfortunate this particular store is turning fans away.
