I came here to get take out. I was pretty appalled by how rude the check out girl was. I gave her my card, she swiped it and handed it back. No have a nice day, anything else?, ect. I stood there a minute unsure if she needed me to sign a copy. She made me feel really unwelcome especially when she saw me not leaving she said "do u need something"? Such an awkward transaction.
