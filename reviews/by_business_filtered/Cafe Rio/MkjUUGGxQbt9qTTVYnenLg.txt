I have eaten at Cafe Rio probablly 25 times and usually enjoy it but I'm never going back.  The last 2 times I've gone they've messed-up my order (and refused to correct it) and overcharged me both times.  I usually order the pork burrito, not enchalada style, and no extra cheese (each costs extra BTW and they usually don't inform people).  

When they accidently put cheese on it they said sorry but charged me anyways.  When I complained they said they would have to fully refund my money and send me back to the beginning of the line to start over.  The line was like 10 minutes long, so I paid the extra $$$ and now I'm making this post..grrrr

Also my sister ordered a salad to go for lunch.  When she got back to her office she realized they didn't put any dressing in the bag.  So she had to drive back and ask for a dressing cup (WHICH THEY CHARGED HER FOR)...At $8-10 for lunch they could be a little more careful about how they take care of people.
