I tend to make hipster choices when it comes to my food: the more obscure, the better. It's this reasoning that always made me inclined to dislike Cafe Rio. "Bleh, another Mexican chain? Psh, be more original!"

Then I had the Barbacoa tostada. Holy crap, I wanted to punch myself for such hipster tendencies. Moist, flavorful, and mass quantities for only six bucks? I am so sorry I doubted you Cafe Rio. You can't go wrong with a tortilla smothered in beans, rice, slow-cooked pork, lettuce, cotija cheese, tortilla strips, and a creamy tomatillo sauce. The tostada resembles a salad more so than its namesake, and honestly, by the time I got to the tortilla, it was so soaked I just tossed it. But everyone's right, the barbacoa is the way to go - at times I'd catch my friend glancing at my pork enviously in between bites of her inferior chicken.
