Love, Love, Love Cafe Rio.  Hands down best casual mexican food in the southwest.  I love that kids under 6 get free quesadillas.  All tortillas made fresh and they have so many options.  I love their tortilla soup, made fresh so you can choose your ingredients.  I have always had great customer service there, the only complaint is sometimes the lines are crazy, but how can you fault a business for being successful.  I go there a couple times a month, and the fact they have a loyalty punch card is even better!
