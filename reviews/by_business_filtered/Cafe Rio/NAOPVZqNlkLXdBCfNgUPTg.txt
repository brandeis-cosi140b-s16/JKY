Cafe Rio...First of all I would like to say that I do not typically leave reviews. Waaaaay overpriced for the amount of food that they give you! We paid $37 for 4 burritos and drinks. Could have had burritos at Los Fav's on Cooper & Ray for half the price! The girl making the food was trying to rush us when there wasn't anyone else in line. We asked for shredded beef & they said we would have to wait an additional 15 for it to be cooked. Shouldn't they have this type of food available and ready if it's on the menu? They could have at least dried off the trays before putting all of our food on em & serving us. Two employees were throwing water bottles at each other in the dining area where the customers eat. Very unprofessional!! Extremely dissatisfied!! We will never return here!!!
