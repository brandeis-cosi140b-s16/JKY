The management in this place must be horrendous. Every employee in the place seemed miserable, none of them even so much as smiled. I had to tell three different people which order was mine and they still managed to ignore me when I said i wanted pico. They were also out of corn tortillas so the only option for my enchiladas was flour. The guy that prepared my food hooked it up with the chile roast beef, otherwise I would have only given one star.
