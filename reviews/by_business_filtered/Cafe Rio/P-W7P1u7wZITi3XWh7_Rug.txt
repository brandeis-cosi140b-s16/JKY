The shredded chicken salad is my go-to meal after a long day of work when I'm too lazy to cook. They are very generous with the serving size so it always lasts me 2-3 meals and actually stays fresh. Their house dressing is AMAZING. 

During peak lunch/dinner times it can get pretty crowded and I've had to wait in line for a while sometimes. But the staff works quickly and they usually get the line moving.
