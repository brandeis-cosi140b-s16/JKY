Stood at the door, thinking we were going to be seated... but boy was I wrong. Luckily the server was nice enough to question if it was my first time and directed us to the ordering line. 

Ordered a burrito and some nachos, which were delicious and were even put in the oven to heat up even more. Their foods are flavorful and the selection of additional "hot sauces" was a very nice touch. 

Will definitely be back, but probably with a few friends since my bf and I couldn't finish either.
