My husband seriously loves this place (I'm more of Chipotle fan). The food is good and prepared fairly quickly. The burritos are good and the salads are good (both dressings are amazing). My 2-year old gets a free quesadilla when we eat here which is cool. 

I did take off a star because, IMO, the price is way too high. We can't seem to come here without spending $30+. (The salad is more expensive than the burrito or the tacos or pretty much anything else on the menu...which is crazy. Really? It's lettuce. Costco sells it in bulk for less than $2.)

That's the only thing that keeps my husband from eating here weekly. Otherwise, pretty good for fast food.
