Do not go here for late night dinner hours. They stay open until 11pm on Fridays and Saturdays however, I went around 10:15pm, and by then they had stopped making any type of fresh food.  
The beans were being scraped from the bottom of the tin and there was little to no guacamole; so the worker pulled a tin of turned-brown guacamole from the fridge storage and tried to scrape the brown part off the top and mix it with what was left and then added a little salsa for some sort of half-assed leftovers. By the time I'd seen the "guacamole" she was going to give me I was about ready to leave but just declined it altogether. (And they still had 45 minutes of service left.) 

Dear Cafe Rio, 
Don't stay open late if you can't serve your customers the same as if they had been there at 5pm (which I have several times before). My late night meal was not "a masterpiece."

I'll be going to Zaba's or Chipotle for a freshly made late night dinner from now on.
