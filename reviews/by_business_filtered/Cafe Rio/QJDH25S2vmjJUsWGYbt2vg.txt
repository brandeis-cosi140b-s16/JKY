This location is BLAH!  I usually go to the Eastern & Richmar location but we were on this side of town and I was craving Cafe Rio. The long line didn't bother me because I'm used to it but... 

1. The employees here are not friendly at all. They do not smile. They do not greet you. The shift manager's (Stephanie) attitude showed she hated her job! She was the 2nd person on the line that adds lettuce, pico, etc. She wasn't listening to what me & my husband was telling her. She had no care in the world how she was treating everyone's food. Very sloppy. 

2. Food quality - THUMBS DOWN! They served dead lettuce. I ordered the tamales and the guy served me a crumbled - into pieces- broken tamales. If my husband didn't ask for a new one, he would of just sold it to me like that. It broke into pieces because it was DRY. 

AND THEY CAN OUT OF PICO AT 7:30 PM - during a busy dinner service! OMG!

What a shame! This location needs revamping in their food quality and their attitudes. We won't be going to this location ever.
