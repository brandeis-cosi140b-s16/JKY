I'm actually surprised this doesn't have a higher overall rating. The food is very good and prepared quickly. It has to be at least as healthy as Chipotle but still offer options of a quesadilla or nachos. the staff is always friendly and helpful, and they seem to get you on your way relatively fast regardless of the size of the line. And with their punch cards you get every 10th meal free
