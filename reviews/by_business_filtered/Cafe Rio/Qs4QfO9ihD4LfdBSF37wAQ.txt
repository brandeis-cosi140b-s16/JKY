I love their fresh made tortillas. But so do lots of others, so darn disappointed that it's so popular I have to wait in line. I don't frequent chain restaurants very often, preferring locally owned businesses, but I'm glad to know that when I need some freshly prepared food, Cafe Rio is there. Bonus that they give the frequent diner card without being asked & that it is a stamp per meal, not visit even when ordering 4 meals like some restaurants.
