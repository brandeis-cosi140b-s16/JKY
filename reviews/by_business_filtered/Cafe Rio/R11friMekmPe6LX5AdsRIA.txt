Been coming to cafe rio for awesome fast Mexican food for years. Lived in Utah for a while...just like you Camilla k. I loved the ones in Utah and thought I would give this one a chance. The manager guy, don't know his name, is a total jerk. The food wasn't even warm. It was cold. My wife and I are sitting here right now and I'm so upset that I have to leave this review right now. Just awful service and not even good food anymore. Gradually getting worse. I'm going to costa vida from now on.
