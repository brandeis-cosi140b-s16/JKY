I so badly want to give this place 5 stars. I LOVE the food, if this review was based solely on food it would get 5 stars no questions asked. But unfortunately I have received awful service 2 out of 3 times I've been to this location. 

The first two times I came to this particular cafe rio I wanted to call corporate and complain, but I am not one of those people. I even delayed writing a Yelp review because I didn't want to be one of those 1 star complainers so I left it alone. 

After the first two awful visits I swore I would NEVER come back to this location. However, I work literally across the street and was craving their coconut shrimp tacos. So here I found myself giving this cafe rio one more try. It was afternoon and heavily busy but I was pleasantly surprised to see they added exactly what I wanted (coconut shrimp tacos) on the menu full time instead of them just being available once a week. So much win. Line went by quick. Customer service was great, food was even greater. 

I will visit this location again and hopefully can receive the same great customer service I did yesterday. :)
