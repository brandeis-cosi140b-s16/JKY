I'm not going to deny one bit, the food was pretty good. I got the barbacoa burrito and the meat was really tender and sweet. Nothing was too dry, but that could also be the result of the wet beans and sauce they put in the burrito. The problem with that is that you cannot pick up the burrito and eat it with your hands, you're going to need a knife and fork. That was one downside of the food and it's not one of the cheaper places either. 

The food is quite pricy for the amount that is given. Chipotle is slightly cheaper and quite similar. That being the first time i went to Cafe Rio, they knew i was a beginner and asked tricky questions. When you order, they ask after they form your burrito if you want it enchilada style. I said no as well as my friend behind me and they did it with his and they charge you .95 cents more for it! Is it really worth it? i highly doubt it especially since it's just sauce and cheese. They don't even tell you these things cost more money, they just ask you and make you fall into their trap. Tricky people.

Bottom line, food is good, kind of pricy, and the people are tricky. Not an everyday kind of place if you don't have the money to spend and it's not so bad if you know the menu and style of the place and how you order food.
