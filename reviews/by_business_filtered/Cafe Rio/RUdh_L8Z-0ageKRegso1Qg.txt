To begin, we waited in line for about 10-15 minutes.  Then, we yelled at the people prepping our food to order.  After ordering, the preppers grabbed cold food and stuck it in a foil tin (all running together), and ran it through an oven before setting it down in front of the cash register.   After paying, we sat down to eat.  My food was very cold in places (unmelted cheese); the cilantro-lemon rice was gross, and the pinto beans were all over everything else on my tin.
