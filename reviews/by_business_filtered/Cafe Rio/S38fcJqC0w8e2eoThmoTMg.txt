do NOT order online or call for pick up! This is the 3rd time that I've placed an order in the morning for afternoon pick up and it is neveR ready on time.  20 or 30 minutes after scheduled pick up time is ridiculous (and it's like that each time!)
I know it's busy but that's why I am prepared and place the order in advance so they have time to prepare and have our order ready...unfortunately they don't prioritize or organize their "pick up" orders. I've waited longer than customers that are just walking in to order. 
I have scheduled meetings and for that reason I order online 3-4 hours ahead....well I used to, too many other choices to deal with this chaos again.
