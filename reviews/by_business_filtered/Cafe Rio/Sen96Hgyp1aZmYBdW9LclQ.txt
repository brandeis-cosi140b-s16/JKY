The best thing about this place is how fresh everything tastes.  As others have mentioned the handmade tortillas are excellent but over many visits I have always come away impressed by the quality of all the ingredients they put into their dishes.

I usually get the tacos with either roast beef or salmon and both are very tasty.  Make sure to ask for some extra house sauce on the side (as they usually only serve it with certain dishes) because it tastes good on just about anything.

Prices are higher than your typical fast food mexican place, but you can taste the difference and tacos are very filling for what you pay.
