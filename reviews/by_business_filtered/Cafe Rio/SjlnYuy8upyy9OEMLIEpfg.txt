This is my third time here at this location and still I don't like the service here. I know they are busy, but they don't have to throw the food at you. Literally, almost went off the counter. I asked to a frequent stamp card which I use at other locations. They ran out so no stamp card for three meals. I think sometimes this place is overrated! I'm done.
