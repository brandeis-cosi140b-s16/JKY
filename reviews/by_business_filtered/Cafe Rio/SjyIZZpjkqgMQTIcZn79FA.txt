Hmm after reading all the reviews I figured I'd give this place a try.

I won't be going back, I ordered the chile roast beef enchilada style the rice and meat taste as if it's not fresh but frozen and lacks any taste. We also ordered the sweet pork barbacoa burrito and I was told it was like eating a sweet potato 

I was supposed to receive a free drink yet I still got charged for it, and the drink itself the mint lime aid ehh what a joke.

They get 1 star for effort, so in closing I'm gonna say this is frozen meets fresh veggies
