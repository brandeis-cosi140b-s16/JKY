Love their food! I'm a creature of habit so I always go with the Sweet Pork Tostada with the house dressing. It never disappoints! I also love their selection of hot sauces, there's literally at least 20 different types. 

The only complaint I have about this location is their speed, the line always takes FOREVER. I never understand this since it's an order as you go type place, but oh well I can deal with it for the sake of the taste.
