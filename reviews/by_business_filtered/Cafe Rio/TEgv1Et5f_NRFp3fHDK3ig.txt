Had one of their special Chile Rellenos the other day.... it was HORRIBLE!!!!! First, it was stuffed with sweet meat of some kind with an unpleasant texture, the breading was badly made and very spotty, not well covered at all, then I requested their Spicy Salsa and it was sweet as well (what gives?!?!) BUT the worst part of the whole thing was that the chiles were not deseeded so you got a mouthfull of seeds in every bite. VERY BAD!!!!!!
On the side I had some Uncle Ben's Rice which was cold. I'm sorry but this was a terrible meal and I don't know how Cafe Rio gets away with stuff like this, I realize this is not Mexican Food but Tex Mex, but even then there are good meals to be had just not here.
