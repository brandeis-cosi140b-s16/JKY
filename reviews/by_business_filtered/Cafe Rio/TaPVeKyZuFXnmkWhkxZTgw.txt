Let's not kid ourselves-- this isn't the most authentic Mexican food available. However, the food is fresh, fast, and delicious.

I have tried the tacos, burritos, salad, and quesadillas.  For my money, I think the Cafe Rio salad with Chile Roast Beef is the best bet. My wife usually orders the pork burrito with an extra side of tortillas to soak up the flavorful juices that are left. 

I am most impressed with how the restaurant handles orders in an efficient manner.  No matter how busy the place is, you can get your food relatively quickly. 

I would like more spicy options, but that is just a personal preference. Move over Chipotle, I have found a better option.
