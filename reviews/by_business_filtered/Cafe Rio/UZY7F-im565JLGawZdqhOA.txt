Currently:

Sitting at my desk pouting because all day I was craving Mexican food and when everyone decided we were going to order from here for lunch I was so excited!! Unitil I got my burrito and took that first devastating bite...

I got the Pork burrito and it was absolutely disgusting. Like wow. Im so grossed out right now...

Instead of the beautiful blend of Mexican spices and flavors I got a sickly sweet burrito mess.

Now it could just be me. If you like really sweet burritos than this might be your thing. Its definitely not mine and i will sadly not be returning.

I knew we shouldve ordered from Chipotle...

*Insert sad face here*
