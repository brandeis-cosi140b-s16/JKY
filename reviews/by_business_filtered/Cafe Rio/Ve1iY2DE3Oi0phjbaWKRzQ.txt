Great food, poor front line management. Second time we have been here and the cashier (same both times, very tall) is incredibly slow. The food is excellent and prepared to perfection by everyone else! However food took twice as long because of the incompetency of the cashier!!!  Should be five star but the cashier ruined it!!!
