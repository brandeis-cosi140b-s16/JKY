Really like this place.  Very relaxed, food is delicious, and the price is spot on.  I usually get the salad with grilled chicken, black beans, no rice and salsa verde (you will notice a them with me and Mexican food).  Usually runs me about $10 and it can fill me up for two meals.  

Do yourself a favor - if you're taking it to go, call it in or order online.  The line can get a little nutty.  Overall it's a great restaurant, with food that is consistently good at a decent price point.  It's good for lunch or dinner or dinner if you can't finish your lunch.

Gonna go get a salad now... craving one.
