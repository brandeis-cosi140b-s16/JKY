Cafe Rio is one of my favorite Mexican fast food spots.  The portions are large and food is great.  I highly recommend the steak or chicken salads!

A few unusually nice things about Cafe Rio is that they give a free kid's cheese crisp with an adult purchase.  My only complaint is that all they have is a small cheese crisp for a kid's menu.  They also do not have any desserts on the menu.  

Their prices range from $5 - 8 per item.
