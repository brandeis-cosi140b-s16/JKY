It pains me to write this review because Cafe Rio is my absolute favorite burrito, BUT I must warn you to stay on them. 

I have ordered the same thing for several years, a burrito with hot sauce.  This most recent time in, I noticed as they were pouring it, it looked more orange when it's typically red. 

After the first bite I knew something was off.

I asked the cashier who then looked at the sauce and also noted it looking thinner than normal, so she asked the chef. 

The response she came back with was that they were low on that salsa, so they had watered it down to stretch it out!! 

Truthfully, it would have been better practice to probably run out of it as opposed to making burritos for customers that either get thrown away or refunded AND thrown away. 

The burritos are normally delicious.  Just be on your guard.
