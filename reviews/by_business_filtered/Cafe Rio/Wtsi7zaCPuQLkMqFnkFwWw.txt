I went here for the first time on a weekday night with some friends. We had a large group, but even so, the wait was already quite long.

Going through the line, three different employees had to ask which order was mine. It just seemed disorganized. The employee who handled most of my order clearly did not know the menu and did not include most of what was supposed to be included with the item. I had to go back to the register twice to ask for missing items. However, when we asked for extra salsa, they kindly gave it to us at no extra charge.

The place was clean and stocked when I was there. There is plenty of space to eat, both inside and outside. The atmosphere was pleasant. It is in a not-so-great area of town, but we are all university students, so the location is great for us.

The food was very good. Their recipes for their meat are amazing! Most of the people I was with ordered some form of the barbacoa meat, which we all loved.

Overall, I liked this place and would return.
