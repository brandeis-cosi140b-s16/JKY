Really--don't bother.  With all the other Mexican restaurants nearby, don't waste your time here.  Unless you just are in a rush for cheap eats with a half a dozen kids in tow.  But still, there are so many other options nearby.

I went here as I had a gift card.  I asked for veggie quesadilla.  The sign said it came with "extra beans and rice".  The girl at the serving line asked if I wanted the rice and beans in the quesa.  I said "on the side."  She said that the next people on the line would take care of it.

I had a choice of other things to go with it.  I said lettuce and guac.  They didn't mention rice and beans.  I waited 5 minutes for the cashier to show up and cash me out.  F-cking food was growing cold as I waited.  Finally I got my drink cup from her and cashed out.  Gift card paid for most of my meal.  I got a mint limeade for a drink. Turned out to be the best part of the meal.

I ate the quesadilla...fairly flavorless except for the hot sauce I added.  The lettuce on the side looked tired.  Guac was just ok...not much flavor there either.  Then I remembered I never got any rice or beans.  By then, I just didn't care.  I finished my quesa and bolted.  I swear, you can get a better meal at Chipotle's.
