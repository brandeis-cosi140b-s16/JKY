Several co-workers recommended Cafe Rio and we had to try it.  We arrived at 6:15pm on a Tuesday and it was a zoo.  3 kids collided with us before we even got in line and the sound level from screaming children was deafening.  We ordered in the swarming, rushed line of patrons where a burrito and drink cost $13 served in a foil tin on a tray that was soaking hot wet straight out of the dishwasher.  Clean tables were nowhere to be found and we bussed one ourselves to make a space to sit.  Food was tasty and spiced well, beans not overcooked but OMG what a horrid dining experience.  Taco Bell is more civilized and a cleaner place than this. Never again, there are plenty of places that are Mexican restaurants charging the same but are not disguised as day care centers.  Never again!
