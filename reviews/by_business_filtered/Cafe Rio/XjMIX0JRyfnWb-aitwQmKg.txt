Wow, this is way better than chipotle and I love how they have daily specials minus Sundays.  Food has better quality based on the salads I've received not to mention their portion is better sizing than chipotle.  They also have a great soda station including 3 different teas along with special beverages like horchata.  You can get creative with the flavor pumps to add to your soda with selections like pomegranate.  They have a cornucopia of hot sauces too.  For $5.75, you can get a tostada salad with either pork barbocoa or pulled chicken or on wednesdays, throw in a drink as a combo with the chicken for $.50 more...you can't beat that.
