3 stars cause the food is really good but this location has some issues. Consistently out of either ice , their fountain drinks, and today I got 5 bucks back in quarters,dimes , and nickels. No big deal on the change but was also out of a lot of their hot sauces they are known for. I love the fact they offer unique fountain drinks and hot sauces but damn, they can't keep it stocked it seems. Food is consistently good if not excellent.
