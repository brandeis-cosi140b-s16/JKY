The chicken quesedilla with guacamole and sour cream and salsa on the side is my favorite.  I am hooked on it, as their tortillas are so fresh - they are made on the spot, as well as the grilled meat.  Also, I have tried the grilled chicken salad, which is very tasty, with an unfried tortilla at the bottom.  Try it just for the tortilla!

5-19-13 I was craving Mexican after having Frank and Fina's and remembered Cafe Rio. The pulled chicken quesadilla was calling my name!  I opted for the wheat tortilla, quite tasty, this time, and asked for an extra guacamole instead of sour cream.  I had half and it was fantastic!  The only thing that holds back the five star rating for this location is that the cashier is not paying attention and almost did not include my pico de gallo after pointing it out to her, and grabbing it for myself!  All in all a good fast food Mexican place.
