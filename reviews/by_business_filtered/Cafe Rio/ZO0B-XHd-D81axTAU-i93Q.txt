Great regional chain spot, it's always a good lunch spot.  This particular location recently went through a remodel and is a lot larger and service is a bit quicker now.  The lunch line can get pretty long here though, so be prepared but it usually moves pretty fast.

The food is decent, my two favorite things here are the shredded chicken salad with the house creamy dressing and also the chicken burrito enchilada style!  Both are very tasty and the ingredients are consistent everytime I come here.  The enchiladas aren't too bad either.
