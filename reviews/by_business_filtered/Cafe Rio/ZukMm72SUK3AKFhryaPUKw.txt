I love the food at Cafe Rio...but the customer service at this location is ALWAYS awful. 2 or 3 people on the line, 5 or more people prepping, but no one jumps in to make the food prep more efficient or quicker. I'm sorry but I'm over the poor attention at this location, this company should be ashamed of their customer service. Shame on you.
