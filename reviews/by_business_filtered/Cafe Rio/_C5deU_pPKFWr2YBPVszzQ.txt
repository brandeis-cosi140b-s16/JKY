I've been to this Cafe Rio location once. My cousin worked at the University at the time and it turned out to be the perfect place to meet up for lunch, especially since I'm a big fan and she had never tried it before.

As always, I ordered a burrito with enchilada sauce. I always mull over their menu looking for something new to try. When crunch time arrives, I seem to find myself settling for that. Settling is not quite the right word, though, because it is always delicious and satisfying.
