Watch them like a hawk when they ring you up.  

Food gets 4 stars, but I was overcharged here.  Not worth my time to battle a few dollars, but they staff is great at adding extra costs for the add ons.  And they don't tell you!

I was ordering food to go and had them put the salad dressing on the side.  I asked for both because I didn't know which would be best.  They charged me for 3!  I would be fine with an extra charge or 2 but I'm not sure how they counted 3.  I noticed they've done this to other people.  I've been several times and this doesn't happen much but it happens more often here than anywhere else.  

I guess nothing comes free for here...
