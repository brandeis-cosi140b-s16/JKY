Fire the store manager immediately! Went in at 6pm on a Friday- I understand it's going to be busy, after about a 15 minute wait to get our food- there was a 10 minute wait to pay! There was 1 group of people in front of me. The employees cannot handle any sort of group of people! New flash- there are 3 registers- why they don't use all 3 when the dinner crowd is beyond me! This group of 3 people held up the entire line to the point where everyone's food got cold- people where beside themselves angry!! 

Then we sit down to find there is NO ICE- multiple people complained to the staff, and NO ONE tended to it. It took us 30 minutes to eat and the ice was still not filled, so thanks for the warm soda!  There were also no forks, it took 7 people asking for forks to get someone to come out and restock them!! 

I will never go back, this location needs to clean house- hire an entire new staff!!
