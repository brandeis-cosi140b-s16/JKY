I went into this location for dinner at 6:15 pm. The place was busy and there was a line. I hadn't eaten and even though I felt like leaving, I stayed. After waiting in line  for 8-10  minutes, it was my time to order. I placed my order for a steak salad and was immediately told they were out of steak and it would be at least 10 minutes before they would have some. Really? Out of steak, at a Mexican restaurant, at dinner time. This is the 2nd time this has happened to me; the previous time was lunchtime. 
A manager or supervisor should really explain to their employees how to prepare for rush hour  and to make sure this doesn't happen. I can honestly say this has never happened at Saba's or Chipotle! 
It will be a long time before I go back to this location.
