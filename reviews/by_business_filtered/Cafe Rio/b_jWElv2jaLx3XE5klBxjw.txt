I don't even know why i would give this place more than one star, because it's got to be the worst cafe Rio in town...almost always they get something in my order wrong...the last time I was here I got the quesadilla...while it tasted fine, it was poorly 'constructed' I mean there was barely any cheese in there and the steak was all clumped up in the same area...and the worker doing the griddle for the quesadilla just seemed like she didn't wanna be there the way she was making the food, she was even mean to her own co-workers, with a 'don't talk to me' attitude towards them...better find another cafe Rio if you're around this area
