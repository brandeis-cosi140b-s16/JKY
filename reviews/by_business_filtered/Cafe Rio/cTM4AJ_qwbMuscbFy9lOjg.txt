Place is consistent at being just awful! You would think free lunch at work and id be a happy camper but they always get the order wrong and the food is either dry or hard or both.  Beans and rice were dry as dirt and the nachos had little to no cheese. Food just rolls around the mouth looking for moisture. Id choke on the beans if i didnt have a water bottle at the ready. On this run I ordered a steak enchiladas with corn tortillas and got chicken on flour tortillas. What the hell!! Next time ill just tell them to surprise me! Why bother ordering if the whole order is wrong. Their green chili also has a gelatinous texture which causes concern. 

I hate when work brings up cafe rio and would prefer the local taco shops next to this dump. Hell ill take el pollo loco or robertos next to this.
