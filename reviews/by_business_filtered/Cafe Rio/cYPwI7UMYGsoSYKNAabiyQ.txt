Loved loved loved the fresh tortillas! 

I had the grilled chicken tacos with pico de gallo & lettuce, side of black beans, no cheese. Lots of flavor going on here! 
Hubby had the pork tamale special & it was moist and scrumptious !!

My drink was the limeade with Jamaican flowers. Yum.

Will definitely return! I want to try the shrimp tacos special on Saturdays.
