CUSTOMER SERVICE NEEDS A LOT OF HELP!!!!

Customer service is a nightmare and Managers need to focus on there performance. I am not a complainer but when your online orders consistanly are wrong and when told to call an order in from now on and then they constatnly hang up on you then you are forced to find another place to eat. 

Food is great but they have to seriously work on customer service!! 

Cafe Rio has lost our loyalty!
