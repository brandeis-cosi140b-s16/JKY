Love coming here on a Sunday evening after a long weekend camping...No dinner to cook, the kids are fed and the other half of the burrito is tomorrow's lunch for everyone!
Woo hoo!  We like the pork barbacoa  with hot sauce and black beans or pinto and the vegetarian burrito with black beans and mild sauce :-)  The service has never disappointed us.
