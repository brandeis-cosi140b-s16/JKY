Absolutely bewildered at the high ratings for these places across the valley. Wife and I decided to pick up some food from the Blue Diamond location because our new favourite for "quick and honest" Mexican fare, Phat Phranks, is closed on weekends.

As I watched them build my burritos my heart sank and I knew I wasn't going to be in for a pleasant experience. The meat was wet, beans were swimming in goo and the tortillas split from the wetness as they wrapped it. My wife's bean and cheese burrito was even worse - 48.5% rice, 48.5% wet beans, 1% of a tiny sprinkle of cheese.

When we went to eat our meals the burritos were predictably soggy, vaguely unpleasant tasting -- revolting beans -- and generally yucky. I found it just edible and would rate the place 1 and a half stars overall, rounding down because it's a bit overpriced and I just didn't enjoy the taste.
