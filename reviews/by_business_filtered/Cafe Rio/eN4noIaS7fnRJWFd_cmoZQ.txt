This is a nice alternative to Chipotle. Fresh ingredients and the expansive drink selection includes Strawberry Lemonade, Mint Limeade, Horchata, and three varieties of ice tea with a line of flavored simple syrups you can pump in. This drink bar is one of the reasons I will come back; it offers unsweetened passion fruit iced tea (china mist brand) which is difficult to find beyond Panda Express. I love it!

Hubby had the burrito. It is standard practice for them to put the lettuce and pico on the side, which means he made a mess opening it up to put it into the burrito afterwards. I shouted my order on my tip-toes since the sneeze guard is really tall (hate that). I had salmon tacos - correction, salmon TACO. I was nervous because I ordered a SINGLE taco with a side of rice and beans, but it was plenty to fill me. The 4 or 5 ingredient dish was deliciously simple. 

The patio outside needed some minor TLC to clean up the bird poop and paint the scraped railings, but indoors was very clean - with exception to the bathrooms. Pretty disappointed with dirtiness of the restroom at 11:30am on a Sunday, so eat at Caf√© Rio, but use Grimaldi's bathroom next door!
