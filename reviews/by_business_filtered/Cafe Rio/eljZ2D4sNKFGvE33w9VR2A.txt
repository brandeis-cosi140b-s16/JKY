Okay the food is okay. When I'm tired of Chipotle I go here, and vice-versa.

I always get the Sweet Barbacoa Pork, it's almost always served perfect.

My main complaint is the people who work here! They are very rude and rush you through the line. Like today, nobody was behind us and this young man made us feel like if we were a hassle. I understand not everyone has a good work day but this is the 3rd time I run into this rude individual. 

I would ignore it, but I felt I write about it just to better their service. 

But the BIGGEST COMPLAINT IS THE FOLLOWING: THEY ARE VERY STINGY! Like you ask for cheese they look at you in a bad way and add just a little bit and then charge you $1 for it!!!!! Wtf? I know it's a charge but for real? Give me what I pay for, a good reasonable amount when I'm not getting any additional toppings.

Ok I'm done talking about this place, go and try it for yourself. In the end, you'll enjoy the grub at this mediocre fast food Mexican restaurant.

Tortillas are fresh and tasty!
