Cafe Rio has been a staple for our family for years. I had a miserable experience here a few days ago at their Stephanie location. The staff was rude and the eating areas are dirty and dusty, just to start. 
I requested no cheese on my pork salad and the preparer was clear on that until she got across the cotija cheese and coated my salad with it saying she didn't realize it was cheese. (What?!) Then proceeded to pull it all off and toss it in the trash instead of making a new one. 
Next, they were out of GUACAMOLE. Gasp! Funny thing is, when there's a charge for guacamole as a side, there's no DISCOUNT on meals that include it? Interesting. So I paid for a pork salad with cheese layered in which I have allergy to, fatty pork, and no guac. The limeade was completely out and the other drink in same machine were sitting there with strange layer on top (machine wasn't stirring it.)
We also ordered tortilla soup that would come with guacamole. 
Our experience with the staff here was ridiculous. I even had to ask three different employees for the manager's contact info and all I got was business card of the store. Really? 
I certainly won't be back. The Eastern location is twice as busy and they've never been out of items when I've visited.
