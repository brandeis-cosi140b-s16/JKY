I love Cafe Rio! It's a local Las Vegas restaurant. I always take my friends and family from Cali to Cafe Rio because it's fresh and delicious! I tend to get the pork barbacoa salad. It's one of their specialties. There is a special everyday so just look outside the door since it's always posted. Everything here is great! Highly recommended to those who have never been. It's fresh, tasty and quality food!
