It's crazy how this place is ALWAYS out of something. Usually it's something big too like grilled chicken. My GF likes the food--I think it's ok--but I really despise the shrug of the shoulders the kid behind the counter gives me when he tells me they're out of something. I swear to god every time I go in there (10+ times at least) there's an employee eating in the dining room which I find very unprofessional. The kids are friendly at least.
