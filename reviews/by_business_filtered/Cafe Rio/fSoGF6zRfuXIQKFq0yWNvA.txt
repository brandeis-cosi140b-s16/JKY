Probably my favorite place for fast, fresh Mexican food at a reasonable price.  Big portions, quick service (unless you get there at peak lunch hours and have to wait in a horrendous line), clean, and very nice employees (not sure why other Yelpers had issues with them??).  

I love their plain cheese quesadillas--I always ask for extra guacamole and get a side of rice/black beans for some extra protein; unfortunately, they charge the same price for a cheese or meat quesadilla, so being veggie, I always get the meat on the side and give it to one of my meat-eating friends.  Friends and family LOVE the salad dressing.  I also really like the key lime pie for dessert (although my hubby says it's way too sweet).  Make sure to pick up one of their stamp cards--you get a free meal when you buy ten.

Great place!
