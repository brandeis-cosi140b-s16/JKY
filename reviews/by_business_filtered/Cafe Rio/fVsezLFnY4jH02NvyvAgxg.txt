Food is great. The staff, not so much. They don't really give you time to see what you want. Herd you through like cattle. Horrible customer service.  Blonde girl at counter constantly gave me the evil eye as I was eating, I guess because I asked her to slow down when my 8 y.o. daughter was ordering. Will not return to this location as this was the second consecutive trip with horrible service. I'll take my $50 somewhere else.
