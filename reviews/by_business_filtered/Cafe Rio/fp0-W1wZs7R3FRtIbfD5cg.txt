I enjoy the quality of food. It is always consistant and they have friendly people taking your order. Beware of Sat and Sun afternoons. And lunch hours. They have an insane line and it would better suit you to wait in your car, call and order take-out, and then walk in 10 minutes later to purchase and avoid the line. My fave is the sweet pork burrito. Always a winner.
