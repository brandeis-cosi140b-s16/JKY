I love Cafe Rio period, but this location is the best by far. Clean and welcoming. The customer service is what makes it. Super friendly and kind. I will travel of my way to visit this location. Food is awesome as well from the homemade tortillas to the horchata, bomb. I'm from Chicago so trust me, I know good food!
