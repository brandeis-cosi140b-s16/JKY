I recently called this location with a last minute order for 15 people (my bunko group) and they were able to fill it within 30 minutes!  I was desperate and the kitchen manager got on the phone and helped me with my order.  The food was very good and everyone really liked it.  They definitely saved me as I had totally forgotten the time and needed good, fresh food quickly.
