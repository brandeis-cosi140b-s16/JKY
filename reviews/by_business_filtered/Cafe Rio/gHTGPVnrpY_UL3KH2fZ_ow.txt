I went to this restaurant because as a fan of Chipotle, my boyfriend would not stop talking about this place! Since going last week, he has (thankfully) not mentioned it as of late.

This place is similar to Chipotle in the way you order your food. You go down the line and let 'em know what you want added to your burrito, salad, etc. A neat little trick is that all the employees yell "double meat" or "big meat" or something like that when you order double meat. Hearing them yell in unison is almost worth the price of the double meat; it makes me laugh. 

Even on a Thursday, this place was packed. I couldn't even believe it! I thought to myself, "Man, this place must be good!" Surprisingly, it was. 

PROS
-You can refill your own drinks
-Quick service, even though it was crowded
-AWESOME, AWESOME sweet pork barbacoa (They got an extra star for this.)
-They don't charge for guacamole like Chipotle

CONS
-The fire grilled chicken is nothing special

I'm gonna stop by here soon for lunch, maybe I'll see you guys there!

P.S. If you love froyo, stop by Yogoyum next door.
