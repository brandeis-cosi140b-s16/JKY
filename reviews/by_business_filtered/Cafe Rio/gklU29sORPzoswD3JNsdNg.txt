Yes, I love Cafe Rio! Especially the salads, the tortillas and the house dressing are the HIT! 
What I don't like is that it is so stressful to order. The background music in their location is so loud, and people working behind the counter are stressing everybody out. It seems often that they just slam the food in the plates without love. 
My husband refuses to go there because of that... and I never go there anymore during lunch hour or in the evenings between 5.30-7.00.
