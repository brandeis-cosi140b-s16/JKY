This is line style like Chipotle...hop in line and place your order, follow your order making selections as you go. Casual dining and fresh tortillas made right in front of you. The only thing I order and ever plan on ordering is their salad. Yes, it may seem like a weird one to obsess over but this is Super Yum! Okay, so they start with a hot, fresh, thick, almost buttery tasting tortilla with melted cheese, then they add rice, your choice of beans, your choice of meat (I liked the steak or shredded chicken, now I don't eat meat), lots and lots of lettuce, a lime, crunchy tortilla strips, pico, guacamole, and more cheese. They have a spicy house cilantro ranch that has a kick and brings everything together! Say it with me now...Wowza! Your taste buds will be having a party all night. They also have loyalty cards so you can get a stamp for each entr√©e, working towards a free one.
