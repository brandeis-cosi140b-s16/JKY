Ok, I'm impressed.  I ordered a salad with lettuce, an unbelievable amount of well seasoned chicken breast, black beans, rice, cilantro and guacamole.  It came in a bowl, on top of a fresh homemade tortilla, with creamy tomatillo dressing on the side.  AWESOME!  My husband insisted on dessert, (it didn't take much convincing) so we shared the coconut flan.  Oh, WOW!  Gourmet quality.   We might just return tomorrow.  :-)
