Been a cafe rio fan for over 10 years growing up in Utah , can say that this cafe rio is the worst , still standing online with only 6 people ahead of me , going on 20 minutes now , ridiculous , also just heard them say 15 minute wait for steak ! Sad to say this cafe rio will never get my business again .
