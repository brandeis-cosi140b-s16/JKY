I've always heard many great things about Cafe Rio and it wasn't until recently that I took that chance of trying something new, other than the usual weekly chipotle run.  Their menu is something new to me so I had to just stand there for a bit and decide what to try......*drum roll* it was decided, grilled chicken salad! 

What amazed me at Cafe Rio is that they make all their tortillas Fresh!  I have never been to a fast food chain where tortillas are made fresh!  And boooyyy are those fresh tortillas delicious!  

This salad is made with the tortilla as the base, topped with some chopped lettuce, pico de gallo, guacamole, grilled chicken, and other garnishes, and you have a choice between a creamy dressing or an oil based dressing.  I'm not a fan of creamy dressings, so I tried the lime cilantro oil dressing and it hit the spot!  

This place is very delicious and fresh!  For those of you who have not tried it yet, it is a must!  

Now onto my next opinion, although Cafe Rio is good, it is so different from Chipotle and yes, Chipotle still is on my list of favorite places to go to eat!
