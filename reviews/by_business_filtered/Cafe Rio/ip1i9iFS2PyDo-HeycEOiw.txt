Similar to Chipotle, you have a whole assembly line of workers preparing your meal. 
I heard this place is always crowded, always a line. They have daily specials and when I went on a Thursday, tamales were their special of the day. It comes with rice and beans along with 2 pork tamales. You can customize anything to your own personal liking. The tamales were just good. It was enough to get me full. Nothing outstanding. The daily specials come with a drink as well.

Did I like it? Yeah. Solid 4 stars for me. There's three kinds of salsa. The medium have a sweet, tangy taste to it. So I opted for the mild. The flavoring was bland. Next time...I'll definitely try the hot.

Maybe this is a Vegas thing. But personally, I would clump this together with Baja Fresh type-a food.
