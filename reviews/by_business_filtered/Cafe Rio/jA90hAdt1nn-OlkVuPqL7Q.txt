Worst cafe rio I've ever been to. Consistently out of something. There hasn't been a single time I've gone there that they've had everything I've asked for. The food quality is good with the missing ingredients aside. 

The customer service is also atrocious. The first time I got attitude I wrote it off as the girl having a bad day, but it's consistently that way.

If there was another one close to my house I would never go to this cafe rio.
