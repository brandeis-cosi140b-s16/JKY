I've been waiting to write this review for a very long time. Mostly because I've been waiting to go out to Gilbert for a very long time. Ha. 

Since I am counting down the days till my exit from this awesome Valley of the Sun, I am trying to hit up all the things that were on my Valley bucket list, and on them: go to Gilbert to visit Cafe Rio (even though there are a few Vegas locations).

I used to frequent Cafe Rio in Salt Lake (Fort Union) during my senior year of high school and in the years following. Those who are in the know, are aware this this place was around before that "other" burrito chain from that "other" city in the mountains. The one that is named after a chili pepper and later got bastardized by McDonalds, even though I still love and eat there.

If you are from the Salt Lake City area, you know this place has a cult following with a line out the door. It's ridiculous at times.

Anyway....

Things to eat at Cafe Rio:

Burrito (duh). Try it Enchilada style. The fire grilled chicken is pulled, instead of cubed. Also, it's clearly marinated, and tasty.

The pork salad. They are famous for this. The pork is slow cooked and is a little sweet, but is sooo good, and topped with house made tortilla strips, and this cilantro dressing that will make you squeal like the pig you are about to devour.

ALL of their tortillas are made in-house and in front of you. 

They have a variety of sodas with crushed ice, including mexican coke. Also, they have the mexican fountain juices like mango pineapple. Yum!

This place is worth the drive, no matter where you are coming from. 

I can't wait for my next trip to Cafe Rio. They now have locations in Vegas, Southern California, Maryland, Virginia, and Colorado.
