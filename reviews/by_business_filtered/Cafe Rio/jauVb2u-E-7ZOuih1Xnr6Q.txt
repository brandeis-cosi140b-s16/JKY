The last time I was at Cafe Rio I had called in a to go order for 2 of the popular pork salad. Needless to say I didn't go back until tonight (after 4 months) because we were so disappointed in our skimpy and I do mean skimpy salads, they were 1/2 the size of the ones we'd had the week before.
I decided since I was in the area I'd give it another shot. I'm glad I did! It's piled with rice, black beans and for once plenty of pork! I even had to ask the girl making it to remove some of the huge pieces of lettuce as it was way too much for me! I'll probably have leftovers for tomorrow! I hope it's this way again when I return for more!
