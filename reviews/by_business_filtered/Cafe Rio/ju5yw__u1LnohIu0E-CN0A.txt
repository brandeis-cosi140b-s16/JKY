I have been eating at Cafe Rio for a couple of years now and enjoy it. Recently I moved to the area and started going to this location. Over the past two weeks I have probably eaten there three times. Not once have I got good service. Two out of three times I ordered online figured out give them time to make it and have it ready for me when I got there. But both times they never started making it until I got there so I had to wait. What's the point of online ordering when you have to stand there and wait in line like everyone else. The first time we went to this location they made our food and we watched them try and give it to two different people before we got it. 

From now on I'll be driving to the Centennial location even though this location is a block and a half from my house. My only thought is they have the worst management ever at this location. 

I only gave them one star because you can have the best food in the world but when your staff is crap why bother.
