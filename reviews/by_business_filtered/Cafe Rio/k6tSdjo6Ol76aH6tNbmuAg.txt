I usually go the the cafe rio on eastern and serene and this is my first time eating at this location.  I have to say it will be the last time.  I would rather drive further for better service, cleanliness, and food quality.  This location is terrible.  The staff were very rude.  They were dropping things everywhere.  The lettuce looked old and wilted.  Half of the drinks on the drink station were empty and we were there at 5:30pm.  It also looked like the they haven't cleaned the whole station for days.  I hope they either retrain their staff or hire better people.
