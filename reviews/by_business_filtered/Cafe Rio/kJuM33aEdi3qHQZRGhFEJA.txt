Always wonderful! Friendly staff and great, fresh food. It is on the noisy side thought, but what do you expect for a family friendly resturaunt? The food is consistant at every location which is a plus as well. Never had a bad meal. Tamala Thursday is amazing! I am not a huge fan of their pork barbacoa, but I think it is either a love it or hate it type thing. I do love thier fire grilled chicken and highly suggest it. Their house dressing for their salads is amazing! I'd suggest to anyone for a quick bite to eat.
