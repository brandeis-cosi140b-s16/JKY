Really good food, but they had 2 different menus. . I happened to look at the one on the wall that is closest to where you ordered. . I ordered 2 taco meal that says 7.99 with your choice of meat.  I chose carne asada with no extras like sour cream and guac .. I ordered a drink and my bill came out to 12.63.. a drink cost 2.19 how did it come out to that much. . I asked the cashier and she said they changed the prices on their other menu that I didn't even see.  They refused to refund or help the situation. . They need to change both menus because they are just confusing people
