Not something to write home about.   I had the shredded chicken enchilada and roast beef enchilada both with medium green sauce.  Although the roast beef was good I thought both were bland for a Mexican place.  I guess their competition would be a Chipotle but Cafe Rio ranks well below them.
So so place, I'll spend my dining out money somewhere else.
