They have big portions and everything was fresh.  Salads looked really good. In comparison, Cafe Rio was similar to Chipotle but much better.

Anyway, I had the burrito and it was great.  It was an easy four stars.  The only thing holding back a five star rating was them being stingy with the meat. For eight bucks put on a little more meat.
