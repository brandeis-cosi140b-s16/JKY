This place is so good I don't think there will ever be a better Mexican "fast-food" joint anywhere. I love everything about this place from the flesh tortillas, to the crazy good pork salad, to the super tart lime pie. I have eaten myself sick here so many times I can't count them. If you are looking for a great quick bite this is the place for you.
