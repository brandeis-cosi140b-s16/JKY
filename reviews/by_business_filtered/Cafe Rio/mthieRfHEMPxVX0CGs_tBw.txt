I have been to Cafe Rio establishments in the past however I had not been to this location in over 6 months. I was eager for the Steak Burrito! 
The restaurant itself was very empty on Sunday, 6pm, which was kind of nice for a quick take out grab-n-go. I got the steak burrito with a wheat tortilla and medium sauce, black beans, cheese inside. It was put through there over warming machine and it was wrapped up and packaged quick. 
I live less then 5 mins away and while I didn't expect it to be super hot I also didn't expect it to be room temperature. 
Overall, i ate the whole thing but certainly was not impressed with the quality of the food itself. I recall it was better in the past so not sure whats changed. Ive decided I wont be returning anytime soon. 
3 stars for service, speed, and cost but I'd say 2 for quality of food.
