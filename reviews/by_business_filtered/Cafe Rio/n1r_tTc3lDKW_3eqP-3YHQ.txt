Her Name Is Rio And She Dances On The Sand
By The Rue

Ate at Cafe Rio in Gilbert,
I didn't go with the cartoon Dilbert,
The food didn't make me squirt,
Across the street is a Filibert (o's).

Chicken burrito enchilada style, 
Stood in line but not for a while,
The food was good it made me smile,
After I give you my number go ahead and dial.

Seven fifty is a fair price, 
The burritos are huge and come with rice,
Add some beans, salsa for spice,
When I'm in Vegas I throw the dice.

Buck sixty five for a small drink,
Starred at the hottie but she didn't wink,
Reading her magazine it made me think,
Looking good in those sweats that said "Pink".

If you have a warrant for your arrest,
Stearing clear of here would be best,
Lots of cops in bullet proof vests,
Lunching with their mistress is my guess. 

This place gets a good crowd of hot little honey's,
Probably only like you for your money,
Secretly they work at the strip club called Sonny's,
Wishing they were a Playboy Bunny. 

Gilbert and Baseline is where it's at,
Stop by here if you wanna get fat,
A lot of food, Sigma Nu is a frat,
I did it like that, I did it with a wiffle ball bat.

DOUBLE MEAT!!!
