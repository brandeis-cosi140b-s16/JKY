This location is just blah. Let me explain why: 

1. The employees aren't as friendly the other location that's closer to me. They're just there, working. No smiles. No welcome greetings. Just there. 
 
2. At the location near my house, I order a chicken salad with just lettuce and cilantro. Since I don't get any of the other toppings on my salad, they load up on the lettuce. At this location, it's just the minimum amount of lettuce. And I'm like "uh that's it?" 

3. The quality of the ingredients here are subpar. I've seen old lettuce and brown pieces of cilantro still being used. And I have gotten sick from their guacamole. 

I love Cafe Rio. The food is delicious. But this location is just average. The end
