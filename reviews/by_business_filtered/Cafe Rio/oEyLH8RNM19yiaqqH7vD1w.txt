My girlfriend introduced me to this place and I think it's one of my favorite mexican food places in Gilbert. I've had a few things off the menu (so has my girlfriend). I must say everything has been delicious. The meat is always tender and juicy. If I had to compare it to another place, I'd say it was like chipotle with a bit more of an authentic taste. I recommend the pork burritos ( award winning type of good), but you really can't go wrong with any item at this place.
