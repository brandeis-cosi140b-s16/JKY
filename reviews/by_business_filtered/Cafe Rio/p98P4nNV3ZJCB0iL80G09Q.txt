Cafe Rio is always my go-to Mexican food place for quick and wonderful food.  And they have the best KIDS special around.  Actually, you get a FREE kids quesadilla for all kids under 6 years old with an adult purchase.  Today I went with chicken enchiladas with MEDIUM sauce. 

Lunch time on a Saturday meant very long lines but it moves pretty fast.  I give Cafe Rio the 5th star because of their drink options.  In addition to the soda machine, they offer 3 types of freshly-brewed iced tea and 4 types of Mexican-flavored drinks (orchata, mint lemonade, etc.).

The fire-grilled chicken and carne asada are both great.  I haven't tried the barbacoa - but it's their most popular meat item I think.  

All in all, Cafe Rio offers up quality made-to-order food - did I say HOMEMADE tortillas made in front of you?   There are very few Mexican restaurants in town that offer the same quality of food for the price.  My family of 3 can eat here for $20 or less - which is actually very hard to do in this town at any restaurant.  And the food always meets our expectations!!
