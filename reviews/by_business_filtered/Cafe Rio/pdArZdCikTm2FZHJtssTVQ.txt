I have been here a few hundred times.  Well maybe more like twenty.

I know cafe Rio is a chain but they make pretty tasty food fast and cheap!  I usually go or the chicken tostada.  I like it better than the salad because they use the shredded romaine lettuce.  

Also, Fideo Fridays!

the only thing I don't like is they shout "extra ...." if you order something extra.  It is obnoxious.  So I was like 2 can play this game...

Jason - "extra meat please."

Cafe Rio Employees - "EXTRA MEAT!"

Jason - "can I have extra a little lettuce."

Cafe Rio Employees - "EXTRA LETTUCE!"

Jason - "Can I have extra cheese please?"

Cafe Rio Employees - "EXTRA CHEESE!"

Jason - "Can I have extra cheese chip strips?"

Cafe Rio Employees - "extra chips...."

Jason - "can I have Extra cilantro?"

Cafe Rio Employees - "extra cilan......"  

I thought it was funny.
