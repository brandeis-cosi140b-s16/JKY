This place is soooo dirty every single time we come here but it is across the street so who can complain. Idk I was gonna grab the lady to wipe the table but the rag she was using looked dirtier than the table she was about to clean. Also she didn't have any cleaner with that rag so shit I didn't want salmonella or anything else on this table. Anyways I ended up wiping out table with some napkins but to tell u the truth there is a thick sticky layer of guck on the table top so the napkin really didn't do any good. 
They do have some great looking and good looking food and on Wednesdays they have a tostada special for 7$ including a drink. They also have a drink bar with horchata and lime aid with all the drink mix ins. Will come back cause my friends like this place but not because of the cleanliness.
