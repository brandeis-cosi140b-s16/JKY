My Mexican food standards are pretty high and everyone SWORE by this place so I finally tried it a few months ago.  If I'm going to suffer the plight of diarrhea, I'd at least like some flavor to make it worth it.  I would truly prefer eating frozen burritos over this place.  

I'd also like to know who provided this restaurant with a single dollar sign.  I paid $12 for a soft tortilla on the bottom of my taco salad, bland meat and sparse, tasteless cheese sprinkled on top with a side of the nastiest salad dressing I've ever had.  Oh, and a small drink cup.
 
I had to shout my order across the noise to the person making my order and could barely hear the questions being asked.  I might have verbally agreed to the assassination of someone being held hostage in the kitchen, I'll never know.   Normally, that sort of thing doesn't bother me with this style of  restaurant (the shouting, not assassination), but this was worse than a bar on a Saturday night hosting 5 21st birthday parties.

And the atmosphere?  Kids everywhere, kids screaming and kids dropping their food and crying. I'm not a kid person, but the parent to child ration was 1:3 and that could shake anyone trying to eat lunch.  The tables were so close together you had to ask the guests behind you to scoot forward so you could get out and the tables were built around the waiting line so the people in line had the pleasure of watching you eat and you had the pleasure of being uncomfortable.
I could go on and on, but you get the gist of it.  

Every offer for free lunch to this place has been declined every since that first visit, I will never eat there again.
