I probably go to this place too much!  But it's sooooo good!  The tortillas are wonderul!  Everything I've ever had there is delicious!  When I first started going there I was hooked on their quesadillas....now I'm loving their tostadas!  If you like their salads, you'll like the tostadas too.  They are really similar, only the tostada doesn't have the tortilla shell as the salad bowl.  Honestly, you can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  The meats there are so tender and flavorful.  And their guacamole is really, really good!  The same can be said of their chips and salsa, queso dip and pretty much everything else.  Tasty all the way around!
