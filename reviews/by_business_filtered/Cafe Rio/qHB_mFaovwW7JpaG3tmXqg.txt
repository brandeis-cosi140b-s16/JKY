First time here and won't be returning.  I asked for a side of sour cream which I only noticed they had some because I saw another person had some on their          plate.  The tiny portion they give you doesn't even fill the small container they serve it in.  Along w the guacamole that comes w veg burrito. The guy serving the pico and lettuce wasn't too friendly.  They need improvement on customer service. The food is just ok.
