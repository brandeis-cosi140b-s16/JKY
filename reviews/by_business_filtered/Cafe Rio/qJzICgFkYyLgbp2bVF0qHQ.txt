My physics teacher was talking about the big ol' round tortilla cooking thingy, so I had to check it out. It is right across the street from UNLV so easy peesy.
Food was very tasty, I had a chicken salad in a tortilla of course, yummy!
The restaurant dining area was clean and the staff was helpful and nice. The tea was empty, all of the teas were empty :( so I had a soda, not a fan of soda.. Anywho, really yummy food here, I recommend it...
