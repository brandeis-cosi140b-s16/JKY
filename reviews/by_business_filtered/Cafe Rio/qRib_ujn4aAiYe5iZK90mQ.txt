So I've actually been to five Cafe Rio locations. Let's be honest. It's a chain. But it's so good! Actually, since I'm being honest, I'm really only reviewing this location because I want to add it to one of my lists.

This Cafe Rio is the closest one to my job and is my location of choice when I feel like some great Mexican food during lunch time. Is it authentic Mexican food? I don't know anymore. Who cares? It's delicious! I usually get a burrito with enchilada sauce. I always walk out full and satisfied.
