Cafe Rio gets 5 stars from me! 
I ordered the 'award winning' barbacoa salad (***be sure to order this with the Tomatillo dressing!) Let me start of by saying I'm not normally a fan of barbacoa but everyone kept telling me how great theirs was and I've got to say it was the best, most filling, flavorful salad I've had in a LONG time. They also create the salad on top of a fresh, warm, flour tortilla so that when you're finished eating the leafy portion of the salad so have a burrito to complete your meal. Aside from the delicious meal the prices were very reasonable, the portions were perfect, and the staff was comedic, friendly, and delightful to be around. I will definately be visiting Cafe Rio again.
