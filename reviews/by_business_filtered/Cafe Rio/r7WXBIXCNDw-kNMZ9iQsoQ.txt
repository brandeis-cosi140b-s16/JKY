I can't believe for all this time I have been passing this place for Carl's Jr's Western Bacon Cheeseburger. I went here on Tuesday which meant it was Coconut Shrimp Taco day ! I LOVE Coconut shrimp so this was perfect for me.The tortilla's are home made...at first I thought it wouldn't make a difference but you can tell! The shrimps were nice and crispy. I had their mango salsa with it and it was heaven on a plate! I'm not a big fan of the rice though but it's okay . I also tried their Tres Leche cake and it was good but I wouldn't order it again because I don't like the consistency of it . I've had others which were a little more firm and that's how I prefer it. My meal came with two tacos rice and beans..(I passed on the beans) and a drink. This was all for around $8.65 which I thought was a good price. I also liked their drink selections because they had flavored teas. I had the green blackberry tea which had a good taste to it so it really didn't need to be sweetened .I will be back...on Tuesdays!
