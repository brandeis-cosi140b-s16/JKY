This place is really just okay, can't understand what the hype is.We came again because we had a BOGO for a burrito or salad. But even with having the price slashed in half it was still more expensive than chipole and didn't taste as good. 

The staff is super fast, they're like hovering with the sauces they think you'll get so you kind of get anxiety that they'll put it on. You have to practically shout at them to "no, the spicy one" or they'll put the wrong one. They're driven by quantity not quality. 

What we got:
1. Chicken burrito: comes with rice, black beans, cheese and your choice of sauce. I asked for the spicy one and it was not spice at all. Maybe 2/10. Tasted mild at best. Then had more hot sauce placed in it. It's served with the lettuce and salsa next to it. 7.79ish, but extra dollar for sauce to cover it. Not worth it. 
2. Steak burrito: again rice black beans, cheese and spicy sauce toasted. With more hot sauce covering it. With salad next to it. 7.79+1.5 cause it's sliced steak (confusing, I don't get it) +1 dollar for sauce to cover it. Again not worth it
