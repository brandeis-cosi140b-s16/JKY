NEVER EAT AT THIS LOCATION. 

The sweet pork tastes good, but I am absolutely outraged by the lack of customer service at this location. While they were making my tacos they "realized" that they put "too much" chicken in the pan and promptly removed it from my order so that they could save money on the meat they were using for my order. On top of all that they got the order wrong and only gave us two tacos instead of three. Horrendous customer service and complete lack of ability to provide to the wishes of the consumer.
