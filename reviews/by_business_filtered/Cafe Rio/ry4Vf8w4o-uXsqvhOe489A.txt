No matter how often I try Cafe Rio, I still can't find anything on the menu that I like. The meats are always either bland or overly seasoned, the sauces they use are always too sweet or salty, or both.

The only redeeming quality I've found is that their veggies are typically fresh. This location was no different and despite putting in our order online, a lot of our order was mixed up and some of us were missing condiments and they didn't pack any utensils or napkins in our to go box.
