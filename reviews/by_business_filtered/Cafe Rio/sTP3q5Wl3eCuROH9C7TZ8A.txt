Costumer service is terrible, the night shift staff has no discipline. The line is messy I didn't even want to eat my food when I got it. Staff was wondering around like they didn't care about the line they had, I was in line for more than 20 minutes. Which made the line even longer, & my meal was made incorrectly. Over all this is by far the worst experience I've ever had at cafe rio, STAY OUT OF THIS PLACE!
