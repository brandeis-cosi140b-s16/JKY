I'm a fan of Cafe Rio. Whenever I'm in the mood for some gringo-fied Mexican fast food this is my restaurant of choice. It's far superior to Chipotle, Baja Fresh, and the rest of the fast food joints in the same space. This location just opened up a few weeks ago in the same strip mall as Golden Spoon, Panda Express, and Albertson's off of Blue Diamond.

The food taste pretty much the same as other locations. Their pork does tend to be on the sweet side, so if that's a turn off for you you're going to hate all of their pork dishes. Tuesday's are my favorite days to come here because their coconut shrimp tacos w/ mango sauce are delicious! 

The staff here is great. Don't be surprised if the guys in the back break out into a song and dance routine as you're ordering or eating. It makes for an entertaining and amusing experience.
