Everyone thinks I'm looney tunes but this is my favorite fast food Mexican EVER! My friends and co-workers won't eat here - they prefer Chipotle, but I am a Cafe Rio devotee all the way! Even my husband has nicknamed the place "Cafe Shit" but what does he know?

I've been eating Cafe Rio since discovering it in Utah in 2005 and their arrival in Vegas is long overdue. 

Fresh tortillas are hot off the press- they're also brushed with butter and warmed on a stove with a little cheese, making the base for their salads. From there, everything from beans and rice to your choice of meat, cheese chips, guac etc. PILED to make a mountain of salad. And their tomatillo dressing is out of this world delicious. I seriously think I could drink the stuff!

I always order the shredded chicken as I think the fire-roasted chicken is too dry and the pork barbacoa is very sweet. 

My kids also order salads, which is very unusual for my boys. They're that good.

They also have Diet Dr. Pepper.

You can call your order in and pick it up, thus avoiding the long lunch/dinner line. I wish they had a drive-thru like the one in Cedar City.
