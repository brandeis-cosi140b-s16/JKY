I rarely go to Cafe Rio because I like Chipotle. The last time I went to Cafe Rio was probably 3 or 4 years ago.  

There was a Bogo coupon, so I decided to go and give it a second try. I got off work at 9, and they close at 10. I arrived there about 9:40. Yes, I was one of those people. There were about 7 or 8 employees working. It actually took me quite a bit to order and leave. I ordered a burrito and a salad with the sweet barbacoa meat. The girl assisting me did ask me if I wanted it enchilada style. It would have been nice to know it was $1 more, which I wasn't aware of until I looked at my receipt when I was at home. I guess they are used to people already knowing that it costs more..... 

The food itself wasn't that bad. I do prefer Chipotle style burritos or maybe it's different when you get enchilada style as opposed to regular. My burrito came with the rice, and meat inside. The lettuce and pico de gallo came on the side. I guess it partially is my fault for not being an educated orderer. 


Yes, I know it was close to closing time, but I had really bad service. The girl assisting me did not know what she was doing. She was lost, talked to other employees while assisting me. Sorry, but I don't care that you only work closing shifts. I just want my food so I can leave. She left my burrito floating  ( I got it enchilada style.) She then left my salad and burrito just waiting there when it was completed. She didn't even package it.
