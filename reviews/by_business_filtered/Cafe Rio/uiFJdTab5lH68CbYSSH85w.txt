I thoroughly enjoyed my lunch at the Cafe Rio. What a great idea- you get a bunch of choices to order from- I got the taco plate with two tacos and chose the shredded chicken and the shrimp of the day with rice and beans. It's a little like a Chipotle but with allot more options. I wish the staff had drained the chicken a little more since sit was in so much water that it soaked through the tortilla. But overall, it was good and decently priced at $7. I was also impressed by the drink choices- they had lemonade with basil and three types of iced tea to try as well as an assortment of other delicious drinks all refillable and are all for the same price as a fountain drink. 
The ambiance is kinda cute with multi colored chairs and tables. 
If you're looking for a good priced and relaxed lunch, you can't go wrong with Cafe Rio.
