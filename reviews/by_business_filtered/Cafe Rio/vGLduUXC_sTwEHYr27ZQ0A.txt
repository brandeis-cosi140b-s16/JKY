Love this location and love Café Rio!  While during peak times the lines can be long, I've never had an issue with customer service and the line still runs smoothly.  I've ordered online for pick up on several occasions from this office with them always being accurate and no issues. Thank goodness I don't live too far away from this location, but the location that I work near is absolutely horrendous.

Thanks for being amazing Café Rio off Stephanie St!  I wish you could train the Blue Diamond staff!!
