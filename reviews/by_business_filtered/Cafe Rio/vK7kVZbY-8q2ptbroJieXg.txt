The food here is on par for Cafe Rio standards and tasted great. The problem was with the staff. When we arrived the line was longer than the corral, and it CRAWLED. As I got to the front and saw the people working the line it was apparent they needed someone supervising them. They were distracted, scattered and lethargic. None looked enthusiastic about their job or at all concerned with the length of the line. But that would be forgivable and truly wasn't the source of the delays. It was the cashier, the receipt said her name was Kelly, who was texting the WHOLE TIME. She kept the phone in one hand while ringing people up and couldn't stop texting. At seeing this it became apparent there was no shift leader or manager present, either physically or mentally. This location needs a management overhaul. Employees should not be texting while working.
