Food is good. The only thing that sucks is the service. The lady taking my order made my salad all messy and didny.even ask.if I wanted shredded lettuce or regular. I.barley got any meat. Also the cashier wasnt even talking to me. She was talking on the headphone with another employee about someones babys mama. A discussion that shouldnt be spoken at work and especially in front of a customer. There was no thank u at all and no eye contact. Also, the pink lemonade was all watered down.
