Been meaning to try this place for a while, we'll definitely return.  Their hottest sauce not very hot but with the variety of bottled sauces they make available to you makes up for it.  I'm a big fan of queso and chips and this place does have fresh yummy chips and their queso was very good, a bit salty but good.
