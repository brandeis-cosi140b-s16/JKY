Still over rated.

Cafe Rio is a crumby version of all of your local Hispanic and South American foods, crammed into one bland menu.

I was asked to stop here on my way to an event. Upon trying to order for a couple people, I learned that there is no flexibility in the items. You can take what they offer in only certain arrangements, otherwise, everything is full price and cannot be made with other toppings. 

They got the order wrong twice, then looked at me like I had 3 heads and a tail when I told them that I did not want chips, beans, and rice with the meal. 

All that stress for drastically over priced, low quality food.
Totally not worth is.

Near ANY Cafe Rio in town, you will find a Roberto's or other spot for tacos, burritos and nachos... so skip this garbage and at least go to a place where the staff is friendly and helpful.
