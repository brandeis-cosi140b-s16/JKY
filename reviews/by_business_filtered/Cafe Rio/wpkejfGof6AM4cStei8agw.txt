Usually have great service here but sadly today killed that, this doesn't apply to everyone one there but mostly to those behind the line. One of the girls seemed very annoyed with the order and was rushing. I know it's busy but that isn't an excuse to be rude and give poor customer service.  If it weren't for the good food I probably wouldn't visit this location again.
