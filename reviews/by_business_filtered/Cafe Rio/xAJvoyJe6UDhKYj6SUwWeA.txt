Love the food at Cafe Rio. That being said, I find this particular location to be very inconsistent with service, and preparation of meals. I would say they are out of some kind of basic ingredient every other time we go. Sometimes it's steak, other times it's chips, or pico. Still we keep coming back because the food generally tastes good and fresh (when we can get what we want). 

Salad tip...ask for the shredded lettuce as sometimes the larger "salad" lettuce is the size of your head.
