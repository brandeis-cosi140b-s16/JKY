Had cafe rio for the first time on cinco de mayo for a staff lunch. The food was disgusting and cold and  we assumed that it had been sitting their for about 2 hours. Since we asked for our take out to be ready at 12:50 and our ticket stated pick up was at 11:04. The food had good flavor, but I just couldn't get over the drenched soggy nachos and the brown guacamole. We are assuming that the day was short staffed and just a little hectic for the holiday. When we called to let the manager know she was super nice and really apologetic and gave us free meals. We will be giving them a second chance because normally the food is supposably great, and the staff handle the situation great.
