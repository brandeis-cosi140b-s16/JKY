"What happened?"

"Nothing ... she's a lil' bitch."

Whoa! I had no idea what was going on and why this middle-aged, polite-looking, homely Caucasian lady was telling her lunch-mate that someone was a bitch, or words to that effect; however, this is the Café Río at the university neighbourhood, so ... shitty service is the norm. It is par. 

In other words, she was undoubtedly referring to an employee from the Mormon-owned chain. And possibly justifiably so.

The food is the same here as it is in Summerlin, in Centennial, in Aliante, across the street from Henderson on the Las Vegas side of Eastern, or in fucking Utah. It's a chain (with A-OK food). But the service here ... oh man. It fucking blows.

"They go the same speed if there is one person in line or if there are twenty."

I disagree with this separate, thirty-something-year-old, dissatisfied regular sporting a UNLV-Tarkanian shirt. (Go Rebels.) I think they actually go slower when there are more people in queue. For, they know -- from experience -- that some patrons will walk out in defeat. 

Remember: quitters never win. But to win at this Café Río, one might have to wait twenty minutes before even having one's food. YMMV.

Rating: "Meh. I've experienced better."
