I will always come back here, it's one of my favorite places in town.  But today it gets 4 stars because I need more meat in my taco!  When a taco has 80 times more lettuce than meat, it needs help.  Cafe Rio needs a meat intervention, NOW!!  

I ordered a grilled steak taco and watched the employee put a nice scoop of meat on my tortilla.  And then he did the unforgiveable - he took the spoon and removed HALF the meat off back into the meat container. NOOOOOO!  

But as it usually goes at Cafe Rio, the queso and chips - along with the rice and beans - make me enjoy my meal despite the meat removal.  

My hubby had the enchiladas with hot sauce and they were gone in about 10 seconds.  He gives them 5 stars.  

I need more meat.  A taco without meat is not a taco!
