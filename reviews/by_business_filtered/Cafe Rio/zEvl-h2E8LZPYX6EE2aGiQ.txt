How hard is it to put some beans, rice, cheese and meat into a tortilla...then add some lettuce and Pico on top and get you out the door...if you are ordering at the Cafe Rio....REALLLLLLY hard.  Seriously. It's fast food...already prepared...sitting in warming and cooling bins in front of you. Food is always good...but the service at the counter is getting slower and slower and slower.  Nothing kills a restaurant faster than crappy slow service.  But that's just my opinion.
