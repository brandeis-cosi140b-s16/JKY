Gotta agree with Tony B. here... the taco salads are freaking awesome. I tried this place for the first time last night and it was quite crowded (a good sign!). Seemed nearly everyone was getting the taco salads. 

Just so you know, this is no ordinary salad. Additionally, this is by all means NOT a healthy salad. You cannot delude yourself into thinking you are sticking to your diet at all if you order this. Despite the hefty calorie count, it's so yummy!!!

It starts with a huge homemade tortilla that has cheese melted on it. Yes, I said a tortilla with cheese is how your freaking salad starts. YUM. They pile it with your choice of pork , chicken or beef (I got chicken, fiance got pork.. both were excellent). They also serve it with rice, beans, romaine lettuce, 2 kinds of cheese, guacamole and tortilla crispy strips on top. I could barely finish half of this massive feast, but the half I did eat was quite delicious. Salad prices average ~$8 depending on what meat you pick.
