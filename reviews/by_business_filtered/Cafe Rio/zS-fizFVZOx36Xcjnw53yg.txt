I had heard of people raving about Cafe Rio even before this location was open. I didn't know exactly what to order my first two times coming here and I think I opted for some vegetarian options because I didn't want to burn a hole in my pocket. I was not a fan at all and didn't bother to come back. However, once again I encountered a person who was raving about their sweet pork barbacoa. She was totally right! This is pretty much the only thing worth ordering. While everything else is pretty much just blah. The nice moist sweet flavored pork is greaaat! I highly recommend the salad because it also comes with the tortilla. I absolutely love the texture, when I found of they sold them separately it made me kinda excited. The salad portion is actually big enough to share. And for those starving college students who think $8 is a little steep for a salad the tostada is pretty much the same as the salad but it only cost $6. So basically cafe rio= sweet pork barbacoa.
