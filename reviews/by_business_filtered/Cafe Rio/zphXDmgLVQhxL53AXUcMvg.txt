Great, quick foods.
For months I only ate the marinated roasted beef tostada, and I was very happy with it. Until a friend talked me into trying the grilled steak. Delicious! Then she got me to try the grilled chicken, now typically, I'm more of a red meat girl, and rarely eat chicken. Its normally to bland for me. However, this is some of the best chicken I've tasted. Highly recommend! Now it's the only thing I get. I can't vouch for the shredded chicken, as I've never tried it, but I was told it isn't as good.
You can't beat the prices. And I also love their iced tea. I usually take my food to go, but they have a lot of room to dine in. The place is usually busy but the line moves quick.
