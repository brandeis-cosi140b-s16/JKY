Its a nice clean restaurant.  Not authentic Mexican food though. They make their burritos weird and when untold them how I wanted it I was told no I dont want it that way. It made me not even want to get a burrito. I was told that Pico de Gallo is nasty in a burrito and I didn't want it like that. I had to let them know that I am a paying customer and I will have it the way I want it. Its hard to hear them when making an order also. The meat spent have authentic Mexican spices either. This is my last time here.
