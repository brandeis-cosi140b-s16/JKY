Cafe Rio has been a favorite spot of mine for a long while now. I have been to their locations in Utah, Washington, and Nevada. It's a step above Chipotle and they have daily specials that are all pretty good and not as expensive as other items on the menu. The only downfall with this place is that if you're not careful when you're ordering you can end up dropping around 15 dollars for lunch. The portions are all pretty damn big. My favorite thing to order is the Sweet Pork Tostada! This location is right across from UNLV so it can get VERY BUSY!!
