My first ever review...the reason I created a yelp account! 
I didn't have high hopes for the lack of stars already when my boyfriend and mom and I decided to visit, but they took restaurant.com coupons on a weekend and we were in the westgate area so I thought "it cant be that bad". I was so wrong. There was only one other table in the entire bar so I wasn't shocked when our waiter greeted us right away. I ordered a margarita from the sign that hung above the bar...only to be told they do not serve those margaritas.....?? Excuse me? Hahahha what, why are they up there then? The waiter had no response, so I awkwardly ordered a beer and let it go. 
The menu had about 10 items... extremely condensed. We ordered guac and chips which ultimately came AFTER our meal, and we each had some horrible rendition of food they claimed to be Mexican. 
I could go on explaining every detail of this awful awful experience, but bottom line is - the food was awful, small portions and waaay overpriced, the service was awful. It was unanimously decided that I am never allowed to pick restaurants based on restaurant.com coupons specifically because this place was SO bad, I didn't even want to call and complain to a manager. I would not go back even if they gave me a free meal. Unless a manager could compensate me with giving me a gift certificate to a DIFFERENT restaurant FAR FAR away from this dump, calling a manager at Calico Jacks would be a downright waste of time.
