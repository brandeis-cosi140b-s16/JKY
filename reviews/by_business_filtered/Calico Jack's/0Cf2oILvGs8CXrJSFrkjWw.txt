I went here for Cinco de Mayo. The crowd was great, but the attitudes of the managers/door men were awful. I was coming down from doing a promotion at Shout House when some people asked me what places where good to eat at approximately midnight. I told them that Saddle Ranch served food until 2am. One of the managers at Calico Jack's expressed an obscenity about Saddle Ranch and said to come to Calico Jack's. When I tried to re enter Calico Jack's, they would not allow me to come back in because I suggested Saddle Ranch. How Ridiculous! If a company is confident, they do not need to bad mouth the competition.  Calico Jacks needs to be aware that I will yelp, tweet, facebook, myspace the way they treated me and if they continue to treat others that way, they will end up like the establishment that once was in that lease space.  I'll bet on that.
