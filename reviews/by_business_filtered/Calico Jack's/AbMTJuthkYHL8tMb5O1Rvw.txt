Eh. It was alright. I expected more. I've heard so much about this place, but I guess its really just a late night place, not somewhere you'd want to go with family and kids during the day.  We went for a combo of my husbands bday and my son graduating his after school program (behavior related). I called ahead to make sure it would be ok for kids, and she said yea because at 9pm is when they start carding everyone, which was perfect for us. 

So we get there, and they seat us. They get us a high chair for my toddler, my son is playing on his game. Our waitress must have been new, and literally just started. She wrote down all the alcohol on her note pad, and wasn't too sure of everything. We ordered some margaritas as it was still happy hour. They weren't good at all - they didn't seem to have any alcohol - If that was a margarita, then I must be an alcoholic LOL. So my mother in law went to the bartender, and they got the bartender in charge - he made the margaritas and they were PERFECT. I don't know his name, but he called himself the Irish bartender (has a tattoo of something Irish too!). 

Then we decided to order some appetizers... and the "menu" only had three entrees on it - tacos, fajitas or burrito..... Sad. The website showed SO much more than that! They call it a summer menu. 

The food was pretty good, but it took forever to get it. 

I don't think I'll be back. Or if I come back it will be for late night drinks with friends, but not ever gonna come back just to eat or stop by. 

Just be warned, there wasn't hardly anyone there when we were there and it was still slow. I can't imagine it would be any faster if they were busy... :(

I give it a 3 just for the Irish bartender guy. He was amazing!
