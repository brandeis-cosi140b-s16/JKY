The margaritas where LARGE and tasty.  The salsa was very fresh but I had expected more kick to it...since we were at a Mexican restaurant.

We also ordered the cilantro lime chicken wings.  A dozen for 9.99.  With tip, the order of wings & 4 margaritas we paid about $55 total.  So not toooo bad.

This was another one of those places where no one wears a name tag. We were unaware of our servers name until the check came. (the other being LGO)
