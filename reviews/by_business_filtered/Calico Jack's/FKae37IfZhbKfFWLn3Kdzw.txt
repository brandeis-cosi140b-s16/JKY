Shockingly bad experience.  Stay away.  

We decided to check this place out after seeing a writeup that they were relaunching this restaurant.  If this was the relaunch, I'm glad I hadn't been before because the experience was awful.  

We arrived after the 9/15/13 Cardinal game.  We were disappointed to find the Event Menu since it was after the game and the place wasn't busy (seems like they could serve a dinner crowd at this time if they wanted to).  Anyway, we ordered a beer, wine, chips & salsa and the mini chimichangas.  The server then informed us that they were sold out of the chimis and they were also out of salsa.  That's right, OUT OF SALSA!!!   I'm sorry - but if I were running a mexican restaurant - I would go to the Fry's up the street and buy the ingredients to make more salsa.  OR - go to Costco and get buckets of Pace.  To accept that they were out of salsa - and would be for the rest of the day - is unforgivable. 

We switched our order to just the jalapeno poppers and got our drinks -- both of which were warm.  And, although we were inside - it was hot.  Fans blowing everywhere but there didn't seem to be any AC on.  

Lastly - it was loud.  Not loud because it was crowded - but loud because they had the Sunday night football game on - which was in a rain / lightening delay - so we could hear Dan Patrick and others kill time waiting for the game to start.  IMO - putting music on and at a lower volume would have been the appropriate until the game came back on.

I thought about contacting the manager to complain but realized I don't want to go back.  Stay away.
