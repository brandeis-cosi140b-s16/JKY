If there were an option for zero stars this place would earn it. Although our server was really nice so I guess one star goes to her. The food was horrible!!! Small cold portions that are extremely over priced- how can you mess up Mexican food this badly!?!? The only "decent" food was off the kids menu. Advice to the restaurant- just be a bar, don't serve food.
