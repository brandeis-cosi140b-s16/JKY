This place got very poor reviews but I had a decent experience.  Really a two star place that gets an extra because of the coupon.

The bartender was the only one on staff (Monday at lunch).  She didn't really know how to bar-tend, but was nice.  We had two beers each and an order of their nachos with carne asada, which was better than most.  I prefer cheese sauce (like queso dip) on top of Nachos rather than melted cheese which gets hard and cold pretty much immediately).  Pretty darn spicy too, which is a good thing

The total bill was $36.  Too expensive for the surroundings BUT, restaurant.com has a gift cert.  You buy the cert for like $3 and it is good for $25 off if you spend $35.  Good part is that it includes booze.

SO, our bill was only $11 (still tipped on $36, of course).

I won't be back without a coupon, but with one, this place is A-OK.
