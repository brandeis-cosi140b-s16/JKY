My hubby and I visited Calico Jack's this past Friday night (thankfully we didn't read all the bad review on here first). We took advantage of the Happy Hour drink specials and ordered the $2 margaritas to go with the complimentary chips and salsa.  We also grabbed the $5 appetizer specials and ordered the calamari.  Both were very good, although I prefer my calamari with a marinara sauce (they serve it with a sweet/spicy chili sauce).  For my entree, I ordered the La Torta, and I have to say that I was disappointed with it.  It's basically a grilled chicken sandwich with sliced avocado, but there was no seasoning to it--no salt, pepper, spice or anything. It was very bland.  The beans and rice that came with it were also kind of bland, so I smothered them with salsa.

The service was very prompt and courteous, and our food was delivered to our table promptly.  We really enjoyed the music soundtrack that was playing--a good mix of dance tunes on a great sound system--that was a big plus!  The ambiance was pretty cool, with a lot of leftover features from the former place (Bar Louie's), but now with a Baja vibe.

We would definitely be willing to try this place again, but would not order the same food choices.  My advice to Calico Jack's is to spice up the food and take good care of the customers!
