This place is really not worth a second look. Went here for a bachelorette party because the bride to be wanted dancing. They did have a cover but I don't think they charge girls (at least we didn't get charged). The service was slow and horrible. The whole girls dancing on top of a bar in underwear and a tank top is not my thing so I was not that impressed. The DJ was decent and kept us all dancing for awhile... the later it got the more iffy the crowd got. It was soon impossible to dance without being grabbed and cornered by guys. We ended up leaving and going somewhere we could drink and have fun without being sweat-ed on by a bunch of older men.
