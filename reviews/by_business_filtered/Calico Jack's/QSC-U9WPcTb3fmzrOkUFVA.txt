WOW.......how do you run out of tea??    They were out of tea?? Iced tea.....in ARIZONA ON GAME DAY? 

Service was horrible.  Food was just okay.  Had to get my own silverware. 
Would never go again.  Read the reviews on line before and was not looking forward to it.  However,  had to meet our group there not by choice.

You live you learn.  By the way as you walked to the women's restroom the men's door was opened and you could peek at the urinals that were being used.  Nice!!
