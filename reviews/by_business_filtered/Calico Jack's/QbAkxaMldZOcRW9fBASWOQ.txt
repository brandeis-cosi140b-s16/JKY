Ehh it's nothing fantastic.  The staff is always pretty nice and service is fine but the food could definitely be better or have better prices.  We've gone a few times just because it's so convenient to our house but it doesn't really get any better and never completely satisfied.  Our last was on an event day, which made the experience worse because prices were higher, menu was limited and we still weren't that thrilled with our food choices
