We went on a non home game day and Westgate was slow.  The restaurant has a Mexican flare tables and chairs in dining area with s large bar area with hightops. We ordered strawberry margaritas, they were generous in pour and size and topped with whipped cream.   Chips and salsa were served warm and fresh, they even have refills.  For meals we both ordered fajitas.  They offered to do a split of the 4 types of meats, however we went with the chicken.  They were served with fresh warm tortillas, pico de gallo, cheese, sour cream, the usual.  The chicken was tender sizzling on a bed of grilled onions and peppers.  They were seasoned to perfection.  Plenty food for leftovers.  While we were there the AZ Cardinal walk in dancing and having fun.  Surprising to see a cardinal seeing they were playing in Detroit.  Ramon the cardinal was a fun bonus especially for my 78 yr old mother, he was a kind young man who just wants to make people smile.  Nothing wrong with that, we need more folks like Ramon.  Give Calicos a try, just not on home game day based on others reviews. We had a nice meal. We will gladly return.
