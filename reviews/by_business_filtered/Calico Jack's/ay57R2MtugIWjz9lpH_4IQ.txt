Awful place. The food is blah and took 30 mins to arrive! Margarita was a lime sno-cone. Ordered a captain & coke, got a Bacardi and coke. Ordered a Mai tai, got a Bahama mama. The server spilled water on my husband. They gave us a ticket that we could come back and get a free drink after the concert, but by that time they charged a $10 cover for men. No wonder they didn't have a wait like everywhere else before the concert!
