Service, meh. 

Not very busy and yet couldn't get a refill. We got our chips and salsa about 2 minutes before our food. Lots of staff but none seemed to be doing anything. 

Food, meh. 

Salsa was alright. the chips were the bottom of the bag, broken into little pieces. The wife barely touched her carne asada tacos and my carnitas tacos were basically cilantro flavored. My daughter did enjoy the bacon cheesy fries. 

Price, horrible.

Portion sizes were small for the price. I guess I'm used to more bang for my buck. 

Family ambiance, poor. 

It really isn't great for kids. No separate kid menu. If you have picky kids this isn't the place to be. 

There's better Mexican places nearby. A lot of them. If you plan on tequila shots this might be the place to be but if you want a nice meal, I'd suggest passing it by.
