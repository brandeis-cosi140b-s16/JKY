Worst meal I've had in a very long time.  The restaurant was empty on a Saturday night at 6 pm and I think there's a reason.  We both had the tacos (carnitas and mahi) and they were both served cold.  The mahi itself was a little warm, like it had just been cooked, but the carnitas felt and tasted like it had come out of the fridge.  The tortillas were cold and hard.  Rice and beans were at best room temperature.  Wash this down with $6 beers?

I'm sure this place relies on events at the local arenas for it's business and since there was nothing going on it put forth a half-assed attempt.

Would not return.
