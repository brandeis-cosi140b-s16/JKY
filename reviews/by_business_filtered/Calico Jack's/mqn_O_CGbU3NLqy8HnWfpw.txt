Stopped in before a concert and was seated right away. Then it took forever to get a server over for drinks and a food order. The server was MIA most of the time. Food was a little less than average. The decor was OK but seemed a little hard. With a name like Calico Jacks I expected caribbean with a pirate theme, not tex-mex and skull art. That's just my opinion and does not effect my rating. The manager looked like he hated everyone and was looking for a fight. The bright side is the bartender they had on that night was awesome. Fun, friendly and was a lot more helpful than our server.
