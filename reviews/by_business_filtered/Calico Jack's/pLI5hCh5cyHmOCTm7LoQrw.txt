Dropped by Calico Jack's after tonight's Red Wings victory in Game 3 to kill time and let traffic thin.  Scanned the area and decided to give these folks our business.  We got inside where a total of maybe 5 or 6 other people were eating and drinking.

We took a seat and waited far too long for service for such an empty place.  Once we were served the folks were friendly enough and I was high on Red Wings victory so I let it slide.

Then we ordered...

Ordered the quesadillas and two beers (Tecate).  First our beer arrived...in cans.  I've never been served beer in a can unless it was PBR and even then we were told up front it was in a can.  Okay, I can live with that.

Then the quesadillas arrived.  They were no better than Taco Bell and probably triple the cost.  I expect to get gouged a bit at a restaurant just outside an arena but this was ridiculous.

Tonight was the first and last time I will visit Calico Jack's.  For the prices charged the food has to be superior to edible for me to even think of returning.
