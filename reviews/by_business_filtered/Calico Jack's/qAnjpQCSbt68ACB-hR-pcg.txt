Years back I would always be here but went back and whoooa what a change and not in a good way :/Would give 0 stars but I can't. Horrible place to go.  Only go if you want your night to be ruined.  Rude people working there. They don't have manners they talk back to you. Very poor customer service was only their for 5 minutes. Guy working their was acting like he owned Westgate and said to go back to Phx. HAAAAA I live out west so kinda sad that they have people like this running this place.
