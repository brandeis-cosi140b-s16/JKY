TERRIBLE!!  We didn't even get a chance to eat.  We came in on a Monday night, there was NO one there.  We sat down, and waited...and waited...and waited.  Finally we went and asked the bartender for menus, we were given one.  We made our choice, still no waiter/waitress.  The bartender at that point disappeared as well.  We got up and found him hiding on the other side of the bar, texting. Upon leaving, I said "I guess we will leave since you have no waiters" and was answered with a rude, under-his-breath comment from the bartender, who barely looked up.  No thanks, too many other choices of places that will actually appreciate my business.  This place won't last long with this kind of service...no wonder it was empty.
