First time visiting this location at Westgate. Showed up on a Saturday before it got too busy so we were able to chill for awhile and enjoy the music and atmosphere. Around 10 or so they started clearing the tables from the floor. The DJ was playing pretty good music and had the dance floor pretty full. 

It was a cool spot to chill with some friends while visiting for a weekend.
