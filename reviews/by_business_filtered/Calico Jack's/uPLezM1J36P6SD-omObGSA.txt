The worst Mexican food I have had in my 58 years living.  Had a chicken burrito I would not feed to my dog, others in our party were also very disappointed.  Food was cold, portions small, salsa terrible and food over priced. Small expensive drinks during happy hour. No surprise the place was very empty.  

Go to one of the other good places in Westgate, I will never visit this place again.
I hope I don't get sick!
