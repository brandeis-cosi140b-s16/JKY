Canteen is refreshing among the "strictly-a-bar" bars on Mill Avenue. They serve food, and pretty good food at that. It's evident they are making a good effort to not just be another place for the frat boys to get sloshed on Fridays, but to be a good place to day drink or have a happy hour snack. 

My friend and I come to Canteen often during the school year to have a margarita and tacos after class. The service has always been really good, the bartenders know how to make a good drink, and the outside patio is pleasant with misters and even purse hooks under the bar (which I got wayyyy too excited about the first time).

I've been once or twice on a weekend night, and the bouncers were surprisingly nice for Mill Avenue, the bartender efficient, the drinks just as good as their non-rushed counterparts, and while the dance floor is small, the DJ was pretty good and everyone was having a blast.
