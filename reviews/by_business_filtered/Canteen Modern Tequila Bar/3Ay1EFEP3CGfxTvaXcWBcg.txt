Went for happy hour last Saturday night and found a buzzing yet not overly crowded bar scene. Slow yet friendly service. Great half price tequilas, if you know what you're doing (we did not, and were not offered any help deciphering their giant tequila offerings).

Moved to the dining room for dinner. Rushed server in a slow room brought us our appetizer and entree at the same time, which always irritates me, but the pork tacos for two (make your own) were delicious (I'd skip the "tamale" appetizers next time). Finished the night with an awesome rice pudding and sopapillas.

We'd go back--I loved the atmosphere and decor!
