Went to the Canteen for a Meetup and I had a good time. It's a nice hangout and the atmosphere does contribute to mingle due to open areas and smaller seating arrangements. Our poor waitress had to bob and weave between the group members everytime to check or deliver - she did it with a subtle smile.

I found the service to be very good, and the happy hour menu well populated.  I didn't dive too deep into the menu, but I had a few drinks and that went off without a hitch. I don't recommend the guacamole - not that there is anything wrong with it, but it's not like a place where the guacamole is.. you know, just that good.

The wait staff is cute and attentive, I have no complains here at all. The place is clean and well laid out. If I have a complaint, then it has to be that it was a little loud for people to mingle. This can be a pro and a con, because that means that smaller groups naturally develop and that is good.  

As I haven't been here at night, but I must say that for a Happy Hour event - this place is to recommend. Absolutely! Now we just have to see how long this place stays open, before it turns into something hipper and obnoxious.

.. und das ist meiner bescheidenen meinung nach.
