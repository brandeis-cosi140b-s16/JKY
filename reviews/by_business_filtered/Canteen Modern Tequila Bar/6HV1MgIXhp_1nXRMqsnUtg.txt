I have only been for happy hour, but it is a five star fare! 

My high status man candy and I had several margaritas over chips and salsa all for under $20. 

The Casa Margarita is a little sweet, but very good once the ice melts a little bit. I was slightly disappointed that they didn't offer a blended option, but I was happy enough with on the rocks.

The chips were light and crunchy and came with three different salsas. I liked the brownish green stuff the best (sorry, the real name escapes me).
The tomato based salsa looks and tastes like marinara sauce and the pico is way too chunky. 

The decor is adorable! I loved everything from the Ikea lighting fixtures to the over-sized Dia de los Muertos skulls. I also liked the half the bar was inside and half was out because it really opened up the area. 

I can't wait to go back for more!
