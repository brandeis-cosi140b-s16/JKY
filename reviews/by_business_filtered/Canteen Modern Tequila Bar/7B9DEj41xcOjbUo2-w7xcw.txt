HELLS YES !! After an Angels Spring Training win we headed to this bar and were greeted by a bubbly buxom college girl who took us our table. I love the cool modern hip layout of this place, it has big ball chandelier light looking things and sofas where you can lounge when you eat, its all really quite cozy ! 
I had 2 margaritas from the happy hour menu and was completely toasted with them ! The street tacos were pretty good although I wish you could mix them and get different kinds. I loved the carnitas and mushroom tacos, delicious and very filling. We also split the hot wings and for some reason, our waitress thought we wanted them naked but whatever, the dipping sauce was amazing !
