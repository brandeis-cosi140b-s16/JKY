I've been a huge fan of Canteen since it opened. But I went yesterday for the one year celebration and I'm not so sure about it anymore. The new menu isn't much to be desired. That's so so so sad because the tacos were friggin' delicious before. Why mess with a good thing? The chicken tacos used to be the best I have ever had. Now? Meh. We also tried the steak tacos and they were super dry and flavorless. The mushroom tacos used to have large chunky mushrooms in them and now they are all minced up. Not a fan. For some reason they stopped using the adorable little taco stands. WHY?! They also remodeled a bunch and I suppose it's fine...but the mini tiny tables that are a foot and a half off the ground with benches that are super far apart don't make for the most convenient place to eat and have conversations. The house marg is still my favorite and they have delicious chipotle salsa. I'll still go for happy hour, and this is still the only place worth going on Mill, but WHY Canteen, WHYYYY?!
