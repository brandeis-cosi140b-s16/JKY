The experience started out a little slow but quickly turned into a great time.  We had the Mushroom taco, Pork Taco and Fish Taco.  The Mushroom Taco should only be ordered if you are vegetarian.  The pork taco was outstanding.  I don't typically order pork but the people I was with did.  we all shared the tacos.  The pork was so good we ordered another order.  Good service, good food and decent prices.  A high recommendation.
