Happy Hour every day from 4-6:30! It can be tough to find a decent HH on the weekend. 

My husband and I each ordered a house margarita ($4 each) -- they were just OK, a little sweet for my taste and so so tequila, but it's pretty hard to beat a $4 margy. 

We also got: 
-an order of chips and salsa ($2): DELICIOUS!

-steak tostadas ($3.50): 3 mini ones per order, easy on the steak, topped with what seemed like a salad tossed in a bit too much dressing 

-shredded beef flautas ($3): 3 of them smothered in enchilada sauce, lettuce, and drizzled with sour cream. these were tasty but they weren't very warm

-canteen wings ($4): 6 chicken wings smothered in either buffalo or tamarind sauce (we got the buffalo, it was good) and served with some rubbery celery sticks

The food on the happy hour menu could use some improvements. I would consider the flautas again but would absolutely send them back next time if not heated properly. Pass on the tostadas. I would get the wings and the chips/salsa again. I would be interested to try the tamarind wing sauce next time; the server described it as sweet and spicy. 

Overall, I can't really complain about so much food and a couple of margys for $20. 

I should mention that I had been here once before to order from the regular menu. I split an order of the pork street tacos and an order of the mushroom street tacos with my husband. We thought both were terrific. Husband works nearby and periodically stops here with coworkers; he says the guacamole is also tasty.
