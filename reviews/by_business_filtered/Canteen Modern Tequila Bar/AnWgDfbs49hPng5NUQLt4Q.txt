Great happy hour deal with very good margaritas (you can't even taste the tequila- a plus!) and yummy tacos. Haven't tried much else here except for a disgusting vodka drink...but what was I thinking ordering vodka at a tequila bar? Decor is nice. Service is heavily lacking. Came here the first time and no drink menus? Came here the 2nd time and the server never brought our waters, even after we asked 3 times. He had to double-check our order more than once. Why? 

The hostesses in front didn't seem to have a clue about what was going on during their  "Grand Opening". And the thing that irked me the most was that the bathroom stall didn't have the toilet paper roll attached to the wall. The roll was just sitting on top of the toilet! If you're going to open up a "nice" place, at least be READY with competent servers and TP rolls attached to the side of the stalls. Sheesh.
