I went to Canteen for a friend's birthday dinner. It has a great atmosphere! The pineapple Patron was infused in house, and our server was super hot. After a few samples of the Patron everyone let her know that. I had the carne asada tacos and they were really good. I have had carne asada from everywhere(including Mexico), and this was easily in my top 5. It is a little bit pricey, but its Mill, what do you expect?
