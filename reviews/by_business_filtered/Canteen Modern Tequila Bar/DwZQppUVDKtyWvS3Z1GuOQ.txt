Stopped in for a quick drink. I wanted tequila, but not a margarita and late-night, there was no drink menu around so I stuck with vodka soda, which ended up being a vodka water sans lime I sucked down before we got out of there! The mixed drinks were served in small plastic cups and the vinyl banquette we sat on was peeling like an old school bus seat! It has potential to be such a beautiful lounge with the dark spaces and open bar, but those details just made it seem cheap and uncared for. This has been on my check it out list for a while, but turns out I wasn't missing much!
