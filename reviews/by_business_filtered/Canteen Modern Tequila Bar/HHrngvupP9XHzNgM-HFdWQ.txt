Love this place - what a nice addition to Tempe.  I was getting worried since so many good businesses had left the Mill Avenue area, but this place gives me hope for a resurgence.  The decor is very eclectic and cool, the bar is huge and has indoor/outdoor seats, the patios are very nice, the service is great and the menu is extensive!
