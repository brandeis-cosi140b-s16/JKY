I went for lunch with a large group and the place was pleasantly empty. The decor is very modern and has a comfortable lounge style.

The chips and salsa are a great starter. You get three tasty kinds of salsa: brown, red, and pico de gallo. The tortilla chips are fried perfectly. They are extremely light and crispy.

I tried the steak tostadas. The meat had a food flavor and the tortillas were nice and crunchy. The red jalape√±o and fresh cilantro on top brought excitement to each bite. 

The dishes are small, but they are are also inexpensive at $6-10 each. Along with the chips and salsa, I got plenty of food, so portion sizes are only an issue for big eaters. It seems like a great place to share several dishes between everyone. 

I would definately go back for the food, but I wonder if this place becomes a standing-room only drunk fest when it gets busier and later in the evening (if so, no thanks).
