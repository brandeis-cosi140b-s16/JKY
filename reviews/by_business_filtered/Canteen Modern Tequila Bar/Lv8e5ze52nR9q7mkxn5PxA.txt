One cent shot was fun. I went there with my friend when I was visiting her in Phoenix. We ordered for a chicken dish, but the server got it mixed up and we ended up with shimp. I dont like shrimp. Anywho, she gave us free shots. Food is ok, if I go there again, I would only go for the happy hour. Margaritas are awesome btw.
