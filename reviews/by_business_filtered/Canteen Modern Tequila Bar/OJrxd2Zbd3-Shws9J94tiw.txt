This place is ok... I had the fish tacos, and they were so boring. They had cabbage(I think) and some pretty tasty hot red pepper on them. However, the menu described it as a slaw, and it was by no means slaw like. They were extremely dry, and the breading was so thick, and the pieces of fish were teensy. 
The server said they were amazing, so I was expecting a lot more. Perhaps I should've gotten something else, but seriously fish tacos are pretty hard to screw up!
 Oh well, I'll probably try them again sometime, but I think I'll try another item on the menu!
