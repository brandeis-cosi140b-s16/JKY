I'll preface this review by saying that I was there on a Saturday night, and the place was pretty packed and loud. I have no idea what this place is like during the day, but if you're like me and don't enjoy strangers bumping into you every 30 seconds, don't go on a Saturday night.

This brings me to the important part of my review, which is how I almost had to throw down with some v-neck clad, Jersey Shore hopeful who felt it necessary to almost knock my girlfriend and I down as he walked past. I guess he didn't like the fact that I pushed back to avoid falling into the table my friends were sitting at, because he got into a staring contest with me, trying to size me up. Personally, I don't care who you are; there is no excuse for acting like that, especially to a lady, and then trying to get in my face about it because I didn't allow you to manhandle me. I told him if he tried that again, we could finish the conversation outside. I guess he knew better than to try anything when security guards are near, because he left. 

That being said, there's a high risk of these incidents happening in places like these, where there is absolutely no room to walk by, people are drunk and ignorant, and egos are running high. It takes away from an otherwise enjoyable experience. The music was good, the beer was cold, and my friends and I had a great time. However, due to that incident I had, I don't see myself going back. It's a shame because it is otherwise a pretty cool place.
