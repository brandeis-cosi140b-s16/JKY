I will admit I didn't have the highest of expectations for Canteen as Mill Ave has disappointed before. What I did have was a Groupon so on Friday night the boyfriend and I decided to cash it in. 

Walking in I was surprised at how nice the place was. And the hostesses were friendly too. My expectations began to change. There was a wait since it was Friday but once we were seated we got a great booth and settled in. The atmosphere is great for date night. 

I ordered a hibiscus margarita and the pork chop and boyfriend ordered chicken tacos and onion rings. The margarita was delish - which if you're gonna call yourself a tequila bar, it better be good. They delivered. The pork chop was amazing. It was seasoned perfectly and nice and juicy. It was served on a cheesy, slightly spicy rice that complimented it perfectly.
Boyfriend really liked his tacos and the dip that comes with the onion rings is awesome. We were stuffed but had to try the rice pudding anyway. It was also tasty - creamy and cinnamon-y served with mini sopapillas. A nice wrap up to the meal.

And throughout the night the staff was great. My water glass was always full, our waiter checked back with us several times and the service was quick with everything. Other restaurants could use a lesson from the Canteen staff on how to treat customers. We felt comfortable and taken care of all night.

My expectation were far surpassed. I can't wait to go back to Canteen. Even without a Groupon the food and drinks are worth it. Great place!
