This place is awesome. The guacamole is great, and so are the tacos. They are smaller than typical tacos, but they are delicious. We ordered, pork, fish, and chicken. The tacos are similar to those at Gallo Blanco. 

We came here for happy hour which is great. They do not serve anything but tequila, or beer, so dont go looking for a mojito or anything. The prices are great for tacos and guac during happy hour, not sure if I would come during regular hours. Which, is why I only gave it 4 stars. I think if you are really wanting this type of food, I'd rather pay for Gallo Blanco. The patio is bigger now at Canteen, and the weather is getting better, so its a great time to go during the day. 

Happy hour is from 4-6:30 and its half price tacos/guacamole/margaritas. The atmosphere is great, not too much of a college kid crowd, even though its right on Mill ave. The decorations are great.

Our service has always been top notch every single time, and the servers and bartenders are attentive, informative, and prompt. 

Great place!
