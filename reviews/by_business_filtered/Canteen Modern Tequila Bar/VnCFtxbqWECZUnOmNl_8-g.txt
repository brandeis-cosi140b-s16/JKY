The food at Canteen was so-so; steak tostadas and a chipotle relleno were interesting.  The onion rings and chicken skewers were fine.  And, the fried fish tacos were pretty light (not in a good way).

But I liked the bartenders, I liked the sex appeal, I liked the music, and I LOVED $2 16-oz. drafts of light beer during happy hour.  In fact, the prices for everything during happy hour were great, and then you add in good-looking people and 82-degree temperatures...maybe it's the $2.50 domestic bottles talking, but I enjoyed myself, to say the least.  I probably won't go back...oh, wait a minute, last night we turned down the apparent sausage-fest at World of Beer to get a second round of drinks at the bar last night after an ASU game nearby!!
