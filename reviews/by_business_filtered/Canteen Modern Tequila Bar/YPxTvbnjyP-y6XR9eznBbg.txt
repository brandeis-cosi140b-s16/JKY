I went here today for lunch with my dad and it was very good! We split the pork tacos...which were awesome! Sweet, spicy, tangy...everything that you could want in a pork taco. We also got the chilled steak salad, which was surprisingly good as well. Both of these items were recommended by our waitress and both were good....so that was a plus. The two items were just enough for the two of us and it only cost about 17 dollars...not a bad deal. I will be back.
