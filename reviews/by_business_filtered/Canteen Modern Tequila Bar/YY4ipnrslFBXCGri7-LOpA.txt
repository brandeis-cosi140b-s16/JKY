A much needed, nice, upscale place to eat in the ASU area. Tacos are very good, the salsa is good, and the vibe is just right. Great place to take a date. They also have bar TVs for games on the weekends. The patio and open air bar is nice. Occasionally they have bands on the back patio, which is cool.
