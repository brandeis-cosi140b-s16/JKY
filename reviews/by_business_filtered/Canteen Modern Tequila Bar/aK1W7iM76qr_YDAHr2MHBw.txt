Good HH, wont go any other time due to all the tool bags running around in their affliction gear! No thanks. Good HH food and drinks and conveniently close but I would not come here if it gets too packed with college scum! I hate MILL AVE as it is but since I live close its not bad if you come early and bail when all the College douchebags start rolling in. The staff is typical too cool for school college kids who have no idea how the service industry really works. Clueless! Sometimes it's OK, most of the time its mediocre! I have only been here twice for HH, but the taco's are still expensive for what they are. The food is decent though as mentioned. Just stay away if it is super busy! They can't handle the crowd.
