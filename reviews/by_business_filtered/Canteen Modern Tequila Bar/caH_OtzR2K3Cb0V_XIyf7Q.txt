I would say this is my favorite place on Mill.  It's classier than a lot of the bars there, and I don't feel as old as I usually do in Tempe haha.  The atmosphere is classy, and trendy, perfect for some quiet cocktails with friends.  My favorite cocktail, grapefruit juice and tequila, was listed as one of the best tequila cocktails in Phoenix by AZ Central.com.  It's refreshing and light.
