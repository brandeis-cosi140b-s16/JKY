My first visit upon the grand opening was not good. I thought the bar was huge and empty. I ordered a beer and it was warm. So I hadn't been back in a long time. 

I decided to give it another try when some friends had suggested going to Canteen. It was fun and full of people. My beverages tasted much better this time. I liked the tacos and short rib appetizer. The BBQ sauce is zesty and sweet and the meat falls right off the bone! YUM!!!

I don't like that the bathrooms are very small and lines extend out through the hand washing area, which is open to part of the restaurant area. That was my main complaint. It's kind of awkward to be in line to use the bathroom as people are checking their make up and washing hands..
