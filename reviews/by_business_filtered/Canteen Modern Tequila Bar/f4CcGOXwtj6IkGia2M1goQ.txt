The place caught my attention from the outside. A modern looking tequila bar? On Mill Ave? I'm in!!!

Saw the patio seating and grabed one right on the corner. Excellent spot. The place had a great selection of drinks to choose from. Food choices looked pretty solid too (but I didn't eat). Pretty much down hill from there. The prices were a bit steep. I saw a great sounding margarita...$9!! To be fair it was one of the more expensive drinks on the menu.But for that I was expecting something reeeeeeeaally good. It was reeeeeeeeally average. Had a drink and then waited for probably 40 minutes for the check. Not a waiter or waitress in sight. This was even after the waitress said she'd bring the check.....

Too many choices in this town to go back. Sorry.
