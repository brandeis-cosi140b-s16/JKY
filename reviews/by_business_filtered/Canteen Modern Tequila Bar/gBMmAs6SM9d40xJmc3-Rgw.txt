When they shy away from shots, I always tell my friends that it doesn't matter how they feel about tequila. It's just something you have to learn how to do as part of a successful, complete life. But with Canteen in the mix, even the wussiest drinkers can find something that works for them.

Step your game up and get some MEZCAL. It's not sold at many bars, and my Del Maguey Crema had a sweet, smoky burn on the way down. Yum. I'll be back for the margaritas, and maybe even lunch some time. If Canteen were any more legit, you'd find a worm at the bottom of your glass.
