AMAZING. I've been to Canteen a few times but this last time was the best experience ever. Olivia is a star! I go to Canteen because they have the best margaritas (the paloma is my all time fav) and the best chilled steak salad. Their steak tacos are also amazing. This last time, Olivia made me feel right at home and I can't even find the words to describe how amazing her service was. I tipped her in cash and a cupcake! That's how grateful I was! She recommended great margaritas, great food, and socialized with us. She was super busy but didn't show it and she performed excellently under pressure. I will definitely be back for more!
