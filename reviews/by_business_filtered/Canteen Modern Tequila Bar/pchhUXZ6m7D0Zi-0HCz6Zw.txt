Decided to take a walk on Mill on this beautiful Friday, was craving chips and salsa and wanted to sit outside to enjoy the weather so the roommate and I decided to try something new and came here. 

First impressions are a big deal, right?! Well tell that to the hostess Danielle, actually don't just tell her, retrain her. Upon entering we asked for a "front" patio seat and she tried to talk us out of it. From a customer service perspective that's not GREAT customer service. I don't even think that's good customer service. You're supposed to accommodate and cater to the customer. After asking the SERVER if it was "okay" she then said "yeah, I can" & took us to a different table then we asked for. Disappointing. Then the 2 gentlemen behind us asked her for the same thing! And through the window we could see by her hand movement and body language she was telling them the same thing she told us! They just wanted what we wanted both us and the gentlemen did not care we JUST wanted to sit outside and enjoy the weather, food, & ppl watch. We were both very low maintenance. If I based my experience on first impression I would NOT be back. 

However, lucky it was a nice day and the server was cool, very relaxed yet friendly. Menu was simple. Prices were great. 

*i would have rated this 3.5 but didn't have that option.
