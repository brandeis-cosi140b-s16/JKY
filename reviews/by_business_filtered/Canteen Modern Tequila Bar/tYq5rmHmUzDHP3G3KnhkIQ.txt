For a killer outdoor patio along Mill Ave. in downtown Tempe for late-night drinks with a cool crowd, this is the place! I entered thru the back and never even went inside... and can't wait to go back next time I'm in town. The servers were quick and kind. The drinks were cold and cheap. The other patrons were cute and fun. When you're in Arizona, you gotta take advantage of the great weather and enjoy your cocktails outdoors after the sun goes down - I did it here! You should too.
