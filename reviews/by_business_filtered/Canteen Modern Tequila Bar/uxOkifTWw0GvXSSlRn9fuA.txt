Canteen offers amazing food and drinks in a trendy setting. We stopped by for happy hour and enjoyed $3 margaritas, $2 well drinks, and pork tacos. The tacos are small but flavorful. They're usually $9 but since it was happy hour they were only $4.50. Our server was awesome he was friendly and had witty comebacks when my boyfriend joked with him. At the end of our meal there were some billing issues. The manager came out, introduced himself, and gave me his number. I was impressed with how he handled the situation. At night Canteen is a bar destination and gets really packed. Not really my thing but worth checking out if you're into the ASU bar scene.
