The building is beautiful, the bathrooms are clean (and modern feeling with a shared washroom) and the patio is pretty cool.  I liked sitting at the bar AND being outside so that's a total plus for me.  Great Tequila selection (DUH) and the bartender made me one of THE best margaritas I have ever had outside of my own house.  They were out of agave nectar so he used citrus flower water (I don't really know that that is either) but it rocked so I'll definitely be back for that again.  Although we didn't eat, the menu looked rather run-of-the-mill-Tex-Mex-bar-food.  There isn't anything wrong with that but I am sure a creative mind in the kitchen could kick it up a couple notches.  Their check-in deal was pretty cool too.  I wasn't all that crowded for a Monday night at all but even with that - service was standard - no real conversation or personality but we got what we needed.

Overall, I'd tell you to check this place out.  It's worth the visit even if it is just once.
