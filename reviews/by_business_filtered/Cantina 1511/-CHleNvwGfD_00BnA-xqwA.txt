I don't give five stars very often, but had to give it up to Cantina 1511 after having an AMAZING dinner there for Charlotte Restaurant week this month.  Typically, I wouldn't choose to go to a Mexican place for an expensive dinner since I believe you can get really good Mexican food for cheap at other places, but this place had good reviews and was worth a shot so we went.

Everything we had for dinner was delicious.  We started off with the guacamole.  I was at first disappointed with the small portion, but as soon as I saw the portions of the rest of our meal, I was glad I didn't waste my appetite on just the first course!  I had their salad while my husband had the soup and both were very tasty.

We were already getting pretty full from appetizers when our main courses came out and they were just...OMG.  If you go, you MUST try the short rib.  Juicy, tender, full of flavor and HUGE!  We ended up having to take most of our meal home because we wanted to save it for another day!

The server was also so amazing and attentive.  I mentioned I was allergic to nuts and the dessert they had slated for the Restaurant Week menu had nuts and he was able to replace it with the bread pudding instead, and the bread pudding was literally the best that I've ever had in my entire life.  I would go back just to have the bread pudding again.

Again, I tend to be pretty critical of places and even some of my favorite places I've only given four stars, but had such a great experience here, it definitely deserves five stars and another visit!
