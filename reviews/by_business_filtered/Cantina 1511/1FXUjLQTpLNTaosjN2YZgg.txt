One of the few great mexican options in the Charlotte area!

While there are several things we don't enjoy from this menu, there are tons of options and you are bound to find the right meal for you.  Lately, we have been following the paleo lifestyle and it's difficult to eat out.  Not the case here surprisingly.  There are plenty of fajita options, ceviche options, and other dishes.  Prior to following Paleo, we always ordered nachos, enchiladas, margaritas and were more than satisfied!

I very much enjoy the basic mexican dive, but if you want to step it up a notch with a bit of American flare in recipe, stop in Cantina 1511.
