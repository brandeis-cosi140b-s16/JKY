I've tried making guacamole at home with everything Cantina 1511 uses for the tableside preparation, but it must be a mystery, because theirs is impossible to recreate. The menu is extensive and loaded with more choices than Netflix on a good day. The recent menu redesign has lots of bright colors and looks like a Post-It note cram session, prompting many bad memories (geology finals) and the waiter promising any kind of guidance with the menu/counseling for bad exam experiences. Service: 1. Redesign: 0.

The menu breaks down into different categories: comida autentica mexicana (which lists Mexican specialties in Spanish) and Tex Mex Standards. Picking out just a few tacos from the Magnificent Seven is tricky, but the pescado frito (fish) taco is pretty spectacular. I like the creative fish tacos or the carnitas, but the ancho chicken salad is my favorite. Tossed with chopped romaine lettuce and garbanzo beans, the flavors are familiarly Mexican, but the dish is fresh and just as filling as an enchilada. Prices are a little bit higher, reflecting a quality difference with other Tex-Mex joints, which I think is pretty justifiable.

The inside's a little noisy, but just like the menu, the paper mobile decorations and a banging Spanish poster of Gone With the Wind are a contemporary update of the Tex Mex cantina. Whenever I'm in town, my sister and I make a point to stop here.
