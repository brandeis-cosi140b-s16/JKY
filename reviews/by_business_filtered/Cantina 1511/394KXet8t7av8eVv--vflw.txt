I loved this restaurant at the East Blvd location and we were excited to try the new location at Park Road.

It was one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had.
-Host staff was rude and quoted us a 30 min wait. After 35 min I politely asked our place on the list. 5 people ahead of us. Really? Also host staff were rude
- After a 50 minute wait we were finally seated. Our party could barely hear each other over the "musician"
-appetizers took  25 min to arrive. Queso was disgusting, Qdoba across the street has better  food overall 
-entrees arrived after an hour of being seated. Food was bland and cold
-Waited 20 min for the check

Best part of this meal was going home. Horrible service, horrible food, horrible experience. Sad because I used to love the margaritas and tacos here
