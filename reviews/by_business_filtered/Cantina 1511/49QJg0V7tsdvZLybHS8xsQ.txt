We used to go to the East Blvd location all the time so we finally were able to get to the Park Rd location yesterday. The inside looks nice, the service at the bar was good, but was so disappointed in everything else.

They downsized the tortilla chip bowls. The red salsa, which we loved, was mega salty. When my husband, who loves salt, says something is salty, it's salty. We can no longer order a pint of beer. It's either 12 or 20 oz. Yet the price for the 12oz is the same as the old pint.  The table side guac, one of our faves, was salty. My vegan burrito was salty and I found traces of goat cheese in it. My husbands enchilada was salty.  

Seriously, put down the salt shaker!  

We are hoping this was just a fluke because for all the years we were going to the East Blvd location we never had a bad anything.  

We'll be back and hoping for a better food experience.
