My husband and I love to come here when we are in the mood for Mexican. Even when they are busy, the service has always been good for us. The Chimichangas are our favorite. Their salsa is really good. It has a little bit of a kick without being very spicy. 

My husband got a burger there once and said it wasn't very good. Other than that, their food has always been great.
