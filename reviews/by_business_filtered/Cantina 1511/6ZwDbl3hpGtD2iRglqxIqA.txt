I like 1511 ok....it's a trendy spot spot for some fresh Tex-Mex. It's a little pricey for what you get. The Enchiladas de Denis are good, but everything borders dangerously close on being wayyyy too smothered in sauces of one variety or another (or both at the same time). You can kind of lose the rest of the food underneath all the sauce, and in turn, it makes the dishes overwhelmingly rich.  I always leave with a doggy bag (not necessarily a bad thing!) due to the food being so heavy!  Or it could be the massive amounts of chips and salsa I consume before the food arrives.....

I'm a sucker for table-side service....be it a bananas foster, waiter prepared caesar, carved whole duck.  So needless to say, I enjoyed the tableside guacamole.  But there is an operational advantage here too...when avocadoes oxidize, they turn brown and mushy.  Even after adding lime juice, it can still lead to a disappointing guac experience when you get a bowl of brownish green goo.  Good guac is creamy, not gooey!  You get the good guac here.  An overzealous waiter sqeezed some lime right into my eye when we were dining with some friends here on our last visit.  Made for some comedic relief to the dinner convo.

This place is always packed, so don't be surprised if dinner takes a little while to come out.  All in all not my favorite mexican spot, but I still come here about once a month, either for lunch with colleagues or dinner with the wife.  So I can't really bash too hard on a place I return to with some level of frequency!
