Awesome brunch option! Will go back for dinner for sure! Came here with the whole fam and everyone was impressed. I'm not a huge brunch guy (we went for lunch) but when I looked at the brunch menu I was intrigued...and I'm glad I tried it...really cool twist on eggs Benedict with Arepas in place of the English muffins. Can't explain how good this was. Kids had lunch quesadillas and wife had a Chimichanga everything was awesome...we'll be back for sure.
