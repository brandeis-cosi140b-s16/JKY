I had a rough time at Cantina 1511 which is shocking because I've always had a great meal there in the past. I went with a friend and we ordered out lunches. When they were brought out she found something in her taco. It wasn't a hair but it looked like a bristle from a brush. Then I got a bone in my taco. The GM was fantastic and came right over and took care of our meal for us after apologizing a million times. Once would have been enough but he really wanted us to be happy. That is great customer service. I've eaten here a million times before and this is the only time I've ever had a problem but it was quickly corrected by them. They took our plates back and replaced our meals then kindly picked up our check. I will definitely go back again.
