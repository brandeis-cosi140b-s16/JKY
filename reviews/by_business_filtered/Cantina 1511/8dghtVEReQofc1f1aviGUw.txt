Best upscale Mexican food in Charlotte by far.  They have two locations but this is the one we go to most often.  My favorite dish is the crap and avocado quesadilla.  Table-side guacamole is the best I may have ever had.  Nice outdoor seating and really kind and helpful wait staff.  Unique selection of drinks, try the pineapple margarita.
