This meal was a big disappointment, food was not special and service was bad.  we choose to sit at bar as tables were unavailable. Had to wave bartender down to place an order, service was the worst I have experienced in years, there were a total of 7 people at the whole bar which made it so surprising .  All food was cold, and they had back waiters bring it out, could never get refills on beer, actually got worse at the end. Got desert to go since it took so long, tres lechees was terrible. I have been a regular at this groups restaurants for years as they have grown, first time I felt like I was at a chain restaurant. Hope we just had bad luck but I won't go back to that location again.
