Happy hour: Amazing, Cheap, and Drinks! I came here for a happy hour with a friend of mine (which was really a failed party, which became like a default date...) The appetizers were filling, and the drinks weren't too bad on the price. I think that there should have been a little bit more space, except I wasn't too worried about it because it was just the two of us.

Overall, I would come here for happy hour itself. South Charlotte isn't quite my scene so I don't think I would get to try out the other dinner options. We'll see if that changes though.
