I recently moved here from Los Angeles, so I was doubtful that I would find a mexican restaurant I would like.  I have been to Cantina 1511 three times now, and the first two times I would have given it two stars.   The third time it was so much better.  The regular margaritas are awful, but I tried a different one this time - something called a Papa something that has real juices in it instead of the artificial tasting floor cleaner-ish mix in the standard one.  Really good, actually. The tableside-prepared guacamole, which had been the highlight of my last trip, was again really good, and we got it with whole wheat tortillas in place of the chips to make it a little healthier.  My husband's carne asada tacos were pretty bad - they had some sickly-sweet sherry flavoring to them, but I had the fish of the day which was mahi mahi and it was really well prepared.  It was served with corn cut right from the cob and mixed with tomatoes.  Drinks took about twenty minutes to arrive, but our server was very apologetic about the situation going on at the bar.  I am glad we gave it another shot.  Also will go back for half priced bottles of wine on wednesdays!
