Cantina is always my go to for girls night out or for b'day celebrations.  It's great for crowds,  the food is pretty much always good and so is the service.  It's a bit on the pricier side for Mexican/ Tex-Mex but I think the atomosphere makes it worth the extra money.  Plus, you can split all their meals.  It is a two dollar split charge-  but they give each person a full serving of the sides-- so it really evens it out-  its a TON of food.
