One of my favorite places in Charlotte. I take out of town family and friends here, and everyone always has a good time. I like that they make the guac fresh at the table. The drinks are awesome. They have good happy hour deals on food. Sitting at the bar area is actually pleasant. Great patio for a nice day, fun to wear sunglasses, people watch, and watch the cars drive by and all the South Charlotte runners. Ambiance is not cheesy at all, hostesses and servers are friendly, etc. There is a weird fishbowl room for large groups that I would avoid if you come in a large group. But definitely make a reservation, you will need it-- this place gets packed! If you come on a Sunday after church the crowd is full of Uptown/Dilworth "society" families schmoozing. But that does not detract at all from how great Cantina is!
