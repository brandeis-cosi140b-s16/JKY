My husband and I just moved to Charlotte and were looking for a new favorite Mexican Restaurant. This was not it. There was no al a cart menu and no chicken mole (two things we like to order/ off of.) While the prices were steep the food was ok. They were completely out of there house margarita by 7 pm which sucks Bc that's my favorite kind of drink and I hadn't anticipated the price of what they did have available (they still are not serving half their drink menu understandable they just opened.) 
The staff was friendly but I was waiting for my drink to be refilled a couple times (not so good when your eating spicy food). The place was good but not for the price or the wait. I think my brother was right, the best Mexican restaurant is a shady one.
