Haven't been in years and was disappointed this time around. I think the menu has changed and not for the better. I usually like a seafood taco but choices were limited and everything seem to include jalapeno bacon. I ended up with ancho chicken which was to include avocado slices and it did not.When I asked my waitress about it she said no it did not include avocado. I guess I should have asked for the menu and pointed it out that it is listed. Anyway the chicken was bad with a strange ortega taco seasoning tast. My friend had the traditional enchilades and she said they were not bad but nothing to write home about. I am sticking with Azteca on Independence.
