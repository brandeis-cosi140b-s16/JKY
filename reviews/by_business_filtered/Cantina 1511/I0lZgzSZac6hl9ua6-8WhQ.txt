Since moving from East Blvd., we haven't visited until today for lunch.  Very pleased with the service, decor, and lunch menu.  I ordered their appetizer platter, and my wife ordered the mushroom quesidillas.  Both were excellent and piping hot.  Chips and salsa aplenty.  My only tick to 4 v. 5 stars was the taste of each offering seemed close in flavor to the other offerings we ordered.  All the food was very good and pleasantly presented.  Each piece just needed a nudge to differentiate itself from others on the plate.  That said, we'll be back!
