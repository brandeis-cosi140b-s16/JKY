Totally amazed by Cantina 1511. Not just with the food (which is always delicious) but the customer service is incredible. Yesterday we ordered fajitas to-go. Almost all the way home, we received a call from them telling us they had forgotten to give us the fajita wraps. Being rush hour, we decided to just stop by the grocery store rather than drive all the way back. Instead, they insisted on driving to our house and bringing us the wraps!! Who does that?? That's incredible. Not only did we get our wraps but a free dessert as well. Top notch service.

Thank you guys at East Blvd. Cantina and thank you Ally who took care of this for us. We were beyond impressed.
