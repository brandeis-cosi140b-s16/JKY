Ive been here plenty of times. Service has always ben excellent! Food is usually good. This last visit my tacos came out cold.... Sent them back and came out cold again. Server was very quick to fix the situation but did not seem to surprised by it. There was no manager to come over and apologize. Very disappointed in the resolution since there really wasn't one. My wife did not even eat her dish and the server didn't notice let alone offer to comp her meal as well. Lots of goofing around and major lack of customer service.
