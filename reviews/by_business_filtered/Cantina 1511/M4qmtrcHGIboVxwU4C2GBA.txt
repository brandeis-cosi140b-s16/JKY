Did you know Cantina 1511 does brunch? Well, they do. And spoiler alert: it's pretty fantastic.

My friend Erin and I were starving after our Yelp Quirks Out event at Jazzercise Charlotte. Time for a boozy brunch! Hey, we earned it with that workout, right? We tried to hit Sir Ed's, but they didn't open until 5pm. Fail. So, we wandered across the parking lot to Cantina 1511.

I'm a sucker for a spicy bloody mary, so it was a no brainer for my drink order. They use a serrano and cilantro infused Finlandia vodka for this one. Win. We weren't sure what to get. Here's what I love: the waiter completely jumped in and was honest. He told me to ax my original order and gave us his ranking for the brunch dishes. Erin went with his #2 pick: the avocado bake. I went with the #3 pick: the fajita style shrimp and grits. He nailed it with both of those dishes. They were delicious. And in case you were wondering, his number one seed is the arepas benedict.

I wasn't sure how I would feel about this new location, but I like that there seems to be more parking. Yes, the shopping center area here can get crazy, but the lot can handle all of it. 

Cantina has great salsa. The tableside made guac is a must get. The tortilla soup is solid. I think I order something different every time I come here. It's all pretty good. 

This place can handle a group pretty well. I've been here for a couple different birthdays and girls night type events. They do take reservations. You can also place orders online for pickup.
