Service was horrible.  We walked in and the hostess was talking to two men in the bar area.  There isn't much of a waiting area and there were four of us so we steppedmout ofmthe way. A couple came into the restaurant and walked to the podium...the waitress seated them right away, before even talking to us!  We waited about 15 minutes to get a seat...and then were seated in the bar area.

My husband ordered a beer.  They didn't have it.  He selected a second beer.  They didn't have that one eother.  The food was pretty good.  But when the bill came, we were charged for the beer!

For the price of the food the service should be better.  I was shocked when the bill came.
