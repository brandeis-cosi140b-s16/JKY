I love Cantina. I'm not getting the whole menu change thing, as I've been going to this place since 2009 and I don't notice a HUGE difference. ALSO, and honestly, if you want real Mexican food- go to a restaurant where you see other Mexicans sitting and eating. This is, what I consider, a white people Mexican place. Not to offend. If I want a step, or a few steps, above my normal Mexican spots I like to dine (like Marias, Azteca, etc) at Cantina. 
Love the food- I usually get the Burritos and they are LARGE. I always have enough to take home the next day. The beans always taste fresh and the chips and salsa before the meal are excellent. We've had the guac. a few times and it's great, but it's not a staple everytime we dine b/c it is a tad expensive. 
The Margheritas, though pricey, are also EXCELLENT! If you're in Charlotte and want an upscale Mexican/Tex Mex place- this is the spot to go. In fact, I'm going this weekend....Can't wait!
