Let me start off with that Cantina has been my favorite Mexican place in Charlotte until recently. Ever since they have moved to the Park Road shopping center they have been lacking. This use to be my go to spot with friends on the weekend and to bring out of town guests, however something has changed since they moved. I feel like they are becoming more of a chain restaurant. 

The service lately has been hit or miss, but mostly miss. Last time we were there (about a month ago) we had to ask for our waiter multiple times. But the worst part was the food. The menu hasn't changed (from the looks of it), but my husband and I order the SAME thing every time and something has changed. We get the  two taco combo: Ancho Polo and Marco Polo. The last time we ordered it the tacos were either not what we ordered or they changed the way they make the tacos. It tasted like a load of coleslaw on them. And not flavorful. They just didn't taste the same. We asked our server if they changed the ingredients, but she didn't know. Plus, the black beans are now brown pinto beans. Mehhh. 

Not sure what's up with Cantina lately, but we tried Paco's a few weeks ago and fell in love. I hope Cantina can step it up again.
