Still one of our favorite Tex-Mex spots!  The new location is not as intimate as the East Blvd location (the only reason this is not a 5 star rating) but they are able to accommodate more customers, so the trade-off for me is worth it.  I have never been disappointed with the meals or the service and the guacamole is consistently outstanding!  One time our server even stopped in the middle of the table-side guacamole prep and said he could not finish since the avocados he selected were not perfectly ripe.  He promptly returned with new avocados and delivered perfection in a bowl that was spiced exactly to our taste.  Very impressive!

The predominant style is indeed Tex-Mex which is my favorite but I understand it may not suit everyone.  That said there are a few "authentic Mexican" dishes that my wife gravitates toward and she is as big a fan of Cantina 1511 as I am.  Enjoy, but plan to get there early on Friday evening if you want to be seated quickly.
