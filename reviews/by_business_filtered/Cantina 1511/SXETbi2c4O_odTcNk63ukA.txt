I don't like Mexican food all that much, but I've been here twice, both times I cleaned my plate, and I plan on going back.  

I have had a taco and a burrito, and both were very good--fresh, well-seasoned, and nice presentation.  

The ambiance is good, and it always seems to be busy (a good sign for a restaurant).
