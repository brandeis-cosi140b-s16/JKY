Why didn't I think of this idea first? An upscale Mexican restaurant that's independently owned (they own Mama Ricotta's as well). This Mexican food will come with a price, but I promise you'll be very impressed with the taste.

They have some very unique Mexican dishes & you aren't going to see your ordinary Mexican menu items. They add their own flare to each dish & I'm not sure I've ever had a better enchilada dish than here. I'm not sure what sauce they use, but it sets it off. They also make the guacamole in front of you & they add a little spice to it as well. Once again, I don't think I've ever had better guacamole.

Cantina's food comes with a price, but it truly is worth it. This beats the upscale Mexican chains by a long shot. You'll leave this place impressed & wondering to yourself why you didn't think of this first.
