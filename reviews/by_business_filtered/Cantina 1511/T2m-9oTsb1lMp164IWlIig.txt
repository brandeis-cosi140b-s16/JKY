Where in Charlotte has authentic, fresh Mexican and Tex-Mex? Cantina Fifteen Eleven, of course. Once you get there, though, the question is, "Who is Dennis and why are his enchiladas so delicious?" Dennis is clearly a culinary genius who deserves a promotion and a bonus, because the roasted chicken, spinach and Mexican cheese enchiladas bathing in Chile con queso and avocado and red pepper crema is the most craveable dish on the Cantina menu. 

There are complimentary chips and two types of salsa on the the table, but that is where the similarities end compared to other Mexican restaurants. Guacamole is made table side by servers and there are creative versions of Mexican classics that are surprising and gratifying. Jicama in the Chopped Mexican Salad, goat cheese, spinach and wild mushrooms in a quesadilla, and Salmon al Pastor are just the start of a menu comprised of fresh and unexpected choices at Cantina Fifteen Eleven. 

Weekend nights are packed at the Dilworth location of Cantina, and valet parking is offered and recommended. The parking lot is small, and maneuvering within is often a tedious process.

Inside, there is ambient lighting shining from the star-shaped Mexican lanterns, comfortable seating and attentive servers and barkeeps who kept an eleven member Friday night group satisfied in a timely manner. 

In addition to the Dilworth location, there is another Cantina in the Stonecrest shopping center on Rea Road. Though the menus and food quality are identical, the Dilworth location seems to offer a more festive and authentic atmosphere.
