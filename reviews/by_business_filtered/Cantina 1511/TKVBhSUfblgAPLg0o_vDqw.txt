Oh Cantina! I am so shocked I haven't reviewed you yet! While I would simply love you for your AMAZING and fresh guac, you have so much more to offer. With Mexican, I am not hard to please, but I have never been let down my Cantina.  

To begin, the decor mixes traditional Mexican style and chic modern flair. The lightening is at the perfect level so you can relax and truly enjoy your meal. 

I have always had great service and when in doubt a tasty lime margarita and the Marco Polo Tacos will leave any visitor beyond happy and full!
