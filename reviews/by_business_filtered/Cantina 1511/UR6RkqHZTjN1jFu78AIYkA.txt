I have to say that I don't know much about Mexican food but I loooove Cantina! Only recently has their quac been pushed aside for the Number One position by Loco Lime. But it is still top notch. The fish taco appetizer is more than enough food for dinner! Great serving sizes no matter what you get. You can definitely split the fajitas since a single order is ginormous. The staff here is always super pleasant and helpful. I have been both to the Rea Road location and East and have to say quality and atmosphere and staff-friendliness is consistently excellent! Love the patio on East blvd location during the summer :-D
