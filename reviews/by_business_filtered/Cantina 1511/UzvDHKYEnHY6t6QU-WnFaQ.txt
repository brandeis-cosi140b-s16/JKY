New to the Charlotte area and I'm not gonna play the I can't give something 5 stars cause nothing is perfect gig. I have it 5 stars because for what it is the place has perfected their craft. Valet parking recommended otherwise parking is tight around dinner time. Our waiter Carlos was energetic and very knowledgeable of all the dishes. Suggestions were appreciated because it lead to try duck for the first time.

We ordered the table side guac because of how good we heard it was and they made it to your preference right there next to you. My girlfriend got fresh margaritas, and chicken enchiladas which had a spinach and cheese filling and a queso sauce on top. I ordered 3 tacos, carne asada in chunks, duck breaded with cilantro, and shrimp and scallop with a spicy sauce. All equipped with taco kickstands when you need a break. They're size is deceiving, they're super filling. All the toppings were fresh, taste buds were tingly. 

Portions were big enough to fill you up and bring home leftovers. Overall an excellent dining experience. Will be going back for sure.
