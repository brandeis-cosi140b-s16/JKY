I'm a big fan of Cantina 1511! The food is delicious, the staff is attentive, and the prices aren't too shabby. The guacamole is made fresh right in front of you which I'm a huge fan of. It is a about $10 so I would say it's good to share with others since you will have plenty of leftovers. I would definitly recommend this place.
