This place is great for lunch. I heart entire lunch menus that are seafood based. Mmm. 

SERVICE: Friendly, prompt, but I will say unmemorable. Though not in a bad way, I suppose.

FOOD: Crab and guac tacos with shredded cabbage salad? Count me in. Many other choices involving shrimp and crab in the quesadilla and fajita areas as well. 

ATMOSPHERE: Great outside area - recommended if the weather's good.

PRICE: I spent a total of $6 on my delicious lunch. Great for a work break.

En short, are you always squabbling with your work crew for a good place to get noms at lunch time? Bring them here. You won't regret.
