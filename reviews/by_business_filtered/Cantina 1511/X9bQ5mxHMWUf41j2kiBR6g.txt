This was trip four, and time to sing the Cantina's praises. They're consistently sparkling - the smells as you enter, the grown up staff, the array of menu choices with both traditional Mexican cuisine and Tex-Mex, the unique salsa, the wonderful and varying flavors and presentations all add up to what you've been hoping to find in a fine Mexican restaurant, and just did. The Salmon al Pastor delighted from the grilled pineapple cap through the perfectly not-overcooked salmon tp the delightful pico de gallo. I was allowed a small taste of the Carones Mojo y Ajo; again, the flavors were fresh and original and not at all stereotypical. Sorry - no room for dessert.
