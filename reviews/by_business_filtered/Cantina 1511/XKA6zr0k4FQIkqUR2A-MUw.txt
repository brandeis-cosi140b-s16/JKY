Went to Cantina 1511 over the weekend and have been there a few other times over the last year; we've literally had the exact same experience every time: painfully bad service and decent Mexican food. This location is seriously in my no fly zone just based off how bad the service is here. Our food has always taken way longer than it should and some part of our order is inevitably screwed up. The wait staff and front desk are super friendly, but god help me something needs to change about the dine-in service. 

Aside from the service, Cantina 1511 doesn't do anything particularly well. The Margaritas are usually over-priced and too sugary. The food is fine, but not anything better than any other Mexican restaurant int the Charlotte area. Truthfully, the only reason we went this weekend was because it was close, and we are SUPER lazy. 

I wouldn't necessarily recommend against Cantina, but I wouldn't go out of my way to tell people to go here.
