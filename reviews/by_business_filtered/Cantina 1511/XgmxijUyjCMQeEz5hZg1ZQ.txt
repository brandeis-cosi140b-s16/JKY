We started with the queso which was awesome ( but then again when isnt cheese not awesome).  The food was a solid, it wasn't quite super authentic, but they had a little twist on it which I enjoyed.  It definitely feels like you are eating at a restaurant and so home made or fast food type place. I would probably return if a friend wanted Mexican and we were in the area.  I like how they make the gauc in front of you and endless chips are always good.  The only thing I didn't like was the decor was a little bit dreary and I agree with Faith about the mildew rag smell.  All in all, it was better than average
