Came here on a Thursday night with a group of friends. It was very crowded, so I am glad that we had a reservation!

I have been to Cantina when it was at the Dilworth location. However, havent been since they moved to Park Road area, so, I was excited to check out the "new" location. The restaurant is super open with a nice bar area and outdoor patio space (with TVs).Parking is plentiful.

Chips and salsa were good and plentiful. The salsa had a perfect spicyness kick for me. Neither salsa nor chips ever went empty.

Ordered the Pina Margarita cause it was one of the few drinks on the menu without that sugary mix stuff....not a fan of that. The marg was delish....though, after reading reviews, I wish I got the Picanta Pina Marg for a little extra kick. Next time!

Ordered the Ancho Shrimp Salad. Nice portion and the shrimp was seasoned well. The dressing was soooo good. Though, I doubt there was anything healthy about it cause it was so creamy! One of my friends didnt like guac, so I ate her guac on her nachos. Definitely will be ordering the guac next time!

Staff was super friendly and attentive.
