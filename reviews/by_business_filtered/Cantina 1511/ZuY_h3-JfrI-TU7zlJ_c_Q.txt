I've been a Cantina fan at both locations, but I prefer the East Blvd. location as it has more character. The Ballantyne location is pretty cookie cutter in terms of a strip mall location. This review is for the East Blvd. location.

My Mom was in town, and with one meal a couple of years ago I've made her a Cantina fan as well. She insists on Cantina at least once every time she visits. No problem here. :P

The day we visited was for lunch on either 3/31 or 4/1, I can't remember. Must always for me: table-side guac and the Marco Polo Tacos. I really do want to try different entrees, but every time I do, I wish I ordered those darn tacos. I'm sold on them. 

We ordered the table-side guac, I ordered the Marco Polo Tacos, and my mom ordered the Wild Mushroom Quesadilla. The guac, as usual, was super fresh, bright with the lime and spices. My tacos were amazing as expected, and plated enticingly (first time I've seen their new plating for these). The chopped salad with the tacos is always so good, very fresh and a welcome change from the regular side salad you get with any meal at different restaurants. My mom loved her quesadilla. 

The one thing I wasn't that happy with was the blood orange margarita. It almost had the taste of a machine margarita, and definitely had way too much mixer. It would be nice to see these with real blood oranges shining through in the winter/early spring as they are in season.

Our service was very good. Our waitress checked on us often, offered suggestions and recommendations, and was very friendly.

Please, Cantina 1511 - don't lose the atmosphere on the move to Park Road Shopping Center. :( Don't become cold like the Ballantyne location. :(
