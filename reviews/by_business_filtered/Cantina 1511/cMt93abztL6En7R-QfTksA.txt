I havent eaten here in years but it was my best friends birthday yesterday and this where she wanted to go. We called thursday over and over until someone picked up to try and make reservations. They said their system was down so we could not make any. First off a company should not rely so heavily on technology that if a system goes down, theyre screwed. Its called pen and paper and works wonders. Second, someone should ALWAYS answer the phone, thats completely unacceptable. Called about 20 more times on Friday and was not able to get through at all. They dont even have an answering machine. That is horrible customer service. Instead we ate at Dandelion Market uptown and it was delicious.
