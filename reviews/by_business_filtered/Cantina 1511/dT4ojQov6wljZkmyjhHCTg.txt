Just ordered take out from them tonight. They said it would be ready in 20-25 minutes and we literally live across the street so we were there at 20 minutes. The food must have been sitting for a while because the food was cold and needed to be reheated. The 'bowl' of soup had two small meatballs in it. The 'pint' container it came in was also not filled and was a good inch from the top. I called and the person who answered said it came with two meatballs and that was the right container. The other food was decent but we probably won't be going here again.
