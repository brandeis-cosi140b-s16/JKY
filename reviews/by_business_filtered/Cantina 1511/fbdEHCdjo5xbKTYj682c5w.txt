Definitely overpriced for what it is.

I've eaten here a few times and the first couple were pretty delicious (LOVING that queso fundido) but the last time was so salty, I couldn't even eat. I sucked down tea like I'd never had a drink in my life just trying to put some moisture back into my tongue. With the over-salting and the high prices, I'd much rather go to another Mexican restaurant where it feels more authentic and rich, and where the food seems more genuine and tastes tons better.

Just wish I could take that queso fundido with me...

I will also say that if you happen to wander in late (a big no-no for me, but sometimes things happen) they won't turn you away and they serve you with the same courteous and friendly behavior as if it were the middle of the day. So kudos for that.
