I've actually been to the one on Rea Road, which doesn't seem to be listed on Yelp. 
I remember this restaurant because the food was amazing! The server was extremely helpful with what he recommended, because I ordered exactly both recommendations for the appetizer and entree. They were both great. The appetizer was the Queso Fundido I think, which looked like a small pizza. Very cheesy. The entree was Barbacoa del Puerco, which was awesome. It came with tortillas where I could wrap shredded pork with other toppings such as beans, guacamole, rice, pico de gallo, cheeses, and lettuce. 
YUM YUM YUM. Service was also excellent.
