I guess this is my first yelp review! 
Ok, so the food is good and the prices are slightly steep for a Mexican restaurant. 
It has a nice modern atmosphere and not your neighborhood Mexicans restaurant feeling. 
Overall I gave them a four star because the food could have tasted better and not so blah, and the prices are too high for most things. 
Would I go back? Yes nit my first choice though.
