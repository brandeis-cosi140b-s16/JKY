Allow me to explain my ratings: 4 stars for the food, 2 stars for the revamped menu (read: PRICE HIKE).

Cantina tends to be my go-to place for Mexican. More because my daughter seems to love it here, and it's hard to please the culinary habits of a picky 5-year-old. We never go wrong here. We love the service - the waitstaff always seem to be personable, and I always appreciate management coming around just to say hi - and the food, a little more upscale take on more traditional Mexican fare (as opposed to, say, Tex-Mex, which is traditional, yes, but more akin towards Yanqui tastes, so you know) that always hits the spot.

So when I saw the menu had changed, I cringed. Menu changes often mean bad things, like some of your favorite plates have been unceremoniously removed from the menu. Alas, some of my favorite taco plates are no longer an option. Still, there's plenty more to chose from, and I did enjoy the shrimp and scallop tacos.

However...lunch the other day was $55. SERIOUSLY? Between my 3-taco plate, my wife's chicken quesadillas, my daughter's quesadilla's, a bowl of plantains, and a pint of beer, that all came out to $55, not including tip? 

Wow. I can afford to drop $55 for lunch, but I object on principle. There better have been about 3 or 4 more pints of Negra Modelo included in that bill.

Oh well. You'll likely see me back at Cantina, except this time I'll be a bit more judicious about what I order, just to satisfy my frugality.
