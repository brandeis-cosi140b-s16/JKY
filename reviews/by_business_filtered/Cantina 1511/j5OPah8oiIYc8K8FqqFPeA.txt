Mmmm, I love this place, it doesn't get any better for Mexican food than this. I haven't been in a couple months but use to frequent this place for lunch when I went to school in the area. I would usually get their small Mexican chopped salad and it was huge, more than enough for one person. It also had a good variety of veggies on it, chick peas, jicama, avocado, peppers, onion and tomatoes. I'd usually add shrimp or chicken to it for my protein as well. I've also had their tacos with shrimp which are very tasty. They bring fresh chips and salsa to your table when you arrive and if you order the guacamole they'll prepare it tableside for you. Also be sure to try one of their Mojitos.;-)
