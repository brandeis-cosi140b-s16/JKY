We went here with a work function. There were about 12 of us so we got the use of half of a private room, the other half was being used by another group. 

I got the chorizo sandwich with a cup of tortilla soup. The sandwich was good but very messy and very greasy. The soup I thought was very good. 

The highlight of the meal to me was the salsa and queso. The queso comes with a little tealight to keep it warm. If that tealight goes out have someone re-light it soon, because the queso will become thick and not easy to eat once it gets cold. 

Overall a great place for some Mexican, but I think I would rather go to a more authentic restaurant.
