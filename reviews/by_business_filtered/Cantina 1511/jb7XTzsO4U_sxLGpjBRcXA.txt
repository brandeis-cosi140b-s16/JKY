My dining experience at Cantina/Stonecrest last week was above average, rating a 4 out of 5. While it was a Monday night, the restaurant was packed. I ordered a margarita at the bar while waiting for my friends and my table. Once we got seated, we joked about how no one wanted to wait on us because we looked like we were having too much fun. Finally, we got our chips and salsa (fresh!) and placed our orders. 

I am totally addicted to nachos. The messier the better! And, it's great value at Cantina if you're watching your pennies, which I am! 

The nachos that I ordered was a huge portion. Enough for two people easily. Fresh guacamole and sour cream was not spared in the least. I had to order jalapenos (forgot when I originally placed my order), but they were brought out quickly. Freshly sliced and spicy! 

I order Tres Leches cake off the menu. It was dry with a whipped topping that I expected to be homemade and fresh, but seemed to come straight from a can. 

Cantina is definitely one of my "go to" places. I loved how they can make a mean Jalapeno margarita if you ask them and if you're going out for Restaurant Week, make sure Cantina is on your list. Of all the places I've visited over the last few years during Restaurant Week, Cantina gives you the best for the value!
