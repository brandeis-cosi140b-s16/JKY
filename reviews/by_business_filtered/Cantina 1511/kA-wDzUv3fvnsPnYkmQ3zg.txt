Stopped by here over the weekend after a movie.  It was about 10pm so I can see why the service wasn't that great.  It didn't take long to get a seat, but it took forever to be acknowledged by a server.  We sat out in the patio, which is probably the best part of the restaurant that night.  It shares the patio with Firebird next door, and they had an acoustic guitar guy playing.  It's great ambience.  

Since we filled ourselves up with movie popcorns and soda, we didn't per se have dinner.  We shared the tortilla soup and the shrimp & crab ceviche.  The ceviche was ok; the soup wasn't much to write home about, it was more like a tomato veggies soup than tortilla soup in my opinion.  For beverages, I had a white sangria which was more sweet than strong.  His dragon something was very much like a mojito and was better than my drink.  All completed with a set of dirty silverware.  

In all, Cantina serves the purpose of a decent place to eat that has some kind of an atmosphere.  Definitely not the best of anything, but it's an ok option.
