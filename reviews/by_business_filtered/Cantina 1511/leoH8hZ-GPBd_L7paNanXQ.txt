The food is edible, but not much more. I had the fish tacos, which I thought had a weird taste.  They tasted as if they were deep fried with the same grease used for a million other things and had not been changed for a long time. The service was bad. Took a half hour before our food came out.  Go to Mi Peublo if you want better Mexican food.  Won't be coming back here.
