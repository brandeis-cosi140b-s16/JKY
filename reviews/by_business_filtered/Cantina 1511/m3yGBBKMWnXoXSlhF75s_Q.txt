Yes, I go here often.  This is an easy meal out with a variety of options and so far, all I have selected have been delicious.

I order gluten free as I have celiac disease and they always prepare my food safely.  A huge huge HUGE plus is that they have a dedicated fryer for their chips- so I can eat basket after basket after basket with their delicious and slightly smokey house made salsa.

I usually order the Marco Polo taco because, why wouldn't i? I often get another taco and the fish one is great as well as he classic beef one.  Their salad you can get is delicious on the side and the rice and beans are pretty good. 

I like their margaritas, nice and citrusy but not too sour, and feel they are just strong enough.  Sitting outside is great and inside can be a bit loud.  Depending on timing, there can be long waits. I will keep returning regardless.
