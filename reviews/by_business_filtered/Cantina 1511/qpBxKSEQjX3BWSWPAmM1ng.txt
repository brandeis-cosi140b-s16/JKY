Decided to check it out with our family of five after finishing a movie nearby. It was overpriced and the food came out cold. My husband and I ordered the chicken pollo enchiladas. They came out in a reasonable time, but were cold in the middle. They were also a bit chewy as if they had been frozen and then nuked in the microwave. I also had the  corn tortilla soup which was ok, but a bit too oily. My older child had the chopped salad, which was bland and came with beets which ruined the flavor. The salsa was good, though, with a bit of a smokey flavor. 

We sent our cold dishes back, which is something we rarely do, and it was hotter when it came back. The bill for the five dishes, one of them off the child's menu, ( 2 of them the smaller portions), water to drink and no appetizers came to over $70 before tip.  Nice enough staff and pretty decor, but with so many other choices around, we won't be going back.
