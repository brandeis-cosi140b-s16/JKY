Went to Cantina last night...not real busy
Decided to wait for a patio table.
Did not take long for tables to open up but no buzz from the hostess station so we went up and asked. They replied they needed to clean the table. Another 10-15 goes by and I peeked out to the patio...4 open tables...so I went back up and said were ready to be seated...the hostess was stippy and said the same thing...need to be clean so I said no the don't there are 4 tables open. She huffed  and walked us to our table. I have run restaurants and would certainly want to know if guest were being treated like this by the restaurant initial contact. I asked for a manager...one showed up 20 minutes later...sorta so late we just chalked up the visit to a joke. Food was fair Music was Great. We've been to Cantina many times...this was most likely our Last Visit.
Go at your own risk...new ownership has really let thing slip.
