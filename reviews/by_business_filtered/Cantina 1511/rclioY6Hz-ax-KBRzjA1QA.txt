Is it the BEST Mexican spot out there?  Probably not, but it is VERY good!
You have to get an order of guacamole- its pretty darn good.
All the dishes are great, again, never had a bad meal here.
Very busy at night, but don't let it stop you; its in a great neighborhood to explore for a bit if you have to!
Good Chips n' Salsa
Descent size bar- but can be very crowded.
Parking can be tight too- all depends on when you go.
The neighborhood is Dilworth
