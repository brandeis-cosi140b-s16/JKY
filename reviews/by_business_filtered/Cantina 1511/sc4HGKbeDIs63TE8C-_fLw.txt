Visited for a date night evening.  Original plan was to go to Firebird.  However, Firebird had a two hour wait.  So we decided to venture to Cantina 1511.  We were pleasantly surprised that we could be seated within 30 minutes.  The atmosphere was inviting and the wait staff was delightful.  I ordered fish tacos and my wife ordered quesadillas.  The nacho chips were freshly made and seasoned to perfection.  I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone and we intend to visit again very soon.
