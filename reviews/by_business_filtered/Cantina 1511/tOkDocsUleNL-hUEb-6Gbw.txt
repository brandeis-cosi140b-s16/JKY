If you were thinking of going to Cantina 1511 for Queens Feast 2013, stop thinking and just GO! Their menu includes four courses, and half price bottles of wine. How can you go wrong?

We went last night, for the first night of QF 2013 and had a blast. Our waiter, Javier, was attentive and really wonderful. If we go back, we'll ask for him again.

The food was amazing. For the first course, they serve you guacamole with your chips. For two people, you get a smaller bowl of guacamole than they usually make tableside, and it was really just mixed together at the table, not anything else. At first I was hoping for more, but I was only able to eat about a third of my entree by the time it arrived so really, the amount ended up being more than either of us needed.

I ordered the jicama and avocado salad for my 2nd course. It was HUGE! My husband ordered one of the soups which was also a generous portion. By the time my main arrived, the non-vegetarian enchilada dish, I was already nearing full. I ate a respectable third, but needed the rest to go in order to enjoy the Bananas Foster chimichanga they served along with ice cream at the end.

For wine, we had a bottle of the Pinot at $13, I think it was. For our normal dining out experience, it was a tad pricey (we normally don't eat anything but a main, maybe $15 per person) but for a Queen's Feast splurge the meal was generous and delicious, and the service was great.

Be sure to make a reservation, though! The place was packed.
