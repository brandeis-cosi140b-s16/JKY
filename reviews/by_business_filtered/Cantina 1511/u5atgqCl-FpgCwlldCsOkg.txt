This has to be one of the best places in North Carolina. Starting with the chips and the very flavorful salsa to the main dish this place is amazing. All of the the tacos are unique and they all have different ideas. Personally the duck taco is my favorite, but feel free to explore the menu. If you live, or are just visiting Charlotte don't miss out on this great experience
