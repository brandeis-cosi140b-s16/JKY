ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE!!  I've been a huge fan of Cantina.  Have gone there countless times for lunch for years. Well I've talked about this place so much that I wanted to take my Mon for Mother's day. We had to wait 10 min to be seated even though we had reservations. Once seated our waiter came flying by with one glass of water to tell us he'll be back with another. Another 10min I got a glass of water. 15min later I stopped someone to bring us chips and salsa. Now that came quick. Then the waiter took our order. Mom ordere basic breakfast, I got the avocado egg bake. Our meal took 45min and it was cold. My mom's plate had a spoonful of hashbrowns. I asked the manager if this was normal portion size she said no maybe they thought it was a child's plate. She said she would bring more but the hashbrowns take 30 min to make...This was just a terrible mothers day. It will be a very very very long time before I even think about going back!!!
