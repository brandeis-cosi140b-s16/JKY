Last minute decided to go out for dinner so I called ahead for a 645pm Rez and actually got one! I was surprised since this place is always jammin and we usually get stuck at the bar.
Anyhow, the waitress and hostess were both friendly and accommodating.  Both of us starving so I immediately ordered the guacamole that's prepared table side.  Nice little touch, always consistent in flavor and enough for 4 to share. A good value for $8.
My entree of redfish(really, redfish is back?) was cooked perfectly, tender and still juicy.  It was smothered with roasted artichokes in a garlic butter sauce. I love garlic but somebody overdosed the sauce making it bitter and slightly displeasing.  My wife's brisket enchiladas were tender, slightly sauced, and plenty of food.
We had ordered house margaritas with Patron.  Pretty good in tanginess but for a $12 drink I would not expect to have sour mix or OJ.  It takes away from the tequila.
We will return, food is usually good and plentiful, but I have to question the value.
Totally not related but what is up with kids dining with headphones on and watching IPads?  Can't parent talk to their children during a social dining experience? How are these kids going to learn to act in public?
Really; don't get me started.  Maybe we should share the no smoking in public and tack on no electronics at the dinner table!
