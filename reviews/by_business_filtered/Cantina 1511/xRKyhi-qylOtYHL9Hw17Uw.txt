Not a very good experience.  We went there to celebrate my daughter. Went with a couple that had a 5 month old baby.  When we got there it was not busy at all since it was about 515.  Our waitress wasn't bad, but our food took forever. It probably took over an hour. At that point in time the baby wasn't happy, we weren't hungry because we ate so many chips and salsa. The food wasn't bad, but wasn't great either. The manager did apologize and gave us this weird dessert that no one liked. The store was not busy at all, and we saw a lot of other people looking around for their food too.  Would not recommend to go go any later, if this was the case at 515.
