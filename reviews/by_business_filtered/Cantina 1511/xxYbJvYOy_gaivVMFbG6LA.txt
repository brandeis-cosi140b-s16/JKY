It has been years since I have been to Cantina 1511 (the other location on East Blvd).  Food review: The chips were over salty and greasy.  The guacamole made fresh at the table was pretty good, I only wish it had some more tomatoes in it.  My meal was not very good - the chicken and spinach enchiladas.  They were really bland.  Not much seasoning.  I had to dump a bunch of salsa on they to even be interested in eating my meal.  The beans seemed like they were not totally cooked all the way, as they were sort of hard.   

Quite honestly, I remember the food being better at the other location.  Maybe I caught them on a bad night?  Or maybe the other location is better.
