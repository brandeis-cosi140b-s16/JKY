I can't believe I never reviewed this place I've been sooo many times!! 

It's kinda annoying how hit or miss this place is though. I want to like this place but they make it difficult with the mediocre food and sometimes mind boggling service!

I have had some good experiences with the food the last time I was there I had the Garlic Shrimp which was great a big portion and the Scampi Flavored dish was exactly what I was looking for!! 

I used to really enjoy the cuatro Leches but the last time they threw a Marshmallow Marenique on top and it was way too sweet and pointless because we scooped it off to the side. 

I will be back but l recently have found my Spanish needs met at other restaurants!!
