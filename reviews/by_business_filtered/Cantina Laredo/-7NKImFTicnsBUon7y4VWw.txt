bacon-wrapped shrimp fajitas.  that's all you need to know. fucking delicious.

server Jackie was great. guacamole was a little spicy, which was a neat surprise. we managed to come on the evening of some high school's home coming, and according to my wife, modern homecoming dresses are way too hoochy for decency; I guess it is a little unusual to see 17 year old gash in public. the happy hour specials are amazing!
