visited for the first time on a Monday evening approx. 6pm. My party of 3 was seated immediately & greeted by our server promptly. For my entree I had the chicken tampico (without spinach) and it was delicious! grilled chicken was very moist, the vegetable side was squash done just right (not quite al dente but not soggy either- just right) the mexican rice also had good flavor. Everything tasted fresh and served warm as though made to order. We split the apple pie dessert w/ cinnamon ice cream- which was good but not great.
I will definately go back again.
