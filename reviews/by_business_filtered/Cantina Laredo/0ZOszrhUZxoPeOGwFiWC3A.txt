We only go for brunch on weekends, so I can't talk about the service since we always get great service.  The fajitas are excellent(get grilled jalapeno's on the side) but my favorite is the Sunday brunch with eggs, steak & potatoes with the awesome chimachurri sauce.  I order a side of their chimachurri sauce every time we go regardless of what I order.  The shrimp dishes are quite good too.  The classic taco/enchilada plates are average.  The down side are the chips & salsa.  The chips are hit & miss, sometimes warm sometime cold.  The red salsa is too mild for us but has a decent taste, the other salsa they serve,  I cant even stand the smell of it, but maybe thats just me.
On a plus, it has big screen tv's for sports on the weekends and its clean as could be.
