This is a personal favorite of mine in Summerlin.  It's really good Mexican-style food and the service, in my experience, has been incredible.  The guacamole is a personal favorite (rally fresh and prepared at your table).  They prepare seafood REALLY well.  I have tried several different dishes and always been delighted with my selection.  Also, I think their apple pie might be the best I have ever had....yeah I know it's a Mexican restaurant serving a traditional American dessert, but they do it up right.  Don't judge, just try.  Overall, I love the location (Tivoli Village in Summerlin) and have always left the restaurant happy I ate there (and of course that I saved room for apple pie).
