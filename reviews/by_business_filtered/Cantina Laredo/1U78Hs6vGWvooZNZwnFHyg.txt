I took the wife here on date night and it was terrible. The food was mediocre to poor. The order was wrong. The portions were tiny. This place has pretensions of being haute or highbrow Mexican. The prices reflect that, but the food does not. The service was snarky and slow. They gave us a comp card for chile con queso for our trouble. Fact is, we will never go back. We will wait for this place to shut down and hope for a better replacement.
