We sat in the bar during Happy Hour so we were able to take advantage of their $5 margarita special and 1/2 price bar menu.  

They immediately bring to the table a large bowl of fresh tortillas chips with some decent salsas. We ordered the margarita special and some pollo and pescado tacos.  

The server was overworked thus not too attentive. The margaritas were not too bad. The fish tacos were fabulous but the chicken tacos were dreadful. Only dumping a generous amount of salsa on the chicken taco could provide enough moisture and flavor to the chicken to make them palatable. 

Overall, if you are hitting Cantina Laredo before 7 PM you won't do too badly if you sit in the bar and order off the bar menu.
