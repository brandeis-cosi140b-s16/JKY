There is something special about walking into a place where everyone knows your name. Cliche, sure, and does it bias my opinion of a place? Absolutely. Either way, Cantina Laredo is still a great restaurant. 

What really draws my attention to Cantina Laredo (other than the worlds greatest employees) is the happy hour. Most importantly their happy hour runs until 7pm. For the self proclaimed workaholic that I am, this is very important. Ever get off work at 6:30pm only to drive home wishing there was a place still serving $3 margaritas? Happens all the time... now there is a fix. 

The food is delicious, most everything on the menu is exceptional; though a few things really stand out. 

1. Table side Guac- yes I know, it's been done before, but who cares! They make it next to your table and it's delicious. 

2. Pulled pork anything (ie. sliders or shanks). This stuff is marinated perfectly and I can attest to the fact that you will not find anything this fantastic between here an the south pole. 

3. This flaming apple pie thing they have for dessert will give you a contact drunk from both the sugar and the alcohol that is contained within. 

4. They have Negra Modelo on tap, usually served in an icy (like actually icy) tall glass.

Good food, good people, good choice.
