We are frequent visitors to the Scottsdale area and have historically liked this place.  Last night was a HUGE disappointment.  The restaurant was quite empty, but that didn't stop the service from being incredibly slow.  Our waiter was cool, bordering on sullen.  When we asked for more water, he came by and said in a snooty voice, "Don't worry, I haven't forgotten about you", then proceeded to do just that.  We had the guacamole (made at our table), which was excellent.  However, it sat at our table all by its lonesome for a good five minutes before he thought to bring chips.  He rarely checked on us and at one point, we flagged down another server who stepped in and brought us water and chips.  If you go, ask for her section (Mo).  I eat out a fair bit and this place wins the prize for the worst service I've had in two years at least.  Having said that, the food was pretty darn good (albeit pricey).  The chicken enchilada was a tad bland, but the chile relleno was very good as was the mole.  All in all, I'd give the service a "generous" one and the food a four.  One of my pet peeves about dining out is needing to have good service.  Great food is only half the equation.  Servers who don't check on me, or keep my water filled (I drink a lot of it) annoy the heck out of me.  Maybe Mo will do better.
