Tommy checking back in.  We did decide to go ahead and brave another visit, this time sitting in Mo's section.  WAY better.  Just goes to show you what a difference good service makes!  I'd go back...that is until Mo moves on.  Hope she stays a while.  And there's no beating that made at your table guacamole.  Save room for the amazing brownie that comes out on a sizzling skillet with some sort of bubbling delight of a sauce.  Can't be more specific as my table mates scarfed it down before I got more than one bite in.
