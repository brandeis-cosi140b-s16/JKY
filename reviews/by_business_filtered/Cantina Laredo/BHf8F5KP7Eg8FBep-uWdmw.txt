Cute place, like everything in Tivoli Village. Really great menu options, including vegetarian which really appealed to me. Two enchilada options I noticed were spinach/mushroom, and avocado/artichoke which is the choice I made. I think I had maybe 2 pieces of artichoke and 3 avocado slices. Instead they were filled with green chiles and jalape√±os which I was not expecting. I was disappointed in that because I was really looking forward to some avocado cheesy goodness!! :( . The black beans served on the side however were really flavorful and delicious. I also ordered their signature margarita which was very good, very fresh tasting, not syrupy like some can be. Service was great, attentive, my water glass was always full, so good job there. Overall just not super impressed with the food!
