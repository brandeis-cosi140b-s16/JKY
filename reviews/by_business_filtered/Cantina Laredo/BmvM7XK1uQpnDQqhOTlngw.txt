Such a great spot! I've been here several times and am never disappointed. Today I was there with a group of six for a business meeting and the food was wonderful. We ordered the cevichi and guacamole to share both were great. This was my first time having either one and they will now become a staple. The guacamole is made to order and ours had a wonderful kick to it. The chips are warm from the oven and the two salsas they serve with them are wonderful, I particularly like the warm one. I shared with my co-worker so I got a barbacoa (brisket) taco and an al pastor taco. While both were good the al pastor did not have the kick I require in al pastor; the barbacoa on the other hand was spectacular and i will be ordering it again next time I go. Several of the ladies I had lunch with enjoyed the salmon which was the fish of the day and all three said they would order it again. The service was good not great my water ran dry a few times but overall our waitress Amanda was very respectful of the fact that we were in fact having a meeting and was careful not to interrupt.
