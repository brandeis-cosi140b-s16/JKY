Went here for the Las Vegas Food &Wine Champagne brunch and was so disappointed. There was about 75 people waiting outside for the event to start then right on time there was 1 girl checking everyone in. A huge mob of people cramming into the door way to talk to one girl. We were not seated by anyone, and were told to, "head straight back." But there were not tables or seats left in that direction and were fortunate enough to get one of the last tables inside, a lot of people ended up outside due to the lack of seating. The menu stated that we could go to the buffet and/or order off the menu, but I had to ask someone to take my order. The buffet was underwhelming as well consisting of fruit, eggs, potatoes, and biscuits; no bacon or meat of any kind. For a "champagne brunch" we thought there would be glasses of champagne or mimosas that would be passed out or brought around but we ended up having to wait in about a 30 person line to have one made in a rocks glass because they ran out of the flutes. After that, I got in the buffet line and there were no plates for about 10 minutes. The ordered food was not much better :( the take on steak and eggs had little steak on the plate and both the French toast and huevos rancheros were way too sweet to eat. All in all, pretty disappointed :(( and we were so excited for this event!
