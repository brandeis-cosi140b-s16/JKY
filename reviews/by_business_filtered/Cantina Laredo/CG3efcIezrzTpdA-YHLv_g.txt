We went here about a week ago. It was a nice atmosphere with decent decor, friendly service and seemingly fair prices given the location inside the upscale Tivoli Village. Both the inside and outside seating areas looked nice, well-lit with good ambiance. We opted to sit outside... which was a mistake. It reeked of smoke coming from the cigar shop next door. No matter, two drinks (each) later and we didn't care so much. The guacamole was very good and that's about it. We ordered chorizo tacos, chicken enchiladas, and vegetarian enchiladas. All three dishes were extremely greasy. Like, grease with a side of food greasy. The enchiladas looked like something from a gas station. The chicken dish tasted fine but the vegetarian dish was not good at all. I did not try the tacos because I personally do not like chorizo, although the person who ordered them did enjoy them. The vegetarian in our group did not finish their food but both of us carnivores did. This, again, was a mistake. I'll spare you the details but thanks to all that grease and possibly in part to the cigar smoke, we both were very sick the entire next day. At first I thought I had a fever but it was very clearly food-related. Yuck.
