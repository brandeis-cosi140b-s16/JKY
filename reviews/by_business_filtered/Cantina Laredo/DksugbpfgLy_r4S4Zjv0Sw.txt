Very impressed with this place.  Not even accounting for their KILLER HAPPY HOUR, the menu is amazing.  No compromises from authentic Mexican, the menu is familiar items with unique twists and high quality ingredients that make it hard to ever go back to "just another Mexican restaurant".  Try the fajitas and the slow cooked carnitas.
