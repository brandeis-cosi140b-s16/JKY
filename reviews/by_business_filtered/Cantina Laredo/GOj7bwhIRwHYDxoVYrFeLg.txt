There really isn't very much great Mexican food here, which doesn't make very much sense to me,as we live in the southwest.  We don't really have much choice, so we frequent here about once a month or so.  The pricing is a little high, but the restaurant is nicer than most Mexican restaurants out there, and the food is decent for North Scottsdale.  I should clarify that we only order 3 things here....EVER.  The tableside guac, and the beef or chicken fajitas, and MARGARITAS! The chicken enchiladas are o-kay, the cream sauce is seriously on the rich and heavy side. Don't order their crunchy tacos, the shell is like something from a grocery store shelf!   

We order the beef fajitas medium rare and it is more than enough for two people especially  with the guacamole.  When the server is making the guac, don't let him add the entire 'spice'  mix...if you let him your guac will be a salt lick..unless you like that...

Chips and salsa aren't bad...I'm not super huge into the roasted tomato thing, but nothing is perfect I guess.  Still good.  Maybe one day we will venture away from the fajitas, or then again, maybe not :)
