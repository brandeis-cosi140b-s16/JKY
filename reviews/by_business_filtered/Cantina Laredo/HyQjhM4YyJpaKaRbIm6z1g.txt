Burt wouldn't come back.
 It wasn't completely horrible, but Burt won't be back.

The guacamole is excellent. The margaritas were very good. The problem was the entr√©es.  Tampico which was highly recommended,  was mediocre and lacked flavor. As did the chicken enchiladas and the mahi tacos. Very bland. Coffee was TERRIBLE. The apple pie dessert is great. The waiter was helpful and attentive.
 
So that's the problem. Apps and desert are wonderful. The entrees are boring and very expensive for Mexican. 

But then again what did Burt expect from a Mexican food chain located in an Italian themed mall in Las Vegas?
