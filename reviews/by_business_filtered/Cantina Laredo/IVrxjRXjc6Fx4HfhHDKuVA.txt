I've been here 3 times now, once for lunch, twice for dinner.  I like patio seating, I live in Vegas afterall and we have one week of Spring and one week of Fall, so I truly take advantage!!  The patio here is nice - it's comfortable, it's great for people watching.  The big patio to the side was booked for a private party, so we weren't able to sit there when I was there last.  The atmosphere is very comfortable, little noisy, but nothing unusual.    

I love Mexican food, I love chips n salsa and this is where my first disappointment lies. The salsa is fine (noteworthy would be a stretch, but it does taste fresh), but the chips are these thin tasteless corn things with no zing, there's nothing to love about them, at all!  Try the chips and salsa from Leticia's and you'll know what I mean by great chips! 

The guac made fresh and tableside is pretty great - it tastes awesome and is all that great guac is supposed to be!  I've had the chicken salad, carnitas tacos, shrimp tacos, and mahi tacos (LOVE tacos too!) and fajitas here.  All very average. They do let you mix your tacos - three per plate and you can try a variety if that's your thing.  The carnitas tacos were the best of the three, but not a WOW kind of taco. They are smaller, street taco size, just like we had back in Ensenada, but not as memorable.  My husband had the enchiladas and said they were "yea, they were good", but again, nothing great. 

They do have a happy hour here - its in the bar area only and does include food although I wouldn't say it's any kind of a smokin' deal that would bring me in.  The drinks . . . . maybe, but not the food.  

I didn't have one, but the woman next to me raved about their Casa Rita margarita which is their house margarita.  I'm not a margarita gal, but if you are, try it out!!
