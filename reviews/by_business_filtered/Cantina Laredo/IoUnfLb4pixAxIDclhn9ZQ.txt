Excellent value for Happy Hour.  We went on a Monday and had $5 House Margaritas which were really good and split (3) appetizers all half price.  I highly recommend the tuna tacos and the steak fajita tacos. They are small street size tacos but really filling.  The salsa is so good even my 5 year daughter loved it.  Cant' wait to go back when it's cooler and sit on the awesome patio.
