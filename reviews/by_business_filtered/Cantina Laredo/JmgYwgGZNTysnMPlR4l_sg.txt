So I came here for a big group event.  They had us sitting in a nice private area.  The decor was very upscale Mexican with dimmed lighting throughout the restaurant.  The staffs were very courteous and helpful.

I ordered an Enchilada dish and it was pretty good for the price.  The ingredients used tasted fresh and prepared in a somewhat artsy fashion. 

If you're in the neighborhood and looking for style Mexican, definitely stop by here, but if you seek authentic Mexican, look elsewhere.

Overall, it was just a purely good upscale Mexican experience.
