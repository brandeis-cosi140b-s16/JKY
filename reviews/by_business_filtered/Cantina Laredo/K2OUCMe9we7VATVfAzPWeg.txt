We've heard good and bad things, but wanted to check it out for ourselves.

Went on a weekday evening, noticed the patio area to the left...asked the hostess to sit there and she directed us to the other patio on the right. Still nice, but was loud...music and singing from the bar or restaurant next door.

Ordered the ceviche and the blood orange sangria to start. Both great, although if you don't care for olives ask to have them removed. The blood orange sangria was great!

For dinner we ordered the chicken and barbacoa tacos. Both had good flavor, not great, but was definitely expensive. 3 "street" tacos, small bed of rice and small bed of beans...for $17 it didn't seem reasonable.

I don't recall our servers name although he was good, he did have to yell...since it was loud, not his fault but definitely something the hostess and management should consider before seating patrons on that patio. My only gripe with the server is he disappeared...and from what it looked like to the other patio...maybe they had him serving there as well?

Driving from Silverado Ranch to Tivoli to go there again just doesn't seem worth it. Maybe if we lived in the area...but won't be going back anytime soon.
