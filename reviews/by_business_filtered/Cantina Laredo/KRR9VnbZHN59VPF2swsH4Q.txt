First time here and as you can imagine, it was busy on a Friday night. Luckily we made a reservation and were seated pretty quickly. Their complimentary chips and salsa are excellent. They offer two types of salsa - one cold and one warm. 

We ordered the guacamole, which they make tableside. It was good, but the onion was chunky and too strong for my taste. You can customize it, so I'll definitely ask them to leave it out next time. We also got the ahi tacos - yum!

I'm trying to be "healthy" so I ordered the shrimp salad, which was okay. My husband got the shrimp enchiladas. I had a bite and wished I ordered that instead, it was awesome!

Service was good. Would return...maybe on a night when I can cheat from my diet, lol.
