In the mood for some Mexican food and we found this place. The wait staff was really nice and knowledgable about the menu. 

We ordered drinks, then entr√©es. I ordered the tres fajita and wife ordered Monterrey enchiladas. The food didn't take a long time and was really good when it arrived. The food tasted really fresh and was presented very well. 

I gave this place four stars because I hadn't tried everything just yet. I'm looking forward to going back. 

Additionally, the menu was very reasonably priced. I would recommend Cantina Laredo to anyone who likes fresh Mexican food.
