My family loves this place!  My favorite is the Chilean Sea Bass.  Even on a busy Friday night, the service was excellent.  We've been here a few other times and it's been great every time.  We had 8 in our party and they were very accommodating.  I came here for lunch a few months ago and had their steak fajitas.  The seasoning and texture of the steak was perfect!  We will definitely be back.
