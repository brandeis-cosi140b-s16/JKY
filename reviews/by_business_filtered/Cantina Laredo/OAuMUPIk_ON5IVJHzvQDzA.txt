Always came here for happy hour especially after a hard days work... Foods good' drinks are great... But the pass 2times we came, it was a let down... 1time... Busy happy hour but the hostess didn't look like she really wanted to help us, so off to Brio we went (great HH too) and now it's cinco de mayo it's 4:30p and busy but still no urgency from a hostess to try and accommodate you, and when we sat in the dinning side the waiter didn't feel accommodating when we said, we're just going to have drinks and get food at the tamale bar... May be the last time we walk in this place... Too bad, I have a big mouth and at the end of the day, customer service is everything to me...
