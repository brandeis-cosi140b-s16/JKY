Dined here yesterday for lunch/happy hour. 

While the server was friendly, the bar was understaffed which amounted to horrendous service. We were not in a rush, but it took nearly two hours to complete our experience. We had two drinks each, guacamole, one appetizer each, and the apple pie dessert. It was entirely unreasonable for everything to take so long. If you are advertising a happy hour, you should expect a crowd and staff your restaurant accordingly.

The food was, in averaging everything, acceptable. Guacamole was terrible. Flatbread was good. Apple pie dessert was excellent. I would have returned to try other items if not for the rest of my experience.

After several hours, I came down with food poisoning. While I dine out often, this was only the second time in my life that I have had food poisoning. I am sorely disappointed in this restaurant, will not be returning, and will be sure to warn others not to dine here.
