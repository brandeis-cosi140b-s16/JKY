This place is not a cantina, it's more like a contemporary place to eat,it's in Tivoli village do I need to say more ? Ok the food was ok not very spice our server was Lisa she was nice but I felt like I was on the lunch rush, three of us were at the table she had our drinks ice tea and soda yes flowing and I can't say if she ask how are meal was,my food was cold I had the tacos carnitas my friends had warm food,so we are eating and Lisa asked if we would like another bowl of chips,Yes , so I'm done three tacos and mind you on a 6 inch corn tortilla with not even spanish rice it kinda look like it but no taste and black beans I'm mexican why couldn't I have the option of refried beans, we had to ask if the dinner came with it I didn't see it on the menu if it stated it, so I'm working on the second bowl of chips while my friends were finishing there meal and Lisa comes and starts to clear the table,I got chips in my hand, I didn't want to cause trouble because I know I won't be going back and they didn't even play cantina music.
