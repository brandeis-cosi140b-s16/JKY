Food was pretty decent but service left much to be desired. Came to celebrate my birthday with friends, had to practically beg our server to smile or pay attention to us. In the middle of selecting our appetizers he just walked away, didn't return for 10 minutes. Got water in the beginning, couldn't get a refill until he was clearing our plates, despite our efforts to get his attention. Sangria is tasty but can't imagine any of us will return.
