OHMAGOLLY...  This is exactly what Vegas has been missing.  The table side guac is total treat.  After sharing the starter, I ordered the Camorones Escondidos.  Chicken shrimp brilliance with sauteed spinach... num num num...  Definitely could not leave w/o trying the tres leches for dessert - no one should...  And of course, had to wash it all down w/ that Perfect Patron Margarita...  Can't beat a bartender who pours heavy...  Can't wait to go back and sit on their beautiful patio.
