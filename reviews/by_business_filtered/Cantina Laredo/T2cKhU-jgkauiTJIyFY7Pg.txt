Cantina Laredo is okay by me. The food is good. The drinks are good. The atmosphere and decor is alright. But that's just the problem. Everything is just "okay".

The only thing that stood out for me is the chips & guacamole. The make it right at your table, and you are able to omit any ingredients you choose. This is a big deal for me because I HATE onions. So I can get delicious guacamole without having to scoop around the onions.

I eat here occasionally, but I never really crave it.
