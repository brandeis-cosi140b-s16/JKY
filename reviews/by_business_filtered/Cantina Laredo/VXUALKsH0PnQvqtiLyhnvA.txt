I read something about this place in one the local weekly newspapers and recommended it to some friends who were taking me to a birthday lunch.  The space was well done but like most of these places, the actual food was just okay. 
Of course, being a Mexican restaurant, I was expecting Viva Michoacan  or Lindo Michoacan (ha! I never noticed they had about the same name.)
The food here was okay, but v.small portions and not much to them. And like other reviewers, the server seems to really want us to drink their expensive booze. 
I'm not a drinker so that gets annoying,
Again, this is not a place that I will special effort to go here again.
