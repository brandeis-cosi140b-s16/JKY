Should have known not to expect an authentic meal when gourmet is included in the restaurants name.  
How in the world is this place rated as high as it is??  Cooking Mexican food and knowing what it tastes like, this place is a slap in the face for Mexican food. 

The variety I am used to is non existent here.  Only noticed caucasian servers, patrons, honestly felt out of place.  

The menu is short and odd.  Nothing traditional about this place.  I ordered the chicken mole enchiladas and I was so disappointed, the sauce was bland no cheese in enchiladas, the tortillas where not cooked (maybe because our meal came out in less than five minutes after we ordered it).  I knew I would be disappointed by the answers the waiter gave me when I asked about the menu. The chicken tasted like cosco canned chicken.  Best thing here was the iced water with lemon.

Giving it two stars because the waiter tried to sell it I just wasn't buying it.
