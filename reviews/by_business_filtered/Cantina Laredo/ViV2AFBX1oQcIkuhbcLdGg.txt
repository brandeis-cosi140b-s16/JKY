I came here recently for a week night date night with the bae. I give it an A+ for design. I love that there's an outdoor patio which given the current season isn't great but would love to come back in the summer.

The service was good but nothing too extraordinary. I did enjoy our waiter telling us how the margaritas are made completely in house with no mixes. A nice natural touch. Also Thursday are ladies nights so half off house margs.

The food was good as well. We have the queso blanco dip to start which had a different flavor from the typical queso dips. For an entree we split the tres fajita. I loved the chicken and steak but the bacon wrapped shrimp I could do without. The only thing I loathed about the meal with the side of beans. Waaaay too salty for any human consumption.

Overall a nice place with great atmosphere.
