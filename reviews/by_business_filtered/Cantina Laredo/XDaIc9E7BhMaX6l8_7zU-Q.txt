I went here for happy hour today and I was very pleased!  The restaurant is beautiful, the waiter was attentive, the food was great, the chips/salsa were complementary, and the beer was cold, frosty, and delicious -- what more could one want?!!??

The happy hour deal is AMAZING (half off appetizers, $2 beer, $4 large margaritas.... awesome!).  I would go back in a heart beat to the happy hour; however, I am unable to comment on the regular service (I'm assuming it is a little more expensive, but great overall!  :) ) Also, they have a GREAT patio that I would love to check out during the fall time.  Lastly, my mom also loved the food, food, salsa, and layout of the restaurant -- very impressive that it appealed to both of us!   

I was full, content, and happy after said happy hour here.  I will definitely be back soon!
