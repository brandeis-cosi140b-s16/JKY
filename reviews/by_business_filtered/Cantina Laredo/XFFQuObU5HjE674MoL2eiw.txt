This is really a 3.5 star rating but I bumped it to 4 stars because the salsa they give you when you first sit down (complimentary) was really good!!! There's two kinds: One is more spicier than the other and has a kick of spice to it. The other...pretty mild and it taste like a bean dip (taste better than it sounds...trust me lol)

Now onto the food: I really like the portions...its smaller than most "authentic mexican" restaurant dishes. Some of you might not like this but I do cuz I'm weight conscious. lol I get paranoid if I feel like I'm eating a bunch of food. But lets not get sidetrack. =) My boyfriend ordered a chicken enchilada and I also order a chicken enchilada with a sweet sauce on top of it. My boyfriend and I both thought it was eh...just okay. The rice didn't taste so good. To me, it was kind of bland. I had to drench that in salsa. Prices I think came out to be around $12-16 per dish. Obviously more expensive if you were going order any type of seafood entree.

Would I come back here? Probably not. I'm not a drinker so I didn't try any drinks but maybe this place would've been better for those who like to drink and such. This would be a good little spot to grab a drink, eat some ceviches, or have some complimentary salsa and chips.
