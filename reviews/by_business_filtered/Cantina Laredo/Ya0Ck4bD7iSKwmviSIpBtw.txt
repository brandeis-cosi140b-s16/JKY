The happy hour is great. Thursdays is lady's night with half price margaritas. They are also great at the regular price. Don't pass up the guacamole made fresh table side. They use serrano peppers which gives good heat. If you want to kick it way up ask for the Ghost peppers but be careful. The complimentary chips are tasty, not greasy or salty. 2 types of salsas are provided, cold and warm. The Happy Hour menu also has a good variety of food at a 50% discount. The Enchiladas De Pollo comes with a poblano sauce and the portion of 3 was flavorful and sufficient. 
The decor was clean and bright. Our servers were friendly, helpful and attentive. We look forward to coming back and enjoying the outdoor patio. Cantina Laredo is a great addition to the dining choices at Tivoli Village. A solid 4 Stars
