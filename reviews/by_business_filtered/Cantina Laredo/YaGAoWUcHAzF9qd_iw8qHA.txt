Walked in just before closing (30 min before closing hour) and our party was strongly encouraged to turn away.  I insisted that we seat, as the restaurant was not "closed" yet and I was enthusiastic for our visiting guests to experience the food here (I'd had great experiences in the past!).  We ordered very simply (chicken tacos, quesadilla, etc.) and when our food arrived it was so violently hot (...a 12 out of 10) and obviously "purposely seasoned", that it was completely inedible. Despite this obviously underhanded dig at our party for intruding on the kitchen staff's hopes for leaving earlier for the eve, our server was delightful.  Long story short, we were not charged for our meal.  Zero respect for a dining establishment who employs an immature, vindictive kitchen staff working behind the scenes, tampering or even handling the food that I (as well as my guests) will be ingesting.  No trust for this establishment, whatsoever.  I will never refer nor return.
