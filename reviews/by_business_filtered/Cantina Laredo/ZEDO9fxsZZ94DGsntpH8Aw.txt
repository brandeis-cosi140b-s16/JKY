First the chips were good but the warm red salsa was weird and tasted more like tomatoes than anything else (a common theme) chimichanga, the chicken inside had a nice smoky flavor and was seasoned well. The sauce on top was tomato paste with a Lil chipotle, not great almost Italian pasta sauce, the refried beans were horribly lacking in flavor/salt and the rice was awful. If you've never had the Knorr bag Spanish rice go here and try it. Or buy it at Fry's for $1. My wife had the street tacos which would've been good except for the "pico de onion" they cover it with. They graciously replaced it with a basic bean and cheese burrito, and a side of the bag rice from Fry's, yay, again the beans were bland. When the bill came they didn't charge us for the street tacos $11.99, instead they charged us $10.99 for a burrito the size of a frozen burrito again from Fry's and a side of the bag rice from Fry's as well. The waiter was very nice though. 
For the price they want you to pay they sure don't delivery that quality. We could've gone to taco bell and gotten a better burrito.
