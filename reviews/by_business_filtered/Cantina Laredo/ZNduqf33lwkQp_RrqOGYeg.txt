Coming to Cantina Laredo I am influenced to think that it will be Mexican fine dining. I start with the chips and salsa, typical with Mexican restaurants. The chips were warm and delicate and the salsas offered robust flavor without having an overpowering heat. I am already happy at this point, but then I order the taco de fajita, which are just beef tacos with avacado and sour cream. My tacos come out and it is only 2 corn tortilla tacos with overcooked dry "carne asada". The rice and beans that came with it were plain as tab soda. It seems as if the flavor was all added to the beginning salsa and nothing for the food. The tacos were overpowered by the taste of the tortilla which is absolutely sad. The black beans and Spanish rice were on par with store brands, meaning they tasted pre cooked. Overall, the only Mexican flavor in this place are the ethnic waiters who served me, which admittedly did add to the look of authenticity.
