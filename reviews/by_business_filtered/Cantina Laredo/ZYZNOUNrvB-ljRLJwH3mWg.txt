If we had received better service, I'd give this spot 5 stars without any reservation. I'd been craving good chicken enchiladas for a few months, and I wasn't having any luck around my area of town (Cheyenne & 95)

For an appetizer, my husband and I split the crabmeat/goat cheese quesadillas, topped with mango/giner salsa. To be honest, they were overpriced @ $14 because of their small size, but, honestly, they were so delicious that I couldn't complain.

To eat, my husband had a chimichanga, which he adored. The crust was thin and friend to perfection. I had the Enchiladas Veracruz, and I was delighted. The veggies on top added a fresh spin to the enchiladas, which were both flavorful and cooked perfectly. The chicken was so tender and thin--melt in your mouth good.

Our main complaint was with the service. We had to wait ten minutes for waitstaff to tell us they'd be with us "in just a minute". Except--she didn't, and she was rescued five minutes later by her fellow waitstaff to take our drink orders. After waiting 20 minutes, we were finally able to place our order and then enjoy the delicious food. So, one waitress was very helpful, and the other was awful.

I'm hopeful that with a second trip, I'll luck out with a good server so that I can enjoy that delicious food again!
