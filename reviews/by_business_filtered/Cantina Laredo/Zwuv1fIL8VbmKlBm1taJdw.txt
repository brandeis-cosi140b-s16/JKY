My daughter and i went out to eat every meal  over christmas holidays...we loved Cantina Laredo ...the server we had was great....the atmosphere  was great, food fresh, arrived promptly,  we thoroughly enjoyed our dining experience....we had been testing various Mexican style restaurants ...we compared restaurants over a weeks time from Sedona to Phoenix and this restaurant received our highest rating....I would recommend as Excellent....what a great holiday memory....also had wifi so,we could Skype with family....great touch....
