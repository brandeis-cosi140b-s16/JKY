I sat at the bar tonight. The bartenders are super attentive and quick to offer a drink and food menu.  

The chips are served warm which I love. The bartender recommended 3 tacos. ( steak, chicken and pastor) I ate the steak.... But the other 2sat with one bite out. Way to BBQ!!!!! Ended up not eating. for a mexican restaurant the tacos tasted very americanized.  

For a drink I went with the recommendation of a strawberry mojito. Gross !!!!!!!! Bar bistro has the best in town.  

after the bartender saw that i ate only one taco, she quickly took the plate and tried to just drop the check.... really????? 

i doubt i will return. they are quick to sell and be friendly and then just act rude.
