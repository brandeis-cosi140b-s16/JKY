Classy place, very nice, drinks are cold as ice, literally, and the tequila is perfect, so many choices too.  Happy hour is a great little fun drinky time.   Plus the food gets a solid rating. Service is a 10!   Always great to discover a new hideout noone knows about that is calm, chill, and just what the doctor and the attorney ordered for me.   Tequila, beer, and tacos, that always solves the weeklong blues.
