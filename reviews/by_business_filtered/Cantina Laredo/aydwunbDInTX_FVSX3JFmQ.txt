Some friends that live close by suggested it.  I was very impressed, my friends are vegan, so finding a place that accomodates them can be challenging, but this place did it without pause, and the waitress understood me when I said I was pescatarian, she had great recommendations and the dish was the special Sea Bass.  Very good!  I really enjoyed the thin and low salt chips they provide as well.
