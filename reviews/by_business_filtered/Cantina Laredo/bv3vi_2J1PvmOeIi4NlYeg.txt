Nice atmosphere and really good food, only thing I didn't like was they served string beans as one of their sides  but only because I am not a huge fan of string beans and I guess didn't expect that in a Mex. Restaurant. Other then that I was very pleased my service was great! the food was delicious and it had a very nice ambiance!
