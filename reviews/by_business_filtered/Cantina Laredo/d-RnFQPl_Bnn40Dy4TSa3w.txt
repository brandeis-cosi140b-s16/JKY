This place has really begun to grow on me.  My girl and I tend to frequent the happy hour spots here in San Tan Village; used to prefer the Keg for Happy Hour, not a fan of Kona Grill, but this place has consistently provided us a good time at Happy Hour.  

I think the service is awesome, 5 stars, easy.
Food, 4 stars
Drinks, 4 stars
Setting/Ambience, 3 to 4 stars.

Definitely recommend...guacamole kinda overrated.
