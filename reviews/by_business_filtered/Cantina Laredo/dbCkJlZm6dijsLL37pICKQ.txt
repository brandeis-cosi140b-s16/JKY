We are big fans for Cantina Laredo.  Excellent bar menu and great margaritas. Service is usually spot on. Food is fresh. Tonight we waited at the bar 20 before I asked if we could get drinks. Then another 10 before they came. When food was served was very disappointed when frozen chicken that had been warmed up was on our food. Bad experience!  I hope this is a fluke as it is one of our favorite date night places because we can hang out and catch up.
