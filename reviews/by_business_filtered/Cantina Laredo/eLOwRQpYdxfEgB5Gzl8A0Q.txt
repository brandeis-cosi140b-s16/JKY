Compared to the other places I have tried so far this was pretty good. I liked the salsa. It was smokey flavored and nicely spiced but not too hot. The chips were a bit salty The meal, Lorado Combination Plate, was very good. Some of the best Mexican food I have had out of a restaurant in the Phoenix area. Yum!
