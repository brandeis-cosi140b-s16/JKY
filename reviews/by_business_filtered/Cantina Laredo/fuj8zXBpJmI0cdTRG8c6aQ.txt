Wow. The dessert was unbelievable. I will try to do a complete review and not only focus on the dessert, but seriously, that's all I can think about. 

We went here for dinner last night. Although the service was friendly, it was quite slow. Slow to get our drinks, and slow to get the table-side guac. Once we did get them however, everything was awesome. Hubby ordered the strawberry mojito which he literally downed in about 3.5 seconds flat. He loved it. I had a dirty martini, and although the waiter forgot the olives, the martini itself was pretty darn good. 

The table side guac was tasty and plentiful - easily enough for a group of 4. With just the 2 of us, we left a lot of it uneaten. 

I ordered a "new" menu item, the portabella and goat cheese enchiladas, and the husband ordered the carne asada and camarones. We both LOVED our dishes. Although I was disappointed in the fact that I got a mango salad on the side instead of the rice which is what the waiter said I would be getting. Shame on me for not reading the menu more carefully (I hate mango). 

Even though we were both delightfully stuffed, we ordered dessert. OMG. No really, OMG. The best dessert I've had in a LONG time. I keep thinking about it. I wish I could have another one today. We had the "Mexican Brownie". In case I didn't already mention it - OMG! SO absolutely delicious. It's a huge brownie filled with LOTS of nuts (I think walnuts, don't remember exactly), served on a hot skillet with vanilla ice cream and a brandy sauce. No really, I think I have to go over there today and get another one. It's so unbelievably tasty. 

So, bottom line, when you go, whatever you do, you MUST leave room for this delicious chocolatey sizzling mouthwatering goodness. 

p.s. I would give the place 5 stars if it wasn't for the slow service. Oh, also, it's a bit on the pricey side (specialty dishes, like the carne asada and shrimp the hubby had, are over $20).
