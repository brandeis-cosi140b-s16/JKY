I came her last weekend with two other guests. I'm basing my rating on the average of our three scores...
We all really wanted to like this place.  It started off great!  The chips and salsa they bring to the table are delicious and addicting.  I was excited to order the fresh guacamole but then it started going downhill.  I only had one bite of the guacamole - I thought it tasted nasty.  One of my guests had only one bite while the other guests took out the grilled jalepenos that were mixed in it and found it to be "ok". On to entrees....one guest ordered a chicken burrito that was "ok"- It was swimming in this creme sauce that he tried taking off.  The waitress kept stressing that she recommended the tacos - I should've listened to her!  My other guest ordered tacos and they looked nice and fresh. I ordered off the brunch menu and got the omelet with potatoes and these cinnamon fried bananas.  The bananas were good but the omelet was dripping with oil!  And the potatoes had a REALLY WEIRD taste to them - they were uneatable!  Ewwwww.  I mentioned this to the waitress with the suggestion that the chef taste the batch being served (I didn't want anyone getting sick from them) and she just smiled and said ok.  Once we asked for our check it took 20 minutes to get it... They weren't busy.  Maybe understaffed?  I paid the check and I have no plans of returning.  I can get way better food thats edible at the Suncoast cafe across the street- and still have money left to play wheel of fortune! My other guest said they would never return again either, while the other said he would just come for a drink and a taco appetizer.  Bummer.....
