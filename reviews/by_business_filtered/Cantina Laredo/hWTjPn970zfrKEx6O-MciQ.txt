Cantina Laredo was fine, but I wouldn't bother driving all the way out there again unless it's because I'm already in the area for something else.
The restaurant's decor is really nice, and it's obvious they're going for an "upscale Mexican" theme - kind of like "Maria Maria" in Tempe. Unfortunately,  both restaurants have overpriced entrees. 

I'm perfectly fine paying $12 for enchiladas - but for god's sake, put something *worth 12 bucks* in them! I can make frozen spinach and mushrooms enchiladas at home, you know? It's not that the food was bad, it just wasn't as creative as I had hoped it would be. 

Also, the guacamole that they make table side had enormous chunks of jalepeno in it, which was odd. Generally, I would think the pieces would be smaller and, therefore, more palatable. I've had guacamole plenty of times in Mexico and they've never put enormous hunks of jalepenos in it!
My friend and I both enjoy spicy food, but were choking on them the whole way through the guac and ended up having to pick them all out.

On a positive note, we both really liked the mango margaritas and the two salsas they give you at the start of your dinner.

Overall, if you're in the area, I'd suggest coming here. But don't expect anything earth shattering, simply expect a flavorful, relaxed meal.
