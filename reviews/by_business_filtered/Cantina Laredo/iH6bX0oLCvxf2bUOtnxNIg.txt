I have been there twice. The food is OK, pricey for Mexican though. The drinks are good. The service is ok too. The first time the service was better, but the second time not so good at all. We were mostly ignored!!! Although it could have been because of my friend's kid!! 
You can find better Mexican restaurant for cheaper, but the location is convenient being it is in the shopping center and all.
