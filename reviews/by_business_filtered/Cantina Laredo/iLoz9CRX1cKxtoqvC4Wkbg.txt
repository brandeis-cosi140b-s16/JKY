I went to Cantina Laredo for their amazing happy hour, we sat at the bar and Edward and Carlos were so awesome!!  They took care of getting us delicious margaritas, kept our chips and salsa full, and we received our food orders promptly.  Shrimp Empenadas were to die for!!!  Best food and service, definitely one of my favorite spots in town.
