I was pleasantly surprised while out at San Tan to find this place for a icy margarita and early dinner whilst the sun goes down.. Nice patio.. Perfect Patron Margs.. and a really cool prix fixe menu.. Which isnt the usual sample sizes you end up with at times with those chosen courses. AND its only about $16 for a 3 course dinner... My one thing I couldnt tolerate was the taquitos... greasy beyond belief down to the dry chicken centered within the greasy 'shell'.. Attentive waitstaff.. good food.. Bueno for the Cantina..
