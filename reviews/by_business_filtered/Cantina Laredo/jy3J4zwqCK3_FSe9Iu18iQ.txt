(Writing under my husband's yelp account - from his wife Debbie S. !) --- If you are looking for a great restaurant in Las Vegas to hold a private event -- look no further! I cannot begin to say enough things about my recent experience with Cantina Laredo in Las Vegas and specifically working with the manager, Matt Lynch. I was hosting a baby shower for my sister who lives in Vegas + 35 guests but I was planning from Arizona. Needless to say, I could not have been more relieved after doing a ton of research for Vegas restaurants when I came across Cantina Laredo. From the beginning, Matt was extremely responsive, helpful with detailed information, flexible with the menu and our various requests, always happy to answer any questions we had and went above and beyond by sharing pictures, suggestions etc. They have a great private room that can accomodate up to 40 people and they are located within Tivolli Village so the ambiance around the restaurant is also great. This gave me such peace of mind knowing we were working with a manager who wanted to ensure we had the best experience possible - not only at the event but during the planning process. The morning of the event, Matt and his staff (specifically our server, Jackie), could not have been more helpful and accomodating. They provided fantastic service throughout the entire event. Many guests commented on how delicious the food was and how prompt the service was, especially for a group of 35 people. Others commented on how great of a place it was to hold a special event. Could not have been happier with our experience from start to finish!
