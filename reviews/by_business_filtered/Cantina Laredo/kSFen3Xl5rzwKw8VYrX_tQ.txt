Visited for the first time tonight and it was excellent!  Arrived at 5pm on a Friday and happy hour seating was full but we got a booth in about 20 minutes.   Our server, Jackie, was awesome.  Very friendly and attentive.  We ordered the house margarita and it was excellent and house wine which was as expected for house wine.  Chips and salsa were great and our happy hour plates were very good and excellent prices.  I loved the vibe of the place, the quality of the food and that happy hour even on Friday was until 7pm.  By 6pm it was definitely full and people were waiting for bar seating so the later happy hour time is much appreciated for people who have jobs that do not allow an earlier happy hour.   Even when full it was not so noisy that you could not talk with your spouse or table of friends.   We will not only be back for happy hour but will be back for dinner.
