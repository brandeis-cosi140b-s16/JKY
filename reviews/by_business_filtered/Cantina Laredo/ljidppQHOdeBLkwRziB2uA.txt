I love Cantina Laredo!

Great for lunch or dinner.  Get the guacamole made at your table, sooo yummy!  My favorite dish is the chicken mole enchilada. If you have never tried mole, this is the place to do it.  It is so rich with flavor.  I tried something else once and it didn't even compare to the mole enchiladas, so I pretty much just stick to that dish every time.  They also have a great Sunday brunch menu, but I never get up early enough to try it out!

The margaritas are STRONG, I get pretty happy with just one.  They also serve warm(as in temperature)  and cold salsa with the chips.  They both are fantastic. 

One funny thing I noticed, every waiter/waitress I've ever had has an accent.  Either they only hire Spanish speaking people or they tell them all to fake an accent so the place feels more authentic!

Oh, I almost forgot...
They have this amazing desert.  I don't know what it's called, but it has the most enticing smell.  It's some kinda sizzling cake, cinnamon ice cream, brandy butter goodness. Try it, you'll die!
