My lunch here was good.  I liked the table side guacamole and was glad they offered to bring additional spicy flavorings on the side so that the guacamole could be shared easily.  My pork tacos were tender and good, though nothing too exceptional.  The dessert tray with fake ice cream was a little creepy.
