The staff at this location is excellent. Although I have not eaten here for lunch or dinner (as this is primarily a happy hour destination) the happy hour menu is sure to have something for every one. I have not had a bad dish from this menu. 

Another fine point for me is that they serve onion free fire roasted salsa, this is very important as my date is 'onion averse'. 

They also make great 'PERFECT PATRÓN MARGARITAS' which is made of Patrón Silver and Patrón Citrónge.
