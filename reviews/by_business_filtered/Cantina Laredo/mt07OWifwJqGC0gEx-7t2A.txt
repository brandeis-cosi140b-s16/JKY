A couple girlfriends & I stopped to grab a late night bite here before we headin to The Grand Canyon. We had the pleasure to be helped by Favio; dude was amazing!! He had us laughing the whole time & also made great suggestions. His dancing & singing is off the chart, as well as his facial hair! haha. 
We really enjoyed our time at dinner, thanks to FAVIO!! :)
