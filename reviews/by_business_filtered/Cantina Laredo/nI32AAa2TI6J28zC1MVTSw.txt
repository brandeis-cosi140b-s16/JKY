Very nice place with great service. Hostess sat us right away. The waiter came over right away for drink orders and got the drinks out to us within 5 minutes. It was happy hour and very busy in the bar area. We sat in the restaurant and weren't allowed to order off the happy hour menu. We had a child with us so I guess that means you can't participate with the special menu in the bar. Kind of annoying. But the waiter did give us happy hour drink prices at least. He was as accommodating as he could be. The fresh made chips and salsa were delicious. The spicy salsa wasn't as spicy as it was made out to be but it was very full of flavor. The waiter explained the menu items perfectly. The ceviche was pretty good. I prefer the shrimp cut up but it all tasted good. I had the enchiladas veracruze I think it was called. Chicken, spinach, queso fresco and a very spicy sauce. It was good but I will try something else next time. My friend had the crab enchiladas. It had a fancy name that I can't remember. It was amazing. The waiter said it was really good. A little more expensive than I would've liked but not outrageous prices considering the quality of food and fabulous service. Even when it got busy our waiter was still on top of everything. Overall it was a great restaurant.
