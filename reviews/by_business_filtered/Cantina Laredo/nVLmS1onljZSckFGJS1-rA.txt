This place has a great location in Tivoli Village. They have a good indoor outdoor bar and several inexpensive offerings for happy hour. One of the best features of this restaurant is that they allow your dog to sit out with you on the patio while you dine. 

The food is not traditional (authentic) Mexican food which doesn't bother me. But, the poor execution is an issue. We have eaten here a handful of times. I guess because I keep hoping to select something on the menu that I love. Unfortunately, that hasn't happened. The highlight of the menu is their guacamole and chips which are made table side. Their complimentary salsas are also very tasty. 

I would give Cantina Loredo another try. It's a shame that we haven't found a good Mexican restaurant in the Summerlin area. My husband likes this place a lot more than I do. He is a fan of the fajitas. So, the 3 star review is an average of both of our opinions.
