Came on the 4th of July. Place was dead, understandably. Had all our kids with us. Our server was nice and attentive. He answered all of our questions and made recommendations which we took and enjoyed. The Tampica was great. My wife had veggie fajitas that were amazing. Drinks are STRONG. All around a really good meal
