My friend took me here for a birthday dinner and it was simply amazing- on par with my favorite The Mission out in Old Town Scottsdale. We shared several dishes and we really loved everything- including the delicious margaritas! The pomegranate one I had was simply one of the best I've ever had. I'm getting hungry just thinking about their amazing menu. Yummmerz!
