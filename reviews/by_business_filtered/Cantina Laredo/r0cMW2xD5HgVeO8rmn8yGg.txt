As Sarah pointed out , the chips and salsa are worth coming here. The food itself is good , not amazing but good - I tried one of their combination platters. The staff here are friendly and the service is really good. They have a great bar though and a nice variety of Margaritas. I would say the bar is the best part of this restaurant.They have a nice happy hour with $5 margaritas.
