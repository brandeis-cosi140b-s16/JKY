First visit - happy hour - we had several items on the happy hour menu and were quite 'happy' ... however... visit number two left me not so happy...

Brunch on a Sunday morning.  Seated promptly.  Chips and salsa - really good!  Loved both types of salsa offered.

I ordered the crab cake Benedict ... mehhh ... I've had a LOT better.  Egg poached perfectly.  The chipotle-wine hollandaise was ok, nothing special.  The crab cake, however, was mushy, thin, and I could barely taste any crab.  A spoonful or two of potatoes (but they tasted ok) ... and the best part of the meal - a cinnamon fried tortilla with fruit.  The complementary Bloody Maria was good.  

My dining companion doesn't care for eggs, so he ordered the only thing on the brunch menu that didn't involve eggs. Chilaquiles (Chicken, sautéed tortillas in salsa tomatillo sauce) - came out while he was away from the table.  I was floored - and took a picture in case there was a discussion with management.  A FEW chunks of chicken, tortilla chips and a bit of tomatillo sauce (and the same small portion of potatoes and fruit/tortilla) .. I couldn't believe that what appeared to be a small portion of green nachos with a chunk or two of chicken was considered an entrée.  At these prices ... not sure I'll be back.
