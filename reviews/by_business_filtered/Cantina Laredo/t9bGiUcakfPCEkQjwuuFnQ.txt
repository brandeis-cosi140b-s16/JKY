Food was ok service very slow  silverware was dirty. I would not recommend that restaurant. Bought a groupon but not happy.Two managers walked around neither one looked friendly or stop by to see how everything was . 62.00 for three of use and was not happy when we left. The brownie dessert was good but that's pretty much it. Update Mathew the GM was very pleasant and apologized I do appreciate that. I wish that business the best of luck. Just for him replying so quick I gave an extra star.
