We want to like this place!  We have been 6 or 7 times, but it seems to get progressively worse.  Our first visit was wonderful and the food was delicious.  We hoped our next visits were with the 'B' chef.  We went again last night with our kids and spent a lot of money on very average food.  The service is always top notch.  They  need a new chef.
