Wow!  This is my 3rd visit in 9 months.  I don't have plans to EVER go anywhere else for Mexican food again.   I wish I'd taken a photo of the 3 taco plate I just ate.  Not only was it a beautiful presentation and a hearty portion, but the flavors were amazing.  Their chips and salsa are nothing short of PERFECT too.  Even the margaritas are fantastic here.  Living in NY & CA for most of my life, I'm a bit of a foodie and difficult to truly impress.  My first visit,  I had enchiladas and wasn't that excited.  I'm glad I came back & tried other things.  My next visit was for happy hour and I loved the variety of food and unique flavors.  The ahi tuna taco appetizer was incredible.  Today, the bartender Sergio recommended that I try a 3 taco plate, since I am not a big rice and beans fan.  This visit SOLD me on this place for as long as I live in AZ.  I highly recommend Sergio as your bartender too.  He makes GREAT margaritas!  ...but be careful because more than one and you might need Uber!
