Got dragged here again for a family dinner....again. :-/

No hostess at the stand, we waited about 5 minutes for her to show up. Not a big wait or anything but on a Friday night, I would think they would have backup staff.

While walking to the table, we passed a large section (the middle of the restaurant) that had the lights dimmed. It's obvious that they don't have enough of a crowd to use all their available space. It looked like they only had 2 waiters and 2 bus boys working the open section of tables and all the staff looked stressed out and weren't very friendly. 

We got table side guacamole...again. I wasn't excited about getting it again but others in my group wanted it. It was a ton better than last time but it still wasn't all that great. You're paying over 10 bucks for 3 avocado halfs but at least this time, they were smart enough to bring out their "herbs and spices" out in little bowls rather than bringing the store bought packet out :P There was no zing to it though :(

I got pork tacos which weren't bad (seriously guys, could adding a little zing kill ya??) but for goodness sake, why is a place that charges $20/plate using crappy boxed rice with dehydrated peas? And why can't they cook the rice completely? Second time dealing with the crappy boxed rice, second time dealing with hard partially cooked rice. I could just call it a crappy white washed Mexican food experience but that wouldn't do justice to just how awful their rice is. 

Again, I left so disappointed. Thank goodness Habenero's (ya know, REAL Mexican food?) is close by AND has great food!  ;-)
