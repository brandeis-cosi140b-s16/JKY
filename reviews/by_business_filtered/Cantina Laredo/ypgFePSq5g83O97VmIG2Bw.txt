I went on a saturday night with my husband-it was pretty empty. we decided to sit outside on the patio, next to the firepit, which really made for great ambiance. It was just really nice. I loved the mix of music that was playing on the speakers. Salsa and all sort of spanish music. 
Food was ok-the rice was over seasoned but still edible.
Nice place..I'd go back.
