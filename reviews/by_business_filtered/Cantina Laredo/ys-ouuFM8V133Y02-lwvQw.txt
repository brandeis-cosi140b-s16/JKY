Service was less than great.  GM Mark not receptive to comments or constructive criticism. To tell you he heard the same thing before but no change made to menu or waitress serving what you ordered correcting the errors in the printed menu is unacceptable.  The ahi tuna taco appetizer was amazing. The tortilla soup was just mediocre. The menu item stating it was chicken stuffed with shrimp and spinach only to be served between two dried out cutlets with a sauce and three shrimp and spinach in between these cutlets does not constitute stuffed by any means.  Go now because if things don't change this place won't make it for too long inSummerlin.
