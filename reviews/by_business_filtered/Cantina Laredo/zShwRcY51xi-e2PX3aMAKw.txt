As a continuation of a Saturday afternoon drink/food fest, we decided to drive a quick 5 minutes away and visit Cantina Laredo in Tivoli Village.  To our surprise, they had a happy hour going on.  Please be advised that it is only in the bar.

For the happy hour, the margaritas were half off and so were the beers.  I just got a Pacifico but it was cheap!  Our tables decided to get a bunch of different appetizers.  Oh, I almost forgot!  If you check in on Foursquare (after checking into Yelp of course!), your table will get a free queso!

What I really love is the unlimited chips and salsa that the staff brings to your table.  I was very appreciative of that.  The chili con queso (usually $7.85) was a little runny but the flavor was awesome!  It came in a soup bowl and fed us for a long time!  Try taking the tortilla chips and dipping it into that.  It's total bomb diggity :)  Our table also got a few chicken and pork tacos, as well as chicken fajitas nachos al carbon for $10.  It was a full plate of the chicken, melted cheese peppers and goodness!  The chicken tacos or Taco De Pollo for $9.45 was Fajita chicken with avocado, pico de gallo, queso fresco and poblano drizzle.  It was packed with a lot of flavor!  Avocado is creamy and chunky and the pico de gallo offers a light taste with fresh ingredients.  The Tacos De Carnitas for $10.05 includes Slow-roasted pork with chipotle wine sauce.  I love slow roasted shredded pork.  So much flavor.  So much juice.  On point!

All in all, this place was a great time!  Since the outside area is so inviting and close to the bar, I would maybe suggest to extend the happy hour to that area.  That would make this place perfect!  No matter, I will be back!
