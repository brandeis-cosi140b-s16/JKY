One menu lunch or dinner, nice views of the fountains especially at night, and a decent south western ambiance. Your standard is a bowl of chips and salsa. Not just any chips,  a Melody Sweet potato, flour with a sweet chiptole dusting and corn chips. 

The menu consists of many tex-mex foods.  I sually stick to the seared Ahi tuna sandwich served with fries. The Tuna is of high grade with a spicy seasoning. The bun is standard as are the fries. all for about $10

My friend usually opts for the "black and blue quesadilla" a steak and blue cheese quesadilla that is busting with flavor. This dish can sometimes lack consistency and the cheese is not well distributed in the tortilla. 

Even if one skips the desert you are treated to a small white chocolate desert wrapped in a corn husk, it will make your hands sticky but it is worth it.
