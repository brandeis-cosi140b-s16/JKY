We had a long layover so we decided to take a taxi downtown. I'm not sure but I think the taxi driver took the long way there, 20 bucks from the airport seemed a bit much considering how close it was. 
But as for Sam's cafe, we really enjoyed it. The chips and salsa was a good start, I like how the basket was an assortment of chips. They prepared the guacamole fresh in front of you too which was pretty cool. We both enjoyed the food. I had this skillet lasagna dish and my girl had a carnitas and something combo plate. The carnitas were a little dry for my liking though. They were a few items on the menu that looked really good too so if I'm ever in the area again I'll hopefully try them. 
Oh, we took light rail back to the airport for $1.75 each and took us less time to get there. Just in case you're traveling like us.
