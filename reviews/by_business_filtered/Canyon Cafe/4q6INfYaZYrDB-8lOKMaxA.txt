After having had some underwhelming meals at our hotel and around the convention district, this place was a BIG treat. The service was spot on, and we knew the meal was going to be good as soon as they brought out their special mixed chips and dark, smoky salsa. After our margaritas appeared (their special margaritas come out with a refill in the shaker), our entrees did not disappoint. Hearty chicken in the enchiladas and quesadilla, and our friend's intriguing 'naked' chili relleno. Portions were beyond generous, and thanks to checking in with Yelp we shared a dessert for free. We chose the banana burrito and had no regrets. Highly recommended. Sad that I won't be back in Phoenix any time soon - I'd definitely come back if this were in my city!!
