Not happy at all and definitely not coming back.
My colleague and I met for a business lunch here and sat at a high top table near the bar. We let our waiter know that we were in a bit of a rush. Even to get our waters took a long time.
I ordered the fish tacos and they were yuck. I was definitely not impressed at all. Aside for my plate taking 40 minutes to get served, it was cold.
We paid and immediately left hungry.
