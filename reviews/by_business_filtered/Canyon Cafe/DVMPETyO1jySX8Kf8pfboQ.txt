My boyfriend and I came here for dinner for our anniversary after a baseball game and to our surprise, mostly everything was amazing! His adova rib eye was cooked just right and had succulent flavors to the dry last bite. My adova penne chicken pasta wasn't far behind! Not to mention the chocolate chip and pecan complimentary tamale was totally different than the traditional tamales we're accustomed to yet scrumptious! I would have gave this restaurant, formerly Sam's cafe, 5 stars but the guacamole was too lemony and our service was pretty slow at the beginning despite seeing tons of staff pass us on by, but once the manager took notice everything changed! Definitely coming back next time we're in Phoenix!
