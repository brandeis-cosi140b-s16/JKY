This is a decent place. I came here some time ago because I had a Restaurant.com certificate, and the BF and I needed to use it up. 

The best part were the margaritas- tasty and lethal. I can't remember what I got, only that it had coconut in it. It shouldn't have worked, but it did! 

The food itself was... so-so. It was edible, nothing to write home about. The service was good, and the ambience lovely. We went in the fall and sat on the patio.

I wouldn't come out of my way to dine here, but if you were in the neighborhood during happy hour, it's definitely worth stopping in.
