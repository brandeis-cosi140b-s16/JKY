It's a day like any other, or so you think. 
During your daily exercise session, a short walk to the mailbox, everything is about to change.
You're a goner now.
It's a letter from the class reunion committee with your wife's hyphenated maiden name on it, and this can only mean one thing.
Saying goodbye to carbs for the next 3 months as she starts serving up swill with hefty amounts of god forsaken vegetables and no carbs. 
Yes, she'll try any diet to lose weight, and on her way down, into this veggie-eating, omni-farting hell, take you with her in the process. 

It's ok, don't panic.
You're a yuppie remember? You live downtown in one of those overpriced lofts, within walking distance from the Arizona Center. 

Here's my recommendation.

Walk to Sam's. It's a few more steps than the mailbox, but at least you won't find any unwanted surprises. 
Carb loading? You bet. 
Order the Desert Fire Pasta, Pancho's Carnitas, or the Chicken Quesadilla. 
All noteworthy, especially if you're trying to negate the affects of your wife's cabbage-reunion soup. 
Sam's delights. Try it.
