We ate here during lunch on Sunday and I can't understand why this place wasn't packed. They have the best vegetarian fajitas, chips and salsa that I've ever had...and I eat Mexican food a lot. The chips are mixed, some are won tons, some are sweet potato crisps and some are seasoned corn chips...all mixed together. Our waiter explained that the salsa takes two days to make the concoction of roasted vegetables. I had my free checkin dessert to go...and there was a lot to choose from. If I lived in the area, I would definitely frequent this place.
