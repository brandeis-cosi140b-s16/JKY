Ate here with a group of work associates while staying across the street for a conference. Service was very good - our waiter handled the large group with ease, which doesn't always happen.

The chips and salsa are unlike any I've had anywhere else and they were totally addictive! My end of the table demolished our bowl in minutes and then grabbed the one from the other end. 

The entrees left a bit to be desired, however. Lots of seafood - which just doesn't seem right in the desert. I would have liked more traditionally tex-mex dishes to choose from as I eventually settled on the enchilada and carnitas platter, which was OK. 

All things considered, it was a good experience and I'm sure I'll be back next time business brings me to Phoenix.
