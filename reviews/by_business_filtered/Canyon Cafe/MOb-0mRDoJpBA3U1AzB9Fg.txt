Sam's cafe was a nice place to go for lunch or Dinner and enjoy some Tex~Mex if your in the downtown area. They are conveniently located on 3rd not far from the convention center.  The Tex~Mex Decor was sorta fun with a small bar area near the front and a huge patio along the park side of the restaurant.   

The service was a bit slow but they were very busy for lunch.  I think everyone at our table had salads, all were A~OK.  Their Cobb salad was rated the best at our table.  The Blacken steak taco salads were lacking steak and and other veggies would have been nice too in addition to just lettuce, cheese and diced pieces of steak.  The Cobb was full of everything your would expect with a good Cobb salad and was very tasty.  The Chicken taco salad was better than the steak.

The chips and salsa at first appeared to be very impressive as many other Yelpers have mentioned however your either a fan or not a fan.  I'm not a fan unfortunately...  The chips were too greasy with way too much of their seasoning!  I especially did not like their salsa.  It had no heat and HUGE chunks of tomato's! YYYEEAA~UCK.  Way too much work to get to the little bits of salsa that were actually kind of good.  I asked for a different salsa, my server just brought us some hot sauce to add to the salsa. Some of folks at our table did like their chips and salsa though. The Grand Canyon Margaritas were very good and a recommend from me to you.  

Suggestion: seek out the "Info-dude" that walks around the Mall area to show people where to go and ask him for some coupons. We were able to get 20% off our meal coupons from him.  Based on their margaritas and a few other Yelp reviews I'm looking forward to my next visit but will order something different.
