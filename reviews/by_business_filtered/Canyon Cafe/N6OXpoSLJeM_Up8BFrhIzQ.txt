So we came here for drinks after work, and the sign says "half price Margaritas." After we order the first round we find out the happy hour is only if you order drinks from the bar. Really? That first round was really weak, by the way. After bringing this to the waiter's attention, he "checked" with his manager and gave us the happy hour price. Needless to say, we didn't order any more drinks from him and he made himself scarce. Would have ordered food, if he came back and checked on us. Ever. Gave two stars because he bumped down the price (as he should) and the chips and salsa were good.
