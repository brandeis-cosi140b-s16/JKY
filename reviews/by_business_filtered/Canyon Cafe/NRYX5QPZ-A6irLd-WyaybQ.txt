Positives:
*Chips and salsa
*Nice outdoor seating 
*Fish tacos with light salad was delicious
*Affordable prices

Negatives:
*It took 45 min for the food to be brought out even though the restaurant was not very busy and especially after several inquiries about our order, stressing that we needed to be back for a conference.  Because the food came out so late we had to get it boxed up.
*Orders were incorrect.
*No apologies from management or wait staff.
