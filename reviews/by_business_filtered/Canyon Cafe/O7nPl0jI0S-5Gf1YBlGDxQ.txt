I was surprised that it took me a year a half to realize that this place was so close to me. Wish I had known a long time ago. 

I came here for lunch with a couple of buddies and from the very beginning I was impressed. We got seated right away and our chips and salsa came within seconds of sitting down! And let me just say, this is the BEST ASSORTMENT of chips I've ever had at a restaurant. There were typical white/yellow corn chips, along with blue chips and sweet potato chips and other stuff. Very tasty. The salsa tasted a little "pre-made" to me but it was still decent. 

I ordered the carnitas and enchiladas platter. It was pretty good. The carnitas had good flavor (but there was only one tortilla) and the enchiladas had a good creamy sauce on top. I also liked the fact that they offered us a carafe of water so they didn't have to keep coming around to refill it for us. I know for some that seems a little lazy and cheesy, but I think it's AWESOME!

The best part was the little mini White-Chocolate/Pecan tamale at the end. It was REALLLLLLY good and wanted about 10 more. Bill was pretty cheap and I really liked the atmosphere of the restaurant. Definitely going back.
