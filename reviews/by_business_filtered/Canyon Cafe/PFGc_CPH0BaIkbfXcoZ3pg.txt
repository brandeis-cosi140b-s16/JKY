I dined here three times in one month, each time with different groups. We all enjoyed the experience. The chips are made fresh on site and believe me, you can tell! 

Lots of outdoor seating right there by the palm trees and water fountains at Arizona Center. There are usually a few birds squawking and chirping in the background as well. No charge for this entertainment. 

Tried several dishes (NOT all in one sitting!), including tacos and enchiladas. All excellent. 

Full bar and indoor seating as well if desired. Friendly staff each visit. 

And here's a nice touch: they give out these corn husk-wrapped white chocolates as complimentary dessert. Make sure you unwrap those husks or you'll be in for a nasty surprise. 

The goods are on the inside. Not the outside. 

But on the inside? Savory, cool white chocolate. It tastes a bit like butter pecan ice cream (if anyone can even remember that flavor, which seems to have gone the way of vinyl albums and phone booths). 

Check out the Canyon Cafe. I believe you'll also become a fan.
