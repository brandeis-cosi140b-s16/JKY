Came here twice for dinner while staying at a hotel across the street for a conference. Staff was very friendly. Food was awesome. The first night I had the Carnitas Platter...second night I tried Pancho's Enchiladas. The chips and salsa were yummy! Nicely seasoned, and once in awhile you'll find some sweet potato chips mixed in. The white chocolate tamale they give you at the end of your meal was a perfect ending.
