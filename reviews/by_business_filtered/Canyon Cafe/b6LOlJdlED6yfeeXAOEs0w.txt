Great location. Food good. Came here on a Monday night about 10 minutes before closing and they accommodated us. Service was pretty quick and good. Outdoor seating available.

We ordered margaritas which were delicious. They bring the entire mixer, so you get about 1.5 - 2 glasses once you're finished drinking it.

We had the fish tacos and Avodo chicken pasta. Both tasted good and were cooked just right. Portions were fairly sizable. 

Dining space is fairly large and is good for groups.
