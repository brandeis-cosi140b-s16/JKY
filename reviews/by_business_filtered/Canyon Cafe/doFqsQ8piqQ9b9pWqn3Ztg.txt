Stopped at Sam's for a work lunch. Great location. It's good to have places like this downtown. 

Everyone in our group enjoyed the food. From the variety of pre-meal chips, the entrees, and the post meal white chocolate tamales. 

I had the shrimp tacos an they were great. Fresh, rich with flavor, and very filling.

I'd like to stop in after work some time for some margaritas.
