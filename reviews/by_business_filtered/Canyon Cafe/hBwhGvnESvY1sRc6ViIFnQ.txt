Went here per a friends margarita suggestion. I had the Rico Rita which was a pi√±a colada-ish flavored margarita. Very tasty while a little on the light side. For $10 you got about 2 glasses worth as they bring out the shaker, which was nice. I didn't order an entree but I did attack the chips which were awesommmme! The basket was a mix of a few different types, including sweet potato, with a southwestern spice sprinkled on. Yum yum yum! I would go back for the chips and a heavier handed margarita!
