Great find thanks to Yelp! My family and I were at the Convention Center for my niece's dance competition and we didn't know where to eat. My sister mentioned that she felt like Mexican food so I pulled up the handy dandy Yelp app and began searching. This gem popped up.

It's about a 10-15 min. walk from the Convention Center and is located in the Arizona Center near the fountains. 

I ordered the vegetable pasta, my sister and mom ordered veggie fajitas and my dad ordered the applewood smoked salmon. The fajitas looked really really good! They had various kinds of vegetables in them, not just peppers and onions like some other places do. My veggie pasta was really delicious. It's pasta with a garlic black bean soy sauce. It's topped with roasted vegetables. The only thing is i wish I knew that there were tomatoes in it because I would have ordered it without. Not a big deal though, since I was able to pick them out. My dad's salmon was fresh and he said it was delicious. We didn't order dessert, even though their deserts look AMAZING. They have something called a banana burrito, which looks really good. This restaurant also has a gluten free menu if that's how you roll. 

Our server Ryan was really good! He made sure our drinks were full and brought us new chips when our basket was empty. He was very attentive and made sure our visit was superb. BTW, their tortilla chips are out of this world. 

We sat outside on the patio and overlooked the lit up palm trees and the fountains. It was really nice out and our visit was very pleasant. There was also some live music playing. The food took a little long to come out but it wasn't ridiculous. You can tell everything was prepared fresh, so I didn't mind having to wait an extra few minutes...plus my dad ordered an appetizer which delayed things a bit. 

Next time we go back I'll definitely try the table-side guacamole...that looked really good and probably tastes really fresh.
