AMAZING SERVICE AND FOOD!!

This is the third time my husband and I have been to the Canyon Caf√© and I felt I needed to write a review.  The patio is beautiful and the sound of the water is so relaxing.  Even when the weather is cold, sitting under the heat lamp makes it just perfect.  We were limited on time this past visit and asked if they could get us fed in 1/2 hr.  They recommended food that was fast and from start to finish got us out in 20min.  The tortilla soup was awesome and the tacos fresh and delicious.  We have had different meals each time and everything has always been fabulous.  The chips and salsa set the tone for a great meal and the white chocolate treat is a nice finishing touch.  I definitely recommend that EVERYONE gives this place a try when at the Arizona Center.  It is now one of our favorites.
