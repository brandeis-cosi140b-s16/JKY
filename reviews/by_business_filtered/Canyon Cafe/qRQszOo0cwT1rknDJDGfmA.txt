this place is decent. the service was great. there is a nice outside patio surrounded by trees lit up with pretty blue lights. the food was good; i had the shrimp quesadilla. my fave was the rico rita drink. they have a 2 drink max policy on this drink b/c it's supposed to get you soooooo wasted and um well i assure you i am not an alki but this drink did nothing of the sort. but it was very tasty! i will try to make this at home :P 

i would recommend if you're in the az shopping centre but i wouldn't go out of my way to eat there.
