Ummm...in a word, no!  Waited half an hour, yes I timed it. That was because I wanted to sit outside and there was a big crowd at the time, sort of a convention that must have all gone to eat at once.  Okay, that was fine. I waited at the bar and ordered iced tea, with no offer of sweetener.  Waited and was seated about 1/2 hour later.  Sat, and the menu looked good.  Ordered enchiladas.  When they came out so quickly I was surprised.  When I saw them, I couldn't help but think they had been sitting in a warming dish and that is why they were prepared so quickly.  Taste was lackluster.  "Salad" served with it was more like some chopped lettuce, that I couldn't tell if dressing had been put on it or not.  If there was I couldn't taste it.  Cheese on top was a sort of creamy cheese sauce, nothing to write home about.  Served on rice, it was sort of dry and not really hot...thus my thinking that they were sort of held warm until served.  No cheddar cheese, no guacamole, no beans.  This dish needed help!!!  Started to check in on YELP to rate while I was sitting there and noticed that I got a free dessert with my meal by checking in.  Had the cheesecake which was thick...if that is the word.  Bill was $14, which I thought was fair.  Had better.  If you are really desperate for good TexMex, and don't mind a drive, the Hyatt Gainey Ranch hotel in Scottsdale, yes hotel food, is amazing and a view to die for.  Yes, it's about 1/2 hour away by car, but I think next time I'll make the drive.
