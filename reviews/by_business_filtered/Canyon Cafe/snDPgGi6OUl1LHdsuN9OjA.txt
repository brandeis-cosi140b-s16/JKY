This is a perfect low key relaxing restaurant with great southwest food outside the usual tacos, fajitas, etc.  I sat outdoors today and there were kids present but it was quiet, and relaxing.  I ordered the southwest Caesar salad which was a perfect variation on a classic.  I then received my entree the Santa Fe stuffed chicken breast.  So flavorful and huge!  The asparagus was cooked perfectly.  I also got a free dessert for checking in on yelp.  There are small remnants of the previous Sams cafe but it's the good things.  Staff is friendly and low key.
