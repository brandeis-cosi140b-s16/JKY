I really enjoyed this place. I had some great grilled tuna with rice and veggies. It was cooked perfectly and the seasonings didn't overwhelm the tuna. Everyone else at the table got more traditional mexican dishes...tacos, fajitas etc. and they really seemed to enjoy them! I also had an AMAZING margarita. It was a specialty one with citrus flavors, I don't even like tequila but it was delicious. The outdoor seating area is beautiful. We ate surrounded by trees covered in twinkle lights, so pretty.
