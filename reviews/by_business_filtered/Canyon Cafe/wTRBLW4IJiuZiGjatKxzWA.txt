Our new favorite place to dine! We have a difficult  time deciding what to order on the large and tempting Southwestern menu. The appetizers are also fabulous...the fried calamari is the best, served with a creamy spicy dipping sauce... large portion....enough for two as a meal. The prices are reasonable and the staff have become our friends. The surrounding outdoor area is beautiful, with fountains and twinkly lit trees. The cafe is located in the Arizona Center so a nice place to walk and shop after dinner.
Ask any ASK ME AMBASSADOR (those guys in orange are great and know what's best in Phoenix) and they will direct you to Sam's.
