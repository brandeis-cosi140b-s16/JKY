Green chile and pork are like peanut butter and jelly. This place has the best! It's even better than my homemade carnitas. So much flavor, the pork isn't completely shredded to oblivion, it's nice and chunky. 
Navajo tacos are my favorite, just ask them to go light on the cheese. (Trust me, they use a TON of cheese)
