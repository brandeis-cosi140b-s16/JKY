With the abundance of good quick Mexican eateries in the area; a new one has to be pretty special to get my business. I ordered the chicken enchiladas dinner plate. The enchiladas were okay, but small for the price. The dinner plate included lots of standard-fare rice and beans, some shredded lettuce, and one good sopapilla (served with honey). Strangely, when I asked, they didn't have any hot sauce available.

I didn't like the fact that the plate on which the food was served was an aluminum take-out container - with no place to recycle it in-store. Incredibly wasteful, and not eco-friendly. 

I also found the loud TV's - one blaring some FOX "news" political program and the other offering a screaming football match - to be really REALLY annoying. 

I won't be going back. Plenty of other good places that offer better food without the propaganda.
