I have been waiting to try this place for a long time.  We decided to hit it up the other night and I see what I have been missing.  My wife had the cheese enchiladas with red sauce and my friend and I shared a sopapilla with pork chile verde with green sauce and a chorizo burrito christmas style.  I don't like spicy food but this was just the perfect amount of hot for me.  Not too spicy but just enough to get me to sweat a little bit.  Every single dish was delicious.  The pork was so tender and flavorful.  Both the red and green sauces were great!  And, they have $1 beers all the time.  Are you kidding me?  This place is a great spot to get some delicious (New) Mexican food and grab some cheap brews!
