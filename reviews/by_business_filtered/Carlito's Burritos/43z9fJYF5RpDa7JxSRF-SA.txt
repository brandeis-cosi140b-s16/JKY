I have eaten here many times and always have a good experience and enjoy the food.  Sometimes they get busy so I have had to wait a bit, but that happens at any food place, so I just find a table and wait for them to bring it out and they do in a large portion!  If you are looking for more than fast food but don't want a full restaurant this is a great place to eat and I fully recommend it!
