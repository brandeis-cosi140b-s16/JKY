My husband and I absolutely love this place. My husband is from New Mexico and couldn't get here fast enough once we learned of this place. I was excited as well since I learned to appreciate the Hatch chile on visits to New Mexico.

This little restaurant is packed pretty much all the time which isn't shocking if you've had the food. The people that work here start to remember you and that is refreshing in an anonymous town like Las Vegas. One Saturday I arrived after the rib special was sold out and the woman working here remembered me the next week and made sure I got one of the specials.

The food is the real attraction though. My favorite thing here is the Saturday night special which is Red Chile Adovada ribs with green chile cheddar mashed potatoes and calabacitas. I love to pair this with the $3 margarita. Seriously, the margarita is $3 and it packs some punch. We also love the Frito Pie which is big enough for two. If you're familiar with Green Chile Stew then you should try it here because it won't disappoint. It packs the heat that Green Chile Stew should have.
