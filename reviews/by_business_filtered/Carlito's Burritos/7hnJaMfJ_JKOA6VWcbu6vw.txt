There aren't enough good things that can be said about this place. 

I've been hitting Carlito's every weekend for months now, and I'm constantly pleased. The service is quick, the food is always fresh and delicious, and the atmosphere is great. 

If you're a Vegas local and have friends/family in town, take them to Carlito's and they'll thank you.
