I was going to give this little place 4 stars because of the small dining area, but the food gets 6 stars; hence it gets 5 stars. This is the best green chili in the city. It's New Mexico style which is hard to find in Las Vegas for some inexplicable reason. The green chili is spicy with bits of the green chili in it. This is as opposed to the blended and smooth version which can be equally good. I ordered stuffed sopapilla that is also a New Mexico specialty not easily found in Las Vegas,  Mine was stuffed with ground beef. The order was served in an aluminum to-go container. I received two sopapillas with cheese melted over them and surrounded by plenty of the first rate green chili. It was a generous and delicious portion. For those of you who crave green chili, I can highly recommend this place. One other thing. They have a nice selection of beers as well as margaritas.
