I drove all the way across town to try this place, but they would not honor my Restaurant.com certificate that I paid money for.  That was a month ago, yet they are still selling them online today!!!  It's fraud.   They should consider this policy as it leads to multiple online postings of bad reviews.

Anyway their prices are high for Mexican food.  They spent all their time on the phone and ignored us when we went in.  We even sat down and nobody even noticed us.  We had to get up to fetch our own paper menus.   It's definitely not worth it at full price.  It's hard to find.  They're not nice.  That about sums it up.

No thanks.
