I love this place! 
I've eaten at this place several times for lunch when I worked on the east side of town and have never been disappointed. The burritos are Huge!. I've taken my son and daughter in law and they loved it too. They've gone back and said their breakfast burritos are the "bomb". I so wish there was one on the west side.
