Albuquerque native and upfront just not NM quality . Some items are fair attempts but most miss the mark. Red chile is off almost tastes like there is tomato sauce in it . The green was ok , maybe I'm too accustomed to having the best in the country available at numerous Albq locations.They are Very proud of their menu too . Most Items  would be the price for two of the items in NM. You want to call yourself authentic NM, taste quality price.Sorry 3 strikes against Carlito's.
