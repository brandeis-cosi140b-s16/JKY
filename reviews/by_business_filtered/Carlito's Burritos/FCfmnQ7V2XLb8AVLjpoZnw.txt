I was looking for a spicy burrito, and that's what I got. On my sous chef's recommendation, I hit up Carlito's for some New Mexican fare, a culinary branch I'm totally unfamiliar with. The offerings at Carlito's seemed similar to a classy Roberto's with a few pleasing twists (calabacitas, fried egg on enchiladas, green chili sauce, etc).

I went with a wet combo green chili pork burrito with all the free fixins inside. I was warned it would be spicy-- it was. I like heat and it was a perfect amount. I enjoyed the pork meat, too. I also got the $3 sides and sopapilla option. The bread was not my style (greasy and doughy) and my two sides were just alright (posole and chili). I love hominy so I fished out the pieces in the posole and enjoyed those. I would not do the upgrade to my meal again since I hardly ate any of it.

Overall, 4 stars. My burrito was enormous and tasty.
