How this place has been here without me knowing about it seems somewhat impossible! I love Mexican food, I love green chilies, and they have Indian fry bread tacos?!?! Ok, so the fry bread is called the "Navajo" taco and to me isn't even their best attribute. 
The best thing about this place? THEY SERVE 3 ENCHILADAS INSTEAD OF 2!!! Maybe that's not a big deal to you, but 2 cheese enchiladas is just almost enough, every time! Also, you can choose green or red sauce with everything, EVEN SALSAS! Which you should splurge and get the extra chips, salsas, and house mad guac. 
I think they only have one location, and it is for sure a family operation. I have always seen regulars when I go, and been treated like I am one. I have yet to actually try a burrito, but between the tacos and enchiladas, I am always happy. I have dined in as well as gotten take out orders and never once been disappointed. 
This place could expand and I hope if they do, they keep everything the same. No need to change what is already great.
