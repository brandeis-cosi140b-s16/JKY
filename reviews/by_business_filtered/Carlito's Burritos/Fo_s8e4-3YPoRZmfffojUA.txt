Maybe New Mexican food just isn't my thing but I don't see how anyone could enjoy it.  

I went into Carlito's optimistically, as the aroma of delicious food was seeping outside into the parking lot.  I ordered a chicken Carlito's burrito with green chili sauce, no tortilla, no cheese, and plenty of delicious fixings.  

When I arrived back to my office, I was disappointed to see that oil had seeped out of the container into the bag- gross- but to be expected with Mexican food.  Unfortunately, although plenty of oil had spilled out the the carton, there was still a ton in the container.  It was a soupy grease disaster.  Regardless of me ordering no cheese it was covered, which only added to the grease factor.  

Despite the look of the food I pressed on and with each bite I was more and more disgusted.  The chicken was poor quality.  It was fatty and had excess cartilage.  I could barely taste the green chili sauce through all the oil.  It was so bad I threw it away after a few bites.  

It looked NOTHING like the photos online and was genuinely disgusting.  Needless to say, I won't be coming back.
