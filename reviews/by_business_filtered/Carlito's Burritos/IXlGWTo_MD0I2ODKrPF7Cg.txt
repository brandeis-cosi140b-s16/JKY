New Mexican cuisine - yaay for entrepreneurs willing to try something new!

Carne adovada IS very good.  go for the red+green christmas style if you have sauce on your meal.  Fajitas are also very good, although we had some stale tortillas on our last visit.  I told the owner & am confident he'll take care of the problem next time.  

Breakfast burritos are good; take advantage of that 2-for-1 coupon.  Also, if you like mariachi music, they have a couple guys there every friday (funny/fun).   Go Carlito, GO!  :)
