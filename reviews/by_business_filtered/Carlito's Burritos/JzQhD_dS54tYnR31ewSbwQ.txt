This is a great spot to grab some good food and cold drinks. I wouldn't call this place Mexican, it's more New Mexico, everything here really revolves around the 'chile' which is a great thing because it's delicious.  

They have daily specials at night which seem great but so far I've only tried the bacon breakfast burrito smothered in green chile and Carlitos roja carnitas burrito smothered in red chile with a bunch of toppings. 

The best bite that I've had from here was the Carlitos roja carnitas burrito smothered in red cause with several toppings.
