Went to lunch solo the other day and thought it was time to post a Yelp.  About my fifth time here.  Live and work way on the other side of town so don't get by here much.  I think it's a real gem.  I've had the Carlitto's chile verde pork burrito several times, huge and very spicy!...and all of the different tacos, with a great shell and juicy, delicious meats and toppings.  Three tacos or the burrito make for a BIG lunch or fine dinner.  The chips and salsa are expensive until you see the truckload they bring you, with a great seasoning on them.  You won't be disappointed.
