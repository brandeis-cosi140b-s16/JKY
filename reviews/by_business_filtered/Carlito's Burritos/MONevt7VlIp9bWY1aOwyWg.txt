Went in to order food to go last night. Placed my order and after about 15 minutes I could see what I thought were my 2 stuffed sopapillas being placed under the heating lamp. So, I decided to watch and wait... for 10 minutes.

Then the waitress bagged up our food and passed it off to me. I mentioned something to the waitress about the food being under the heat lamp for 10 minutes and she just walked away. I was gonna raise hell but after waiting for 25 minutes I wasn't going to have them remake it because they were so freaking slow in the first place and I don't like the idea of spit in my food.

I drive home, a total of 3 minutes, and found cold, gluey, gross sopapillas with congealed, greasy cheese and a complete lack of green chile. Disgusting!

Never, ever, ever again.
