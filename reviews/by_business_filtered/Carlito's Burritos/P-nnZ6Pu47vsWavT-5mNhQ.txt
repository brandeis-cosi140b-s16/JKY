Spicy, spicy, spicy!!!  Now that that is out of the way, I thoroughly enjoyed my eating experience here.  I recently moved from the San Diego area, so I am very particular about my Mexican food and have been hesitant to try out a new place for fear of disappointment.  Carlito's came up in my search for Mexican food and this NEW Mexican burrito did not disappoint!  I ordered the pork verde burrito wet to go.  My order came out quickly and the portions are huge!  The staff was also friendly, which is certainly a must for me.  I will definitely be returning here again.  I am anxious to see what their other menu choices have to offer.
