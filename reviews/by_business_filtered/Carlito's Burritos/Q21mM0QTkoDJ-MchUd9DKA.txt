Only reason I'm giving them 4 stars and not 5 stars is that, if you're trying to eat there...forget it- open tables a scarce and they've crammed what they can into this little place. Need a larger space. It's loud and busy, but AWESOME for the food. If you get the right person at the right time of day they can be friendly and not rushed. I usually order ahead (give each my number for the discount) & wait in the long line to pick up. Could benefit if there was a pick-up and order lines, but again....LIMITED SPACE. Everything I've had has been great with plenty of flavor. Sopapillas with the honey...great sweet snack. Pork Verde (Carlitos Burrito) & smothered is the way to do it!!! Share or make it lunch and dinner!!! Breakfast burritos are great as well. Give yourself some time, and go!
