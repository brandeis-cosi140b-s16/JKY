Finally, great New Mexican cuisine in Las Vegas.  You'll clear your sinuses while having fantastic red and green chile delights..along with sopapillas and maybe the odd chile relleno or two.  Dang, I shouldn't have written this review..I'm just making myself hungry again.  One of the hidden gems in the desert.
