This place was great. The prices are amazing, the service is friendly, and the food is delicious. This is not Taco bell or Margaritaville. Mexican food and New Mexican food are two different flavors. It's not suppose to have tons of spices and salts like Mexican food does. It's the tastiness of the fresh ingredients and the hot chili that makes this food amazing. 

The reviews that said the food was bland, are just use to dousing their food in salt.

My fiance is from New Mexico so it was a relief to find a place where you can take home frozen green chilies and tortillas. We also ordered our 4 dozen tamales for Christmas.

Everyone needs to give this place a shot. We will be going here at least twice a week from now on.
