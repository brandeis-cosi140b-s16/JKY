Veggie burrito with calabacitas(kinda spicy veg) is addicting smothered in green or red sauce or both (Xmas style). Green chile cheese cake is delicious.  Independently owned. dollar pints.  So much better than Roberto's  and the same price!  My co-worker from NM takes 2 buses to get to get to carlitos the food is that awesome.
