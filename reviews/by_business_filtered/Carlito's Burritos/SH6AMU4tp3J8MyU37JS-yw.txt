Been meaning to come here since I moved to Vegas but I'm rarely on this side of town so when I was I went there early on a Thursday morning. 

When I walked in I knew I was in for a treat. You can smell the Green Chile and it smells like I've walked into a real New Mexican restaurant back home. 

I ordered a Green Chile bacon breakfast burrito. I was not dissapointed this is a legitimate New Mexican restaurant and I felt like I was eating a Twisters burrito back in Albuquerque. 

The burrito was large and loaded up with plenty of bacon, egg, potato, and green chile. 

I would love to sit down and be able to try a little of everything here. There is no place in Vegas to compare to because New Mexican cooking is completely differrent then a typical Mexican restaurant but it is better then any other place.
