So where else do you go in the valley for frybread? New Mexican cuisine is very different from regional mexican or tex-mex or Peruvian, etc. and if you're a fan of the other side of Arizona then Carlito's does an admirable job.

Yes, you have to go to New Mexico at this point to find the award winners but what other choices do we have? I think Carlito's beats where there ain't any. I hope others get the idea; every time I've been there's a crowd.

I had the Navajo Taco which probably needs adjustment but the green pork  burrito (wet) with lettuce, tomato and cilantro on top of it all really made me happy happy. Oh yeah, don't forget the calabacitas inside for your good health.

There's nothing to say about sopapillas - if you haven't had one or two then oh well. But if you know what a churro is then you better get going.
Now.

So Carlito's is beyond okay 'cause everyone I've taken along so far really likes it/them.
