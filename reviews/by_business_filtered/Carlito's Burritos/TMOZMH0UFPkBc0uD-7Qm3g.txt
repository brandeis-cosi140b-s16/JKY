We are always on the lookout for green chile smothered burritos. We had been here a few years ago, and being back on this side of town we had to try it out again to see if it was as good as we remembered it. 
YES! It absolutely is, and it actually seemed a bit better. On Sundays they have buy one breakfast burrito, get one free. I believe that it is for just their breakfast ones...which they sell all day. I got the bacon with green chile, and smothered in green chile. My husband got the chorizo the same way. The woman at the counter was not really the most friendly, either that or she was super busy. I could not really tell. There was us, and she had just put the phone down. No smile. As a matter of fact, the only thing she asked was 'red or green'...meaning the sauce. We sat and waited while they were made. We took these to go, and had to endure the smell of them on the drive home. 

These things were huge. So big that we saved some (okay, most in my case) of it for later in the day. There was so much filling of eggs, hashbrowns and meat. Nicely smothered in a spicy sauce. These were exactly what we were craving. If you are looking for a big, super filling breakfast burrito then look no further. You can get it smothered for $1 extra in either red or green sauce.
