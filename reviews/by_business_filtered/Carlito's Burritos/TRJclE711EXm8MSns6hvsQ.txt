If you love authentic New Mexican food, you will want to roll in the green chili at carlitos. I have never had a bad meal here and I've been going to carlitos for over 7years. Stuffed sopapillas are amazing! Breakfast burritos are amazing! Green chili stew is amazing! You can't go wrong, this place is amazing! Also the staff is wonderful and the facility is always clean. Great job carlitos!!!
