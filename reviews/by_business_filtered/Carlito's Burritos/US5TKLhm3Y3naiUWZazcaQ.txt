The family on my Mom's side are all from New Mexico, so I have eaten a chili or two in my day.  This place knocks it out of the park.  

If you want a medium kick, go with red chili.  Turn it up a notch with green chili.  If you are a total wuss bag, don't get the chili, and go back to New York City.  

My personal favorites here are the breakfast burritos (served all day!!!).  The hash-browns within are always crispy, a feat I will never understand.  Add some carne adovada (pork marinated in red chili) with eggs and cheddar, and your taste buds will salsa dance the rest of the day (or into the night).  For spicier flair, try a pork verde (green chili marinated pork) with extra green chilis.  

I do not suggest getting it "smothered", which is adding even more chilis to the outside, and cheddar.  It is just too much.  Keep the chilis in the burrito, and everything will be just fine.
