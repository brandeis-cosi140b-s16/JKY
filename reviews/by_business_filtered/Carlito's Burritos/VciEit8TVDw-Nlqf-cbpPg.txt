We went to eat here yesterday and as we were ordering we noticed a C rating from SNHD. Now I'm not a horribly fussy person, for the record I have eaten there in the past and enjoyed the food, but the C rating bothered me. I asked the woman who was taking the order about the C rating, she made a face acted very odd and blew me off. I asked again and she rudely told me she had just returned from her days off and knew nothing about it. The C rating really bothered me knowing that a C rating is one step from being closed down, and her sketchy behavior really didn't help the matter so we cancelled our order and left. To the owner I do understand and realize that perhaps inquiring about a rating may be considered rude. However perhaps some customer service training may be in order considering as a regular customer I have seen the woman working the cash register before, she stands out as she has bragged to me and other customers that she's so involved in the restaurant and prominent that people think she's the owner. A simple polite "I'm not sure would you like to contact the owner or manager" would have been acceptable. From a customers stand point I made it clear that I had been there before and enjoyed the food at 8 1/2 months obviously pregnant my inquiry was purely concern and not to put the restaurant down. Despite the fact that this is the only place in Las Vegas I can get the New Mexican food I enjoyed eating in my hometown of Santa Fe, the C rating they currently have, the C rating they had last May (according to the SNHD website), their poor customer service, lack of regard for regular customers. I will not return, and have already told several friends (who eat there) about my experience.
