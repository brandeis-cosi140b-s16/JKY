went in at 8:30pm on a weeknight.  Had half an hour until close.  Place was fairly busy with three women at counter downing margaritas.  They were very "happy" and so loud that my head hurt!  Everyone was screaming and laughing and hanging on each other and the other customers.  I finally had to ask who worked there.  We decided to order for takeout and I told the woman bartender that it was our first time at the place.  She wasn't helpful as to toppings, extras, etc.  Frankly, I wanted to leave the parking lot before the women did.  One other customer got her car keys and brought the car to the front door.  Why are they serving customers that appear so intoxicated?  Oh yeah, food was ok but I was totally turned off by the yelling and craziness.
