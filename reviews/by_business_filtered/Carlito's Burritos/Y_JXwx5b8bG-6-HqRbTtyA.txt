Well once again I come into a negative situation with my dog... I wish some of these people would read the standards handbook about service animals

We were in front of a very long line and the person who is rather chubby was at the cashier register and told my girlfriend he would not even serve her clearly the dog had a vest on a marked badge so we had to go all the way to the back of the line and wait to review our order .....so disappointed
