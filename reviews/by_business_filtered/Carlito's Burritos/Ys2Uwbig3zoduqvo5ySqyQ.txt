Since I'm a Native New Mexican, I'm probably a little tougher on the rating the food at Carlito's Burrito's than others. 
I have been coming here for about 4 years now and I can appreciate having the type of food I'm used to eating growing up in New Mexico.
This is not Roberto's and shouldn't even be compared to it. Those that like Roberto's may not appreciate Carlito's but will appreciate the great food!

Now if we could only do something about synchronized street lights right Dave?!
