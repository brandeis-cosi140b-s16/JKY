Being familiar to New Mexican food, having family & resided there, I wouldn't consider this the most authentic; however, for the price and their Sunday Breakfast Burrito - buy one get one free deal, I don't have much to complain about. We frequent nearly every Sunday and enjoy their Chicken Breakfast Burrito smothered Christmas Style (Green & Red Chili) along with a $1 Carlito Tap Brew. Not only do we cash in on their 2 for 1 but they also offer a loyalty reward patrons can cash in on. We simply filled out a simple form and give our name after we order. After spending $50 you receive a credit for $5 on your next order; which, nearly makes your next trip free! 
We love the early staff but strongly dislike the evening staff. 
As they're popularity grows, seating can be a hassle. The atmosphere is extremely casual and I love football season at Carlito's. They have a few flatscreens and also don't shy from  accommodating their patrons with requests from their DirectTV listings. 
If you are unfamiliar with this type of cuisine but are looking to cure your craving for spicy but flavorful... Try their Carne Adovada Enchiladas. It is a one of a kind entree that should have you coming back for more!
