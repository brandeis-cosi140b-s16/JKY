Was very disappointed in this place.  It looked like an awesome hole-in-the-wall type setting with authentic New Mexican food, but the quality simply didn't deliver.

Menu options were robust, props for having Fry Bread on the menu.  I went for a Carlito's Steak burrito instead, with their famous salsa verde.

The Salsa, instead of being deeply flavorful and robust, came off as thin and excessively salty.  The steak pieces were rubbery and tough, and tasted like they had been boiled instead of fire grilled.

Wish I could say better, but it simply wasn't the case.  Their menu items are tempting enough that i may go back and try something else.
