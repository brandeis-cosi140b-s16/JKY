Now this is real New Mexican food. I've been searching for decent New Mexican food for a long time and haven't found any until now. I came across Carlito's Burritos on Yelp and decided to give it a try based on the great reviews. They use actual hatch chiles. I had enchiladas Christmas style and they were right on point. My wife had the vegetarian burrito smothered Christmas style (ofcourse) and she loved it. My daughter ordered the Frito pie and it was a little too spicy for her. I ended up eating it and loved it. Next time i'm in Vegas, this is the first place that I will visit.
