Nom, nom, nom.....THE BEST Mexican Food in Vegas, and we've tried many places.   If you enjoy NM/Colorado style Mexican Food, with Spicy Green Hatch Chili sauce, this place will become your favorite.   A great amount of heat that doesn't hide the flavor.   The burritos are huge and if you are ever there on a weekend when they are cooking their tri-tip, DO NOT drive by without stopping for a Tri Tip sandwich, smothered in cheddar and green chili sauce.   We drive over 20 miles to eat there from the West side of town and it's worth ever cent of gas money and time to do so.
