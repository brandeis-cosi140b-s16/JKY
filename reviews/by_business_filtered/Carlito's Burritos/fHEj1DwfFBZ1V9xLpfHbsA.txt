Vegetarian Review:

Last year I had gone to New Mexico and had the best South Western food experience.  Doing my research on Yelp, I had found Carlito's and my excitement went up.  However, it went back down when I cut into my burrito.  They put way too much rice and less beans in my burrito.  New Mexico is all about their refried beans and how great they taste.  Carlito's sauce was super hot, not like the kinds I tried out there.

My fiance did love his carne burrito, so that's one extra star for his enjoyment.  

Don't plan on coming back here during my next visit to Vegas, I have to get it right or nothing.  Conclusion, if you're a meat eater, this will be a great place, you should check it out.  As a vegetarian, not so great.
