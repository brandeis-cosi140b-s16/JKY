I love their everything breakfast burrito when they do the half off specials on Wednesday morning up until 11 AM and the two for one Sunday breakfast burritos. I really can't picture paying 9 dollars for any kind of burrito so I go when they have a deal on them. They are completely stuffed with scrambled eggs, hash browns, cheddar, and red or green chile PLUS  bacon, chorizo, sausage and ham. That makes for one really filling burrito. I go for the green sauce because it's spicier and I love spicy food. I would have to say don't smother it because it turns this thing into a fork and knife meal and that's not what breakfast burritos should be about. This place uses extremely fresh ingredients and I love that. The one Debbie downer would have to be that the guy running the register always seems to be kind of miserable, I wish they would hire someone that could greet you as you walked in the door and smile while they take your order.
