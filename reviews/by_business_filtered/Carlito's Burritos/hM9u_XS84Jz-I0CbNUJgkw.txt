An offbeat location, but yummy food! We had the chips, salsa and guac, steak tacos and sugar sopapillas. Yes. They have sopapillas! Regular and sweet ones. They're larger than my hand, too! 

Meat was tender. Green and red salsa were delish! Great portions. Taco shop style seating. I'll be returning for sure.
