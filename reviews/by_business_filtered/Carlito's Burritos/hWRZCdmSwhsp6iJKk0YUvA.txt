We dropped by for dinner around 6pm on a Sunday night. There were a few other customers, but not super busy.

We ordered a burrito and a stuffed sopapilla. Both were generously sized, good tasting and reasonably priced. The service is friendly and the atmosphere is casual and comfortable.

Definitely a nice place to get some tasty grub!
