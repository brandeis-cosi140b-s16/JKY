I hadn't  had the chance to try the Chile Relleano ( It;s a Green Chile pepper with cheese inside and batter dipped and deep fried), I didn't get it smothered I ate it plain and it was awesomely great! Normally they have some kind of special going on every day, It was the Slider which are hamburger wrapped in a flour tortilla, it comes with cheese, Chile relish, and a spiced up mayo. I opted to have it plain with cheese and ended up with a side of Red Chile to dip the Sliders in. What can i say I love that Red Chile!!!
People that work there are always friendly!
