My new favorite mom and pop Mexican...oops sorry New Mexico food. And yes there is a difference between the two.

This is a small little counter service restaurant that has seating for maybe 30 people.  It looked like they get a lot of to go orders though. 

A friend of mine who lived in New Mexico 30 years goes here quite frequently and mentioned I should go try it with him.  Well, I love me a good pork burrito with verde sauce and that's exactly what I had. I ordered the Carlito's Burrito Double Meat (no beans) with pork verde. When I ordered, I was warned about the heat level... no problem though... That was buy far the best Chile verde sauce I have ever had and my burrito was drowning in it, which is just the way I like it.  The pork was cooked perfectly.  I was amazed I was able to finish the whole think, but I pretty much didn't eat until the next day.

The staff there are very friendly and it is run like a family business. They seem to have a lot of Latino clientele which to me is a good sign and a testament to the food.
