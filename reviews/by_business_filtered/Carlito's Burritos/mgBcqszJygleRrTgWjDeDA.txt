First off, I hear people complain that this isn't authentic Mexican food. Well, it isn't Mexican food. It's **New Mexican** food, just like you'll find down in the Land of Enchantment. 

I LOVE New Mexican cuisine, green chile, and I love Carlito's! I've been a fairly regular customer since they opened and have yet to be disappointed with the food or the service. The staff is always friendly and most of them even remember my name- a real rarity these days. The restaurant is very small and does tend to get really crowded during peak meal times. However, even when they are busy the service is still pretty quick. 

My favorites are the Carlitos Burrito with chicken or pork verde smothered in green chile and the pork verde stuffed sopapilla smothered green. If you like it extra spicy like I do, ask for a side of napalm sauce (essentially, it's a habanero pur√©e!!) with your order. Burns. So. Good. 

Occasionally on Saturdays, they do an oak pit BBQ tri-tip. It gets served up on a garlic roll with green chile and cheese and chile seasoned fries. This has got to be one of the best sandwiches ever made. If you get the chance, this sandwich doesn't disappoint (and it's big enough for two). 

In the fall, they bring in Hatch green chiles and sell them by the bushel. You can pick them up fresh or they will roast them for you.  The smell of roasting chilies is almost a religious experience. 

If you love New Mexican cuisine, stop in and give Carlitos a try.
