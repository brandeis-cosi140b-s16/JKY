I realized a long time ago that Mexican food is generally 5 basic ingredients re-arranged in different ways. Beans, Cheese, Meat, Tortilla, Salsa, Sauce, sometimes rice. And while Carlito's is no exception to my keen observation, they do some great re-arranging. 

Tucked away in the south east, Carlitos is probably the only thing keeping this small strip mall in business. The place itself is pretty tiny, and probably can't seat more than 25 people. Yet despite its small size and odd location, the place is usually packed by regulars who are familiar with the food and know what they want.

Carlitos offers traditional fare such as burritos, tacos, nachos and the like. But they throw in some new things to the mix, the sliders (mexican style mini burgers wrapped in tortillas with a chilli relish), green chili stew (super spicy), and the sopapillas (which are essentially fryed fluffy tortillas which they use for a dessert or stuff them for bigger meals)

The food is great for the price. Getting a full meal with a drink is easy under $10, and on top of that they have $1 draft beers (they have their own brew I guess) The tacos are made fresh which deep fryed tortillas made on the spot, and the sopapillas make great fluffy desserts. I thought the huge burrito I ordered was a little on the bland side. Each week day they have specials going on, the best is probably $1 taco tuesdays. Just remember that the place gets packed. Tell your friends to grab a seat or get it to go. Definitely worth checking out if your into Mexican food and tired of your regular places.
