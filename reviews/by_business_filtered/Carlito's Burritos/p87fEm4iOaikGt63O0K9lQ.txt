Absolutely delicious! And a lot more reasonably priced than I first thought. I only heard about this place from Marianne Y last month during Sloppi Jo's debut. I was happy to find out that it's close to work.

I went with a Pork Verde Combo Burrito for $4.95 and chose to have it smothered in sauce for an extra $1. The guy warned me that the Pork Verde is spicy, but I was good with that. For $3, you can add a Sopapilla and two sides. I wanted to try their Green Chile Stew and compare it to Sloppi Jo's, so I ordered the Sopapilla, the stew, and some rice.

When I got back to work, I first dug into the stew. The heat hit me right away. It was almost overwhelming, but I soon acclimated and the flavor came through. I think I give the slight edge to Jolene's Green Chile Chicken Stew, but I would certainly get Carlito's version again. The burrito was spicy, but I think the stew had already seasoned me to the heat by then. At $5, the burrito is huge and definitely value for money. I only ate half of it and am saving the other half for tomorrow. As for the Sopapilla, I was impressed at how soft and fluffy it was. It came plain and yet it was somehow still delicious and totally addicting. I dipped it in the burrito's sauce until I reached the very last tasty morsel.

I hate it when I have high expectations for a place and it doesn't shine. I always feel like my disappointment is due to my inflated anticipation. I'm extremely glad this isn't the case with Carlito's. I do declare that I have a new lunch destination in my regular rotation!

Update: I just ate the rest of the burrito and noticed a couple of honey packets in the bag. Oops. Those are probably for the Sopapilla. Oh well. It was delcious all by itself!
