I had quite a good vegan burrito here. The veggie burrito had a lot of flavor and the green chili was great with a good amount of spice. Ordering was a bit intense though. There were quite a few people behind me and I felt rushed and flustered. Apparently, I get order anxiety under pressure. 

I was impressed with the final product. It was big but not giant and getting it smothered with green chili was the way to go. The only thing that I wasn's a fan of was the plastic forks and disposable metal pans. It is hard to eat a big burrito with plastic cutlery and it also isn't very eco friendly. That won't stop me from eating there again next time I am in town.
