So I been thinking about a good Navajo Taco. I did not get that at Carlito's. I did get a great Chili verde and  Adovado chili. They are lacking in the execution of the fried bread.
It did not look like anything I have seen the Navajo's make. It was not fried to its beautiful crispness. It was like a pillow of soft dough. I wanted some texture contrast to the soft spicy compliment of chili. The service was good and the place was clean. The menu is small and sometimes thats a good thing. I am on the fence on if its worth a trip back.
I am more like a 2 1/2 stars. to the owners and chefs check out any You tube video of Navajo taco's and see if I am wrong about what you are selling.
