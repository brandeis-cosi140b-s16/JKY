Ordered the Navajo taco with carne adovada. Good. Not great. Fry bread could have been crispier and meat was room temperature. Also ordered the pork verde burrito combo smothered with green chili. Got the retried beans. This was excellent. Complex flavors. Spicy. And hot. Beans were so good I would consider just ordering them separately!  Or smothered in green chilis. We would definitely go back. It was small and crowded but it was fairly quick service!
