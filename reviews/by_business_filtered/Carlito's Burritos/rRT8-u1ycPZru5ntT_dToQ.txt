Best burritos in Henderson. They are huge and full of so many different unhealthy things that it'll give a nutritionist a heart attack. Always go for more than 2 meats and get it smothered. Smothered burrito is a wet burrito with red or green chili sauce. You can taste the spices in addition to the dry chili. 

On Sunday, they have a B1G1 free breakfast burritos and they have daily specials too. On Saturday, they sell rack of ribs with their own spices. They are also great.
