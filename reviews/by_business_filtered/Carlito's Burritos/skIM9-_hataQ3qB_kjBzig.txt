I've always been a big fan of New Mexican cuisine. So i was excited to see someone in Las Vegas is making food from there exclusively. This place rocks. the ambiance is cool. Southwestern art, Indian pictures, etc. very awesome vibe.

Very simply this place is New Mexico plopped down in Las Vegas. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Everything is authentic, hot, fresh, and a plate of awesome. The burritos are the size of a 6 month old baby and can fill you up for the whole day. The green sauce is made with real "Hatch" chile's. can't wait to try the Indian Taco's 

Like to give a shout out to the owners. Thank you for bringing N.M. to Las Vegas. Keep up with the great food!!
