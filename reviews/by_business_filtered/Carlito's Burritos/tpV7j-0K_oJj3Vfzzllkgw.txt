A little taste of home! In New Mexico there are burrito drive thru joints that have a very distinct home cooked NM flavor. I never thought I'd find that flavor in Las Vegas. I am beyond excited! 

I had no idea this place existed. I was reading The View and came across an ad/coupon, so we went on a Sunday morning. To our surprise, every Sunday is BOGO burrito day! I opted for the breakfast burrito with green chili (of course!) and ham; my boyfriend did the same with chorizo. So very delicious. Chorizo has a kick, so keep that in mind. Grabbed a to go menu and am beyond ecstatic that they have stuffed sopapillas!!!! Oh and freshly made margaritas is also on my next visit list! Cannot wait to return!

Sunday was busy but the staff (owners..?) were SO friendly and welcoming. We waited about 15-20 minutes for our to go order, but it was worth every minute.

What are you waiting for? Go check this place out!!!
