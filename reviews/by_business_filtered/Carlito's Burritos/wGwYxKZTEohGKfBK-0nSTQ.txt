Stomachs full and a smile on our faces!

We had dined here for lunch at an off time.  There were still a constant stream of people coming in during our entire stay.  The dining area is small.   I'm guessing during peak times you may want to order to go.  The line to place your order goes quickly.  There is a little wait for the food but nothing too major.  The employees are so great! They go out of their way to make sure you are satisfied with your meal.  

I had the shrimp combo burrito smothered.  The burrito was filled with shrimp, beans and rice covered with green chili sauce and cheese.  Really good.  When I cut the burrito in half, one whole side didn't have any shrimp.  Probably could have used more.  It was a large burrito so It filled me up anyway.  

Carlitos is certainly a place I'd like to visit again.  I'd recommend trying it out!
