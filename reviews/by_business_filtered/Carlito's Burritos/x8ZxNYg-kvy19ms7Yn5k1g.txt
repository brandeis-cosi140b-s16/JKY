This place was small, really small but busy. The line was almost out the door. You would think they did something right. I came here on the recommendation of my co-worker who swears that it's delicious. So where do I start, oh ya, the Micheladas (NOT GOOD). Watered down taste. I make better. The stuffed sopapillas were good, so my co-worker hit that on the dot but nothing to brag about and say that I want to go back. The locations is nowhere near the strip. The chicken tamale with chile verde wasn't all that great either. I've has some of the best tamales in Los Angeles. Bottom line, I wouldn't recommend this place but this is only my opinion. Lot's of older folks in here. The place had Indian Art Work on the walls which was really great. Maybe I should have ordered something else but I came here to order the sopapillas. NIce experience but I won't be coming back anytime soon.
