Carlito's is our favorite local place to hang out at. You can't beat the $2 beers and $3 margaritas! The food is authentic AND very yummy! My favorite is the nachos. On Mondays they have $1 sliders which are my second favorite.
Update: I just ordered and ate the soppapilla sunday. This is my new favorite thing!! It is AMAZING!!!!
