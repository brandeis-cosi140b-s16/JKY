Carlito's burritos is a def good reminder of all the good eats and memories of new Mexico I loved the food even though it was prepared a-little Different from what I'm use to I guess I just have to lower my standers a tad bit when it comes to eating new Mexico cuisine in las Vegas nv I mean nothing is ever like home. So anyways about the food it was great I liked it and so did the party of six I went with. Minus one * due too it being set up like a Roberto's taco show I was expecting more of a sit down type atmosphere with a waitress/waiter hmm well next time I will know what to expect good food and glad to see that there trying to bring the new Mexico style to the city of sin would I recommend it yes support the home town rock on enjoy good eats.
