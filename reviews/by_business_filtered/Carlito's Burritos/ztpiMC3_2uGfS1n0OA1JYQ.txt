This is a really great place. I never really tried food from New Mexico before I tried this place, but it's awesome. It's a small place with enough room for maybe 30 people or so. So I always hear the other people that are eating there saying that it reminds them of the food back home (New Mexico).
Everything there is fresh. The carlitos burrito smothered in green chili is delicious. I've had just about everything on the menu since I go there almost once a week for lunch, and everything has always been good. 
The people that work there are friendly and the place is nice and comfortable.
