I wanted to take my sister out for dinner last night to celebrate her upcoming 21st birthday prior to going to see Cirque Du Soliel. We both love Mexican food and Carlos O'Brien's is literally within walking distance from my house. We used to go all the time as kids, but it has been years since I have been there last. 

I'm glad we gave it a try because we had a really great experience. We were seated immediately even though it was 5:45pm. We had friendly, attentive service from both our busser and our server.

We were served delicious, warm tortilla chips shortly after sitting with a tasty, fresh, and chunky salsa. They also provided the liquefied hot sauce, but I did not eat it because I do not like that kind at any restaurant.

I decided on the veggie fajitas. The black beans are vegetarian, the refrieds are not. My sister selected the fajita quesedilla, sans meat.

Our food arrived quickly and piping hot. Both of us had huge portion sizes and the food was extremely fresh and really tasty. They put a salty and slightly spicy seasoning on their fajitas, which come with a mixture of peppers, onions, squash, zucchini and potatoes. 

Back in the day when I used to eat meat (15+ years ago) I always ordered the shredded beef chimi. It was amazing. I would assume that it retains the same amazing taste and size as when I favored it as a child, but who knows.

Our meal came to $21 and I gladly tipped our server over 20%! I will definitely be back when I have a cheat day on my diet!!
