This place is nothing special.  The food was good, but not great.  The service was fast and friendly, but again the food was nothing worth going back for.  I don't even remember what it is that I ate, so that in itself should tell you something about the place.  Or does that tell you something about me?  Yes, I am getting old, but I can remember when something is worth having again!
