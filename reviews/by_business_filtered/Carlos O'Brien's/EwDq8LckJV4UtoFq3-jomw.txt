This is an old Phoenix stand by and the portions are huge. I have been ordering the machaca chimi for at least 30 years, it's still wonderful.  The tacos are still the best in Phoenix because they are filled with so much meat, cheese, lettuce and tomatoes. 
My favorite menu item is still the chili conqueso. Don't fill up on chips without ordering some.
