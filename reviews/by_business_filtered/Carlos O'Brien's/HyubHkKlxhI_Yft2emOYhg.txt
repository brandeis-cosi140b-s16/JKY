Met some of my friends for lunch here the other day.  It's a nice feeling ambience inside.  Noticed that it was not very full.  I wondered a bit about that because when I drive by other times it looks like they are really busy (end of business day).  I did notice that the wait staff is not very attentive.  They're nice but even though it wasn't busy, it took a real long time for the server to attend to us.  The food was ok.  I'll give it another try, maybe an off day.
