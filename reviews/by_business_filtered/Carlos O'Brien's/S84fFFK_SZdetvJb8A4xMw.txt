Since we were in the area, we decided to try out this restaurant. My parents remembered it from their younger days and so we decided to try it out. The restaurant is very large. It is nice and the waiters were helpful. The food was decent. It didn't taste bad, but it wasn't quite the quality I was hoping for. 

As a vegetarian, I ordered the burrito grande and asked for vegetables instead of meat. I wasn't disappointed by what they substituted: onions, green peppers, and evens potatoes and carrots (that must have been the Irish side of the restaurant). 

TLDR: Nice facility, decent food, but I think I'll try a few more places before I come back.
