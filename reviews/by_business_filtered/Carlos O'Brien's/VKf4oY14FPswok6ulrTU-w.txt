My family ate here fairly late and we were all starving. Our waiter was friendly and never neglected to refill our drinks or ask us if there was anything else we needed. I am a vegetarian, and there were a lot of options for me. The vegetable fajitas were delicious - probably the best I've ever tried. My family said that the beef tacos and beef burrito were amazing as well. We had eaten here before, but not in a long time. Now, however, we'll be sure to keep this place on our restaurant radar!
