The chips and salsa were the best part of the meal.  The service was good, but the food lacked flavor and was quite bland.  My steak fajitas and the peppers and onions that came with them were not flavorful at all.  The re fried beans were overcooked and were simply bad.  The queso app was OK, but nothing special.  With all the choices in central Phoenix, I will be going elsewhere for my Mexican fix.
