Okay, the food is not the BEST mexican food in the world.  But sit in the bar area, it is real cozy with a nice authentic vibe.  Just good people having a good time.  No meat market here or anything.  Chips and salsa are good, but again, not the best.  Staff is awesome and they will really take care of you.  Ask for "Jose" - he will take care of you.  Tell him attorney steve sent you.  When he looks at you funny, just ask him for some hornitos!
