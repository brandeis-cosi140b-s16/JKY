this is a great mexican restaurant. i've been going to carlos obriens since 1985. the portions are large and oozing with cheese and sauce. i don't eat rice or beans and with the large enchiladas and tacos, you don't need them. you can easily fill up with just the enchiladas & tacos. everything has alot of cheese and sauce, covering the whole plate. the chimi's are huge. fantastic chips. they do have a nice bar with plasmas and you get free chips and salsa  whether you're there to dine or drink. the service has always been good. this is a large, good restaurant. they do have a happy hour in the bar. you can call ahead and order food and they give you plenty of sauces with your to go order.
