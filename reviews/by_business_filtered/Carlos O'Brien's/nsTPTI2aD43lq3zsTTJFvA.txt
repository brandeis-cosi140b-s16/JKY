Oh man.  Where do I start with this place?  I absolutely love it.

The only reason it doesn't have 5 stars is because it has a devastating effect on your waistline with frequent visits.  A look around at your fellow diners will confirm the fate that you too will suffer if you don't mend your gluttonous CO ways.  Eat in moderation - especially here.

Then again, that really shouldn't deter you from stopping in. Especially if it is your birthday - because this is THE PLACE FOR BIRTHDAYS!  Every single time, without fail, and more predictable than the US Mail - someone is celebrating their birthday.  When I would go often, it was understandable.  But now that I go much less frequently (for reasons stated above - yes I fell victim to it), it is amazing.  My 2x a year visit, and it happens to be someone's birthday.  I wish I had those odds with the lottery.  

They have some of the best chip's and salsa in town and great beers, both in the bottle and on tap.  And they just keep 'em coming....free of charge, like it should be.   My favorite sunday afternoon past time would be hanging at the bar, drinking XX Lager, and consuming mountains of chips.

The burritos are excellent to - although I tend to stick to the bean burrito with enchilada style (with red sauce) since it does well left over.  And trust me, leave some food on your plate.  Or suffer the consequences (see above).  Cheese Crisps, Nachos, Fajitas and tacos are pretty tasty.

Everything is smothered in cheese, beans, and rice and served on hot colorful plates...just like comfort mexican food should be.  I have never been disappointed with any visit to CO, well, except the time I found out they stopped serving the  choc-star-lite mints after dinner.  That was a real downer.
