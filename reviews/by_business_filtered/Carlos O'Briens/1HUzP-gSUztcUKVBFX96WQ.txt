We stopped in for happy hour on a Friday afternoon and were not disappointed. The place is popular and filled quickly. Many were regulars who were well known to the staff. We had excellent service from waitress and busboy both of whom were very attentive. I like the chips and had too many. The lunch menu was still available (until 5) and my wife had her usual: pollo fundido.  I had a beef flauta for something different. It was ok but I plan on a burrito next time. I had margaritas. I ordered them from the happy hour menu. I noticed that the lunch margarita is 50 cents less but the computer charged the higher price. It barely matters but it is a small aggravation. We will be back. Several places do fancier tex-mex but we enjoy this occasionally.
