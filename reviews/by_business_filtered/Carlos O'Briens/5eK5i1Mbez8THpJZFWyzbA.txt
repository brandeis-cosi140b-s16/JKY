Been eating at Carlos O'Briens for over 30 years before they moved to the 12th St and Northern Location. 

Was trilled to have the location on Bell Rd and Scottsdale Rd open close to the house. 

Their food is always great and never had a bad experience. Chips and salsa are awesome.  I always order the combo #9 with a green chili burro and 2 tacos. The cheese crisp,  tamales and Mexican pizza are always good. 

Good service and a separate area for take out are nice for this newer location.

Will always come back for the great food and service.
