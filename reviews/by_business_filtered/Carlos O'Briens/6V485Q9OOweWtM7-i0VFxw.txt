The service is quick and friendly but the food is not at good as I expected. I ordered a prickly pear margarita which it stated on the drink menu was made with "fresh fruit." I have only sent two drinks back in my life and this is one them. It was Too sweet, like drinking straight syrup. Even after letting it sit and waiting for the ice to water it down i still could not drink it. The food was not the best presentation either. Very marginal. I have never had random cabbage and steamed vegetables in my spanish rice before. Definitely not a place to go for a healthy meal. Though their shrimp was good.
