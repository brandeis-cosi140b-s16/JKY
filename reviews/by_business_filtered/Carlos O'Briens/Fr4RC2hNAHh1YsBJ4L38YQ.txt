My boyfriend & I came here for our Valentine's Day dinner. Good thing was that it was real quick seating, even being a typically very busy evening with the holiday. Our server came promptly & he was very friendly & courteous. Drinks followed almost immediately, food came pretty quick.

I ordered the Chile con Queso for an appetizer, & i gotta say this is my favorite item ever-BUT something just tasted funny. The cheese didn't taste right for some reason & I was so disappointed cause I was really anticipating it & I've never had a problem before. But it was just not right. 

My food came (cheese quesadilla) & again... Cheese tasted funny. I couldn't even finish my food, normally I scarf it down like no tomorrow & take the left overs but I know I wouldn't eat it & again... I know what the food is supposed to taste like, I'm not sure what the problem was but I am disappointed. 

I gave more stars because I have nothing to complain about as far as service. The people are very friendly, refills were a little slow, but he was always super nice & the prices aren't bad.

I've been going here since I was a little girl & my parents would take me here... I hope they read my review & figure out the problem. :(
