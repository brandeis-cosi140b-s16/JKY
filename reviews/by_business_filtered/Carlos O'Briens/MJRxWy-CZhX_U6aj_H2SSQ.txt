Returned for a second try.  Waitress was very very nice everything came out timely no big wait. However this time it wasn't as spicy it was The first time.  Must be different cooks.    One of the people I was with did not like it because he said it was not authentic and I guess he should know as he's Mexican. However I did not think it was bad I thought it was pretty good and so did the other person I was with.     So if you don't mind it not being an authentic authentic Mexican restaurant then I would give it a try because it really tasted pretty good
