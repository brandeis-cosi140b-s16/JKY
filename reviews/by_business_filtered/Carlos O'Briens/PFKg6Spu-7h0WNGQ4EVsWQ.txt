The food taste very good, 4 stars on the food for what you expect at a Mexican restaurant. My wife and I ordered margaritas that tasted more like frozen ice (traditional). I then switched it up and got a strawberry margarita. I actually did not know if it was a margarita or daquari. Very, very disappointed in the margs. If you are only coming for the food, it's worth trying. Not worth trying if your looking for a good margarita.
