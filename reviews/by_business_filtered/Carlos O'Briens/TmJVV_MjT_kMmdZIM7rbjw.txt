Who cares that it's not " authentic" Mexican. It's mexican-american, which is fine with me. I used to visit a lot and then stopped going. My partner's mother went about a month ago and bought back some leftovers only to remind me how good the food is here. Wow. Why did we stop going ?

Their "botanica" nacho creations are a 5 star production. I can't see how they can improve it. And it's huge. I would eat is a a meal. I love their chips and salsa. The service is first class, sodas coming before you even ask for a refill and their portions generous. 

I enjoy eating in their Northern Ave location as it is a great space, albeit dated from the late 1980's - which I love. There chimis are indecent and delicious-stuffed with my favorite machaca. They seem to stay crunchier than some other restaurants in which they start to get soggy after serving. In all I give them  4 1/2 stars if I could, but since my last 5 star review was filtered, I will retrain myself and give them 4. Ia m more than a fan.
