If give this place three stars but for the guacamole.    I love guacamole but not with jalapenos in it.   Almost everything I wanted jalapenos in it I know it's a Mexican restaurant but they didn't have to smother everything with it.   Chimichanga was good but that too had jalapenos and what gives.  I love Mexican food but this was so overly spiced I couldn't finish it.   I will go back though and give it a second try it could've been just a cook that was on that day
