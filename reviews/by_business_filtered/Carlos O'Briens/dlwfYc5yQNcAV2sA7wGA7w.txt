Went here last night as it was next door to our hotel. A local friend said it was very good so I wanted to try it. We were seated quickly & our waitress was very nice. The only thing that is taking this review from 4 stars to 3 stars is their lack of a drink menu. I was curious to see what types of quality tequilas they had available, or any speciality margaritas. Because of this I opted to just order a Patron margarita, which I unfortunately didn't know the price of (ended up being $8 and tasting very good so it all worked out). We then ordered some guacamole for our table as an appetizer. It was REALLY good, perfectly spicy, we were very pleased. Our entrees arrived in a timely manner as well, and of course piping hot (I always have to touch the plate when they say "hot plate, please don't touch". Am I alone in this?) :) I got the steak fajitas (good, not great), my friend got the Pollo Fundido (really, REALLY good... I would totally get this next time we went) and my husband had the cheese enchiladas which were also very good. The beans they serve alongside everything are the other thing that brings this review from a 4 to a 3. They're not terrible but the way they arrive to the table just looks gross. They must microwave them because there's a sort of  hard "shell" covering them. Once you mix them around though it's not too bad. The rice is however very good. If there would just make up some drink menus & take a little more care with the refried beans, Carlos O'Briens would be a hit & a must go to dinner spot everytime I'm here on vacation!
