I have gone here many times over the years due to its close proximity to my mom's house. It has always been mediocre... but alright. Today it was not so good. I called in to order a to go order at lunch time for my mom (who's sick) and myself. We had some specific instructions (hold the beans etc). So I get there and there were some seriously weird (possibly drunk) people in line in front of me. It took them about ten years (or minutes) to complete their order. So it's finally my turn, and I tell the lady that I have an order for Jennifer. She says... you do? what was on that order. So I tell her the basic components of the order (not including the details because I thought she was trying to locate the order). She then walked away and did not come back for fifteen minutes. She was tending the bar. When she came back I asked her what happened and she said that the person who was working up front took the order and couldn't leave so the order was never placed and therefore she had to re -place the order. Well.... that sucked because I did not know she was placing the order again and did not include that I didn't want beans and sour cream... kind of a big part of the order. So I get home and the burrito is just covered in beans and sour cream..... gross. I just wish there was some communication... why didn't she just tell me that they didn't place the order. I didn't even get a chance to ask her questions because she went over to bar tend. Well, my mom called and they credited her the money for the messed up order, which is the right thing to do and they get props for that.... but the quality is yet to be seen.
