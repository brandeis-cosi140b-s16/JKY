This place is pretty delicious. My husband and I both got the breakfast burrito that was yummy, but the potatoes are amazing! The food portions are pretty good too (even though the burritos look a little small they were actually super filling!) Only downside was the service seemed quite slow, but the staff seemed friendly. It's convenient considering all the other places we walked by had a huge line and this place didn't have a wait to get in. Not too shabby.
