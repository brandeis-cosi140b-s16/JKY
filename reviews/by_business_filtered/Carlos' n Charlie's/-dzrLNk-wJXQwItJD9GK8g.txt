I wish I can post a negative star.  This place is awful!  My husband ordered a Cadillac margarita which was over loaded with sweat and sour mix.  Our appetizer came out after our dinner arrived.  I took one bite of my chicken burrito and spit it out because the chicken was ice cold.  My husbands carne asada burrito looked like it had all the left over greasy meat inside.  Needless to say we called the manager over.  He seemed irritated that we were unhappy with our food, comped the dinners and margarita, but still charged us for the appetizer which we didn't even eat!  Don't waste your time or money at this place.  Go to Margaritaville instead!
