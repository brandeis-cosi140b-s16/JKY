This is my new fave spot in Vegas! They are located at the Flamingo and they offer happy hour daily-- two for drink specials on margaritas and beer.

I enjoy Mexican food so I am happy we can dine here. They just started serving breakfast and their omelets are so yummy!! They do open early and close late. And you have to try their ceviche and guacamole super good!!

Their patio is nice to relax, eat, drink and listen to music.
