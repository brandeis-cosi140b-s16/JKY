If I could give this restaurant negative stars I would.  Absolutely terrible experience.  We came here with a wedding party of 20 people.  It took over 20 min for our drinks to come out and they messed up on two of our food orders.  Then when it came to splitting up the check they would not split them.  We were told that it states on the menu that checks are not to be split (still not sure where that's stated).  We were never notified by the waitress that checks could not be split.  After speaking with the manager they still would still not split them.  This ment many members of the wedding party had to go to the ATM for cash.  I have never been so disappointed in a restaurant and the management.  Having worked in the restaurant industry I am appalled at this establishment!
