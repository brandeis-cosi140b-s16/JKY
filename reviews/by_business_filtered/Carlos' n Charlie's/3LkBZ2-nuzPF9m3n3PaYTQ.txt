Food was terrible, over salted, over priced, slow to deliver-- guess visitors to Las Vegas will eat here once-- I'm a local and will never return and will let other locals know to eat at Taco Bell-- it is better and realistically priced.  Chips thick, salsa from a jar, lettuce wilted--- nothing good to say...
