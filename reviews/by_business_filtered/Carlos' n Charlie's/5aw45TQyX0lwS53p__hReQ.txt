Carlos n Charlie's is not charming. They do not have good food. They do not have good prices. The service is the turd on the top of this poop sundae; they straight up refused to let us split checks (between two parties) and scoffed at the idea of subbing a cheese enchilada for a meat enchilada on a multiple enchilada platter.

The Cadillac Margarita comes in a plastic cup and is made from swill and imitation lime swill. The guacamole shouldn't have been able to be bad (since it was made in front of us) but the guy forgot salt and pepper and hence it was immensely bland.

Sidenote: one of our party members passed out at the table immediately after consuming the above mentioned guacamole. I am 92% sure it was because she hadn't eaten all day but I want to leave open the possibility this place is poisoning it's guests because it wouldn't surprise me.

If the Paramedics or the Flamingo Security who responded to the above medical incident were Carlos n Charlie's staff this review would have more stars because their customer service was dramatically better than the actual employees.

As an alternative I recommend everywhere else in the world. Literally you could just knock on doors offering people money to cook you mexican food and I am certain the first person to accept you in would be able to cook you a finer meal with whatever they had on hand (and would likely agree to a much lower price) than this lousy embarrassment of a "restaurant."
