Horrible service!!! Family and I decided to eat Mexican food and chose this establishment to have dinner at.  We wanted to see what was their dinner special and they frowned upon that right away.  They brought us warm tap water and semi cold beer. When they brought us our food they just set it on the table and left without saying if there is anything else we need which we did. They never checked up on us to see if we needed another drink. The food seemed like it was canned food. I specifically asked for no onions and it seems like I said add all the onions u have in the back. No one person that I went with enjoyed the experience let alone the food. This is one establishment we will never go to again!!!
