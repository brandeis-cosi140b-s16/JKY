Do not eat here!  The first nickel and dime restaurant I have ever visited.

Way overpriced, average price is $16 per plate and you get very little.  Food is over cooked, hard, stale chips.  Server got my wifes order wrong twice.  The iced tea and iced water is from the tap (not purified).  

I finally told the server we had to leave and needed the check.  $40 for a beer, fish tacos, iced tea, chips and salsa that all tasted bad!
