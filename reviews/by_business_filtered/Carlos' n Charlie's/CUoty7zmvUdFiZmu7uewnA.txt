Horrible.. please do yourself a favor and eat your poker chips before you dare to eat their tortilla chips. Just plain bad. I understand Americanized Mexican food, but this doesn't even cut that low grade. Bland, boring .. served less than hot. And far too expensive for what it is. The queso dip was cold - no flavor. We tried to dress it up by adding the salsa, but the salsa just made it colder (it lumped) and more blah.!! The quesadilla was supposed to have carne asada , chorizo and chicken...well, you fooled me. Just stay away. How can you make tasteless chorizo - seriously.  Only saving grace, the waiter (poor guy) was actually a good guy.
