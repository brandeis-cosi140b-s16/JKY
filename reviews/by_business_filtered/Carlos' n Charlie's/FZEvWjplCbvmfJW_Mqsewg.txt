First let me say that I am not a picky eater but yuck, yuck, yuck, yuck.  I paid $17 for fish tacos that were nothing more than a fish stick fried for WAY too long topped with some orange ranch type sauce on flour tortillas, oh the humanity!  I didn't even get any mediocre rice or beans with my entree.  Chips and salsa were $6! Who pays for chips and salsa at a Mexican place? Overpriced is an understatement.  

The servers tried to do a dance.  It was waaaaay too long and repetitive, I wanted to scream out "Please stop, can't you see they aren't having fun? Put them out of their misery!" 

The only cool thing was the bartenders.  They were very talented.  I am uber clumsy so when I see people throwing things and catching them too, my mind pretty much gets blown. Doesn't take much, I guess.  Those poor men should find another place of employment however, because unless Carlos and Charlie's changes the foods quality, I don't see them lasting as a Vegas establishment. Eat ANYWHERE but here.
