Do not get the BBQ ribs. Lousy at best. Even the corn on the cob sucked, and the fries were stale. The "bartenders" were nothing but kids goofing off juggling cups and bottles. Didn't even have Bohemia beer and charged me $35 for a shot of 1842. Oh yeah, and $5 for a bag of chips and salsa. What a joke...
