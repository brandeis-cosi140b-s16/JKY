I dont know why the bad reviews, when we went here the staff was awesome not to mention the atmosphere. This was a Friday night and things were quite fun. They have inside and outside seating but the drinks can only be consumed when buying the $20 unlimited wrist band inside which is fine because thats where the DJ was anyway. The food was great no complaints at all!! I look forward to going back!
