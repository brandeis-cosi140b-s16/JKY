The staff is great but the food is mediocre save for the ceviche. I'll talk about that in a second. So. I order a margarita on the rocks. This is a Mexican restaurant. On the STRIP. Yeah, it comes out looking like Mt. Dew and tasting like sadness. They also have margarita slurpee machines and I'd probably have been better off going that way. 

The food was your generic churned out Mexican. Think... well, the "Mexican" dishes at places like Chili's. 

They get two stars because the ceviche was fantastic. I couldn't believe it came from the same place! As someone who has made ceviche at a fine dining restaurant, I know my ceviche, and it was spectacular. Lots of avocado, which is great. Even my husband, who isn't really a foodie, commented that the ceviche looked strikingly different from all the other dishes.

Bottom line: order the ceviche and stick with Dos Equis.
