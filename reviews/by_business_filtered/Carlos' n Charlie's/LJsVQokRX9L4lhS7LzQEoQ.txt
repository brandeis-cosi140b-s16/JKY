3 stars for the food, it was good enough.  1 star for the underhanded pricing schemes and crappy overpriced margarita's.  Beware everything is an extra charge: cheese, guacamole, chips and salsa.  They will not inform you of these extra charges up front but they will offer them to you as if they are free.   The surprise comes when you get the bill. 

I think they are trying to be another Senior Frogs with loud music and servers who break out into line dances occasionally.  Avoid this place, it's lame.
