I haven't heard good things about the food, but since I didn't try it I wouldn't know.  The service was ridiculous though.  And I didn't like the drinks much better.  We stayed in the Flamingo for a week and we were on a trip with lots of co-workers so I ended up having more than one experience here even though under normal circumstances I wouldn't have been back after the first time.  We stopped by at the end of our first night in LV to grab one more drink with a friend before heading to our room and decided on frozen margaritas. ( Let me start with 3 important facts: 1) I LOVE margaritas. 2) I enjoy sour things so much that I will happily peel a whole lemon or grapefruit like its and orange and eat it with no sugar. 3) We had quite a bit to drink at this point and weren't in any state to be picky.)  The margaritas were so mouth-twistingly bitter and sour that none of the three of us could get one down.  The next time I came they had some sort of all yo can drink thing going on.  Problem was, no one that worked there knew the rules.  We were originally sold a line about how you can come and go as much as you want and bring your drinks.  But every time they fought us about it making up rules about needing to get a new cup and then rules about having to have the same cup.  On top of all that, the latin techno that was playing was so loud that we were all sitting around the table texting eachother because you couldn't hear the person right next to you even when they screamed at the top of their lungs.   Beware of this place because they wander through the casino trying to sell you on $20 all you can drink tickets.
