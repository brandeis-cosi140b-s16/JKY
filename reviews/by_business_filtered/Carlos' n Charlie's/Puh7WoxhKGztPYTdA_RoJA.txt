This place is the worst hands down. Don't bother just don't. The "Mexican grill" doesn't get anymore white washed.. And this is coming from a white girl! The margaritas are shit and so is the food.. Just keep walking. Not worth your money. It lives up to it's star and half. Let me put it this way.. I wouldn't feed this food to my dog.
