Went right after work to get some drinks.  We ordered 3 beers and some food.  The food took about 20 minutes for a sandwich and they were not busy.  A couple rounds later we were wondering where our server was because he hadn't been to our table for about 30 or more minutes.  He FINALLY came by ad said his shift was ending.  She since we work in service industry we offered to close out with him and ordered another round from the new server.  We never saw our 1st server again.  We waited 20 minutes and asked where our beers were.  He said I will be right back with them...what kind of beers are you drinking again(we had a few empty bottles of the same beer on the table already).  Ordered the same beer again and waited for another 30 minutes.  Finally once we got our beers we closed out.  $95 tab..which is expected for the strip but with THAT service it should have been comped.  We then went to the bar which was a great experience.  So if you want to get decent service go to the bar......but needless to say I don't want to go back.
