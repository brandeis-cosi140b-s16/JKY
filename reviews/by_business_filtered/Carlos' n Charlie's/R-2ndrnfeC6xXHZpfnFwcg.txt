I decided to try this place for dinner since I was staying in the hotel was tired and didn't feel like venturing out.
I had the chimichanga figuring that was a pretty safe bet but it wasn't very good it was actually pretty gross.
The Vegas sunset drink wasn't very good either.
And Love Mexican food. This is probably more tex mex and still falls a little short

The frozen two for one margaritas are pretty good if you get the right bartender.
Other than maybe a Margarita outside at the bar I probably won't return to this place
