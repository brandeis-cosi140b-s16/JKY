Don't get me wrong..I love the Flamingo..but this place is the absolute WORST! I'm pretty sure they use canned dog food for anything chicken related and not even the expensive brand...haha ohh god this place was just horrid! And we even gave it a few chances and it was always an awful experience! They should be embarrassed of their chips/salsa/guacamole...the salsa was definitely poured straight from a jar of salsa they bought at Walmart, and the "table side guacamole"?!..might as well just bring your own avocado to chomp on and save yourself $10...another standard Mexican side dish you wouldn't think anyone could mess up..rice and beans! My beans looked like the poop emoji on the iPhone and the rice was a real crapshoot..my fianc√©'s rice randomly had green peas in it? So that was interesting....
And then the service..our waitress had no idea what any drink or lunch specials were...we had to convince her that there even were lunch specials by walking to the front of the restaurant and taking a picture of the display that listed them. The ONLY reason they got one star is because they did at least offer drink and food specials throughout the day (and because yelp makes you give at least one star..haha). But overall, for how much traffic this place gets they really need to step their game up.
