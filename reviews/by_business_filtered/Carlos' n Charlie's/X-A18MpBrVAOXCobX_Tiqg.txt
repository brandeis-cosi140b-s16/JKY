Probably one of the worst restaurants I've ever been to.

Food = No.  

We threw the red flag on our meal as soon as they told us they charge for chips and salsa.... we ordered the cheese dip and chips and the cheese dip was worse than something out of a carnival vending machine.  The service was a joke and after ordering drinks (beers) for 5 people and chips/cheese dip, our total was $65 and we left.

This is not a Mexican restaurant and it's one of the worst restaurants in Vegas in my opinion.  Listen to the other reviews on here and don't bother.
