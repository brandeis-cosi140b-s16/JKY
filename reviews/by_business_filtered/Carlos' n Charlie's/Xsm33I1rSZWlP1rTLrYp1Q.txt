I just got back from Vegas today and a bunch of us went there last night and had a nasty dinner!! Took 15 minutes for us to get our drinks then another 8 to order food!!  Pretty pricy for food especially food That was so bland!!We ordered chips and salsa that we never got and tortilla soup that we never got and I had 2 small short hairs in my steak and chicken tacos(they were gross, no flavor) and they came and took it away promptly, told me I wouldn't be charged for it( of course) and bought me a beer! My friends all ate their food because they were drunk but they all hated it too! I will never go there again and I hope I can save others from having the same experience as us!!!
