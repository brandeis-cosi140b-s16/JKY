The food was seriously gross AND way overpriced. I am a pretty shitty cook, and I honest to god could have made better tacos. Plus, as we all know, a day of drinking can make somewhat questionable fare (Del Taco) taste like ambrosia of the gods - and yet, 10 beers deep, the food still tasted disgusting. Cold meat/no salsa on the tacos, wilted lettuce & canned corn on the salad, and to top it off a $60 check?? I think not, sir. Spend your money on "manbuckets" of Coors Light at the flamingo pool ($48 for 12 beers, hayyyy).
