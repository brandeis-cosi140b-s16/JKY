Came here with a nostalgiac mindset. I've spent quite a bit of time in CNC's while working in the Caribbean. While this does not compare, it's still a good time. It reminds me of a Mexican themed SaddleRanch. Worth a visit.

Had an order of guac, and cheese dip. Both were pretty good. Also had margeritas at happy hour. If not for the HH pricing, it would have seemed to pricey for what you're getting. But there's definitely a quality for having outdoor space to hang out at during the evening.
