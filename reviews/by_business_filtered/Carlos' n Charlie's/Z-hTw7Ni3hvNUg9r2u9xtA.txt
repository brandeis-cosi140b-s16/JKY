Not bad for me! Visited during Happy Hour (it was a Thursday afternoon around 4 pm) to take advantage of the 2 for 1 margaritas. Ordered 4 margaritas (3 passion fruit and one regular- server said passion fruit was the best) for our group of 5, as well as chips/ salsa and the banana chimichangas (recommended by our server). That's right, no free chips 'n' salsa here folks. I didn't eat the salsa but the banana chimichangas were awesome, and the portion size was definitely large enough to share. Margarita was good- I agree the passion fruit one's the thing, and with the buy one get one it's a good deal!

Atmosphere... kinda TGI Fridays I guess? Makes more sense when you know they are owned by the same company as Senor Frog's. We really liked our server... a youngish woman that wore a flower in her hair... don't remember her name.
