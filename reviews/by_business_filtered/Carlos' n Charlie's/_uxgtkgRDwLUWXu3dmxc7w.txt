We ate here twice. The food was fine, chain restaurant on the strip food. Wasn't amazing or unique but it tasted fine. They have decent drink specials and average drinks. The staff there is what makes the place great. The waitresses were really fun and friendly, kept bringing us stuff even though we were sitting in the self service section. The bar managers Coco and Ian are really amazing. They were funny and nice and really talkative during the day. We went to a "party" there on our last night. The party was crap, they "promoters" who got us to go mislead us and the promotion staff there was beyond rude. A man from the promotions company yelled and cussed in my face, so close he was repeatedly spitting on me. He wouldn't tell me his name or who he worked for. The hotel did nothing. Ian and Coco stepped in and took really good care of us after that incident. I won't stay at the Flamingo again but I may stop by that restaurant again if I'm ever in Vegas just to see if they are still tending the bar.
