We were craving Mexican and wanted somewhere fun and casual for our last night in Vegas. FOUND IT. We were seated outside and it was really nice. Our server (I think Rocky - her name was smudged) was very attentive and helpful to our table. The HH specials were great for our group of 4. We got two Marg's for $10...and the boys got deals on their beers, but I don't exactly remember what it was. We ordered the chips & salsa & altho they weren't bottomless, there was plenty for the 4 of us. 

I ordered the chicken quesadilla off the App menu & it was a perfect little meal. My brother asked for their HOTTEST sauce/salsa. It came out & holy smokes it was hot! I spread a tiny dot on my quesadillas.  (OH the Gauc was REALLY good!)

The prices all seemed really reasonable & Yelp has all sorts of deals when you check in. We will be back on our next Vegas trip!
