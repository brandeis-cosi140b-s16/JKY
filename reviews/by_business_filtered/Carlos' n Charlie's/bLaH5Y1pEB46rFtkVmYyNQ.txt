I was so upset with this restaurant. I came here with my sisters for a later dinner and there were maybe 2 other tables with people seated and a few people at the bar. When we walked in, we asked if they were still serving dinner and we were told yes. We sat down any where we wanted and it took 10 min just to receive a menu.

After looking at the menu, everything was over priced. We decided to stay to grab something simple, and there were two servers standing in front of our table arguing that neither of them wanted to take our table. WHAT!? We could literally hear them, and instead of one of them deciding to help us, they both just walked away and we were never helped!! 

We got up and left immediately. I couldn't believe the service at this place. Glad we didn't spend any money there because they do not deserve it!
