Went there last night before going to a show. We didnt get complimentary salsa and chips like most mexican restaurants. But that wasn't the issue. The prices are high for what you get. Ordered a burrito and it came with dried out refried beans. No lettuce or salsa even.  The burrito was terrible. The rest of the party had tacos and fajitas. No one was crazy about the food. I dont know what was worse - the food or the service. When we were done with the meal the server brought the check without saying anything. Just plopped it down. What if I wanted dessert or coffee? We couldnt wait to get out of there. Seriously, something needs to be done. We will not return.
