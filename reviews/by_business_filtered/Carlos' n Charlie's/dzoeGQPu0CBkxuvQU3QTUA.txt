Had a Really fun time there! It was to me a BETTER version of Joe's Crab Shack but with Delicious Mexican food. Lots of fun, interaction with the staff there was great, a whole lot of dancing around, and the food was GREAT! Im shocked to why i lived in vegas my whole life and never been to this place....will be goin back for a fact!!!!
