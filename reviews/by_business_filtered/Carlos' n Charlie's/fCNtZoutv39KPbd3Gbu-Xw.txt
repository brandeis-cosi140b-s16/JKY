I absolute love this place!!!! So much fun! Order the fish ceviche!!! The servers there are all so fun! Bring your casual clothes. They have outdoor seating with bartenders and squirt guns along with the best manager ever jordy!  There's dancing and probably the best restaurant party environment I've ever been to. I really enjoyed every minute here. Ask for the barber chair, but be prepared to take not only a shot, but if you can handle it they will pour the entire bottle in your mouth and spin you on the chair. All and all the best place ever! I would go back just for the fun atmospheric environment these guys provide!!! Highly recommended for children too. They make cater to kids with balloon animals along with the entertainment of dancing the conga line or the shuffle. It truly is a blast! A must when visiting Vegas l. The prices of the food is reasonable. Not expensive at all!

Don't forget to ask for the barber chair (21+) only!!!
