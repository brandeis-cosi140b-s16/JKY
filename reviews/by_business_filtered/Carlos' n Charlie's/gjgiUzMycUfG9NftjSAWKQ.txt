Not sure why all the one-star reviews here, unless things magically improved by the time I ate here.

First off, this isn't the best Tex-Mex place in the world, but folks: 1) this is a CHAIN, and 2) this is the Vegas strip... If you go to a Vegas strip chain restaurant and expect a freakin' gourmet meal, you're, frankly, pretty dumb.

But for what it is, Carlos'n'Charlie's does the job. My wife had the tortilla soup and chicken and steak fajita, and she was very happy with both. My chicken and cheese burrito was quite good, and kudos to those involved for respecting my allergy to onions.

Bummer that the nachos are extra, but again, this is the Vegas strip; I expect to be screwed here. But I was surprised that the prices are as low as they are. Only problems I had are that the mojito has no sweetness to it, and there were some cretins completely disregarding the multiple "no smoking" signs.

Seriously, give these folks a chance. I did. No regrets at all, except that I didn't order the tortilla soup!
