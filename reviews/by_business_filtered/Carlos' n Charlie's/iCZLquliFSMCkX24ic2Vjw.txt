We stayed at the Flamingo labor day weekend so it was a no brainer to eat here.

For all the people giving it one and two stars, i am assuming they were expecting way too much out of this place. It's basically a restaurant that specialized in bar food. Mostly Mexican dishes but there are other options. Realistically you're in Vegas, do you want to spend hours in a restaurant? No! You want to get your food quick so you can get back out and enjoy the strip! 

We were seated inside but we actually ended up moving outside after we ate. The outside patio is definitely a party atmosphere, where as the inside is a little more reserved.  Our server was very nice and recommenced items to us when we asked what the budget options were! 

The prices were all reasonable and the food was good. We will definitely go back here on our trip next year.
