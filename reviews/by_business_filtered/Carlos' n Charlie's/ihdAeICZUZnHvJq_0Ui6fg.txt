Arrived just before 6pm on a Wednesday during our stay at the Flamingo, just in time to take advantage of the 2 for 1 margaritas. Food was good and came out fast. I wouldn't call it authentic but was good. Margaritas were kind of typical and a little too sweet.  Was good food and I may go back of I had a good coupon otherwise probably not.
