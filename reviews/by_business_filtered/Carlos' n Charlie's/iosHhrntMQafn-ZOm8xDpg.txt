After laying poolside for a few hours and out a couple of 'Jacksons', the wife and I decided to stop by here for their 2 for 1 Margaritas.  Figuring the margaritas have to be decent since they were blended, we sat down and ordered a round of strawberry margaritas.

We are thinking...cool...2 margaritas, $12 (with tip), sitting outside on a patio overlooking the Flamingo grounds...not bad right?  Wrong!

Let me tell you.  I tended bar p/t when I lived in Chicago (downtown not suburbia) so I know how to make a lot of drinks...well...including garnish (which don't get me going on most bartenders in today's bars that don't know a garnish from their a$$hole) and make them quickly.

The bartender was friendly.  Got us our drinks quickly, then dropped the bill and left.  First thing I notice...no lime....uhh..it's a margarita...anyone knows margaritas get limes.  So I wait for the bartender...for like 2 minutes.  Finally I stand up, walk over to the bar and reach over and grab 2 lime wedges from the garnish rack.

Place one lime in each of our drinks.  Cheers to a nice holiday...proceed to drink.  I downed a good sip thinking it would be good.  It wasn't...the most sour, bitter drink.  But not wanting to 1) make a scene and 2) get all worked up because we were on holiday afterall, we decide to leave and take our drinks with us thinking we would finish them given the heat and all.

Well...a couple of hotels later (as we walk along the strip) - we end up throwing them away.  What a sin...in sin-city.

The food looked decent and the prices fair - which is the only reason I am not giving the place a 1-star.  

So in all honesty...probably closer to 1 1/2 stars.  Avoid the margaritas at all cost.  The Nachos looked good.
