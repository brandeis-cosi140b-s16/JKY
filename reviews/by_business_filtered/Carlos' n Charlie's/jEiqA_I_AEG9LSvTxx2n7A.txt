I was scuuuuuured to buy the $30 for $15 because of the reviews but I did it anyway. Why not, it's Vegas!! 

Got here around 4 on a Wednesday. Sat on the patio. Really nice atmosphere outside. Breezy and cool, yes even for Vegas. Our server came right away, we showed him our coupon and he told us our options. He allowed us to have 2 separate checks so we could get happy hour prices and also use the groupon for food. Cool beans. 

We got the sampler for $31. There were 2 of us. Girls. Couldn't come close to finishing it. It wasn't great but it wasn't horrible either. Just your average Vegas Mexican food I suppose. 

We each had 2 beers and were on our way! No complaints here! I'd go back but maybe just for drinks. If you go to eat, look for a coupon. Have fun!
