I don't know why everyone else had a bad time here, my party of 4 thoroughly enjoyed our time! Delicious food, wonderful attentive server (Amy), great atmosphere. The only thing we didn't like was the woman coming around trying to get us to dance and get rowdy, when all we wanted to do was eat and enjoy ourselves. I would love to come back.
