I spent a couple of days at Flamingo's on the Strip and since Carlos an Charlie's is hard not to notice in the hotel, I went there several times for a drink and a snack. This is not the kind of place you go to for a serious meal, it's a bar with food for god's sake. The gin and tonics were great and there is no way to mess up a beer - bottle or draft. The service was good and the guacamole an chips were just that, but it was a nice touch to have the waiter whip up the guacamole at the table. The place is noisy with numerous TVs conveniently placed throughout the place, but hey it's a bar not a place you go to for a romantic dinner or a first class meal. It is what it is and this is what I liked about this place. Let me add that I have been to other locations of this chain both in the US and Mexico and they are all very similar - decent bar food, a bit pricy, and a good place to park your bod for a few minutes or hours to people watch.
