Had dinner here with 15 other people. I ordered the fajita salad and half way through I found a metal bracket in my salad. I have never experienced this before in my life. As I pulled the metal piece out of my salad and held it up my friends were just as amazed as I was. The manager Pattied immediatly came ouver and apologized. She comped my meal and a few drinks. Now thta I think about it hey should have given us a huge discount for that mishap. We I wont be going back there anytime soon. Was my firs and last time.
