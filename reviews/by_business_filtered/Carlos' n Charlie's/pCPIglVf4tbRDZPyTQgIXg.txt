Myself, wife and 2 friends arrived at the Flamingo and checked in at 8.00pm and decided to eat at Carlos and Charlies, as it was convenient and we did not want to travel far - What a mistake........! The restaurant was not busy and the service was still terrible, to start they managed to screw up a simple drinks order, even the beers were wrong ! The waiter then returned with the correct drinks and the beers were only filled up to where we had taken a drink from.....They could not even fill them up and at $17.50 for each beer, I think they are the most expensive on the strip !
Food was trerrible and a poor excuse for Mexican. We originally lived in Austin and this is nothing like Carlos and Charlies at Lake Travis, or they would have been out of business long ago !

Very expensive, poor food and no atmosphere - do yourself a favor and steer clear. There is much better available (almost all is better than this !).
