I don't think I've had such a awful experience at any restaurant  in my life. Mind you this happened on my birthday. I go to order some wings to go and while I wait I decide to grab a drink. Well at the end of my drink I notice in the corner of my eye something brown in my drink and to my surprise I find a dead roach in my drink. It was the most disgusting feeling I've ever felt. I wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy. I'm to the point I don't even wanna eat at any restaurant  again. Such a awful experience be aware of this place
