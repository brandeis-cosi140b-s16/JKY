HORRIBLE SERVICE! If I really got into what happened here I would be writing for hours, pretty much they were understaffed so the manager brought free chips and salsa to everyone, I asked for no onions on my tacos, it took 30 min to get new tacos, might I mention I got the wrong tacos when they brought them. My friends food was cold, oh and they comped my food cause they felt bad.... It was ridiculous  never going back
