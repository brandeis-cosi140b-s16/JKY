I don't think I've ever seen so many bad reviews! I can't say I disagree, but our experience was a little better then 1 Star.

My girlfriend and I stopped in here late on our first night in Vegas. We started with Margarita's and an order of Guacamole. The Margarita's were OK, but the Guacamole was the best thing we had all night. It was made fresh to order right in front of us.
Our entree's were below average, even for a chain Mexican place. According to the menu, my Cheese Burrito was supposed to be filled with Cheddar and Jack Cheese with veggies. What it was was a Tortilla filled with onions and green pepper's with barely any cheese in it at all.  My girlfriend ordered the Chicken Enchiladas in Red Salsa. She summed up the Meh of this place perfectly after tasting my Burrito. She said that both our dishes tasted like they came out of the same pot.  Pretty sad when you consider how different our entree's should have been.  

Our service was OK, but confusing. Our Server's seemed to switch about one third of the way through our meal and then the first Server reappeared when our check came out. They are wheelchair accessible, but I can't see ever coming back here unless it's to sit at the bar, have a couple drinks and order some Guacamole.
