Bad service.
Salty guacamole.
Salty shrimp.
Dry chicken.

Had to wait and wait for our drink order to be taken and then to receive them. 

Bar staff outside seemed to be having more fun than doing any actual work. 

Simply shameful. I've been to the Carlos n Charlie's in LA MANY times and never had service this bad!!
