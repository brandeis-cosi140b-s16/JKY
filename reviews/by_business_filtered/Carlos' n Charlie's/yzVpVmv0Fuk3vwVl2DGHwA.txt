Not a fan of this place. We stayed at Flamingo and passed by this restaurant aka bar everyday. One night, we were approached by a promoter to check this place out for open bar $20. We had a long and tiring day and decided to have a drink there instead o walking out in the hot weather to other places. Well, when we were at the bar, it looks like they are understaffed and it takes forever for us to get our drinks. Music is too loud and I don't enjoy myself at all. After 15mins, decided to leave after one drink. Can't wait to get out!
