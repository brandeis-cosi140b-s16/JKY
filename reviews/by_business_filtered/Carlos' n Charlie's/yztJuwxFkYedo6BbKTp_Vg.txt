If there was a option to give this place a negative star I would. Myself and girlfriend stopped by to grab a late night snack before hitting the strip it was around 10 PM so for Vegas standards still pretty early. The restaurant was already in full club mode with the music cranked but no customers, we were first seated at a booth but the music was so loud we couldn't hear each other so we asked to be seated out on the patio. The waiter said the host would be right with us but that never happened so we headed to the patio since there were other patrons and staff out there just to be stopped by security who told us we weren't allowed to sit outside at this point we dropped the menus on a table and headed out. Just hard to believe they would turn down two paying customers just to make the dining room look busy. The food that people had on the tables looked pretty good.
