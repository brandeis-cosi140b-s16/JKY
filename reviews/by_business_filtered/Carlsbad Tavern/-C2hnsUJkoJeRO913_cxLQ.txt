So I should have known this place was bad when I pulled up and there was no parking available but they had a valet service that conveniently had reserved spots. So after being FORCED to valet park my wife and I went inside and were promptly seated(kind of strange since there were no free parking spots). I ordered an green chilly cheese crisp for us to share and my entree was a green chilly pork burro. The cheese crisp was flavorless and unappetizing. The burro tasted like it had ben PRE-MADE and over cooked in the microwave upon order. The pork was dry and flavorless. I would not recommend this place to anyone because it's NASTY and does not do Arizona Mexican cuisine any justice at all.*****AVOID at ALL COSTS*****
