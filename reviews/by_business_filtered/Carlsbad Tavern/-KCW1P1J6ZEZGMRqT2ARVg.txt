This place has awesome margaritas on the rocks.  It's not the fanciest place around, considering Scottsdale and all of it's pretentiousness is right down the way.  But it is a great place to relax and grab a nice meal and drink, especially by the waterfall late at night.  They have a pretty good late night menu too that I used to always order off of when I got off of work.  I love their carne adoba (?) plate!  They also have really good appetizers.  Cute place to drop by when you're in the area and just want to kick back.
