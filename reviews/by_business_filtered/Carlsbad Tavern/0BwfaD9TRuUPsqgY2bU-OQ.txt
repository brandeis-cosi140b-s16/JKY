Went here with some friends and was not impressed. This is definitely a place with a nice atmosphere and is probably better for drinks only. Had nacho appetizer and chips and salsa. Chicken was dry and nachos had no flavor. Salsa was not spicy and very watered down. Chips were good and hot however. The food itself was OVERPRICED and just okay. Won't be back. It may be called Carlsbad tavern because its BAD. Also there is a rock for decoration inside the restaurant that says "beware". It should be on the outside warning people not to go in. Also their parking situation is crazy. I had to park down 2 blocks. Also I should mention it took 20 minutes for someone to come over to the table to take our drink order.

P.S.

If you wanted chicken wings, which my friend really did, you cannot get them any time. Its only for the late night menu. how hard is it to make chicken wings?? Why only LATE night?
