Pretty good!  We came during off hours so our waiter was super attentive and friendly.  We liked the food a lot - the lobster enchiladas were phenomenal.  My only complaint is that if you have kids that actually like Mexican food but can't handle spicy/hot food, there's not much on the menu for them.  They did have a children's menu but it was mostly cheeseburger items.
