Went for dinner thurs 8/17. Casual place, attentive service and the food I felt was a good value. 

While the individual plate price might seem high, its not when you consider the quality of the food which I felt was above par and on target for value. 

I had the enchanted platter, corny name but serious food. fatguy two adipose thumbs up. 

Wife had the pork loing with a really incredible jalapeno risotto.

I say go and enjoy this place!
