LOVE THIS PLACE! 

I have been going here for years, and absolutely adore this restaurant.  The place is dimly lit (even during the day) and boasts a huge patio. The bar has a bunch of kitschy crap all over the wall that is fun to look at. 

Without going into a huge story about all the times I've been here, I'll just list all the food I love:
 Portales Portobello, Sweet Mash, Boneless Chicken Wings (late night menu only), Cheese Crisp, seasoned fries, Spinach Salad, Spicy Crab Cakes, Green Chile Burger, Habenero Burger (it is good, freakin spicy, and comes with a glass of milk), Tortilla Soup, Green Chile Stew, Chile Rellenos, Carne Adovada Plate, Green Chile Mac and Cheese (late night menu), Key Lime Pie, and Basket of Sopas. 

I bet I am forgetting some things, but basically, all I am trying to say is that this place is the bomb diggity. 

OH! They also have a really great Sunday brunch with cheap breakfast, bloodies and mimosas.
