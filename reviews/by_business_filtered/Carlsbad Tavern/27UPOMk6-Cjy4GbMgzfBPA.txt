Sunday afternoon Happy Hour! The margaritas and mules were very well done. The prickly pear was so tasty and not "touristy" sweet. They use good tequila to make their margs. The blood orange was a bit sweet but still good. The Cabo margs were our faves. We tried the Cherry mule and the Jalisco, which had a good spice flavor. The hatch chile sauce was not very spicy today but still had good flavor. The Carlsbad Brochettes were cooked perfectly and the cheese crisp was good. I am a spicehead, so I wanted a bit more heat but everyone else loved it. We didn't try the regular menu items today, but I will update when we return. The real reason I am taking the time to write this review is for the service we received. Lottie was FANTASTIC.  As you know from reading my reviews, I fully believe good service makes the food and drinks taste better. It's becoming a rare experience. Lottie had great suggestions, knew when a drink was low or empty, and had a fun and energetic personality. I will ask for her when we return for sure. Good experience! The bat cave looks fun...but if I see a bat, I'm done.
