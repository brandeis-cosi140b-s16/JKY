A friend of mine took me out here for a belated birthday dinner. I have always wanted to try this place so it was a welcome surprise. We were seated on the patio since it was a nice evening however me being the wimp that I am, I had them turn on the heater because it was a little cooler than I thought ( plus it didn't help that I had a a very thin top but that is another story lol)

We ordered Mai Tai's for our drinks and let me tell you those suckers were strong. Luckily for me I was not driving and my dinner companion sipped his sparingly. We had the Mexican Potstickers as an appetizer however although they were good, they were quite salty.  I ordered the Crab Stuffed Poblanos as my main course and my friend ordered Chorizo Stuffed pork chop. Baby, my Poblanos were stuffed with so much crab!! OMG it was soo good. They were huge as well So big that I even after sharing I ended up taking one whole one and a half one home with me. My friend's stuffed pork chop was delicious and the red chile cheddar mash potatoes had just the right kick. He too ended up taking half his meal home because the portion was so good. Oh and if you think I am complaining, believe me I am NOT by any means. I also ordered a pina colada later on (as again I was not driving) and that too was just as strong. They do not skimp on the alcohol and I was very happy about that.  Nothing like spending $9 on a drink and you can't taste any alcohol.

Now although were were stuffed to the gills, we also ordered a piece of key lime pie to share. Delicious to say the least. With the exception of the ultra salty mexican pot stickers, the serve, the food, and most importantly the company was fantastic. If I am ever in the area again, I may have to check out there happy hour.
