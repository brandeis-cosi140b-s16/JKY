We've been there three times now and we LOVE the food. Would highly recommend that part to everybody. 

We DIDN'T enjoy having the hostess come to our table while we were talking after dinner and ask us to move to an inside table so that they could seat a large party that was coming soon. We really hadn't been sitting there for what we thought was a long time after dining. Made to feel uncomfortable, we decided to leave instead and noticed empty tables in the outside dining area, as well as others inside. It made us wonder why our table in particular was asked to relocate. It was an unwelcome experience that was new to all of us. Prior to tonight we had thought that this was going to be a place we would go to again and again...but maybe not now.
