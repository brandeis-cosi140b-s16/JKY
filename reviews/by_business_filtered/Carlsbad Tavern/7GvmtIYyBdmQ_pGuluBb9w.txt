This place has the best dish of all time... Blue corn enchiladas. You can never go wrong when ordering this delicious treat. I've come to Carlsbad many many times and I always order the same dish. The food is consistent and the patio is perfect for date night. Be careful when sitting outside when it's hot out because of the Mosquitos. Those lil suckers bite me every time. You can subside the annoying pain with more margaritas.
