My husband and I were really impressed with this little place!  I'm kind of surprised to read he run negative reviews because our experience was quite the opposite.  Flavorful food, fun drinks, accommodating staff, awesome atmosphere.  Best of all, very minimal Scottsdale douche-baggery!  We can't wait to go back!
