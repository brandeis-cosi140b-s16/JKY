Opened by a former part-owner of Richardson's, Carlsbad Tavern is one place in the valley I keep coming back to.  It used to be on the corner of Scottsdale Road and Osborne...moving to Hayden (just south of Osborne) about 6 years ago. 

With inventive New Mexican entrees, Carlsbad Tavern provides both great atmosphere and eats! 

It's steaks, ribs, and burgers are grilled over pecan wood, adding a smokiness that's a nice alternative to hickory or mesquite. It's carne adovada rivals both Richardson's and Los Dos Molinos (though less spicy than Los Dos.) Start off with the Tequila shrimp, served with cilantro pesto black beans (to die for!) Chicken tortilla soup also rocks my world...Chili rellenos are among the best I've had in Phoenix. Ribs are way up there also. The sauce is unique, flavorful, and works perfectly with the meat. Don't forget the corn muffins with cactus butter! 

Well stocked bar with a friendly competent staff. They also have one of the funnier menus around called..."The Daily Guano"

Much more seating here than Richardson's. What really sets it apart is the tables outside. All heated, for comfort any time of year. Add to that a creek and a fireplace...and you get a restaurant that works for lunch after golf or a on date.
