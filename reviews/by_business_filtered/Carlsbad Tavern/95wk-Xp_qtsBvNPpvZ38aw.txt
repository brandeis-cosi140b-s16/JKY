Tolan the manager is always super friendly! I've been going to Carlsbad for years so I am a regular, but that started because the service is friendly and the food is great. This is a very popular joint that's been around because they do what they can to please their customers. I'm surprised with some of the okay reviews (but you can't please everyone) maybe those people were having a bad day. Also a heads up the food is tasty and there are some dishes with some spice/flavor, that you may not think of so I always ask if it's spicy. You should go in this place if you haven't already. Yum!
