This is a great place!  
It's one of those places you could drive past every day for the rest of your life and never know how cool it is.  I did for years...just wondering about the name and thinking that I needed to try it.  Then, a way long time back..I took a friend there for dinner.  What a blast!  Not sure what time of year but a perfect weather to dine alfresco.  So we sat outside and the hours fairly cruised by as we ate from one end of the menu to the other.  The food was pretty good too!  Everything we tried tasted great. I think!  The drinks were good..I can swear to that.  So a few months go by and I try it again.  Second verse, same as the first!  The food was good, the service was good!

Anyhow, in the intervening years, CT has never failed me. For me, it has always been kind of a fun place to take someone who has never been there.  The outside gives no indication of how cool the interior is.  I will keep heading back and recommend it pretty highly!
