We ate here a week ago on a last minute choice and it turned out to be pretty good.  Two of us had the fresh snapper tacos and really enjoyed them.  Very big portion and the fish was very good.  One of our group and a combination enchiladas, chicken and crab.  Also a very good portion and good food.  Our other friend had a crab stuffed chili pepper and it was huge.  He ate half of it.  Also very good.  Service was good and all in all it was a nice meal.
