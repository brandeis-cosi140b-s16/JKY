The best thing about this place is the d√©cor. It's incredible with flowing water and festive lights everywhere. I would have loved to sit outside but members of our party voted against it. 

Other than that I wasn't impressed. Everything was spicy. Everything! The beans and rice that accompanied most meals. The pico de gallo was on fire. The guacamole needed a fire extinguisher. The only thing on the menu that wasn't spicy was the cheeseburger. I wish someone would have told me this before we sat down.  

Our service also left much to be desired. We were there about 2pm on a Friday and the place was pretty empty. Regardless of that fact our server still forgot everything! He forgot drinks. He forgot sides. He forgot refills. He did not forget his snarky attitude when we asked for recommendations on what wasn't spicy. Oh but he did forget to tell us that things like guac and beans were spicy 

If you like spicy (which most of Arizona does apparently) try it here, but I won't be back.
