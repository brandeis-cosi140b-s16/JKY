I recently came across this place that I have lived by for years but never ventured into I am so glad I did. The ambiance was great!  Friendly and casual! The newspaper menu was such a cool touch!  I had the Blue Corn enchiladas which were delicious! My server was very friendly and helpful when I was trying to decide what to eat. This place has a one of the nicest patios around. I would recommend to this place to anyone wanting to have a great meal in a fun atmosphere!
