Came in a for a quick bite to get out of the heat and found myself in a great bar with a great atmosphere and the best green salsa ever. Krystal was our server and she was absolutely delightful. Try the skinny margarita and order the chips and salsa. The green salsa is homemade from tomatillos. Highly recommend any restaurant that has survived almost twenty years. Well worth it.
