Solid 4 star rating, very consistent which is a trait high on my radar.

This "is" New Mexican cuisine, which translates to hatch pepper green sauce and sopapillas. After that the sky is the limit with variations and combinations of cooking styles. 

And vary it does!

At Carlsbad there are 3 distinct dining areas, The Bar, The Cave, The Grotto. Each area presents a completely different atmosphere and draws corresponding cliental. 

Casual fine dining in "The Cave". 

Trendy down in "The Grotto".

 You will find the regulars in "The Bar".

I prefer eating "fine dining food" at the bar, because that's how I roll. The bar tenders are witty and quick with a joke and light up your smoke if you know what I mean? The drink strengths vary by the bartenders. 

Its very dark and low key and you will drive right by the entrance if you are not careful. Carlsbad is also one of the few places in town that serve late night food. You have to try this place out for yourself, nothing else like it in the valley. 

My kind of place!
