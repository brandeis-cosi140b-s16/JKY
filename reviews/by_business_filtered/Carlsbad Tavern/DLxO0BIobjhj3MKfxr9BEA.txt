This place has a very interesting setting and a really wonderful patio.  The food is great and the drink selection is varied and tasty.  Both feature ingredients native to the southwest.  Definitely worth a stop. The only downside is the rather indifferent service.  That may have been just a fluke.  It was very busy.
