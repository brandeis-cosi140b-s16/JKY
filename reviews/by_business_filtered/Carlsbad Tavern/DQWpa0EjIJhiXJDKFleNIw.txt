I used to live in Scottsdale and this is the one place I really miss.  The ambience is nifty and the food is delicious.  I always ordered the green chili burrito and couldn't even begin to finish it, but it made for a tasty meal the next day.  The drinks are also really good.  This is a definite jewel in this town--don't miss out!
