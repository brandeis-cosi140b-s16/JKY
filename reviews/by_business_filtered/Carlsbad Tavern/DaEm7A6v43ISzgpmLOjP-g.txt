I was excited to check this place out. Having lived in AZ off and on for 8 years, the time had come. I had reserved in advance and our table was out on the patio, as the reservationist had recommended as the temp dropped to the 80's. For our table there was one umbrella and the sun, if directly on you was hot! We had to gather umbrellas and position them ourselves..it was quite a comotion. Our server even saw this and didnt even offer to assist!

The server, didnt seem to care about the service, after all the 18% was already included.  It took forever to get our drink orders and even longer if we wanted to partake in the bloody Mary Bar.. because he had to bring us glasses.

The Bloody Mary Bar, was on a teeny tiny filthy table next to the bar...the garnishes were extinct, the table was dripping various ingredients. It looked like the remnants of a rager the night before. One of my friends asked for an olive, since none were provided and the bartender (who wasn't busy) rolled her eyes and scoffed! WTF?

I have to say the food was good.. at least the lobster croissant was but it wasn't worth coming back with all things considered,
