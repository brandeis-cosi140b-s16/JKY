After visiting Carlsbad's tavern last night for the third time ever, I'm updating my review to show our displeasure with this restaurant.  

We were promptly seated on the outside deck for dinner and our server was very quick to greet us. We ordered two skinny margaritas made with casadores, which were really good.  Nice start. We ordered the red chili chimi with a sopapilla for a buck extra,  and meatloaf for our entrees.

 Before the food arrived my husband and I ordered another round of margaritas,  and this is where the night began to go downhill. Mine came out perfect, but I have no idea what the bartenders did to my husband's.  He kept telling me it tasted off. I finally took a sip and almost spit it out; it tasted like flat salty sprite, it was so bizarre.  By the time I had tasted it I figured it was too late to send it back so we just ate the cost and didn't finish the drink. Come to think of it, each time we've visited,  we always are served margaritas that are very inconsistent. 

The food arrived pretty quickly,  which was nice,  but we were soon disappointed again.  Both meals were passable but certainly not great.  My meatloaf had nice taste but the mashed potatoes were so bland and honestly looked like they came straight from the "instant" box.  My husband's chimi had very little meat and the rice and beans were nothing special.  Our server forgot our spoapilla as well. 

If we ever come back,  it won't be for a very long time.  There is only so many times that we will settle for inconsistent drinks and mediocre food.
