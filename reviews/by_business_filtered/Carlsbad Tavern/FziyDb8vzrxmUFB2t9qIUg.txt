We were there very early this evening, so that may be the reason we had a less-than-5 star experience... We ordered off the happy hour menu -- crab cakes and potstickers. We also ordered the green chili mac and cheese. 

The food was VERY good, for bar food. Nice spice in the crab cakes and the aioli that came with them -- and the salad greens on the plate were outstanding. The pot-stickers were okay, but not on the same level. The mac and cheese was good -- but could have used a few more minutes under the broiler to make them a little less soupy. 

We got a side order of guac and should have gone with the full order. 

Where Carlsbad lost us though, was the margarita. I know it was somewhat my mistake -- I ordered the house marg and asked them to substitute Grand Marnier. When the marg arrived, I couldn't taste any GM and asked the waitress to check if maybe it had been left out. She shouted over to the bartender to confirm that he had added the GM -- and of course he said he had... Oh well, without the taste of the GM, it was just a plain old margarita. I would have paid $5 for a decent dose of GM, but whatever. 

I decided to pass on the margarita and just drank my water instead. The margarita sat on the table untouched throughout the meal and the waitress never asked about it. It would have been a nice touch to have had her at least offer to get me something else... 

So I'm knocking a star off for service... 

But the outside patio IS great looking and I recommend you head out there when you arrive. I'm not sure why this place shows up as a tapas bar in the Yelp listing, but it's really not a tapas place. It's a New Mexico themed bar/restaurant with very good food and I'm sure most of the staff is very good as well, judging from the other reviews... Don't pass this up on my account -- but do remember my experience when ordering your margarita...
