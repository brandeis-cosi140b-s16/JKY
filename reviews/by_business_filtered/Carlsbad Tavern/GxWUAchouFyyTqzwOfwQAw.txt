Sat on the patio last night-heat lamp ON of course.  Really lovely, and the waterfalls drown out the sound of traffic on Hayden.  I wanted Sangria but didn't see it on the menu.  Not only did they have it, it is probably some of the best I've had.  If you've never tried Carlsbad, now is the time to enjoy the patio with that glass of Sangria.
