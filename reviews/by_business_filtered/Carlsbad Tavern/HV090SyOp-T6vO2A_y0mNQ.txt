We went here in hopes of getting some great New Mexican food, we were disappointed in their green chili sauce, the sopapilla was like flat fried dough, and it was in the shape of a perfect even sided square. All the sopapilla's we've ever had were puffy and odd round shapes. I will give them credit for great service, but would not recommend this as a place to get good authentic New Mexican food.
