Yum, Yum, Yum.

It's spicy, so wussies take note. 

I LOVE their blue corn enchiladas.... they're served on a big plate and all the sides run together and you can't tell what is what... MMM!

Their chicken enchiladas are also top notch.

Yum.

Highly recommended, especially for those with taste buds of steel :)
