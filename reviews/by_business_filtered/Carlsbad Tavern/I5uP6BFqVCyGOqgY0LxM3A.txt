My husband & I went here for Valentine's Day Dinner. We arrived a little early than our reservation, so we hung out at the bar until our table was ready. When we got seated (outside) we sat for 19 minutes before a waitress came over to us to ask what we would like to drink. We ordered our drinks and asked if they could turn on the heating lamp next to me because I was cold. The short woman bussing the tables had a very difficult time getting it started, figuring out the propane needed to be changed. Then after multiple attempts to get it to work, they moved it and got 2 more which also didnt work. I was annoyed it took 3 heating lamps and 5 people to figure one out to get it's started. Guess I was that hassle guest! Lol anyways... The food was good when it was served although ridiculously hot, my husband burnt his taste buds off with his first bite of enchiladas. So he finally got to eat more after 15 minutes of cooling. It atmosphere was nice, but the service was definitely scatter brained on surprisingly not such a busy night for them..I am not sure we will returning, we definitely got the vibe that it's a local hang out kind of place, not an enjoyable evening...
