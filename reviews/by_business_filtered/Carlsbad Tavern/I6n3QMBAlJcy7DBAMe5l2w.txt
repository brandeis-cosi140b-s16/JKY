First time into Carlsbad Tavern. Shocking since I've lived in the valley for so long. Immediately coming into the lot there were no parking spots available, so I had to park across the street and walk over. Their atmosphere was quite interesting, I wish my friends had opted to sit on the patio rather than in the bar area. 
Being there 2 hours we probably saw our server 5 or 6 times who only came by when drinks were empty already or someone new came to join. He also copped a little attitude when we needed to split the check so we separated everything for him. Am I wrong or do POS systems not have seat numbers on them? My flautas were OK and my margarita was awful but the rest of my party said the food was pretty good here most of the time, I suppose I'll have to come back and give it another shot. 
One big pro though... When we left we realized there was a wait for tables. The atmosphere was so calm and people weren't crammed into the bar area while they waited. That is something they are definitely doing right. Stay posted for an updated review.
