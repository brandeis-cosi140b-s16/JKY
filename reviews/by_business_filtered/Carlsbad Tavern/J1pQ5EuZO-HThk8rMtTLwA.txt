This place is in my top 5 favorite places to eat in Scottsdale!!! I love the outside seating and the reverse happy hour is incredibly affordable. The food is phenomenal, we had the chicken quesadilla and the filet mignon tacos; never had anything like it!! This is all around a great place, service is always up to par and there's nothing bad on the menu (even though I haven't had every item) in my opinion this restaurant can do no wrong. I can't wait to go back, I'd eat there once a week if I lived in Scottsdale!!
