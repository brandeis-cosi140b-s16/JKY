Awesome AWESOME atmosphere.  Especially when its not an inferno outside on their patio...surrounded by chili pepper lights and a small creek complete with foot bridge and tiki-ish bar...  Carlsbad Tavern is one of my favorite spots.

I love sitting outside but as it really was an inferno when I was there last week, I had to get aquainted with the inside bar area.  Not much different, chili pepper lights and New Mexico license plates... excellent music and good vibe all around.  

Spending most of my early 20s in the Midwest, I hadnt had a whole ton of New Mexican food before but let me tell you, I am now a whole hearted fan.  Lots of green chile menu items, burritos, enchiladas...  My recent favorites are the crab stuffed green chiles, and the carlsbad chicken salad.  HUGE portions so bring your apetite.  

Prices are average but great for the amount of food you get...between $8 and $25 for steaks etc.  Perfect service, friendly staff.

Dont forget to try a prickly pear margarita--best in town!!
