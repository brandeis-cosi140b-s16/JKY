I really like this place, but the prices are a little inflated. I used to come here a lot with my co-workers at lunch when I worked in the area, but not as often since I changed employers. I still want to come here because I love the habenero burger so, so much, but I'm a little iffy on spending $13 on a burger. I come occasionally when I'm not feeling cheap but I never have any regrets afterward. The drinks are also a little overpriced for how weak they make them. The fries are really, very good too and I really like the river running through the back patio. Gives your meal a great atmosphere. I also like to call ahead so I can pick it up and eat at home. The hostess and bartender are usually very personable and helpful. I would recommend giving it a try!
