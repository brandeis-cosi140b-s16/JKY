Great food! Always excellent service.

I always get the Red River Chicken for lunch. Great with the perfect amount of spice so that my mouth starts to burn a little just when I'm about to finish.

You can't beat the chicken chimi on Tuesdays.

I've eaten there with co-workers during lunch, on date night with spouse, and even taken the entire family

Eating outside is great as long as no one is smoking and it's not too hot
