My friend Emily and I were so excited to try this place we always drive by.  Our excitement was squashed by the rude bartender and the socially awkward couple we were sitting next to.  It's really too bad cause I thought the food was really good.  

Next time I am looking for a dark bar with a bunch of people in a bad mood, I'll hit up this place.
