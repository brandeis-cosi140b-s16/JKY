Came here during a spring training trip. Very short wait for a table. I really liked the decor. I thought it was relaxing and cool. It was a little chilly so we sat inside but the patio area was appealing as well.

Between the five people in our group, we ordered the blue corn enchiladas, green chile burrito (one with chicken, one with machaca), red snapper tacos, and green chile philly. The tacos were good tasting but the plate was kind of busy with a lot of dressings. Philly was good but the bread could have been more interesting. A little bland and dry. 

The enchiladas and burritos were great, especially the machaca and the shrimp in the enchiladas. The green chile was tasty, as was the side of red chile we asked to try. It was the best I've had in awhile, especially outside of New Mexico. The machaca meat was really tender and had a lot of flavor. Sadly, the rice and beans looked better than they tasted but we were so into the green chile we didn't really care.

Definitely a place to go for a relaxing environment and some good, New Mexican inspired food.
