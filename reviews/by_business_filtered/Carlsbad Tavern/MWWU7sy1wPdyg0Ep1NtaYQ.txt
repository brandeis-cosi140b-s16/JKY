We stopped by here before a spring training game and we had already eaten, so I can only review the service and the drinks. 

First off this place is really cool to hang out in. We sat outside in the sun with the water going and some music playing. It was really nice. All of the servers were quick and awesome. I did the make your own bloody mary bar and the guys had beers. It was a good pour of vodka and plenty of add-ons for the drink. I then had a mimosa which was good. 

The guys got some food which looked awesome but I was too full to even try. Fiance got tequila shrimp (I think that's what it was called) but its an app of grilled shrimp on a bed of black beans. 

We don't go to this side of town very often but I hope I get to go back here since the menu looked awesome.
