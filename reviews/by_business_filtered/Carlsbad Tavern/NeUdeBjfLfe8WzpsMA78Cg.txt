Nothing screams I'm in Arizona than waking up at 11:00AM and heading straight to Carlsbad Tavern for my late morning pina colada...all while sitting outside right by a mote. Please take note of the menus! They look like newspapers. I had the Spicy Lobster Croissant with a side of fries dipped in lemon aioli. Really? REALLY. (And REALLY REALLY GOOD). I just wish smoking was prohibited even in the outdoor seating portion of the restaurant. Major bummer when our neighbors decided to take a smoke (while they were eating...can't they just enjoy their food for a few minutes?) Aside from that, I thought it was a fun place to eat! When I was leaving the restaurant I noticed the indoor portion of the restaurant looked pretty small? Oh no... :-\
