I went back to Carlsbad Tavern, because I had been dreaming about the Carne Adovada plate. Remember my last review; the burrito was To die for!

So I ordered the plate, and was really disappointed. Like so sad I couldn't really eat my meal. I would like to first say that I think it is more of a personal reason than Carlsbad Tavern's issue. I grew up with Mexican Food, not New Mexican food. So when you get a plate with meat, you get salsa, sour cream (very gringo, btw) and other sauces, for lack of a better word! With the Adovada, it was meat, beans, tortillas, and rice. No sauce nothing to make it more interesting.

So I took most of my meal home and doctored it up the next day.

Lesson learned, order the burrito if you want Carne Adovada. Although Next time I go back, I will for sure get the Chile rellenos. I am sure they will be as good as I remember!
