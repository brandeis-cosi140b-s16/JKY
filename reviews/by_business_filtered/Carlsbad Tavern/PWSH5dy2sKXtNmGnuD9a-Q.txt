I basically live across the street from Carlsbad, and have always had a weird vibe from it.  Why?  good question.  I was basically judging a book by it's cover, which is so stupid because this place is AWESOME!  First of all, you have to sit outside.  Their outdoor area is fantastic and doesn't make you feel like Hayden Rd. is on the other side of the rock wall.  I really wanted some Mexican-style food, which is why my boyfriend and I went to Carlsbad in the first place.  We saw the habenero burger and quickly changed our minds to challenge the heat of the burger.  We also got a side of the green chile mac, which complemented the spiciness quite well.  The burger has a warning saying "you buy it, you own it," and although I thought the burger was excellent, I didn't think it was all that hot or scary.  Don't get me wrong, it was definitely hot, but nothing the average heat-lover couldn't handle.  I love it when you find a place that has so many things you want to try, and Carlsbad is one of them.  I am looking forward to going back and getting something new, oh and having another one of their house margs which are also great!
