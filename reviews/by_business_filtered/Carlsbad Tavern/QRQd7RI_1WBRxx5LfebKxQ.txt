Been around the corner from this place for a couple years, guess it's about time my batwings brought me in...

A good mix of happy hours specials from appetizers to salads. From spicy potstickers to salads, they've got a lot of variety. The drink special I got down with was the Tres Agave Margarita. (I know, quelle horreuer on the missing Malibu, but sometimes you've gotta try the specialties). 

The drink I asked for was on the rocks, lotsa salt. And boy, did they make it like I ordered it. It was good, not as good as a certain favorite margarita place of mine, but I'd give it a 4 star on a 5-star scale. 

Service was friendly and spot on. No empty glasses or dying for a drink around here. Guess the bat cave bartenders have some good drink radar going on. 

The food was average. Nothing spectacular. But it didn't repulse me or remind me of stuff I used to make in home ec class. So that's a plus. 

They did have Malibu behind the bar so when I return, I'll go back to my usual. Don't know if they use a pineapple gun or the cans. That may sway me into sticking with the margaritas :P
