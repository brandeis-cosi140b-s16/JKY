As long as we have lived in AZ , we had never gone to Carlsbad Tavern and decided to check it out last week when we were on way home from doctor's app't in Scottsdale.  It was a pleasant surprise and must say that the wait staff was so friendly and nice.  I got the shrimp with rice rather than beans and it was a bit 'hot' but nothing I was unhappy with.  Good taste!  My husband had the patty melt with fries and he said his was very good also.  I ate some of his fries and they were very tasty.  We would recommend it and will definitely go back. They had a steady clientele so that was a good sign as far as I was concerned.
