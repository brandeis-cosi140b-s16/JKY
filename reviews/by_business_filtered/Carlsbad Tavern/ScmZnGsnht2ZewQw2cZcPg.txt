Great "Oasis" spot.  You'll see this place on the east side of the road. You sort of enter the "bat cave" over a bridge and pull though the restaurant before you're seated outside.

It's all walled off and the fresh "naturey batty" vibe is refreshing with no view of the bustling street outside.

The food is hot, and spicy and really good.  Great service.  Solid spot for great lunching and I'm sure dinnering.
