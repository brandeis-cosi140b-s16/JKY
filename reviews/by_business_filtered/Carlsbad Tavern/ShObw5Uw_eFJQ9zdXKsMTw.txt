Will write this place off of my bucket list. Was definitely not impressed. I ordered the shredded pork nachos and my son ordered a burrito. The meat in both of our dishes was tough. I ordered a Moscow Mule which I usually drink when I eat out. It was so watered down. We choose to eat outside. The place definitely needs some cleaning and updating. Maybe if you dine later in the evening when it's dark, you won't notice how dated it is.
