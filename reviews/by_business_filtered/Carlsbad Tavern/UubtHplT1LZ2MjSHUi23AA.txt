My son wanted to go here for his Birthday. It is a little drive from where we live. The decor inside was supposed to have a cave look with bats. (Not Real Ones) HeHe. I had heard that everything was really spicy. This I did not find the be true. I got the Carne Adovada plate. The meal was good but not spicy at all. I may not be the one to judge of what is spicy as I am a hatch chili fan. The hotter the better. This is one place you don't get free chips and salsa. We ordered the chips and salsa. Their salsa was good but again not very spicy. Everyone enjoyed their meal. The service was good. The meals were reasonably priced maybe a little higher than I am used to paying for the same type of meal where you get free chips and salsa. I did not like paying for the chips and salsa. I would definitely eat there again if I was in the area but not good enough to travel 30 miles just to eat.
