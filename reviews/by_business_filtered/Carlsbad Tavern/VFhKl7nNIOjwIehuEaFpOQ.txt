Finally tried you guys last week. Won't go back though. Wanted to watch the only NBA playoff game at the bar but, 3 TV's were on hockey and someone was watching golf ( played 10 hours ago and was taped). Did not honor the yelp check in nachos until the third request and, couldn't get my easy drink order right or fill our water glasses.  You need some serious staff training. Food is good and nice venue.
