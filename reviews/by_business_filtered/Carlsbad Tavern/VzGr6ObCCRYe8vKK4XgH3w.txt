Just jumping on the Yelp bandwagon, and figured I would start with this location! This place was truly stellar. We live in the nearby neighborhood, and decided to walk here for dinner and drinks. So glad we did! The atmosphere was awesome, the food (and portion size) was fantastic, and Liz the bartender is A+++. Definitely returning again!
