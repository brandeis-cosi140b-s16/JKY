We absolutely love the food but the management is rude.  When we went there Friday night more than half their tables were empty and we were told they had no room in a very rude voice. There were no reserved signs on the tables.  When I phoned them the following day they said they don't put a reserved sign on tables.  Perhaps instead of telling us there was no room they could have said all tables were reserved.   We have gone there a lot because the food is great and never had a problem getting a table.  We will never go there again.
