The green chile sauce has a lot of flavor but the pork really is rather bland.  I opted to get the enchantment platter(?) - basically a try everything plate.  

By far the best thing was the chicken enchiladas.  It had good flavor, the meat was moist and seasoned.  Yum..  The pork stuff chile was decent too though a bit on the bland side.  I asked for pico de gallo which helped it a bit.  The carne acevedo(?) burrito wasn't bad, but even more on the bland side.  The sopapilla that came with the platter was pretty good, I didn't even put honey on it.  The worst thing about the plate was all the cheese.  I'm a fan of molty cheese, but this was just way too much.  There had to be like half a block on the plate.

We also tried the green chile pork stew which was decent..  The chile had a pretty big kick.  Somehow the dish didn't come together well.  Just tasted like veggie soup with green chile salsa in it.  The worst thing was the pork that was overcooked and dry in it.  

The pricing is a bit high, even for happy hour.  The atmosphere and menus are creative.  The service was pretty good when we went, but we were there early for lunch (~11am).  Decent place, maybe I'll try the nachos next time.
