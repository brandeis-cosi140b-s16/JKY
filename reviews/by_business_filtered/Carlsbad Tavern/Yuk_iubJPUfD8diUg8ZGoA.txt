I enjoyed HH Nachos, Steak Tacos, Crab Cakes, Crispy French Fries and of course their UNBELIEVABLE Fried Ice Cream & Chocolate Bread Pudding (which I don't even usually like but this was bread that tasted like chocolate instead of chocolate on bread so WOW) 
Great specials, Good enough service.
I am so glad I took the advice of whoever told me it was the best Mexican Food in Scottsdale. I was impressed. 
I did not have time to take photos, I was too hungry and the food was too delicious.
Getting used to Southwest Fare where black beans are on all "Mexican Food" is different but I'm game. In KY you also have everything is "Queso AKA Cheese Dip" so the fat white girl in me misses that but again, I can adjust.
