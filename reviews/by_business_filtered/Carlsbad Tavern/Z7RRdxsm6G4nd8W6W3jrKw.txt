Carlsbad Tavern is the Scottsdale version of Casa Bonita. I know, I know, there are no cliff divers, and there are no video games, but they both serve Mexican food, they both have a giant waterfall, and the whole place is like a cave so three out of five ain't bad. 

The staff here are all incredibly friendly. It looked like they actually enjoyed working there. And you can tell this place is family owned. It has a certain fun factor that corporate lawyers would most likely have advised against (examples being...the giant waterfall, outdoor canal, and large objects hanging tenuously from the ceiling). 

The food was pretty good. My dining companions complained of too much cheese, but this is "New Mexico" style Mexican food. What better way to "Americanize" something than to put giant portions of cheese all over it. Am I the only one who occasionally has a craving for a giant burrito covered in savory green chili sauce and melted monterrey jack?  As soon as I hear those magic words "be careful,the plate is REALLY hot!" I turn into a human version of Pavlov's dog. 

The margaritas were very good, and their tomatillo salsa was top notch.
