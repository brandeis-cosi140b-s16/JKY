great place to eat after a spring training game..

the outdoor patio was perfect.  the weather was warm, there is a waterfall and the candles and strung-up lights come on when the sun goes down.  great atmosphere.

the food was good!  recommend anything with the green chile sauce.  

the only thing that we didn't like was the waiter.  not friendly at all.
