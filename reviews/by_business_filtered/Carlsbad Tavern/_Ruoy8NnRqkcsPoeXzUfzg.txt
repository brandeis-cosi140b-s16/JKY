This food was amazing. I had one of the specials for the evening, scallops in a sauce that was to die for. Really indescribable as I couldn't identify what flavored I was tasting. But it was wonderful. Another person had the filet salad which they said was great. Another had a plate with chili rellenos and two other items. Was really spicy hot and good.  Don't understand some of the negative reviews here. Almost like we were in different places. Plan to go again before we leave town
