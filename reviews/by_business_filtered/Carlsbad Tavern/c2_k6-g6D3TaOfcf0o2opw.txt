The food here is delicious! The first time I went I had the Chile Rellanos but with french fries instead of rice and beans.  I was really happy they accomadated my french fry substitution as it's a bit unusual. The Chile Rellanos where delicious, best I've ever had! I even had enough to take home.  The last time I was there I had the Macaroni and Cheese Bites and Chips and Salsa.  I love love love the green salsa, it's not a chili based salsa and I couldn't quite pin point what it was, but it's delicious!  The Macaroni and Cheese Bites are little bits of snacking perfection, I loved them!

I can't wait to go again and try more things!
