I've been going to Carlsbad Tavern for years now, and it's a great go-to for late night eats (though I tried their brunch for the first time today, and was kinda blown away - I will be back for that). Food is pretty consistent, service always good, and the decor is funny/cute. 

As others have pointed out: if they say spicy on the menu, believe it.
