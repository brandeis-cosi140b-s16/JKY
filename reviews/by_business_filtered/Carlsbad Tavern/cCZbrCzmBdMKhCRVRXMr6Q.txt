So the last couple times I've been to Carlsbad I've been disappointed.  This place has really lost its luster.  The salsa now tastes like it comes straight from a can and there was such a huge layer of grease on my food that I couldn't figure out where my enchiladas stopped and the beans started.  Last night I went there with my mom and Grandma and the waitress was a huge snob, we didn't even want to tip her (of course we did).  It was so dark in the dining room that my grandma couldn't see the menu so she asked if they had a shredded beef burro. The waitress, in a condescending voice says, "Yes, of course we do, what you want is a green chili burro".   Gma then asked if that was spicy and she said, "Not really".  It came out so spicy that she couldn't even eat it.  The waitress did not offer to make her something else or take if off the bill, she was sooooo rude the entire meal, I won't even write about all the instances.  Her name was Michelle, so if you go there and she's your server you may as well get up and leave.   I really want to like Carlsbad, its within walking distance from my house and has a good concept... I just don't know if I can go back after my experience last night.
