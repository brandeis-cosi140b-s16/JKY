It breaks my heart to have to write this review of a restaurant that used to be one of my favorite places to eat in Scottsdale. 

Today we were having a Sunday brunch for my bestie who lives in Texas. I had fond memories of the food, and especially the sopapillas. We arrived at noon, it wasn't terribly busy, so we sat outside on the patio. 

First off, we ordered margaritas and several others decided on the bloody mary bar. The margaritas were gross, salty and sour w/ limes that were long past their prime. The bloody mary drinkers were made to wait...and wait...and wait for their glasses to walk inside to make their drinks. 

We ordered our entrees at about 12:30-12:45 and didn't get them until after 1:30. When I received my carne adovada burrito, it had been nuked beyond recognition, the rice was shriveled and was burnt onto the plate, as were the black beans. My first bite of the burrito was a hunk of fat...that pretty much ended it for me, also, the sopapilla I ordered for the dish came out 20 minutes later after I reminded him. The sopapilla was not at all like I remembered, and was more of a flattened piece of naan than anything else.  

The rest of my party had varying issues with their meals. To add insult to injury, my lunch cost $55 for one gross burrito, 2 drinks and a piece of bread pudding due to whatever gratuity they added. The waiter was surly...when he was present at all, which was rare. No water refill, completely unapologetic for the various issues with our experience, and never took away the offensive margaritas he served in the beginning. 

Needless to say, we will not be returning. What the hell happened to this place??! ugh! BUMMER!!!
