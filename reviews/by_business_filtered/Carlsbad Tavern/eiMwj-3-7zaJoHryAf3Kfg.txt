I've had all kinds of dishes here from the Enchantment platter to the tequila shrimp to the lobster linguine special. Every time I come it seems to be even better than the last. 

Pros:
-The restaurant looks like it could be a Disneyland installment. Take that as you will. 
-Portions are generous, come hungry!
-Anything involving lobster or a cream sauce here is a winner

Cons:
-Anything involving non-seafood meat is dry or overcooked in my book
-I personally like higher sauce/veggie-to-meat ratios, but they usually pack their food full of MEAT

:) Still love you Tavern. Keep improving!
