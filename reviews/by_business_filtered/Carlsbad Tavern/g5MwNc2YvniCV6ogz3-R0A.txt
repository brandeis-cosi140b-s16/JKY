I was in Scottsdale for work and was craving something from the southwest. Carlsbad had great Yelp reviews. I was surprised as about everything in my experience was the opposite of what I'd read on yelp. The service was actually good. The bartender, I think his name was Louie, was very friendly. The food was mediocre at best; it kind of reminded me of airport Mexican food. The green chile isn't the same time of green chile I'm used to in Denver. This green chile was more like a salsa, not the stew/roux I've become familiar with in the southwest. My experience was fine, but not close to good enough to bother with Carlsbad again.
