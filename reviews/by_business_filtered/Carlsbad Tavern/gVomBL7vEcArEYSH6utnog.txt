Went back for a happy hour at night and the food is still pretty good and tasty. The regular Happy Hour prices are still lower than the late night happy Hour and the menu's are different. On this visit, tried the three chicken tacos which were loaded with spiced chicken inside fresh tortillas. The chicken quesadilla was stuffed like no other quesadilla and was very filling. Used the free chips check-in and it turned out to be a quite a satisfying late night meal. Also, a $5 vodka soda was large sized and hit the spot.
