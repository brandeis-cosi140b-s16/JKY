I live about 2 minutes from this great place!  My Mom was a graduate of Carlsbad Highschool 1957 and I am from New Mexico so this has a special place in my heart!  The crab cakes are great and so is just about every single meal, especially the osso bucco.  They have a  signature ribeye quesadilla that is served early in the day.  They admit that they don't make ANY money on it. Yes, it's THAT good!  The fireplace which is outside smells great in the winter months!  There is not ONE single meal at the Tavern that is bad!!
