Great quality food especially for the price, excellent service by our server James H. I haven't had such good service from a server in a long time, he's fantastic and it made my mine and my girlfriends evening even better.. Thanks James.. Oh and I must recommend the Cowboy Meatloaf. Super good and worth every penny.
