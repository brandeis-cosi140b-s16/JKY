Such a great Mexican-American food restaurant. If you're looking for a nice but casual Mexican food place that is a little different, go to Carlsbad. I recommend sitting outside, they have a pleasant waterfall and stream under a bridge and just an overall relaxing atmosphere. They food is also terrific of course, though a lot of items lean toward the hotter side (even their black beans side is spicy). My favorite's are the Southwest Patty Melt & Chipotle Stroganoff Chicken Pasta, terrific. Great for family dinner or a date.
