Meh...Blah...Robin, don't ever take me to the bat cave again!

This was the worst New Mexican food and margaritas we ever had! I never have to force myself to drink anything with tequila in it, but their house margarita just didn't taste right. We got chips and salsa, which you have to pay for, and was told which salsa was mild and which was hot. They must have forgotten the chiles as neither was hot. 

We then asked our waiter about some items on the menu and his response was "it's popular". We then asked what he would recommend and he said "anything with sauce and cheese on it to cover it up". Wow...we looked at each other thinking "is the food so nasty that we need cheese and sauce to get through it?" We decided to split the Blue Corn Enchiladas and the 1/2 Rotisserie Spicy Citrus Chicken. I don't know how to explain it but the enchiladas were tough and the green chile was tasteless. The chicken sounded like it should be spicy with habanero and guajillo chiles. It tasted more like it was smothered in BBQ sauce. It came with green chile mac n' cheese which was tasteless and the jicama slaw, well the jicama was okay but the cabbage was bitter and the dressing did not help it at all. 

The only reason I gave it 1 star is for the cool atmosphere! Inside it's like a bat cave and the outside patio in nice weather looks relaxing. 

Unless we hear some significant changes to the food and drink, I think we'll have to hang out with Superman instead!
