I went here last night with a party of 4.  It was about 7pm and the place was pretty dead.  A few years ago I sat outside which was good, but this time I sat inside which was interesting.  The decor is pretty weird with bat stuff everywhere.  Nothing like it around I can tell you that.  The patio is also very interesting as well with a nice water element.

My first trip here was about 4-5 years ago and I tried to be hardcore and order their habanero cheeseburger.  I love love love spicy things but it was a bit over the top for me and I couldn't even finish it.  I was trying to be a bad ass in front of my then girlfriend (now wife) but I just couldn't choke it down.  It was very good but it was just way too spicy for my gringo mouth/stomach.

So on this trip I decided to sample some of their other, more mellow fare.  I was really looking forward to this because I am a big fan of New Mexican cuisine, spicy food, green chili, etc.

* Chips and Salsa - the chips are fresh and excellent.  The 2 salsas they give you I think were pretty fresh as well.  The mild one was ok but was a bit too chunky for me.  The green one had some heat to it but was just ok as well.  It had a weird taste like it had pickled chilis in it or something.

* Green Chili Cheeseburger - good sized, juicy and smothered in green chili sauce.  I ordered it without the bun and have absolutely no idea how someone can eat it with one because it would be a giant mess.  Anyway, I wasn't a big fan.  I just didn't like the taste of the green chili sauce and would have much preferred just strips of fresh roasted green chilies on top of the burger.  My meal came with a side salad which was eh.

* Green Chili Philly - My wife ordered this without the hoagie bun.  I had a taste and I did't think it was very good.  Had some heat to it, but it wasn't very flavorful.  And the flavor it did have was just eh.

* Green Chili Mac n' Cheese - This was my favorite part of the meal.  It wasn't the best mac n' cheese I've ever had but it was pretty good.  It was a bit too soupy instead of think and creamy, but it was good.  Very interesting with the green chili in it.

I wasn't a big fan of the service either.  Our waitress was cracked out.  She kept forgetting things and basically shoved a to-go box in my face before I was finished.  It was all pretty odd because she was friendly and was quick with my diet coke refills.  I think she must have been new to the joint.  I dunno.

I really don't know if and when I'll be back.  There are plenty of other places that serve kinda sorta the same food and this place really didn't stand out in terms of food or service.
