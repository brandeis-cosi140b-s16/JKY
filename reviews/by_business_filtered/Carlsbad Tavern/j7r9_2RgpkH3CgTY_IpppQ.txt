Horrible service, has reservations and were seated 20 minutes past our time and then sat for 30 minutes waiting for drinks and water. Waitress seemed bothered by us and checked us once our meals were finished. We were overcharged for drinks and guacamole...the food portions were very small and not original at all. I brought this horrible experience to the manager's attention and he was completely aloof to the fact that we extremely disappointed in all aspects of this experience.
