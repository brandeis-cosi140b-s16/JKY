I'm not sure what it takes for you to give a 5 star, but for me it takes leaving the place satisfied and happy! The Bat Cave has a little something for everyone, from the patio to the bar you can find customized experience of New Mexican cuisine.  The experience at Carlsbad Tavern is pretty optional, as the staff caters to where ever you like to seat and whatever it is that you need.  

The menu items are exceptionally well thought and obviously there is no need for modifications.  If you like spicy, Carlsbad is all about that chili.  You can literally get educated about chilies by the posters on the wall, so pay attention!  

My favorite items off the menu would be whatever Chef Ruben is cooking as his special, or the Crab Stuffed Poblanos for dinner, and the Portales Portbello for lunch. Happy Hour is everyday and there's a drink menu with more than 5 mules, so five stars right there... need I say more? Wait, don't let me forget to mention they have a late night dinning menu until 1 or 2 am... that's impressive!

If you leave with out having the Dolce de Leche fried ice cream, you will being doing yourself an incredible disservice.  It is the best thing I have ever tasted! Can't wait to bring my family here! 

Restaurant week.... here I come!
