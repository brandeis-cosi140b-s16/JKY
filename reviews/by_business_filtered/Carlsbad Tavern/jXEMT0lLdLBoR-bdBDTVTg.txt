Love this place and have for several years.  No the habanero burger is not as hot as it was before the fraud network.... ooops I mean food network came around.... if you have only one day at this beautiful culinary excursion..... with 4 people start with 1 habanero burger as an app cut into 4 for a group,  1 cup of posole as a mid entree sampler, then the Carlsbad is your oyster... for virgins get the enchantment platter.... the specials are always good too... I wont go on and on about every thing I eat there... 10 year non local veteran.  Nice people, great service, great food, strong drinks.... I have actually eaten lunch and dinner there without leaving.
Carlsbad, I love you.
