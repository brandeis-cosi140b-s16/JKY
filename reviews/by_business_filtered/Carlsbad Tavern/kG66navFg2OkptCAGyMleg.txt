Eh I have experienced better, but I felt the 2 star mark was a bit harsh. I wasn't really disappointed in anything in our experience, I think my issue mostly was the fire burning in my chest for an hour after dinner. Their food is spicy!

We were seated in the bar area, perfect because the Sunday night football game was on and we had a perfect seat to watch. We started off with a couple of bears and their crap cake appetizer. I enjoyed the crap, boyfriend thought it was bland, but he is from Michigan and has very high standards for crab, so we will ignore him. It came with a nice tossed salad and an extremely hot dipping sauce. If you like that sort of thing, awesome, if not you should stay away from the sauce. 

For dinner he got the roasted chicken with mac 'n' cheese, chicken was tasty and the mac 'n' cheese was to die for! I got the stacked enchiladas, subed green sauce for the red though, again their shit is spicy! The flavors of the meat were fantastic, however there is a lot going on with this place. I could only eat maybe a quarter of it. I would recomend both. 

They also have this burger on the menu that is pretty much 100% made out of hobenerros; mixed into the patty, on top of the patty and in a sauce on the burger. They even have a disclaimer on the menu stating "You order it, you own is." So not take backs. I witnessed a friend try to eat this once, it was so hot he just got made about it. Spitefully ate the whole thing those, I am pretty sure it gave him an ulcer or two. 

Over all good place, but I wouldn't venture back unless it was very convenient to my location and I was in the mood for some heart burn and breathing fire.
