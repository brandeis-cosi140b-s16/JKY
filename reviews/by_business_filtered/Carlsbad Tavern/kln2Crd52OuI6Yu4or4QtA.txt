Met up with 2 friends from the valley who had never heard of the place. Decor had a woodsy eclectic feel. Sat down and the bartender was a pompous ass. Just had an attitude the entire time. Screwed up my drink order and was for the most part inattentive. The food was the saving grace. I had the pork whatchamacallit and it was intensely delicious. Rice and beans were also equally excellent. Come to think of it, i coulda given it a 5 star meal if it wasn't for the arrogant bartender. Oh and if you haven't read, you have to pay for the chips and salsa.
