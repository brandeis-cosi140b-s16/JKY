Came into this joint and figured by the ratings, this place would be more than just mediocre. Bummer!

I came in at 11PM and I'm not sure if it was a bad time of day or what but when we walked in...nobody was there to greet us so we just sat in the bar area. Second bummer! This lady was super drunk yelling across the bar and obviously belligerent. The bartender didn't seem to care at all. This lady even spoke about how she was drinking and driving home. Say whattttt? Get a taxi! 

Anyways, food was mediocre as well. Nachos were just chicken, cheese, and meat. No green onion, no tomato, no guac. Give me some colors on my nachos! Service was nothing stupendous either and they charged my friend $3 for a ramekin of a measly scoop of guac. That was our last straw. I will admit their margaritas were killer though. That may have been the reason for my extra star.

Los siento, Carlsbad Tavern!
