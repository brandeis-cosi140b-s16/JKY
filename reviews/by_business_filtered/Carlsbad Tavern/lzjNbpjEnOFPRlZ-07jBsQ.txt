It took a lot of convincing, but we were able to talk the whole MSBL team into going here for dinner one night during the tournament. They complained up a storm about how it was 20 minutes away from where we were staying and some said they just wanted to lay around and do nothing. But, I just stood my ground and told them how great this place was and that they would like it. We made a reservation for 9 for the outside area. The guys were all late, figures. But they had a table for us and it was a gorgeous evening. They guys all got steaks, burgers, southwestern inspired dishes, etc. They ate like they had played all day in the sun. Ok, maybe they earned it. 

And after it all, they thanked me. They all loved it. The food was just as good. The outside setting was far better than inside the first time, and our servers kept up with this roudy crew.
