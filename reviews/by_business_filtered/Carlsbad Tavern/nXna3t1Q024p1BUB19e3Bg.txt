Expensive, but good.  Go for the ambiance, but stay for the food.  The patio is wonderful, it never got too hot even though it was the middle of the afternoon; but then again I didnt come in the middle of july when being outside is the equivalent of living in an oven.  If it gets too hot, just order another drink.  They come in a nice sized glass and are plenty strong.  Bring friends, drink a lot, and have a good time.
