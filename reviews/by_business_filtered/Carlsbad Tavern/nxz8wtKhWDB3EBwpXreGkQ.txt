The food was pretty good, though I think it's more accurate to say it is inspired by New Mexican food. They were definitely light on the chili, and it was alright. It didn't help that the item I ordered was supposed to have red chili, I ended up with green instead. I might be spoiled by restaurants back in NM, especially since they use lots of chili. The sopapillas weren't very good, they weren't as light add they would be in NM and they were to sweet. I would need a really good reason to go back here. Next time I want new Mexican food, I'll plan a trip back to NM.
