When we moved to Arizona, Carlsbad Tavern was one of the very first places we tried. And I have never returned. I drive by it from time to time and just wonder how it stays open. As other Yelpers have mentioned: they charge for chips and salsa, and neither are even remarkable (DON'T buy it). I thought the atmosphere was okay and welcoming for a casual place. 

Perhaps it was an off day, but the food and the service were quite poor. We went in for lunch on a Friday, and I had chicken quesadillas because I wasn't too hungry. My date ordered a green chili burrito. The only thing that saves this from being a one star in my mind was that the green chili was really tasty on the burrito. 

I would recommend trying something else in the valley before trying here.
