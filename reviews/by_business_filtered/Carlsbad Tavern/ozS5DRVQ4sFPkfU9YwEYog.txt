Came here for my birthday lunch. Food is good and ambiance is nice, but they could give a crap if it's your birthday. Believe me, don't need the song and dance, but when your table is clearly celebrating something, it seems like the polite thing to do to just say "happy birthday". 
Was a great day to sit on the patio, fountains were fountain-ing, and psrking's plentiflu/easy. 
Two of us had the Carl's Chicken Sandwich, which had a bunch of good flavors. Side salad was nicely put together and not just iceberg lettuce. The third person had the Southwest Patty Melt with fries--also very good. The tangerine margarita wasn't too bad. Prices vary between steep and reasonable. 
Will we go back? Meh...
