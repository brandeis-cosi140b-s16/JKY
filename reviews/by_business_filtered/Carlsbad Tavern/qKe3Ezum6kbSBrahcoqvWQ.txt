There should be a separate category for New Mexican food. The dishes might sound similar, but the flavors are different. They are proud of how hot they can be, but there is a brightness to the spiciness that is much more than just heat. Great flavorful food, served in HUGE portions. Seriously consider splitting full course dinners down the line so you can do appetizer, soup, salad, entree, sides and dessert, because it's all good!

Nice funky charming ambiance.
