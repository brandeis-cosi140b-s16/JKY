This is a great place that always serves up delicious food and drinks. When the weather is nice, I love to sit on the patio for the all-afternoon happy hour. The New Mexican pot stickers are very excellent and well worth trying. The rest of the food is well-prepared and flavorful, although  few dishes appear to be unique.

This place used to have a great selection of port, but no longer. The beers on tap are okay, but the margaritas are truly great.
