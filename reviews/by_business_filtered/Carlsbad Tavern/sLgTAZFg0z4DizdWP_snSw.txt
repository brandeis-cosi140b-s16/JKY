I have always been a big fan.  A frequent patron for 10+ years.   This weekend my father and I went for lunch;   the Carne Adovada was very good, however the Pozole was cool and fatty.   And the Tesuque salad was lacking dressing, and the chicken was bland.   Could be a hit if better prepared.   I will visit again.
