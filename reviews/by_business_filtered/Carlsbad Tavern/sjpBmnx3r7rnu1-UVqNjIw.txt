We were able to watch the sunset by sitting on the upper deck.  This extra perk was a great addition to our dinner.  I had the salad with jalapeno bacon and chicken, can't remember the name, but it was excellent.  My husband had the meatloaf.  

Our service was excellent and pleasant.  The little stream isn't the greatest, but the little fountains make a pleasant sound.  Great restaurant for the price and amount of food.
