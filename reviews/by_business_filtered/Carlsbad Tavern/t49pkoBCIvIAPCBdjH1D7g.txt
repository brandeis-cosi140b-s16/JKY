I am from NM and this place brings me home. The enchantment platter is unreal, also love the green chile stew, the sopapillas w/ honey. Osso Bucco is great. It's not officially "mexican" food, it's "NEW" Mexican food, but take my advice, next time you have what you think is a yearning for "mexican" food, just head straight over to this place instead. Great patio when the weather is nice.
