We hadn't been to Carlsbad Tavern in about a year, and we decided to go back last night.  I found the food on par with a former visits, but the service was very disappointing.  It was very difficult to get our server's attention with all of the tables he was managing.  I had to chase him down so we could place our order.  He forgot to deliver me my sour cream, but yet presented me a bill where I was charged.  I don't remember service ever being an issue in the past, so I certainly hope they can change this soon.
