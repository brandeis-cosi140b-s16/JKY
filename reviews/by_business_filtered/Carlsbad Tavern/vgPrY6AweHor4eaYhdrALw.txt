To the BAT CAVE!. We have our company's parties here and take potential clients from out of town to kick things up a notch. Great atmosphere and the food is really tasty. They use Pecan wood in their grill which makes a big difference. Start off with some grilled Tequila Shrimp and some grilled Carlsbad Brochettes. A few of my favorites are the Machacha and Tomatillo Chimichanga, the Carne Adovada Plate, and the very spicy Habanero Burger. Menu reads "Warning Hot! ... may cause temporary blindness or loss of hearing". I thoroughly enjoyed it and was sweating like a dog. More napkins please. They have a large amount of choices on the menu including their NM spin on the Reuben Sandwich, the Philly Cheese Steak, and the Chicken Sandwich. Don't forget some desert to cool things down a bit. Carmel Flan covered with Prickly Pear or Chocolate Grand Marnier sauce or the decadent Chocolate Bread Pudding covered with Butterscotch sauce. Touchdown for the team!
