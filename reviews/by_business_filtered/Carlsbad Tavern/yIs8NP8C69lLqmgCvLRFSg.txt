We were down from the Northwest visiting family in Scottsdale. I heard about this place from a burger joint back home. Although I love Mexican food, I had to try their burgers. I love spicy food, and the habanero burger caught my eye right away. The burger was delicious, the meat was well prepared. The only thing I was disappointed about was that it was not as hot as I expected, I have tried quite a few spicy burgers in my day. The fries and salad were excellent as well. My family members had cheese crisps and quesadillas, to which there were no complaints. I did not order a beverage from the bar, but it looked very spacious with a wide selection. The restaurant also features a good sized patio setting near a pleasant moat. Service was average, nothing special but no complaints.
