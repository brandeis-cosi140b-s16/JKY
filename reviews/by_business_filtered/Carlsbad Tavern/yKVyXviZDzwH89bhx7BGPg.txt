Def gotta check this place out. I was visiting and got lucky and was able to sit outisde on a October Night. Outside setup is pretty cool in the night time. I can see how it looks cheesy in the day time. 


Food: 

Mac & Cheese was excellent, and the green chile in the food was amazing. The stacked enchiladas was excellent as well. Food was a great temperature and flavor was well above par.
