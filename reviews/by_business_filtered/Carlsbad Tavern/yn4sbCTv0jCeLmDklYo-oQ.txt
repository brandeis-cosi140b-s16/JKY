If you haven't been before, you are sure missing out.  A staple in Old Town Scottsdale which is on my frequent list.  Atmosphere, Food and staff are all amazing.  Food has a nice kick to eat and I haven't eaten anything I didn't throughly enjoy.  The patio is a must for a nice Az day with a cold drink.  Everyone who works there is always so happy and friendly.  Once you go once, you will fall in love and become a regular...Enjoy!!!
