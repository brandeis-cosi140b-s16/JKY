I love coming to Carlsbad tavern , I work late, and they have a great late night happy hour and menu! That all being said, the MAIN reason any person in a twenty mile radius should wander into this fine establishment, is the wonderful bartender Liz. She is friendly, funny, and slings drinks like a pro! She is a true asset to the company and truly the best bartender in all of Phoenix!
