Went for supper with wife and 18 month old. We sat in the same kids section we always sit in which is perfect because little HJG can make noise and fit right in. The service was as good as usual and we got good food at good prices. They have good American fare and some good green chile. The french fries are sinful. The salads are a bit olde fashioned -shredded processed cheese on top? CT is also a good spot for happy hour and to watch sports and tip back suds.
