I came here once before and they had really good late night food so I thought I would try it again for dinner. But to be honest, it wasn't anything to be jazzed about and a little overpriced for how boring the food was. My dad had the rotisserie chicken which came with green chilli mac and cheese, but it didn't even have actual green chillies in it. I had blue corn enchiladas which were good, just not great.
