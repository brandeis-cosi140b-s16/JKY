Oh my goodness this was delicious. I am such a huge fan. The margaritas were probably one of the best I've ever had (and frozen which makes them even better). I loved loved loved the Prickly Pear margarita. My food order was so large that it was nearly impossible to finish even with a little help from my friends. I got the Carne Adovada plate and man was it good. The spiciness level was perfect and just enough to clear the sinuses. The flavor was full and complex. The rice and beans were solid (this is usually my indicator of good Mexican cuisine) but not anything so delicious that I felt compelled to eat them all.
The decorations were really cool and I liked how the menu was like a newspaper. I loved the outdoor fountain and sitting next to it under an umbrella on a hot Arizona day was close to paradise for the hour and a half we were there.
