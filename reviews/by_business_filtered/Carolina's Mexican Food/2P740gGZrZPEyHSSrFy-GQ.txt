Without a doubt the best Mexican food in Phoenix. Well...maybe not better than Rito's, but you can count on it being open a lot more! The majority of their menu items are the best in town. Can't go wrong with the Green Machaca...melts in your mouth. You'd be hard-pressed to find a better chicken taco. Anytime I'm close, I stop in for a bite to eat. A Phoenix must.
