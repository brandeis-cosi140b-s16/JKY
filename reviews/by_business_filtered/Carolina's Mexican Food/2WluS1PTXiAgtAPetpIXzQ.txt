Despite that the inside itself is a little rough around the edges I give them four stars because I've never ordered anything off the menu that wasn't delicious. It's a very casual place. I'm not sure I would even go as far as calling it a Resturuant, it's more so fast food type joint. So you can't expect all the bells and whistles. 

What you can expect is good food and who cares about the rest as long as your appetite is satisfied! It's a busy location so the staff is always trying to do their best at keeping up with the line and getting orders out. I've even used their catering on two separate occasions and was still very pleased. So if you want some authentic Mexican food, I doubt Carolina's will disappoint. They don't always have a crowd for nothing!
