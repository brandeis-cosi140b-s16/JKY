Let me start by saying apparently I have no friends in Phoenix...... No one told me of this gem until last weekend. I have been out here for 12 years! 

I am not a big fan of Mexican food, unless it is done right. Yeah I've slummed it at the Taco Bell and took a step up to the Del Taco & of course I have been to Macayo's. I have to say I am in love with Carolina's! 

I had the Machaca burrito with potato or should I say Pappas! To say I am a fan is an understatement. The tortilla's are the best I've ever had delicious! The machaca (shredded beef with chile's, tomatoes, onions & spices) was perfection. Not to spicy and lots of meat they don't hold back. It's so tender and juicy the best machaca I've ever had. 

OK so confession time I had one on Saturday and was back for another today and bought a half dozen tortilla's! Yum! 

They are closed on Sunday and this location closes early through the week. In regards to the Ghetto reviews, it may not be your side of town but if you think this is the ghetto you obviously have never been to the ghetto. 

Both times I have been here no one has bothered me or approached me. Which is more than I can say for other parts of town. Damn near every car in the lot and across the street were under 5 years old and high end. BMW, Mercedes, Navigators and so on. No one is worried about having their expensive cars there. 

About the decor, this is not a zagat sit down matradee type restaurant. This is a dive, a joint, a place to get great Mexican food on the fly. Yeah the spot needs paint, soap, water and decor. But I would rather not pay for that and get my cheap delicious Machaca burrito. I have eaten there and taken it to-go. I will be back!

Also the people were not rude to me they were busy as hell and very nice. I think some of the reviewers might want to come down from their ivory towers and enjoy some good food. Plain and simple. 

Carolina's is delish, I will be back and hope to see my fellow yelpers there!
