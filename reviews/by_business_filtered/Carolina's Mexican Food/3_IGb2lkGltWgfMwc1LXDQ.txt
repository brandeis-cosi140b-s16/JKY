Carolina's West is as every bit as good as the original Carolina's! Including the price for the amount of food you get, and you can actually find a parking spot at this location...

I was pleasantly surprised to discover that they had a west side location, especially after trying the original spot. I questioned myself if the food was really that good for how far I'd have to drive. The answer was a resounding YES, and I almost flipped a table over when I discovered Carolina's accommodated the west side! Yay!
