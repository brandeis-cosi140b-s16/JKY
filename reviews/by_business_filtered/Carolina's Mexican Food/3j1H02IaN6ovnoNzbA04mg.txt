After 4-5 visits since opening May 5th, I'm having trouble wanting to come back.  There are excessive delays in getting your food and a cluster of people standing at the side of the restaurant waiting for their orders too.  It's as if the location size (especially kitchen) can't handle the restaurant volume.

I've figured out that this place is more expensive than I thought because you simply can't fill up on just one item.  It's nice that the burrito is only $3.25 or so, but it's not enough for a hungry adult - add your tostada, chips/salsa, taco, soda pop, etc. and you're easily approaching $10.
