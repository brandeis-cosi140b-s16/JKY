You better know what you want by the time you reach the front of the line because this place operates like a hustle and bustle fast food joint where all the food is prepared to go even if you order it for here.  I dined in, but it was obvious that most of their business is to go.

Rather simple menu which is fine, and I thought the tostadas and bean & potato burro was pretty good, considering how simple these items are.  Potato was rather soft, refried beans were smooth, and tortilla was above average.  On the whole, it was very affordable, and it's always good to offer tortillas to go by the dozen.

I'm sorry folks but I'm just not feeling the butter tortilla.  Of course butter is probably good on anything, but this just didn't do it for me.

They could offer more substantial serving ware for those dining in.   You would think they would have served the tostada open faced for dining in, but it too was neatly packed up to go.

Table and floor cleanliness wasn't up to par either.  Maybe that's another of their ways of telling you to please just order to go?
