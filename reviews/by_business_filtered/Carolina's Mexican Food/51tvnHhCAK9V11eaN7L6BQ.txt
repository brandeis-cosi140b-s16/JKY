holy guacamole! i just got back from getting my burrito, i loved it so much i couldn't wait to review it. 

i got a machaca burrito. it comes w/ just cheese but i asked for beans as well. OMGosh! i took one bite and i was in love. seriously. i'm going to have a big problem b/c i am going to be craving these burritos and they're just too far away from my home :'( 

homeade torillas, shredded beef seasoned just right, refried beans and cheese. so simple but so good!!!!! i will be back before i go home that's for sure! yummy!
