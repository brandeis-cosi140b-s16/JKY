Yet another Mexican fast food place made popular by people with no taste buds or basic food knowledge. YAY! I should have knowk by the customer base to turn around and walk right back out the door instead of waiting in line. I need to learn to go with my gut more but no I thought I'd give it a chance and people kept annoying me about the tortillas here. They are giant thin and not even fully cooked tortilla's, so what's so good about them again!?!?! The menu here is pretty damn BORING!! Some basic ass Mexican fare which in some parts of the country none of these items even exist! Just a guess but maybe just maybe some of you were high before going up in this Carolina North!?!? 

My Ma had a green chile burro it was THE worst ever congrats!! It barely had any meat in it or green chile!!! That's right it was a "green chile" burro made with maybe a teaspoon of actual green chile the rest was basically gravy. Not the good kind either I mean a lot of flour and water mixed in to the sauce that it was not even green it was gray!! GROSS!! A gravy burro doesn't sound too appetizing now does it?!?! The green chile burro gets -1 star here people. 

I had the cheese enchiladas w rice and beans. The rice was quite edible not burnt or crunchy but surprisingly fresh tasting and moist. I would eat it again if I had too the beans were not bad either nothing spectacular. Last but not least the cheese enchiladas.....they were good, I ate them and I don't even like red enchilada sauce. 

Now if I was in the area of the original location I would probably give it another go for sure. This location not so much however there is a far better Mexican place up the road that serves way better options and ummm real Mexican food and I don't care if it's cheap here either.
