I eat here fairly regularly and have been doing so for years. It is not really what I would call pure authentic, but it is very good. I usually order the number 13 combo with taco, tostada, and a beef enchilada. The choriso breakfast burritos are really good also. This place is always very busy for lunch but we generally manage to get a table by the time our order is ready. If your going to do takeout call in your order so it will be ready when you get there.
This is THE place to go buy freshly made flour tortillas, you order them, they make them, and you get them nice and warm.
