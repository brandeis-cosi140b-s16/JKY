Carolina's is a diamond in the rough. 

The ambiance is sketchy yet homey at the same time. 

The foods is always tasty, I recommend any burrito, as they're huge and wrapped in homemade tortillas.

Remember to take home a bag of chips and/or tortillas! They're cheap and super fresh.

Four stars for never having carne asada and the weird salsa bar.
