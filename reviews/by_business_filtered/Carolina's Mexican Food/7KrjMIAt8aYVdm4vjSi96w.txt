When I lived and worked in Phoenix, I had my first experience at Carolina's as a lunch trip with a coworker. She told me that they had the best tortillas and was fast enough to fit in our lunch break.

I cannot tell you how delicious all their food is...flautas, enchiladas, combo plates, tacos. chimis, etc. Even though I'm back in Chicago, I dream about this place. I recommend it to my friends when they head to Phoenix area, and I hope that when I visit next, I have time to drive out for lunch.

The sauces are delicious and everything is homemade. They take pride in their food and are quick with the service. Delicioso!
