Raise your hand if you like authentic Mexican food....if you do, this is the spot. This place isn't much on the eyes, but your taste buds will probably spontaneously combust with enjoyment. 
If you're going durring lunch hours prepair to stand in line, and it'll probably be out the door. Apparently more, and more people are finding out about it. Dispite the line, it moves relatively fast. You can also call in your order before you get there too. Mine is speed dial 5 with the brail on it in case I go blind one day. 
While you're there, try a butter tortilla...Carolina's make they're own tortillas fresh.
