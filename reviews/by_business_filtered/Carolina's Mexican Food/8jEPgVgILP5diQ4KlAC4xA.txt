Is this location a total shithole?  Yes. It used to be a LAUNDROMAT...
Is the food amazing?  You bet your sweet patootie it is.  
Do I bring out of town guest to this location on purpose?  That would be an affirmative.

When I first went to Carolina's 4 years ago with coworkers for lunch, I thought "you people must be outta your damn mind."  But then I considered that one of my coworkers was nearly a septugenarian with a bad limp from a war injury, and I told myself to put on my big-girl panties and walk in.  And boy am I glad I did!

I've tried several things: tacos are awesome, the green machaca is amazing (frankly, it makes me happy in my pants it's so good), the Oaxaca special is great, the enchiladas are eh to me, but lots of people freak out over the sauce, so def try it.  

As many others have said, the proof of how good the food is in the tortillas.  When my boyfriend (still living out of town at the time) brought some of the tortillas home, his roomie joked that he could wallpaper his house with them.  They are big and beautiful.  Another thing to note, when I took my man here for the first time, there was a grandma-type coming in with two HUGE stock pots.  I figure, that has to be a good sign that it is worth it to her to hoof it in and out of that place for that much food.

Yes, 12th and Mohave is well, for lack of a better term (and I apologize for the un-PC-ness) is in the barrio.  But for some reason, the sketchiness adds to the experience.  It's always busy, not matter when you go, and ladies, there usually ARE hot firemen there on Fridays for lunch.  So go for a happy tummy and some eye-candy.

Truly, a can't-miss experience in Phoenix.
