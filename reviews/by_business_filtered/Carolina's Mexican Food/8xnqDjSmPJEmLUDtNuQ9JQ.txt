[4 Stars for the tortillas and the beans, 3 stars for the enchiladas]

Having heard about Carolina's for years and never making it down to try their food, I kind of had high expectations from friends, neighbors and reviews I was getting over the years.  In hind sight I kind of wish I had gone for a burrito (next time I visit I will do that) but I had been craving red chile enchiladas the day I went.  

Upon entering I knew not to expect anything fancy about the place, for me it's a non issue that does not even get factored into my evaluation. Knowing I wanted to try a couple of items I ordered a combo of Enchiladas, a crunchy taco with rice and beans, and  I also ordered a tortilla with cheese, to-go.   When I got in I dug into the enchiladas, mehhh they were ok, The sauce was definitely underwhelming (slightly disappointing).  After about 3 bites I decided to dig into the taco.  It was good.  The highlight of the take-away was the tortilla with cheese and the beans in the combo meal.  Oh my!! These were great.  I would go back over and over again for just these 3 things in their various forms.  

Yes I will go back but now I have a better idea of what I will try on the next round.
