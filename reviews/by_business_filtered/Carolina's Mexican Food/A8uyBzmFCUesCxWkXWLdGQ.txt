Almost as ghetto as the original, Carolina's (North [as we call it]) offers amazing and cheap Mexican food-the greasy, cheesy kind-and their tortillas are the best in town. Their signature (red) hot sauce is great, but not many people know you can get tasty green hot sauce or tastier pico for a small fee.
