After reading some less than flattering reviews of Carolina's, I thought I would come to the defense of this iconic Mexican restaurant in downtown Phoenix, named after the kind owner. You see, I was craving some good Mexican after this bowl of cheap ice cream I just had for dinner (don't ask), and harkened back to a time when I'd frequent Carolina's while working in Phoenix in the 90's. 

I think I have the bad reviews figured out, save for the gal whose rear end turned into a fire hose: The people were SCARED of the place, the area, everything. Yes, Carolina's is what you would call a dive, with a capital D. And, it is in the HOOD. I mean no disrespect by that, it's just what it is. When you consider the whole package- the neighborhood, the building, signage, interior, etc. it could definitely put some people off who are not used to such a thing. I mean, I understand, because I'm a guy, I'm not small, and the first time I went there I thought I'd be gunned down or kidnapped by MS-13 or something. Seriously, driving there I was aghast as I had never seen people in the US living in 40 year old, busted up cabover campers sitting on the dirt, with plywood shacks surrounding them. Not kidding.

But the food, the handmade flour tortillas, it's divine. When somebody cries that their soft taco just didn't hit the spot, I wonder WTF they were expecting. Maybe Taco Bell? How about get an imagination and order the Machaca Beef and Bean Burro and turn into an absolute wild animal because you can't eat it fast enough? That's what I'm talking about.
