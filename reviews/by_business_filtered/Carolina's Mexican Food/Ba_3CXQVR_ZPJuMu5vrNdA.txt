While the food is excellent and we won't stop getting it I can only give 1 star for a pretty petty policy they have.  While ordering 3 quarts of bean, 2 dozen tortillas and 12 tacos it's pretty obvious that I'm not going to eat it there.  When we ask for a container to put some hot sauce in the answer is we can sell you some if you want a larger container.  So off to the salsa station and fill up 10 or 15 of the little salsa cups and try to balance them going out the door.  You would think with an order like that and the amount it cost they would accommodate you with a container of salsa.  I guess when your food is that good and you are packed all the time you don't have to worry about customer service.
