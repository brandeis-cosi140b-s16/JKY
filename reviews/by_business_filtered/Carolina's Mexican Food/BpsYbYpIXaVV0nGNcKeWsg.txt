Yeah, it's borderline ghetto, but the authentic Mexican food makes it well worth venturing outside your comfort zone! All fresh & delicious!!! 

Definitely more of a lunch, than dinner, spot.  Carolina's is far from upscale. Think cafeteria style with styrofoam boxes & plastic ware. No cerveza or tequila here, either, but at these prices you can drink later!
