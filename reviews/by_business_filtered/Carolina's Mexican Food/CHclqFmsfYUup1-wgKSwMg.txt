I am and always will be a fan of Carolina's. I've been to the Original location at 12th St and Mohave and within my family that's my favorite location but my parents and one of my brother's prefers this Carolina's. I think it's because it's open later and the neigborhood doesn't look too risky plus it looks cleaner. 

Anywho, Carolina's just has really good Mexican food, I like their Chimichangas, their burros, and their tortillas. OH their tortillas is one of the best in the Phoenix area, and is comparable to the tortilla shops in south tucson. I always get a chicken chimi with the works, and i'm always content. I also get myself a cheese quesadilla because the melted cheese in their buttery fluffy tortillas are outta this world. *yum* 

The drive to this Carolinas might be farther for me but it's a great alternative to the original location if you find yourself in north phoenix. Oh plus you can have dinner over here since they close at 8:30 or 9.
