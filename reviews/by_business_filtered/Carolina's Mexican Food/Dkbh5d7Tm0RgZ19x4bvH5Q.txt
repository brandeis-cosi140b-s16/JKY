I live in San Diego, but over the 10 years I lived in PHX, I developed a serious LOVE for this place. Now, I have my family bring me a huge to-go order every time they come visit. I just got my most recent rations and am as in love as ever...and so full I can't move. 

This simply the best Mexican food I have ever had. Even when I lived in town, I would almost never eat at the restaurant. Instead, get a quart of machaca, beans, rice and of salsa and get a couple dozen tortillas and you are set.  A burrito with those ingredients is simply heaven on earth to me. 

Carolina's rocks!
