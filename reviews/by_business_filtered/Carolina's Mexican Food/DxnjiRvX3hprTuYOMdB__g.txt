A Christmas Eve tragedy! My husband purchased 1 dozen green corn tamales and a half dozen green chicken tamales for Christmas Eve. So here it is Christmas Eve and we just unpacked the order to discover we only have 11 green corn tamales -- no chicken tamales at all. Very very very bad! He said they were very disorganized when he was there, bad service. I will only go to the Cave Creek location from now on. Merry freaking Christmas!
