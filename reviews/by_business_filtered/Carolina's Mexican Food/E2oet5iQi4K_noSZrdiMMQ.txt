This is coming from a Hispanic woman very proud of her own home cooking. I make my own tortillas, beans, etc.. Consider the fact that I am a huge fan of my own cooking as you read this review. 

Normally, this is a pretty good joint. It's not bad if you're jonesing for a taco or some really good beans (and don't want to make it yourself). It is considerably tastier than any Filiberto's, and more authentic tasting than places like America's Taco shop. 

My faves are the butter-soaked tortillas, bean burritos, and chicken tacos. I keep it simple in simple joints. Today, unfortunately, it wasn't even close to as flavorful as it usually is. It wasn't worth the hour I put in at the gym afterwards. 

But hey! Normally it is worth a stop, especially if one is deprived of Mexican food at home.
