This is me and my wife's go to spot for when we can't think of what we want to eat...or are craving it so hard, both of these things happen often. 

First off their tortillas are the best in Phoenix. This is the only place I make sure to also pick up a buttered tortilla or cheese quesadilla just to make sure I'm getting extra tortilla action in my meal.

My favorite thing to get is the chimichanga combo, but I also love the beef tacos, enchiladas, and 3 way burritos. Oh also they recently started serving carne asada burritos and those are real delicious too! Actually I like everything they have, let's be real.
