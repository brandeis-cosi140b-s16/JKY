This place is great! Came here once for dinner and I was pleasantly surprised by how good my meal was. (I really wasn't expecting anything great due to the very mixed reviews). I got the chicken enchiladas combo. My SO was basically eating off my plate (he just got a chicken burro...I though it was pretty tasty too, great tortilla).  Dinner for 2 came to just over $11 bucks. So it's salty, greasy and carb loaded, but if you're eating at a fast food mexican restaurant, this is expected! Unfortunately, this is not very 'fast food' due to the number of patrons who frequent this place. Average wait for dinner is 25 to 30 minutes. Just call ahead and do take out. That's what I plan to do from now on.
