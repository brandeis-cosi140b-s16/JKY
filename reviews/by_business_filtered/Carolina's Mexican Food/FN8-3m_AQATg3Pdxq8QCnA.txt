The best machaca and flour tortillas anywhere!!!

I'm craving a machaca burrito as I write this.  Unfortunately, they don't deliver to Kentucky!  I spent 90 days in Phoenix last year and 'discovered' Carolinas.  From that point on, I ate there at least 4 times a week.  Everthing on their menu was good to outstanding.  

A caveat - this place is a total dive in a less than desirable part of the city.  But, it's close to downtown and my hotel.  When I departed, I brought back several dozen tortillas.
