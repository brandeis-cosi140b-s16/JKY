Phoenix is home to some good and cheap Mexican food. Carolina's is one of those places. I don't really come here for the tacos or burritos though. I come here for the godlike tortillas. That is the real draw of this place. I just flew back to Seattle with two dozen in my carry-on. They're seriously the size of your head.
