They do fantastic Mexican food for lunch, and they also do great breakfast burritos starting every morning at 7:00 am. It may not be located in the most convenient neighborhood, but it is well worth the drive to the southside to come here! (Just don't park across the street - the signs inside advise that you might get towed.)
