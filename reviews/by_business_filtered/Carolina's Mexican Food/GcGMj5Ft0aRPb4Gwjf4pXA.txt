I love their tortillas and their salsa. Their salsa has a strong garlic flavor and is unlike any other mex joint I have encountered in AZ. Carolina's has a very extensive and cheap menu; two people can easily eat for under $10. 

Watch out! Carolina's gets CRAZY during peak eatin' hours from its downtown cult following.
