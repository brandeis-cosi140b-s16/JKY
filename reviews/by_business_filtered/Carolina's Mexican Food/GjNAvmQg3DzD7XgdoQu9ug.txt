I luv this place. Yes, its a hole in the wall, in the ghetto. Who cares...yes, it is a little run down. So what. The red chile beef plate and burrito are scrumptious. Big chunks of meat, sauce is flavorful, not bland at all and not too spicey. I would recommend getting your burrito dbl wrapped, because it does fall apart. You can also buy their homemade, still warm, tortillas for $3 a dozen. I would eat here everyday if I could.
