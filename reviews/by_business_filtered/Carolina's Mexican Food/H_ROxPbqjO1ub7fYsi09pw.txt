If heaven were a Mexican restaurant, Carolina's would be that paradise. Seriously though daaaaaayum is this place tasty. I struggled to find truly delish Mexican food in Phoenix after moving here from Tucson, and after many disappointing visits to local restaurants after people raved about them, I was so glad that the recommendation for Carolina's paid off.

Their tortillas are the bomb. Soft and chewy and flavorful are only a few words to describe them (BOSS is another). Their salsa is amazing and they sell it by the pint and quart (praise da lord of Mexico). I also wanted to give a shout out to their beans. I usually forego beans at Mexican restaurants bc they are just mediocre BUT at Carolina's, these beans give me life. Like seriously, you guys, these beans are the shit. Well. Uh. I mean. Okay yeah whatever let's go with it. Anywho, their rice is also tasty. 

They have a large variety of options for combination plates, as well as individual items you can get with either machaca beef (shredded and amazing), diced beef, carne asada, or chicken. You can also get some things without meat. My personal fave is the machaca beef chimichanga. Unlike some of the restaurants up here, Carolina's does it right by NOT piling on enchilada sauce on top which defeats the whole frying purpose. Their hard tacos are also tasty. I've literally never had a bad meal at Carolina's. The only thing I wish is that they were open on Sundays. 

Carolina's FO LYFE. *drops mic*
