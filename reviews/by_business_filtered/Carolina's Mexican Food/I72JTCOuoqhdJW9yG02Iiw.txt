OMG!! May I pray upon the altar of Mexican food at Carolina's! I have been going to Carolina's since it was just a hole in the wall with no tables to sit at... It is amazing to see how much it has grown. We are huge fans of their burritos especially the Machaca Mix and the Oaxaca Special. We recently drove from SoCal to Phoenix and stayed overnight near downtown just so we could go to Carolina's for lunch! If you have not been here and are looking for the almighty of Mexican food then your search is over!
