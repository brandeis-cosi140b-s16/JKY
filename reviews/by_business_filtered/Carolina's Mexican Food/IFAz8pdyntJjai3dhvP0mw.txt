Go hungry! This place has THE BEST Mexican food in Arizona. Hands down. Yes, it is in a bad part of town. Yes the place looks like a total $#!% hole. But the food makes up for it 100000%. 

No matter what you order, I promise you will not be disappointed. However, if you do order a burrito, order it double-wrapped. And do yourself a favor and get a order of the fresh tortillas to go. Amazing! At $3/dozen you will not be sorry. 

I am torn on this one issue though....would I want this place to re-locate to a better area? Remodel to improve the atmosphere? I dont know...I feel like if they did it may get even more popular and then Id be annoyed.
