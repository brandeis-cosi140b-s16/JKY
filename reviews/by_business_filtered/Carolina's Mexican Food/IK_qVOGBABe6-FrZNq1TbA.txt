I was so disappointed with this place, since I have heard a lot of great things about it.  I normally give one stars to places that give horrendous service or the food made me sick and while this place did neither of these things the food was extremely bland.  I got the beef taco plates and the beef was so bland it tasted worse than a place like Filibertos.  Yes, the salsa was good, but tacos should not need salsa, it should only enhance them.  The beans also were overcooked and burned my wife's mouth.  Overall, I think this place is overrated and while not bad, it is comparable to getting food at Filiberto's.
