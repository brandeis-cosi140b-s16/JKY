I am shocked at how few people give this place five stars. Carolina's is the most authentic Mexican food you will find not on a taco truck. They make the tortillas by hand but they don't use lard so they are good but not like the real thing. The beef tacos are wonderful, the red chile burro, and the oaxaca special are my fav's. The 3 way burro is also great. If you are into chimi's they all rock. I read one review that said the food had no flavor, well I hate to think maybe that person was sick and lost his taste buds. I have never had bad food here, actually it is consistently delicious. I always get my food to go because the dining area is nasty. It is always so crowded and hard to find a spot clean enough for me to want to eat at.
