This place has some of the best chimichangas in Arizona.

I love how crappy the building is because it makes the food so much better. I think pretty much everyone I have ever taken to this place got nervous about what was about to happen at first glimpse of the building.

All have left happy to know the place existed and instant fans of the food.
