Carolina's is Mexico's preemptive answer to Americans who think Taco Bell is authentic Mexican food. It's tasty food served up with a side of beans in a building that under other circumstances would be better suited to an auto mechanic. But therein lies the charm. Carolina's seems to consciously embrace chaos by not having queues for customers to maintain an appropriate line and a menu that has seen better days (not to mention, some of the missing prices cause some confusion). It habitates in South Phoenix like a buoy in a hurricane, yet it fits and belongs and to perfectly complement the gritty reputation of its surroundings. 

When I used to work at 48th Street and Southern Ave, I would stop by here after calling in my order and treat my coworkers to the most amazing breakfast burritos this side of the border.
