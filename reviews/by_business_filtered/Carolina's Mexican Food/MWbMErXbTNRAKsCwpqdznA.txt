This it the place to get the best flour tortillas in town.  Huge, thin, and perfect for a snack in the car (while they are still warm from the griddle) and then my favorite quesadilla with the little containers of their hot sauce- with little seeds and lots of flavor.

You will be the perfect guest if you take tortillas on the plane to your host...and you will be the envy of the flight if you have lunch to go.
