Spent 3 years in Phoenix trying to find a good Mexican restaurant that reminded me of my hometown in California. Let's just say finding this hidden gems was as close as it gets. The outside of the restaurant is a bit run down and could scare potential customers away. However, that is what gives it great character and makes for a great  place to stop by. The food is amazing and the customer service is excellent. Would recommend to anybody looking for authentic Mexican food.
