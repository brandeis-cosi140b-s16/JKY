I love this place!!!! OK it's not a place you actually want to dine in at but the food is so f'n good, just order and leave. I have had most things on the menu (no menudo though) but my fave is the machaca burros and crunchy tacos with a half dozen of the 1oz salsa cups. And after filling up on this I snuggle up to a dozen of warm fresh giant tortilla's (still in the wrappings of course). I like to order a quart of the machaca for later consumption in burro's, over rice, with eggs, my list could go on. 

You would think with the mounds of money they have to be making from the constant lines of people they would do some upgrades to the place. Oh well, keep the food great and we will keep coming.
