1st time here today. The food is one step above Filiburto's... It's pretty good but by no means great! The price is pretty low but the portions are really small so the overall value is only fair. The staff was knowledgeable but not friendly. Food came out in a timely manner. 
IDK I guess over all my sock were not blown off. 
I wasn't bad... it just wasn't great...
