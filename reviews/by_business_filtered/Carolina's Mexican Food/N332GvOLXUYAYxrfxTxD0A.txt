I am tempted to give 5 stars because they have good prices. In terms of food I'd say that their tortillas are good it's what makes their burritos worth eating. Their machaca burrito was good, their red chili burrito was good, but I wasn't a fan of the green chili burrito. 

I can't recall ever having a green chili burrito that was as gelatinous, it was almost like a gravy which in itself isn't bad - but is when it's more gravy than meat. I'd say it's more of a gravy burrito then green chili burrito. My idea of green chili burrito is one you'd get at St. Mary's tortilla factory in Tucson (which also has way better red chili burritos too lol but I digress).

All I've eaten are the burritos here which I would say overall are good. While their prices are good it's not mega cheap...just cheap..because I eat quite a bit and I need 2 burritos to make a dent while in Tucson I can go to BK's and get full off one and it's about the same price. But still it's priced very reasonably (I lived in california for a bit and I'd say these sized burritos would be like 6 bucks while a burrito like one at BKs might be 9.50)

I shall update when I have the litmus test - carne asada. I don't expect it to be as good as BKs because I don't smell mesquite grilling the meat but maybe they use good spices - keeping an open mind lol.
