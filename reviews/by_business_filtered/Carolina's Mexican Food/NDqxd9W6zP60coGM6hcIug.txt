I have always been a fan of Carolina's, but the drawback was the original location was far from my home.  Now with Carolina's north I can take care of my cravings more often.  I am a creature of habit with Mexican food, its either chimichangas or burritos which are always wonderful. I have ordered take out when family comes to visit and everyone is always delighted with the food.  The venue itself is very casual and friendly. The only drawback is they are closed on Sunday, but then even the best have to rest
