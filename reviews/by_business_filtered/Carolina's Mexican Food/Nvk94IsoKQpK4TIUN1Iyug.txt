I really love this place. The mixed burrito is excellent and really reasonably priced. If you love Mexican food, you need to come here. While the food is some of the best in Phoenix, there are a few things that keeps this place from being 5 stars: 1. It looks like your car will be broken into if you are not in the (small) parking lot; 2. The garbage cans are always overflowing... do they ever take the trash out?; 3. There is next to no seating; and 4. Definitely sat near a gang member getting lunch who stared my friends down during lunch. (don't see too many people at other Phoenix restaurants with "South Side" tattooed on the back of their head and neck.)
