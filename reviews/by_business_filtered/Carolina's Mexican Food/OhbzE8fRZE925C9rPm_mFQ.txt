If you want to find a "real authentic" restaurant that's been in Arizona since 1968 then Carolina's is where you want to be. The neighborhood is  run down and you might not want to walk around there at night.  Saturday afternoon for lunch is pretty cool..  If you don't mind the bullet holes in the windows.   If you like the ambiance of a mess hall with grungy concrete floors.   No pictures of anything on the walls.   And you don't get turned off by this.   If you want  to take a date here, don't.     Personally, we love to try places in the heart of a Mexican neighborhood because you get the real deal.  The real folks who come to this Phoenix institution, however there are quite a few gringos like us.     As soon as you get your order you will find the food is oh so good.  You know you are in the right place.  You order at a counter and can see into the kitchen.  There must have been 20 ladies making homemade chips and tortillas.  The prices are really great and they have a rather basic menu.  I had the chicken enchilladas which were wonderful.  Usually, I get the green sauce but I forgot to mention that and so it was the red sauce which was incredibly good.  Hubby had the enchilladas with beef and it was equally as good.  Going to Carolina's is not just for the food.  It is the whole experience which you get upon entering it.  I took home some home made tortillas.  They are without a doubt the best ones I've had.  You can get lots of food by the dozen, but being I live in Tucson it is too far to have them make the trip back home.  Besides I would have nibbled on them going home.  So all in all, if you can deal with the ambiance of the place and just want some "down home" Mexican cooking, by all means give Carolina's a try.
