I have eaten at the origin location for years...So, I was excited when they opened one on the West side of town. The first time we went the food was just as wonderful as the original location. We recently came back from a long trip away from home and was looking forward to some good Mexican food. We ordered enchiladas a side of beans...the beans were wonderful, but the enchiladas were horrible. They used to put them into a metal container and serve them smothered in enchilada sauce and melted cheese. I don't know if they were out of these containers or just trying something new but they served the enchiladas cold in a Styrofoam container. The cheese was unmelted, cold and really ruined our meal.
