Agree with everyone else its definately a hole in the wall. The inside is very institutionalized. I feel like I am at a prison or something with old mcdonalds tables.

6 of us went we all had something different. The size of the food is good. Its not like huge amounts. You order a chimmy you get a chimmy and thats it. After seeing their tortillas you could buy I assumed these burritos would be huge! But not so much. A few of the ladies we were with were not very comfortable being there.

I would definately go back if there was someone looking for an authentic place to eat. Its the real deal.
