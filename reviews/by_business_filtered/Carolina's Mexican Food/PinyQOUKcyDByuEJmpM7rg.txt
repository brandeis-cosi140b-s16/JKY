Carolina's is at the corner of Cactus and Cave Creek Road with its own parking lot that was easy to navigate and find a spot in.  Walking inside it became obvious that this place is a local hot spot since it was packed!  

To order you go to the cashier at the front counter and pick either individual items or a meal combo.  The cashier was helpful in recommending menu items and was nice enough to suggest a combo deal for us that was cheaper than the meal we had pieced together ourselves.  

I had the #15 - three flautas with a side of rice and beans with a taco added on (hard shell).  My fiancee had the two taco meal with rice and beans.  The rice and beans were very tasty, which we have had a hard time finding since our move to the Valley.  The taco fillings were good (shredded beef, cheese, lettuce, etc.) but the taco shell itself was oddly greasy and tough to eat.  On his last taco, my fiancee actually just pulled out the filling pieces and ate them without the shell.  

The place itself wasn't the most organized and cleanest, but in their defense we went at dinner time and it was very busy.  There were a fair amount of people taking to go orders, which we may do if we venture here again.  

Overall: B-  
Suggestions?  Try the soft taco instead of the hard shells and I don't recommend the flautas since they were a touch burnt and there is WAY more shell to filling ratio on those - so not quiet as yummy.
