Cheap, fast, and tasty.  The potato and egg burrito is awesome for breakfast. It's light and fresh not greasy and rubbery.   Had a few other items here before, the tamale was good but messy and not put together very well. The tortillas are very good, but I hear they're "authentic" and made with butter/lard or something like that.

Good breakfast or lunch spot. The inside is pretty big and cafeteria style looking.
