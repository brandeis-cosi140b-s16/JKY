The two tacos with rice and beans is my ultimate go-to food here. This location is a little far away from my home so we don't come here frequently. But I LOOVE the tacos. The tortillas are excellent as well. A local favorite, which can be seen for itself during lunch hours. The inside is not the most visually appealing (the walls are a bit cracked and don't get me started on the floor...) and there are only a few tables. This place is more ideal for takeout.
