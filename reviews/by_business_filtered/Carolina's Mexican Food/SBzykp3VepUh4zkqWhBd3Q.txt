While I love all kinds of food Mexican is not normally my first choice. After hearing so many great things about this place for years I was finally able to check it out.

My dining partner and I shared the two beef enchilada combo, a beef tamale and a cheese crisp. The tamala was very mediocre. However, the enchiladas and cheese crisp were delicious!

If you're in the area around lunch time this is a must try (if you are able to forgo the opportunity to eat at Lo Lo's.)  Although be forewarned - the lunch rush is pretty crazy and it may be difficult to find an open seat, but it's worth the try!
