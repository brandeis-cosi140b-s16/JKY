I think I'm in trouble. A Carolina's 5 minutes from my office in Peoria. I didn't realize this was the same Carolina's as the restaurant in Downtown Phoenix until this week, so I introduced the delicious, affordable, Mexican fare to my coworker. 

Compared to their original Phoenix location, this location is much more comfortable and clean. Although I appreciate the "taco stand" feel of the Phoenix location, the West restaurant is newer, cleaner, and a bit more welcoming. 

I overdid it on the ordering. I over-ordered. I was so excited I couldn't help it! I tried the green corn tamale, a chicken enchilada, and a soft chicken taco. I ate half of everything and was stuffed and saved the rest for dinner. I enjoyed the tamale the most. The size was good too - I'm sure most would say it was a bit on the small size, but I liked that it wasn't huge. My coworker ordered the chips to start and they were awesome. The salsa isn't chunky, but it's spicy and delicious. 

What else can I say?! Good cheap, fast, authentic Mexican food. If you're looking for a light, low-cal lunch, this isn't it. 

I have to mention the tortillas. I ordered a dozen to take home. I didn't realize they were close to 18" in diameter. I sure hope they freeze well. Carolina's claims they have the best tortillas - and I agree. 

The only things I didn't care too much for is the excessive amount of Styrofoam used and the fact that my hair smelled like corn tortillas the rest of the day. :)  

Simple, delicious, authentic. Carolina's will not disappoint.
