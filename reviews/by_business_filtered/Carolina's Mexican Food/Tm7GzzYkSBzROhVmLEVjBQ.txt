I lived in the Phoenix area for nearly 4 years, but now I am back home in Boston.  People usually ask me if I miss Phoenix, and the truth is that I don't.  However, one thing about Phoenix that I do miss is the real MEXICAN FOOD.  I only ate at Carolina's once, but I still remember it being some of the best Mexican food I have ever had.  Make sure you get here early for lunch because this place gets packed!
