Carolina's was the first stop we made in Phoenix. After a 6 hour long drive, we were in the mood for some Mexican so Carolina's seemed like a good idea. After getting off the freeway, I was a little confused on where this little Mexican joint was located. We were passing by random houses in a questionable neighborhood before we finally found it. Now, if this place isn't a dive, I don't know what is. The building reminded me of the old, rundown ones in LA, except this place was in the middle of desert. 

We walked in and got some weird stare downs from locals. I guess we stuck out like a sore thumb in this neck of the woods. The restaurant reminds me of an old-school cafeteria. The tables/booths were are like ones from the 70's. You might know what I'm talking about, some old donut shops still have them. Our plan was to just eat a little bit because we had dinner plans a little later that night. We decided to get 2 tacos and an enchilada with a side of chips. Although Mexican isn't anywhere close to my favorite type of food, I thought the food here was lacking compared to all its' rave reviews. Even my boyfriend who loves Mexican food thought it was just alright. Unfortunately we didn't get to try their tortillas that they're famous for. 

I don't know if Carolina's can beat the Mexican in SD. That's a tough call, but I can see how Carolina's would be a good spot if you're just in the mood for Mexican or maybe if it's late and you're piss drunk.
