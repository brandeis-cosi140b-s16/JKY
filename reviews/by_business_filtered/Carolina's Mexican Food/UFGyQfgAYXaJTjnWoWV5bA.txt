3 way burrito ($3.25).. not only is the name a whole lot of fun but it tastes awesome! Red chile, green chile and beans wrapped in one of their killer tortillas.. smooth, tender, creamy and delicious. Make it a foot long ($.90)and now were talking! Pair it up with their salsa and you're in for some great Mexican goodness!

I mentioned the tortillas but I REALLY need to mention them again, they are fucking kick ass! Stretchy while tender with a slightly smokey char taste, this is about as perfect as a tortilla can get. Because they were so messed up with our order the manager gave us a free dozen.. they were just made too, hot and steamy in the plastic bag. I couldn't wait and ate one immediately.. my gawd, great Mexican experience. 

I love you Carolina, will you marry me?
