I was so upset about this place that I had to write my first review today.  I went to Carolinas today and placed my order.  I waited for about 15-20 minutes.  People who ordered after me started to get their food.  So I went up to the counter to the lady calling out numbers and giving the food to the people.  She couldn't find my order.  She was starting to tell the cooks to make my order but at this point I asked for my receipt back because I wanted my money back.  The girl said without being apologetic that I needed to go over to where I ordered to get my money back.  So I went back to the guy who took the order and asked for my money back.  He didn't ask what happened just opened the cash register and handed me money.  No apologies from anybody or acknowledgment of the fact that we waited and had no food. 
I think this place has okay food but I will never go back because this food isn't SO great that I need to deal with the service that doesn't care about keeping customers happy. 
There are much better places that I don't fear food poisoning from that are really nice to their customers.  I say the previous sentence because people who have been the place know that it isn't the nicest place.  In fact, it is the worst looking place that I have ever seen.  I can't believe I've eaten here in the past due to the way it looks.
