Great food, terrible dining room.  

Carolina's has excellent, cheap and very filling food.  Their Carne asada is done right and flavorful and their tamales are the best readily available options in an area saturated with fast Mexican food.  The interior of this place looks exactly how you would expect a place that churns our a ton of delicious and super cheap food.  It's packed and dirty.  I'd almost suggest they give up on trying to keep everything clean themselves and just leave out a bucket full of bleach water for everyone to use.  Maybe someone with some crazy OCD would wander in every so often and wipe the tables down.  

I suggest you call ahead. The lines can get long and there's a separate register for people who called where the food is distributed away from where the masses order.
