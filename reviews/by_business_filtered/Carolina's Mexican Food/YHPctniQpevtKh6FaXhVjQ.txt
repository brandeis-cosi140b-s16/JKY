Delicioso!  I LOVE mexican breakfast food.  Carolinas is not only for breakfast (their tamales are to die for too) but breakfast is what I can most accurately RAVE about at Carolinas.  Get the MACHACA!  Delicous beef 'ish' meat wrapped in homemade tortillas... still warm and stretchy! 

I finally physically went to Carolina's today and its great and to the point.  Order at the counter and its ready for you in a split second.  They have AWESOME SALSA in the 'eating area' to smother your machaca etc. with.   So yummy.  

Its quite busy inside which is a fair representation of how scrumptious Carolina's is!  A true mexican food gem downtown.... which is nice to actually find because there are SO many choices... but CHOOSE CAROLINAS! :)
