How anybody can complain about the food or service at this place makes me wonder about their sincerity. The joint across the street is ALWAYS empty so they may be a complainer. Not only is the food some of the best mexican at a fast food place (not a pick up but made to order) so you should expect to wait a while. As for the service, have you ever thought that you get what you give?. Try a smile and a pleasantry instead of grouching. We have been going to Peoria,s Carolinas since they opened and only once have I seen a male at the cash registers, it is always girls. I have never heard anyone be rude or abrasive to a customer. It makes a person wonder what the complainers expect, if you want waiter service, do you go to McDonalds?
