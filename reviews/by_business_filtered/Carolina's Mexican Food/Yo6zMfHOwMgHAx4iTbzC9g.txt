I've heard a lot about this place over the ten years I've lived in the valley. I've always wanted to try it and see what all the fuss is about. I've heard several times that they have the best Mexican food in the valley. 

I went for lunch during the week and ordered a green chile burrito and a red tamale. The burrito was runny and soggy and the inside was almost like a can if Dinty Moore, the tamale was dry, very little meat, too much masa and didn't taste very good. It was a complete let down after hearing so much over the years and I would say that any local Filabertos has better food after my first visit. I'll give it another shot and that might change my review some.

The other reviews mention it's legacy and the dive location so I'll let them cover that as well as the butter tortillas.
