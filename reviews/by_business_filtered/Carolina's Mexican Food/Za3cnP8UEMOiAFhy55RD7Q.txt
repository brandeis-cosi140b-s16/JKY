Yes it is a dive but it is some of the best Mexican food I have tried. It's not "authentic" in a LA food truck or tacqueria way, but more like your Mexican grandmother's kitchen (if you had a Mexican grandmother).  I think they put crack in the tortillas; usually the tortillas are just a vessel/carrying case for tastiness, but the tortillas here are amazing. The stuff inside is great too and the hot sauce is typical Mexican. Thumbs up!  Especially the Machaca.
