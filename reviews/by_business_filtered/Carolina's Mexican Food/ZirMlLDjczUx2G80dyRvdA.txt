You want truly authentic beef machaca with heavenly homemade tortillas, then you have come to the right place, they have original taco bell chairs from the 70's. The interior looks like a old abandoned school cafeteria, but never mind that the food is out of this world! I wish I lived closer to this gem! I tried their cactus location and it does not even compare to the south phx location on Mohave. Staff is ultra friendly.....they run a tight ship!
