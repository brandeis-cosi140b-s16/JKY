If I moved away from Phoenix, this would be one of the first places I would go to eat when visiting home.  The beef tacos are greasy but delicious, the chips & salsa are addicting.  Buy some extra sauce if you love salsa like I do.  The nice thing is they usually give a healthy amount with to-go orders.

The eating area isn't the best but I never mind.  I wouldn't go there for a healthy eating or a nice dining experience.  Just great mexican food!
