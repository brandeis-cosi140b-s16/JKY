I've been going to Carolinas since I was in nursing school, nearly 10 years ago. The prices have increased over the years, but the quality of food has never changed. It's the best Mexican food restaurant in the entire southwest! Keep it up! Everything is made from scratch. Just like grandmas cooking!
