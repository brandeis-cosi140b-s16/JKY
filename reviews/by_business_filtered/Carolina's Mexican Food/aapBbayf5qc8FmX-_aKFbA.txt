We spent Easter in Arizona for the first time and all the natives suggested we try the burros at Carolinas.  The woman at the front was super friendly with the tourists from SF with the questions.  The place was clean and packed (Tuesday at 1pm) but it was  fast service.  We ordered three burros (3 way, green and red I think), two soft and two hard tacos (chicken). The burros were SUPER GOOD and my kids loved the tacos.  We ordered a dozen tortillas to take home - we were not disappointed! The prices were so reasonable...I wish Carolina's opened up in San Francisco....I miss it already...
