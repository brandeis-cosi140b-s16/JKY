Good food - horrible service. I have been a loyal customer for the last 15 years. Their food has consistently been good but the service has been deteriorating. The last 6 times that I have placed an order for an event, my order has not been ready by the time I was told. Recently, we ordered dozens of tamales about 5 hours in advance. We arrived and they had forgotten about our order once again. The women at the front, didn't seem to care and never apologized. Half hour later, we were still waiting. We had to cancel the order and called Comedor Guadalajara right down the street. They were amazing and saved the day. I shared this story with many people at the event and it was recommended that I write a Yelp review. It's with great regret that I say I will not go back to Carolinas again.
