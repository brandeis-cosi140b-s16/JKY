Dicey to review a mexican food stop in Phoenix.  It's like trying to determine the best painting by Andy Warhol - subjective all the way and chances are you will find plenty of people who think his work is crap.

Authentic?  who the hell knows?  

For me, I found a menu item I love and can eat it all day long here.  Have tried to recreate the taste at other establishments and haven't for twice the price or more.  

So, Carolina's serves a purpose for me.  An infrequent indulgence of my favorite burrito and consistently prepared.

Peace
