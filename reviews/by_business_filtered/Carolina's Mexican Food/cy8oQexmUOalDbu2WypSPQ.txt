Dirty little hole in the wall. Excellent food all the time. Tortilla's rock. I get a bag every time I go. Machaca, enchiladas are all great. Nothing is bad here. May be bad for you but just excellent mexican food. 
As Shelby A. Says:
"If you want Mexican food that tastes like it was bought off of a street vendor in Piedras Negras, then this is your place."

YES IT IS!!!!!! Thats exactly what I want!! That is the best kind of Mexican food!! There is nothing better than street vendors!!! This is nothing like that at all but it is damn good!!
