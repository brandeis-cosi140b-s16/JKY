This location is in the hood but I don't care. I will go anywhere for Carolina's tacos! I don't know what they do to the tacos here but they are like crack. I could eat them everyday! With rice and beans and a side of sour cream. I can't get myself to order anything else. This Mexican food joint lives up to the hype.
