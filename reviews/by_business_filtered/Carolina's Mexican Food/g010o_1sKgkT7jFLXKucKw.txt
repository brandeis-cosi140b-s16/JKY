They have the worst customer service and organization.  Called ahead for order.  Arrived and paid for it said they would call me when ready, assuming few minutes.  Fifteen minutes later people coming in and ordering after I paid got there food.  When I could get someone's attention and asked about my order it was just sitting there.  No apologies or anything.  40 minutes even after calling ahead is bad.  This is not the first time but will be the last.....
