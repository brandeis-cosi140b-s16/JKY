Stopped in for lunch on Saturday just before noon. It was busy as usual but not too bad. I had a green corn tamale and my hubby had a #3 combo that included a taco, tostada and enchilada with rice and beans. 

There is limited seating so while I was in line he went and found us a seat. It took quite a while for our food to come out. My tamale was good although there was more masa than meat. It did have good flavor though. Hubby really liked everything except the red sauce on the enchilada. It almost tasted like someone dumped a bunch of red chili in the pot and didn't finish cooking it. I would definitely not order anything with that sauce on it again. The beans and rice were very good.
