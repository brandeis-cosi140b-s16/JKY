Great yelp find again! This is a must go to place once you land in PHX and before you depart as well.
The tortillas are awesome/piping hot fresh and the food was better than most mexican places I normally go to in Cali. free refills on all drinks even the mexican drinks. Try the machaca plate or the chimichanga.
