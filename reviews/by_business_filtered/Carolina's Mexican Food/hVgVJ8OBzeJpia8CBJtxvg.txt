Delicious!

I have never been to the Carolina's downtown, so this was my first experience with the place. I had some friends raving about their tortillas and talking about how they are the only ones they will use anymore, so of course my interest was peaked.  This combined with all the rave reviews and me and the husband decided to take the short trip this past Wednesday.

The locations was clean, and the employees were polite. The menu is extensive so I caved and went with the number 9 since it had rave reviews in a previous review. The beans and rice were very tasty and the tacos tasted better than any other "taco stand" joint I have been to and best of all were not loaded with grease. The tortillas used in the tacos were thin and crunchy and boy did the NOT skip on the cheese. The husband ordered a chimichunga and he was pleased to find out  that it was only chicken inside (he has texture issues with onions and chilis) and he was over the moon with the "non chunky" salsa with a good kick to it. We tried a cheese tortilla (once again not super greasy at all) and a buttered tortilla. Next time we would do either a cheese tortilla or the chips, not both. We really did end up over ordering but for under $20 and lunch for the hubs the next day we really couldn't complain.

We will be back, soon I hope. This is definitely on the guilty pleasure list.
