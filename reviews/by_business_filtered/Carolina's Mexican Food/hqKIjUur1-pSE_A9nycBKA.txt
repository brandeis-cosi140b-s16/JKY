Look just because the place is in the ghetto doesn't mean it is going to be automatically good. I grew up a couple of miles from here and we have been coming here for ages. The rice and beans are decent but not the most awesome thing I have ever eaten.

Let's just say everything is decent but it's not the greatest most flavorful mexican food there is. The enchilada sauce is mediocre, and the beef is so so. I will say the tortillas are great, huge and flavorful. We usually pick up a package on our way out. The place is a dive/dump but what do you expect?
