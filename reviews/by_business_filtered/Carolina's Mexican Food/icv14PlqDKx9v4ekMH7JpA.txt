4 stars only because of the flies :/ but other than that they get 5 for the food mmm we love Mexican food being from Los Angeles it's hard to find good Mex food like home it's on every corner so when we traveled to Phoenix about 3 yrs ago we came across this place wow I'm so glad we did it is deliciousssss and homemade tortillas is always a plus so now I get a chance to yelp about it;) so were in town can't wait to hit this place again
