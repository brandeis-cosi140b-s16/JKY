I never actually went into the restaurant. 
My friend, who's been telling me about Carolina's for years, brought over some take-out the other day.

Prefacing our wolfing session, he informed me the meal might not be the greatest, but how the tortillas were the absolute bomb.
He said they were the best in the valley, and how when he was in line to pickup the order, several people were there for only tortillas.

Everything he said was accurate.
My red chile was ok, nothing special. Refried beans, above average. 
The tortillas?

Unbelievable.
Growing up in south Phoenix, and having a plethora of Hispanic friends whose mom's all made homemade tortillas, Carolina's took me back to those happy days when mom sent me out into the hood looking for my father every weekend.

I almost always found him at the Granillo residence, slurping menudo, drinking beer and eating Mrs Granillo's tortillas, which were the best in the hood.
Carolinas reminded me of Mrs Granillo, my dad, and my mother yelling at him for coming home drunk. That is until he whipped out some of Mrs Granillo's tortillas, then she lost her mind and all was forgiven.

If you go to Carolinas, order a dozen flour tortillas, and eat one or two.
Then go out clubbing and get sloppy drunk.
When your wife presses for where you've been all night, whip out the tortillas.
They'll save your bacon.
I know this first-hand.
