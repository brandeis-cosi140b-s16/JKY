The food is very tasty. It has a distinct flavor that is unique to Carolina's. Often I'll find myself craving their food. The menu is simple. I can choose from variations of burros, chimichangas, or pick from their combination list. The real attraction is the speed of service - they're fast. You can see them hustling.

The dining area is ample. It's definitely not a fancy place, but it's great for a breakfast burro or lunch.
