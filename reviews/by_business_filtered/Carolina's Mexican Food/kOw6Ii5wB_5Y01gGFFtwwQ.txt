I was in the area today at lunch time and decided to stop in to try the food I have read rave reviews about. I arrived just after noon and the place was pretty busy. The line to order reached all the way to the door. The food smelled delicious and made my tummy growl with anticipation. It is always hard to decide what to try first when trying a new restaurant. I went with the enchalada & tamale combo. The wait was pretty short for as busy as it was and the price was right. 
I liked the enchalada, the tamale was great but I wasn't wild about the red sauce over everything. The rice and beans were amazing! I wish I would have ordered a couple flour tortillas to go with my meal and I will be returning to give them a try. The burritos people were eating around me looked amazing as well.
