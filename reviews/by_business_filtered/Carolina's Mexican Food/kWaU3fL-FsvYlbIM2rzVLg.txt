If the reviews were based strictly on food, Carolina's would get 5 stars. My brother and his family took us there for the "best Mexican food in Phoenix". I wouldn't have gone if it wasn't for my family's experience there. It's in a sketchy neighborhood and looks really run down, but looks can be deceiving. The food was amazing!
