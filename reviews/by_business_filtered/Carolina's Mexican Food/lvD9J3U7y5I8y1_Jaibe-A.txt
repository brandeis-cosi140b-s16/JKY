The food is pretty cheap and is one of the best places to get a quick Mexican food meal  in Phoenix.  I wouldn't say anything stands out with so many Mexican food places to eat in the Valley. It is mentioned in a few reviews that they are terribly slow at getting even the simplest orders out but, if you do decide to go and eat-in I would let the cashier know that you are taking it to-go.  They get those orders out faster than the dine-in orders.
