While the food taste great, the way the restaraunt is operated is a bit confusing.  You have to stand in line to place your order, then wait around to pick it up.  Not wise for a "other than fast food" type establishment.  On this visit there were maybe 8-10 people standing around waiting, our group of 7 occupied seats so we didn't interfere with those eating.  

Maybe a revamp is needed to provide an area for those waiting for their meals.
