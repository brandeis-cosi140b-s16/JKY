This place is scary on the outside, dilapidated on the inside, but 100% good food. I stop here every time I am in the neighborhood. Good taco's, Enchiladas, and burritos. Service can be slow as they are almost always busy.

Make sure you get a dozen tortillas to go. You will never find better and fresher tortillas than here.

Seriously though. fix the place up.
