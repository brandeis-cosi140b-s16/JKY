Carolina's has some really good food.  My favorite is #16 which is the Chimichanga (I get mine with machaca beef) with rice and beans.  LOVE this, it is really good.  The beef is amazing, the rice is really good and so is the beans.  They are famous for their flour tortillas which I find to be just ok.  Then again I woke up every morning to that wonderful scent of homemade flour tortillas...my Grandma in the kitchen making her flour tortillas from scratch. Carolina's are ok, too big...amazing flour tortillas is not about the size is how they are made and what they are made of.  I did buy a dozen to take home and see how they would um "hold" up, they didn't...they got ROCK hard fast.  And who has a comal that big to accommodate a flour tortilla that big? I always come back though for their Machaca beef burritos and the #16. Oh and let me say this one other thing, I ALWAYS order cheese inside my Chimi, they NEVER put cheese inside, NEVER! I know they put some cheese on top, but even when I have asked them to put some inside as well...they don't! So don't bother asking.
