I heard so much about this place and thought I was about to have the experience of a lifetime. I had cheese enchiladas and took home a dozen tortillas. I wasn't impressed by either. The enchiladas were bland and the cheese looked like store bought shredded cheddar (it wasn't even elted all the way). The tortillas were pretty dry even though they were still warm when I bought them. I won't be going back.
