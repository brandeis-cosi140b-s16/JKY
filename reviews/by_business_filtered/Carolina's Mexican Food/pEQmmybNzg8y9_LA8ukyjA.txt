I'm from South Texas where Mexican food flows like rivers of milk and honey. Been living in AZ a couple of years and have been on a mission to find the ultimate taste of Mexican food from home.  Boy, oh boy. My husband took me here one afternoon.  I ordered a green chile burrito. Let's just say that my husband kept talking and I had to tell him to stop talking to me because my food was so flavorful that I didn't want to waste my energy talking but instead focusing on the party of perfect blend of spices, juicy succulent gravy, warm fresh flour tortilla and the earthy flavor of green chiles going on in my mouth!  Amazing!    Yes. Yes. Yes. A definite treasure this place is.
