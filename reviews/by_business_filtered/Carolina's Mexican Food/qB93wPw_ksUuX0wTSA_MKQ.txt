Went there for lunch today, had the chicken chimichanga, beans, and rice.  Nothing was bad, and the ingredients looked fresh.  Unfortunately, the taste was a little bland.  Just a big wad of chicken breast in a fried tortilla, the guacamole looked like it was from a tub, nary an avocado was found.

The food was served quickly and the dining area was clean.  I will have to try something else on the menu next time, though.
