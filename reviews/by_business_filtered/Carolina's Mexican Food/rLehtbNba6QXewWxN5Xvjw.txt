Carolinas is a special little hot spot! Always great consistant food at good prices. Homemade tortillas that are heavenly. You can order a dozen  (or more) to go. I normally freeze half. It's fast homemade food that's always fresh. Refried beans are awesome. You can order a side of cubed potatoes that are made with real butter. There are tables to eat there plus I see alot of people picking up food togo. I've had green and red chilli ...Red is my favorite here. The rice is good but they use some kind of herb that I can't figure out what it is?...that I'm not absolutely crazy about
