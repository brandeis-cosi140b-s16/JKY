I've heard from a lot of people that this place is pretty tasty-so I had to check it out. I thought maybe I had been there before and had an idea of what to expect but I walked in with a new picture in my mind. I thought it would be a sit down restaurant, but it was set up more like fast food and it was very fast indeed. I enjoyed a great red machaca burro and also tasted a flavorful bean, cheese and lettuce toastada and a side of Mexican rice. 

It was pretty busy in there at lunch time and we lucked out getting the last available table for our party of 3. 

The bathroom does not have a changing table and I had to change the baby on the counter top right behind the door-If you have small children that wears diapers I recommend changing them elsewhere. 

I would definitely go back here for some quick savory Mexican food on another day : )
