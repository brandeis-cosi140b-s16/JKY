I don't feel like I really need to write a lengthy review here as it has been done hundreds of times.  We all know Carolina's has the best flour tortillas in town, but everytime I order any other food off their menu it is average.  There are many, many much better Mexican restaurants in and around downtown Phx.  So, go in, get your tortillas to go, and head somehwere else for dinner!
