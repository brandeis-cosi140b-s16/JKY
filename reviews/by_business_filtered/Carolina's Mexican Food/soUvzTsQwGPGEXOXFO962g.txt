I have given Carolina's several chances feeling that I was just not ordering the best items. The tortillas are not that good, no carne asada or black beans. This last try will be just that! I ordered a veggie burrito ASSuming it would have rice, beans and veggies. Nope I got home with a giant tortilla with lettuce, tomato and luckily I added guacamole. Still searching for a decent burrito in Phoenix that is not from Chipotle.
