Food and salsa are great the service is always bad. I have been going here on and off for about 6 years and will be giving them another break in service for about a year. Not sure why you would call your order in a head of time and then wait for 3 breakfast burritos while watching people who just walked up to the counter receive their food. When I asked the young lady at the counter how they were getting their food before me when I called in 20 minutes prior she said it all depends who takes your order and who is making it... Well as I had an appointment to be at, that is why I called ahead and asked how long it would take, I told her to cancel my order to which she said "Okay!!" with a big smile. I sure hope their food quality never gets to low because their customer service won't save them. See them again in a year... well if they are still there.
