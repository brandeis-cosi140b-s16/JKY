It's obvious that everyone that walks in the door here loves it. This is one of three Carolina's in the Phoenix metro.  I've wanting to try the original Carolina's near downtown but did not want to drive all the way down to "da ghetto" all "gangsta like" to eat some fast Mexican food.  I have been to both North and West locations and found them to be very good and consistent.  

After standing in line to order like at a "taco stand" I sat down and noticed all the dishes coming out of the kitchen, and I started to almost drool.  Then my number was called and the funny urge to yell BINGO, but rather went up to the counter to get my piping hot Machaca Burrito with Papas and a side of chips and spicy salsa (served in styro-foam, ARGUE!!). While the salsa heat was almost too much for my taste buds, it was simply delicious and even took some home. 

Holy cow, this was amazing for the price.  As so many others have mentioned their tortillas are simply delish!! The beans were a good consistency, not too runny, not to dry and the rice had a great flavor.  Again the food is a great value for the price.

In summary, despite that fact this place is NOT eco-friendly by using stryo-foam it is more over a place that is convenient off the 101 and Peoria if you're in the area looking for good, fast Mexican food. This is not necessarily a destination place to plan for but rather a place of convenience with tasty food.
