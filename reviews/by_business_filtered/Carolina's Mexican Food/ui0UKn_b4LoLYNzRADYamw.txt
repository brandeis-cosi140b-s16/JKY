I had heard so much about Carolina's that I convinced my husband to try it on a Tuesday evening. The place was packed, always a good sign. We placed our order to go, and went towards the pick up area to wait, and wait, and wait. Finally after a half an hour, one of the girls noticed we were still there. Apparently they had been waiting on something. We got our stuff and left. I was still expecting the best, after all the wait had to have been worthwhile, right? Wrong! The food was lukewarm at best, the tostada/taco shells were stale, and my husband said his enchiladas were very bland. The best thing and this was truly the best I've ever had were the chocolate chimis for dessert. I would go back just for those. I so wanted this to be better than it was, but unfortunately it just fell short.
