This is one of phoenix iconic restaurants. Been around for ever. The food: pretty simple straightforward food. I like their red chile burro on lunch time and when i do breakfast i get their machaca and egg burro. As you have heard their tortillas are fresh made and pretty delicious. The restaurant is nothing fancy but you will see businessmen and bankers from the neighboring businesses dressed up and eating. I take one star off because they take so long to answer phone or never answer when you want to place a phone order.
