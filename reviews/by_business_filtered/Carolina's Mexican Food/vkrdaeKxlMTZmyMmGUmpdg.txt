This is my favorite Mexican food on this side of town. I've never ordered anything that wasn't good here. We always get the chicken tacos, red tamales, tostadas, burros, chimichangas, and rice. It's all good. You can't go wrong here. 

Even though this place more like a fast food place I love the food here. Sometimes it takes awhile to get your food so I would recommend that you call in. It's so much faster but it's always worth the wait.
