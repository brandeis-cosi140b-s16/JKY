I'm from Texas, and I love tex-mex, which probably makes me a little harsher on this place than others would be.  The ambiance is perfect.  Exactly what you would expect from this kind of place.  Quick, cheap, easy.  The styrofoam containers everything is served in and the plastic silverware it comes with is a nice touch, too.

But the food is a little lacking.  I had the cheese enchilada combo and the rice and beans were excellent.  The actual enchiladas though...left something to be desired.  I don't know what it was, but they just tasted...funky.  Like they had been cooked in my old gym sneakers.  After I ran a 5k.  With athlete's foot.

Now maybe the cheese enchiladas are an aberration.  Maybe I have a different idea of what kind of greasy Tex-Mex I can expect out here.  Who knows.  My experience here was just not that great--which makes me very sad.  I really wanted to like this place.
