Flew into AZ for a week's worth of business, and the first place my client's dragged me to for lunch was Carolina's. I was not entirely sure if my stomach could handle all that traveling, and then eating food from a rather dicey looking place, but oh boy, was my stomach thanking me over and over again!

I have the Chicken Chimichanga with Guac and it was probably the best thing I have eaten in a very long time! Service was pretty fast considering the line that was growing by the minute. Food tasted great and was pretty darn cheap to boot! Needless to say, I was begging them to take me to Carolina's everyday for the next 5 days....oh what I would give to be able to eat this every single day
