Delicious food; terrible service. After no greeting, no smile, a 16 minute wait for a combo, no apology, no "thank you," and a very sloppy container delivered to me, I was done. The food, however, was so good that I had to bump up the rating a notch or two. Because of the food, I'll give it one more try, but the service needs to be better.
