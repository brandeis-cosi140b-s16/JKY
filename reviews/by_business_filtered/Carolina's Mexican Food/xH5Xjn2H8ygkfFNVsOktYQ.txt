I almost feel bad giving this place 3 stars considering all the good reviews that it has.  The food is pretty good here, but it's just not great.  I finally decided to trek out to Carolina's after hearing so many good things about it.  I ordered the chorizo and bean burrito with 2 red beef tamales.  It didn't take long to get my order, which was nice since I was hungry like the wolf.  The burrito was decent.  The chorizo was spicy but that was about all that could be said for it.  The tamales were actually fairly tasty.  Though the red chile I asked for was sadly missing.

For a quick-stop mexican food place, it's very good.  I'd certainly go there for a bite before most of the other places I've tried out here.  That being said, it's exactly what you expect of it.  It's not gourmet, new, or exciting, but it is a good solid meal.
