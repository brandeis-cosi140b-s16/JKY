Dining at Carolina's always reminds me of how things can be just so right with the world, all without any extra trouble or fuss.  The place is always hopping with a bustling counter crowd, particularly after work with takeout orders.  Machaca (in anything) is moist and flavorful, and the tortillas are whisper thin, just the right amount chewy, and perfectly cooked - the perfect home to any conceivable filling combo.  Better yet, you can get tortillas by the dozen to take home and fill as you please.  Something to think about the next time you have guests over for margarita night and want to impress the socks off of them with nibbles.  Hatch chili cheese crisps anyone?

This place is unequivocally not for people who want romance, candlelight, ambiance and serenades with their tortillas.  It's for people who like their aguafrescas in styrofoam cups, their red and green chile combos on plastic trays, and don't mind counter service and booth seating.  Basically, it's unfussy heaven.

A caveat - come here for the tortillas more than the combo plates.  You can find better tamales and tacos all over the city, whereas the tortillas are the main attraction.  Treat it like going to a seafood restaurant and purposefully NOT ordering the steak.  To do otherwise would be silly, kids.
