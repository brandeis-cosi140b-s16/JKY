Four stars for this wonderful little hole in the wall kind of place.  The location is a little out of the way and I came in for lunch which is okay as there is a very varied crowd.  From longsleeved office workers to utility company uniformed types to gold chained and tatooed tough looking chaps, this place has it all.  Fret not because everyone's here for the good food :). 

I had a machaca plate and I like it very much.  The beef was nicely cooked, juicy and tender and full of juices.  The tortillas are home made and very elastic.  Yes elastic, cause u can pull on it and it will stretch, it's almost a little rubber band like.  Unlike most tortillas at other places that simply tears off and crumb when u pull on them, this one will flex with your pull :)

I will be back for sure, can't wait to try their green chili burro :)
