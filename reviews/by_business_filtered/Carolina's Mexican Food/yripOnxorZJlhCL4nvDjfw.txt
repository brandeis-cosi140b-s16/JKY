I always get the chicken taco, it's amazingly good if you don't mind a little grease. Call in your order ahead of time-it's always insanely busy, and make sure you check that you have everything. They've forgotten to give me my order of chips a few times, which is really a bummer because the chips are some of the best I've ever tasted.
