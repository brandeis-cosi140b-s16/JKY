Not all tortillas are made equal, and there is no question that Carolina's makes the best ones.  They're huge, not super greasy, and perfectly made so that they don't break even when they are overfilled with goodies inside.

I'm partial to stuffing my tortillas with green chile and chorizo w/ potato, but even if you just fill those tortillas with only cheese, you've still got yourself a real treat.  Do yourself a favor and skip the Mission tortillas at the grocery store, and pick up a dozen at Carolina's!
