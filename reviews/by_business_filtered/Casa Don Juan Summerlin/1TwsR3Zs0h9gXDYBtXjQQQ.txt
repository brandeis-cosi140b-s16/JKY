We checked this place out because our friends raved about it.  We will give it another try but this experience was just average.  First off everyone is very friendly which is a plus. Another plus is the chips. They weren't greasy at all but I had to add salt for my taste.  Good bean dip and salsa both complimentary.  My husband ordered a watermelon jalapeño margarita and I did the pomegranate margarita both very tasty.  My second round didn't taste nearly the same and when I sent it back the waiter came back and it looked and tasted like they just dropped pomegranate in the margarita I just sent back.  Hummmm.  I wasn't going to make a big deal out of it so like a sport I drank it.  After stuffing my face with chips I wasn't hungry so decided on a al la cart tamale cheese and jalapeño. Decent... I had hoped for more cheese and more than one jalapeño but whatever.  My husband ordered the fajitas... Big disappointment here. Fajitas are meant to be sizzling!!!!!! Nothing when they arrived to the table. The bummer part was the table next to us got theirs sizzling hot.  It presented like the food was sitting around for awhile.   The chicken was dry and shrimp was small.  Overall wasn't terrible will try it again but mainly for drinks and chips!  We may even take advantage of the free shuttle service that will take you home!  Everyone should try this place just for that!
