Second time at Don Juans, my husband and I love this place. The owner or manager is really nice, he has greeted us at the door both times. This time he was waiting outside opening the door for this guests. You don't find genuine customer service like this anywhere. I'm not sure if they are all related cause they work together like a family! 

The guacamole is super fresh and has a nice citrus bite. I had the fajitas and they tasted awesome! They also have a person making tortillas right there so you know they are fresh and you can taste it too! We also got to take advantage of happy hour which is from 5-7, 2 beers for $5! 

We will definitely be back, we live over 20min away but it's worth the drive, trust me ;)
