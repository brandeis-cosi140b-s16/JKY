Wow!! Just wow!! I've never had an "authentic" Mexican restaurant that I belong to until tonight!! Not only that, it's so close to my house!! Amazing food, amazing service, and their own tequila brand is to die for. You can taste the amount of hard word that goes into this tequila. I started with the guacamole appetizer which was amazing and the homemade chips to boot. My girlfriend had the 2 enchilada plate with chicken piled high with rice and beans. Absolutely delicious!! I had the chile relle√±o, beef taco, and beef enchilada. It was so much food, but I devoured it!! Our server's name Billy and he was on point and an amazing salesman. We were trying to save room for fried ice cream but there was just no more room. Can't wait to come back next time!
