We have been in Las Vegas for 5 years now and have been looking for a truly great Mexican restaurant. We finally stumbled upon Casa Don Juan on Main Street, which we loved. Now the Summerlin restaurant opened and I think it's even better. The service is consistently wonderful, the food perfectly delicious. I love the outdoor patio and large booths in front. The bar area is fantastic. Highly recommend it!
