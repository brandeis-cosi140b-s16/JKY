Any restaurant that honors Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera is worth checking out. You don't really expect authentic Hispanic in Summerlin, (no chipotle doesn't count white folks) but this place was great. People that think it's just average are probably to used to having a Baja blast with their burrito to know any better. Take it from a brown guy, this place does it right.
