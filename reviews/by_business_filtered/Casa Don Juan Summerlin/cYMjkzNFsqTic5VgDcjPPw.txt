Delicious food, great service. Pomegranate margarita was delicious you can taste the patron it's not just margarita mix. I had a tostada mixta, very well made the shrimp and octopus was fresh. For desert I had Mexican flan that was simply perfect. 

Very nice decor and very clean. I will be back to try other dishes very happy with my first visit.
