Update - June 2015

The last time we got our usual takeout, it was subpar and bland. I'm hoping it was just an off night but I was really disappointed when I got home and opened the carnitas platter. I was even more disappointed when I tasted it =(

I was hesitant to come here after the over-priced, bland food we got at their downtown location a few years ago. But we live right across the street from this new location and the other restaurant we had planned on going to had a 30 min wait. 

I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of food and flavors once our food arrived. I breathed a sigh of relief after the first few bites because I was expecting to be disappointed and to swear this restaurant off forever. I hope they keep it up since we live so close and it's nice to have a Mexican restaurant in this area. The service was stellar. Even the busser was incredibly friendly and super prompt clearing our plates or bringing extra chips/salsa.

The only downside was that the salsa was a bit disappointing and I still think the food could have used a tad more seasoning, but overall it tasted good. We had the carnitas platter for 2. It was the perfect amount a food for 2 but we're kind of little piggies and eat a lot. 2 normal people might have some leftovers to take home. The homemade flour tortillas were so yummy and filling! I am looking forward to going back.
