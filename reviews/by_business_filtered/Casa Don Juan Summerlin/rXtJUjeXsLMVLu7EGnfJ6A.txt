Outstanding as always! I have really enjoyed everything I've had here or at the one on Main. You've gotta try one of the cocktails, my favorite is the Vuelve la Vide- abalone, shrimp, octopus and mussels. The chimis, tacos, enchiladas, rellenos, puerco en chile verde are all great! It may be a little pricey for the location, I recommend Groupon.
