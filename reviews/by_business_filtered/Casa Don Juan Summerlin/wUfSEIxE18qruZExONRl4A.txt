We were so excited to see this place open up in the NW.  For weeks we would drive past and say we can't to try it. It's got a good rep from the downtown location.

The moment of truth: we walk in and were greeted quickly. We got our table in about 10 min. The busser asked for our drink order. 5 min later the waiter comes and asks if that's what we ordered. Mind you it was water a magarita and a chocolate milk. 

We ordered our food I got a combination enchilada Chile relleno and a taco. The taco was very greasy. Oh we asked for spicier salsa for our chips and we got charged 3.99! The enchilada tasted as if it was from a frozen package. My husband ordered the beef tongue. He asked for flour and corn tortillas and they actually only gave him one of each. When he asked for more they charged us for it. Never in my life have I been to a legitmate Mexican restaurant that charges extra for salsa and tortillas. And the kicker is every time we asked the busser for something like that salsa or those extra tortillas the waiter always came to our table and asked if we wanted that.

It was a huge disappointment and we will never go back. Service, food, atmosphere, and prices are why we will never go back to this location. I wish I could give it a 0.
