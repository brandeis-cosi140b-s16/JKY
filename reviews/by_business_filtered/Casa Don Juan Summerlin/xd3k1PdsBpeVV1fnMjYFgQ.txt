I Yelped this place to find some decent food in the area and I was so thankful I did!! It turned out to be delicious with home made tortillas the lady was making right in front of us and the service was even better then the food which is rare these days! Billy our waiter shook our hands as he gave us the check and thanked us for allowing him to serve us tonight and the bus boy noticed me looking around, asked if I needed anything and when i asked where the restroom was he walked me to the other side of the restaurant to show me. I'm blown away!!! This is definitely going to be a regular spot for us when we come back into the area.
