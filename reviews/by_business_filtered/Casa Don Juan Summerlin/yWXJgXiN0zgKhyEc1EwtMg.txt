Exceptional customer service. Staff was friendly and attentive. Unfortunately, everything that came out of the fryer was not good at all. Don't know if it was just a bad night, but chips were stale, "crispy" taco was soggy and greasy, and tamal was dry with too much maza. Rice and beans were very good, but nothing else was impressive. Will not go here again, especially for the price. Not really sure how this place got such a good rating. Makes me doubt the validity of their ratings.
