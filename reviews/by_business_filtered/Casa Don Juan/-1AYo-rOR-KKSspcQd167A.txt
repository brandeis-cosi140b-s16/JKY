OK guys let me start off by saying until just about 3 years ago I have lived in Orange and Los Angeles Counties.  I was born and raised in So Cal. I have done my grocery shopping at Mercado's.  I've had many a drunken, reckless, eat till you burst and drink till you puke night in baja.  I have smuggled fireworks and Cuban, or what I was told were, Cuban cigars across the border and yes, I have most likely eaten dog or donkey tacos in Tijuana.  So If I am well versed enough to speak my mind about anything it would be Mexican food.  With all that being said...On with the review.

My quest for good humble Mexican food in the Vegas valley has been 3 years in the making and time after time I have been disappointed.  This place however was good.  It was not bad but it was not out of this world fantastic.  I ordered a shrimp ceviche tostada 3 tacos, one carne asada, one al pastor, and one lengua to get a full range of flavors.  The lengua was pretty damn good moist, tender and flavorful, the same goes for the pastor it had good flavor, good texture and the taste was pretty impressive.  Now this was not the case with the asada.  The carne asada taco was dry and overcooked I would like to think I just got a bad batch but who knows.  

OK on to the ceviche. The ceviche was again not fantastic but better than just average.  I would like to have seen whole shrimp instead of the diced pieces of shrimp that they used here .  There was also a lot of diced tomatoes to act as filler.  If this same exact restaurant was located in Long Beach, CA I most likely would have given it 3 stars instead of 4, but considering the number of bad experiences I've had in Vegas, Casa Don Juan has acted as a glimmer of hope and provided this Californian a taste of home.
