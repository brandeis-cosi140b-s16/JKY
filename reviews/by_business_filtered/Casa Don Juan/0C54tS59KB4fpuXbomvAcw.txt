Bland Bland Bland! Service was good but food and drinks (mojito) were bland!!! We went to have a date night at Casa Don Juan and sadly my husband and I were disappointed, coming from San Diego and spoiled by amazingly authentic Mexican food; nothing here had any flavor. From the salsa for the chips (it had heat) beans were bland and if you order a tamale, that is exactly what you get a steamed tamale with nothing and hardly any meat. My husband had the chimichanga platter and it was bland boiled chicken fried in a tortilla. The mojito taste like lime juice over ice... Very disappointing
