02/14/11 LUNCH. New to the LV region. Had Mexican food in the Los Angeles area for 41 years, so I'm spoiled. Been to a few other mexican places before coming here, this is one of the first reviews I'll write about them. OK, today. Ordered cadillac margarita, which was OK but expensive. Chile relleno was OK. (Chapala's has better ones, IMO.) Good green chili chicken tamale, but not enough of the sauce. Overall, nothing special, and EXPENSIVE for the experience, especially for a lunch. PS I should mention, the wait staff, albeit a little overwhelmed by the crowd for Valentine's Day lunch, were VERY COURTEOUS and WONDERFUL to me. ALL very friendly and attentive.
