I love hole in the wall places and this is definitely one of them.  The staff is nice, the place is unique (I love dia de los muertos skulls a lot!) , and the food is great. Not fancy, not over the top, but delicious none the less.

 I also love how FAST they are. I order, I blink, and then my food is there! It is great when I want decent Mexican food on the go and close to that side of town. 

 If I had to leave my car for a couple hours at the shop I go to up the street, I can just walk down to Mr. Don Juan's place, throw back some beers ( or margaritas), have a bite to eat, and then walk back up to my car satisfied! 

The atmosphere, the music (sometimes), and everything really about this place is welcoming and comfortable. If you are downtown check it out!
