My husband and I went here on a very glowing recommendation from my boss.  

First, parking is tough but we did find a spot.  We walked in, it was loud and we were not greeted.  Finally, someone says "two" and I nod, not knowing who I am speaking with and she proceeds to come around a corner to seat us.  She put us at the smallest table I have ever seen.  It was so squished between two tables that we were unable to sit down.  The hostess dropped the menus and walked away.  We moved the table, physically so each of us could sit down one at a time.  

We sat, we sat some more, and finally a bus boy brought us waters, chips and salsa.  

We continued to wait until I had to flag down a waiter.  

My boss said he orders a top shelf margarita, pork tamale and beef enchilada, so my husband and I ordered that exact same thing.  

The chips were stale tasting the salsa seemed out of a can, the beans were very runny.  After finishing off the basket of chips because we were so starved our food finally arrived, the margarita was warm, the red sauce on the enchilada has no flavor like it came right out of a can.  The tamale didn't have the meat inside the masa, it was set on top.  We ate maybe half and then waited forever to refills on our water and the check.  

We have been told by others to give it a second chance but I don't see this happening.
