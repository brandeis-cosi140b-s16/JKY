I was really looking forward to trying this place as I always see that it's pretty busy, but I'm very disappointed at the food. We ordered a beef fajita plate and shared it between two people. It was definitely enough food, as they give a lot of beef, but the quality of the meat was horrible. I also told the waiter it was my boyfriends birthday and they sang, which was nice, but gave him a plate of whip cream!! Very disappointed.
