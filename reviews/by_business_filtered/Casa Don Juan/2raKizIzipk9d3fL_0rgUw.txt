DO NOT BUY THEIR STUPID GROUPON and actually probably don't even bother coming here. No i'm not just another cheap @ss w/ a groupon b*tching about having issues using the discount. They either really don't update their own website, or have ridiculously inflated their prices while this groupon is on - i'm not sure which. 

It was a great deal $10 lunch for 2 and of course there was a $ restriction on the food ($10-11/person), and you pay whatever is over, which is fine. Except that it doesn't mention you can't just order an $8 burrito, you can only order from their comidas y cenas pages (plates w/ beans and rice). Website says $13 for a chimichanga/current menu is $16, website says $10 for chilaquiles/current menu is $20. This isn't effen Border Grill wtf! 

I liked the atmosphere, the food was ok, not much better than Roberto's though. Fast friendly service, but i don't appreciate this bait and switch sh*t. I'd be curious to see if their prices go down once the groupon expires, but irrelevant because i'm never going back to find out.
