I really loved the food the reason I'm giving it a 3 they charged all of us more. And they also charged us the table because we were a large group calm on that is ridiculous.We did love the food and if i come back with a large group get separated tables if  not they will charge a lot and also if your not paying all together make sure that you tell them before you pay and they charge what they didn't bring to  you.
