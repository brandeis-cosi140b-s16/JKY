Here we go you guys:
Great food. Had the shredded beef chimichanga (pronounced Chimmy-CHANG-ga). Sarie had the pork carnitas (pronounced Car-knit-tuhs). Good. Good. Real good.
Started out with two-for-one Mojitos. They were as refreshing as skinny dipping in the fountain of youth. 
We went with a groupon of course, so we also had two house margaritas. I had mine frozen (like my heart). Sarie had hers on the rocks (like our marriage). All good.
This place gets crankin around 8 pm. So plan on a busy, eventful, loud experience. Which is exactly what we wanted. There was a birthday girl at the booth next to us. She was very pretty.They did the song and dance for her. 
Also, the little mariachi man with the guitar can break down one hell of a 'De Colores' if you're interested in that stuff. I am of course.
Skipped out on desserts. who can eat a flan after all that booze and chips and rice and beans? 
The BEAR can, that's who! That's why next time I'm rocking CDJ with the big Bear and we'll go all the way with that caramel custard you guys.
