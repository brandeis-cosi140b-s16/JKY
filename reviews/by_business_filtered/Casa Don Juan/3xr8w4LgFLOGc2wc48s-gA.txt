Definitely a do-over. We've been driving past Casa Don Juan for a decade saying, "we really need to try this place". We finally did and we will be back. This place is surprisingly large inside with tons of character/personality. The menu is huge and everything we tried was excellent. They have a large staff so everything moves quickly and you get your drinks and chips/salsa/bean dip right away. Just a couple of blocks south of Fremont Street on Main this is a great place to stop for dinner before heading to Fremont for a night out with friends.
