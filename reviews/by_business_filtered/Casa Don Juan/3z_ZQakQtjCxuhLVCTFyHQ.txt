Absolutely love Casa Don Juan!  Came here for a late lunch the other day and the food and service was excellent.  The mango margaritas were the perfect way to start the weekend early.  I ordered the chili relleno + cheese enchilada combo and couldn't have been happier.  The chili relleno was the best I ever had.  Super light and melted in your mouth.  Loved their enchilada sauce.  I'm putting the salsa and guacamole here in my top 5 and that's saying a lot since Mexican is my favorite food.  The service was tops and so was the food, yay!
