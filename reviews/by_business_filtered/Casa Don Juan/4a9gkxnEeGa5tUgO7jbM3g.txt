Never seen a more overrated place in my entire life.  You are basically talking Baja fresh at $15 a plate, even with a groupon it's a complete rip off.  Chips are lame, salsa no good.  If the prices were cut in half I would still say "Meh".  How do they get away with this in the middle of the ghetto?
