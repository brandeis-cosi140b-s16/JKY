I read the reviews of Casa Don Juan and decided to give it a go.  It's is good, and it certainly is fast!  I didn't think it would be as fast as it was, but once again, my fellow Yelpers were correct.  

I had the carnitas con puerco.  It was a good sized plate of pork slices served with pico, guacamole, refried beans, and rice.  The carnitas were a bit dry, but I fixed that with some Tapatio and by spreading some salsa from the chips over the pork.  The food was good and I enjoyed my dinner here.

They served standard chips and salsa with bean dip.  The salsa had a bit of a zing to it, but the bean dip was blah.

I'm not sure if I'd return.  This was a visit to try the place.  I'm not sure I'd drive to downtown when there are so many good choices nearer to home.
