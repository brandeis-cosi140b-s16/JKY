Went in for lunch today. I had waited a while (years) to try this place because there are a handful of awesome Mexican restaurants in Vegas that I frequent regularly. After a numbers of years of thinking about trying this place, I wish I was still just thinking about it. There are much better Mexican eateries in Vegas!!  

My experience today included a super long wait from the time I was seated until the waiter (really sweaty guy) took my order. We're talking 20 solid minutes before I ordered. One redeeming thing at this point, the chips and salsa - the salsa flavor was good and unfortunately the highlight of the meal.

Ok, food comes. Very greasy beef taco, very, very greasy. That's just gross. Pork tamale - not bad but could have used more meat in the middle. Cheese enchilada was okay. There was something, like a noodle, in my beans. I noticed it about half way through. I don't know about you, but it's hard to keep eating after you find something weird in your food. Rice was just average. Sweaty waiter pretty much ignored me until the very end of my meal. I asked for a refresh on my completely empty water glass - it took a while but another man did eventully bring me a fresh water. Then the bill comes and I'm now in a rush to return to work, so I didn't look at the itemized check. I think I was over charged by at least a buck or two. Being in a rush I just blew it off. First and last time I go here. Period!

Conclusion, go to a better Mex spot! There are excellent places around town. Sadly, this is not one of them.
