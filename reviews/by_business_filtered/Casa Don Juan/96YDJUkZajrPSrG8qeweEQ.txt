We came early in the morning for breakfast.  It was just perfect, although is a little far from the strip (if your vacationing in vegas) it's worth the drive. 
I had the green chilaquiles, my wife the red ones, and I can tell you it was an authentic Mexican kitchen flavor, too bad I forgot to take a picture.
The decoration is really nice with art of Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo all over the restaurant, the restrooms clean and beautifully decorated.
Definitely we have to come back and taste their dinner menu, I wouldn't doubt it must be delicious.
