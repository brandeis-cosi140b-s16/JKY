We have eaten here several times, so I can't believe that I haven't reviewed them before!  We recently took advantage of the Groupon for Casa Don Juan and had dinner and 2 large frozen Margaritas.  The chips come with beans and salsa which are both very good.  I had a combo plate with a Crispy Beef Taco, Chili Relleno and Pork Tamal.  Hubby had the #31 which is the same as what I had but instead of the Tamal, it comes with a beef enchilada.  The beef they use is really tasty and the Relleno's are the best in Vegas.  The food is always very hot, fresh and delicious...our favorite Mexican food option.
