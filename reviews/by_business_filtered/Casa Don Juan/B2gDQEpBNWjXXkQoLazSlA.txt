We ate at Casa Don Juan tonight after seeing a show at the 4 queens. The service was not all that good and the food just so so. It came out really fast but did not have much flavor. Probably will not go back again. The raised their prices since we were there a year ago about $4 a plate, and the portions are small. Only about 2 table spoons of beans, give me a break they are the cheapest thing to make, and theirs were watered down. 
They also don't do happy hour on Fridays anymore.
