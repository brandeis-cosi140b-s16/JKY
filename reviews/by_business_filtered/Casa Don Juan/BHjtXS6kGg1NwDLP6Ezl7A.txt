Usually get really good service but tonite it was horrible. We had a Groupon so maybe that's why the waitress treated us like crap. Had to ask for water THREE times and when the check came she said we had to pay up front at the register which was never the case in the past. While at the register, two other waiters came up with money/credit cards for other customers to settle their bills for them. 

The food was good as always and the margaritas were yummy as well (although I asked for NO salt on the rim but got salt anyway). Unfortunately the waitress was so bad that I'll think twice about coming here again. There are other good Mexican restaurants in Vegas.
