5 stars for awesome service. 3 stars for food. They serve retried beans and salsa w/chips great taste! I ordered shrimp toastada the shrimp is not cooked w/the lemon :(  was just okay. the hubby ordered the cheese tamale REALLY MOIST great taste! The rice was just okay also. The drinks were not the best Michelada was not good. The strawberry margarita was not good either especially for $13.
