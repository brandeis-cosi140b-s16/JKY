Descent Mexican food. Not bad but no so wonderful. Sorry was very friendly but painless slow. The place was empty in a Tuesday night but they would hold us a table with a reservation? They push alcoholic drinks... Careful....chicken fajitas were standard fare...chicken mole was a bit sub par but very edible. Friend got chili relleno but complained it tasted of fish? Oh well, we will skip this in the future, but the location is good & atmosphere is fun.... Good modern hipster music.
