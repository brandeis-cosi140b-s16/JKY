Oh mylanta! There's not one time I go to Vegas without stopping here! I wish they opened another restaurant here in LA. The service is awesome, ambiance is great, && there is this super hot waiter working there now... WOW! Lol. Anyways... Haha. If you like to drink, i recommend the Modelo Micheladas, they're probably the best I've ever had!
