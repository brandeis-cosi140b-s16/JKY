i would like to start off to say that i had a good meal. but i went to the bar had two drinks.. i played 55.00 dollars and i was ready to pay for my food they charged me for my drinks i said why when i played 55.00 they gave me the receipt that "was wrong".. it said i sat down there at 6:24pm and i arrived at 5:18 pm...which was wrong because, i made it there at 6:35 i picked my daughter up then came over to eat for almost 45 minutes. to make a long story short i asked them to go over the cameras they said, "they don't work" management was rude and she did nothing to help me. not even go back on the receipts an clarify that i wasn't lying. im not please and i feel like this company is getting over on alot of people with "gambling".. its not about the food or the drinks it about how she gave me receipts that clearly showed i wasn't there at that time. nacy g. our waitress was amazing wonderful server!... management sucks!!!!  I WOULD LIKE FOR EVERYONE TO BE ADVISED THAT THEY ARE TAKING PEOPLES MONEY!! AND THEIR GAMBLING MACHINES ARE WRONG! AND BETTER MANAGEMENT! I WANT MY DAMN MONEY BACK HIGHLY UPSET AND I WANNA PUSH THIS FURTHER CAUSE THIS IS HIGHLY UPSETTING!
