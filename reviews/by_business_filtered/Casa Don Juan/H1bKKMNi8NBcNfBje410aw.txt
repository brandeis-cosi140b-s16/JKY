We stopped in here last night for dinner before First Friday. The place was pretty busy, and we were told we'd have a a 30 minute wait. However, it was closer to 45 minutes.

There's a big couch in the waiting area decorated with sombreros. The wall was covered with pictures of Frida Kahlo. I liked the look of the place and was looking forward to a good dinner.

I ordered a chile relleno and tamal with pork in red sauce. My wife got a carne asada taco, chile relleno, and tamal with chicken in green sauce.

While we were waiting for our food, we were given chips, salsa, and bean dip. The salsa wasn't very flavorful and the bean dip was lukewarm. 

It took a very long time before we got our order. Once we got it, the food was lukewarm. The chile relleno was fine but nothing special. The tamales were okay, but again, nothing special.

The only thing I really liked was the carne asada taco. My wife got an order of flan. She's a flan snob and said it was one of the better flan she's had, second only to her favorite at Frank and Fina's Cocina.

While we were waiting to be seated, I saw that there was Groupon available for Casa Don Juan. I bought it hoping it would be available to use by the time we were done eating. It wasn't, so I guess I'll be back. I'm hopeful that we'll have a better experience if we go when it's not so busy....I'll let you know!
