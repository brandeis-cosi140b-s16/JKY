This is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants in town and it doesn't hurt that it's located downtown near where I work. The service here is always wonderful and you are greeted as soon as you enter. And in my experience, unless you come during First Fridays, you are typically seated immediately. Once seated, drink orders are taken pretty quickly and then fresh chips and salsa are brought to your table. Sometimes they automatically bring you guacamole too, which is an extra $5.99 charge, so if you don't want it you may have to tell them upfront.

The food is priced reasonably, although it can be considered expensive for Mexican food, depending on what you order. Regardless, the food comes out quickly and the portions are fairly large. I usually get the same few entrees: huevos rancheros if it's breakfast time, or enchiladas or fajitas if it's lunch/dinner time. The food is delicious, comes out hot, and I haven't had anything I didn't like. I've had margaritas on a few occassions and they are pretty large, whether frozen or on the rocks, although not very strong (surprise, surprise). If you like it strong, you may have to ask them for a few extra shots...

Sometimes when I'm here the owners and managers walk around the restaurant to check on each table, which I find nice. Not many casual restaurants focus on customer service anymore and it's always about speed now. The waitresses here are patient but speedy with drinks/orders at the same time. The only thing negative about this place is that parking can be kind of tough if you come when it's busy. They only have a couple dozen spots in the back, as well as some meter parking out front.

Overall, I enjoy this place whenever I stop by and am always recommending it to friends and family.
