First time here and I will definitely be back! They make their own homemade tortillas!!!! I had the flour tortillas; delicious! I haven't found another place in Vegas that does this. You also get a side of complimentary bean dip with your chips and salsa which is a nice bonus. The house margarita is delish on the rocks!
