One of the best pork and beef tacos around! The food is delicious and authentic. 2nd time here and nothing bad to say. Nothing but a positive experience. Also, I normally don't like horchata, but the best ones I've had so far was this place, the Bacchanal Buffet and at my work. I like when the Horchata isn't strong in spices, but more creamy and smooth. Also, the chips, bean dip, salsa and guacamole are to die for. I can't stop eating it because it's so good. They need a location in California, OC and LA. :D
