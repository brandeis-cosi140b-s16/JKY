Super fun atomosphere!! Perfect for a date night or even a birthday party. We started out with chips and bean dip. The cheese dip is hands down amazing though. I had a Pina Colada which was prepared and brought out to me in a pineapple. Talk about yummy! My boyfriend had a Watermelon Margarita that was not only smooth, but refreshing and tasteful. I would definitely recommend it. To eat I had shrimp ceviche tostadas that were huge. I could barely eat one. My boyfriend got a cheese enchilada combo and let's just say his plate was spotless when he was done. We topped off the night with fried ice cream which hit the spot. We would recommend this place to everyone. We will be back!!!
