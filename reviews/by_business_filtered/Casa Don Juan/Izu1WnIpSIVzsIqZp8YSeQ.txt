Very nice people very nice food. It could be enough but I feel compeled to express my support for CassaDon Juan in few more words than that. Extremely big and tasty meals, very fast service, attentive waitress etc. seems to be standard there. We lived in Vegas at Stratosphere and were little unsure during our walk there - neighbourhood is not among the most pretty in the city, you walk past several used cars joints and repair shops, the street lights were off....but it all ended when we entered the Casa. The only thing I would change (at least for this particular evening) was the guitarist - although he seemed pretty skilled, mood of his songs wasn't very encouraging. I thought his songs should be more lively.

Go there and don't worry, you will fell well there.
