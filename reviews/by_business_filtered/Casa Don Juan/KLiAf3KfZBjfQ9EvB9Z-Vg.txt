After hitting the Frankie's Tiki Bar near by, we were looking for a good place to eat.  Being from Hawaii, we don't get a lot of authentic Mexican food - so we were happy to give this place a try based on the Yelp reviews.
Prices were good - compared to Hawaii - and the plate sizes were giant.  I wish restaurants would make smaller plates and smaller prices!  Guac was very yummy!
Only reason this doesn't rate higher is due to the servers.  We were asked if we wanted Guac with a chips and we said yes.  However, it didn't show up and we had to ASK for it!  Then the drinks never got refilled and water never came.  
We are used to crappy service in Hawaii but this was pretty bad.
I'd come here again, but I'd split a plate with someone and not expect the service to be spot on.
