If I could give this minus stars, I would.  What a "rip off".  My dh and I are from El Paso, TX, (where they have REAL Mexican food!)   Ate here tonight.  Where to begin?  First off, we ordered margaritas at $15 a pop.  Watered down drool!  No flavor, and where was the Tequila?  Food was lukewarm.  I had cold tacos.  My dh had tasteless enchiladas.  Friends had cold flautas and chile rellenos. It all tasted like 1960s TV dinners.  And, it was expensive!  $13.99 for two tacos and a dollop of canned re-fried beans and rice!  Save your money and eat at Taco Bell....It's better!
