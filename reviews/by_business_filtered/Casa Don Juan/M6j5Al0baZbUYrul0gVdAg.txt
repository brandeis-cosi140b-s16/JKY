Business diners flock here. On any given lunch hour, you can find district attorneys, police investigators and lawyers dining in the crowded lunch room.

There are a lot of menu choices and the chips and salsa are tasty.  Service is quick.  I found the lunch a bit disappointing as the tortillas were not fresh tasting and the food lacked authentic flavors.  The shrimp was too chewy and the chicken stringy.

The sauces were excellent though and the enchiladas were delicious.
