Stopped in just about 20 min before they closed coming from one of the bars close by, they sat us, then didn't rush us at all, and mmm mmm mmm Erik the server was the perfect eye candy ending to an already awesome night! 

We ordered drinks and food from they late night specials menu, food was good, not amazing but good, it was also closing time so who knows... And around $6-$8 a plate. The beverages were really fun, one came in a bowl and it had like 5 types of alcohol in it and it was delish! 

The service was great, drinks were kept full and table cleared off frequently of empty glasses. Friendly staff and comfy booths. 

I'd go back for sure! They have a bar in there also that has some tv screens and the restaurant section is a pretty good size. 

Cool decor and fun vibe. Decent food. I will have to go back and eat when they are not closing. But I had the Pollo Mole and it was very good.
