First off when we arrived we were told that it was shift change so we couldn't be seated right away. We waited for 15 minutes while people just hung around the hostess stand chatting. Then we sat down and I ordered a frozen margarita which was brought on the rocks. When it was sent back I suspect it was brought back to me after having just been run through a blender and having ice added to it. Pretty much just tasted like ice. Food was fast, but blah and then we had to wait 30 minutes for our check. Finally, after paying at the register I was waiting for my partner to go to the bathroom and our waiter came up to see how much he got tipped. I don't think he realized that I was the person standing right there. You just waited on us! What the hell? Overall- don't do it if you can avoid it.
