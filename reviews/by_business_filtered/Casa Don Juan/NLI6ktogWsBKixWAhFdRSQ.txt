Very disappointing meal. The tacos and enchiladas I swear are smaller and smaller every time. The carnitas were sitting in a pool of grease. Gross!!!  And the pricing seems to rise. Ordered pico gallo and there's a $2.50  surcharge. Where nowhere on the menu does it state it's a surcharge. When brought to managers attentions manager was combative and no service oriented. Will NEVER visit again.
