Let's be clear, this is Americanized Mexican food, for gringos. There are almost no Mexicans that eat here. That should tell you something. It's not horrible but it's not authentic so if you are a drunk gringo who likes Taco Bell, then you will like this place. Otherwise stay away. The carnitas burrito I had was completely forgettable.
