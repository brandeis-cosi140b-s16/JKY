My first visit to this Mexican restaurant was a success. We were greeted and seated promptly even though it was busy and we had 6 in our party. Our orders were likewise taken quickly, and our food came out FAST, maybe even a little too fast! There is something I don't say often! 

The food is fresh and extremely varied, also quite tasty. The chile relleno was stuffed with plenty of cheese, but for me, the batter was a bit thick. Tacos were wonderful and the red sauce on my enchilada was delicious. I wouldn't call this place tex-mex at all, seemed pretty authentic to me!
