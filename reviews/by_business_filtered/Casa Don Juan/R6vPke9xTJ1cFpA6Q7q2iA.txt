I'm surprised I've never written a review before. Casa Don Juan is part of our regular rotation. The carnitas plate for two with handmade corn tortillas is a must. Since they've added tamales to the menu, we have to have a side of those too - pork is my preference. Salsa can be hit or miss, sad to say it has no consistency. Service is always quick and friendly.
