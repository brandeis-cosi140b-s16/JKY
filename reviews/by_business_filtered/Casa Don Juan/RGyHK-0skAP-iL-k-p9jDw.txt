Didn't even get water before they told us that their machines were down and could only take cash, how about telling us that when we walked in before you say us.
Very unapologetic about it & we were starved.  Not sure it's a ploy to use their ATM but we don't pay $5 to get cash.
I'm sure their food is great but service is lacking.
