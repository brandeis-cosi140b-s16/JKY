**Summary**
       - Service - The service was great. The waiter was took the initiative and answered all questions we had about the menu.
       - Flavor - Perhaps it was what we ordered, but the food seemed mediocre.
**Ordered**
       - $12.99 Pescado (Veracruz style) - They deep fried a whole fish. It was definitely an experience. However, the fish seemed a bit bland (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/a192hdM0_UVCYLwPJv1Qwg?select=PJHl0-1lr3VutIljvJWAgg).
       - $13.99 Carne Asada con Arroz, Frijoles y Guacomole - The carne asada was decent but a little dry (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/a192hdM0_UVCYLwPJv1Qwg?select=2jMekOanf6P9EuTiBzuh0Q).
       - $2.50 Lengua (Beef Tounge) Taco - The meat was good. The only complaint was it was really spicy. I had to stop half way to take a break (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/a192hdM0_UVCYLwPJv1Qwg?select=YThhtM8r_BRfN3L56wfKGQ).
       - $2.75 Flan Napolitano - Made from scratch flan. It was delicious.
**Recommendations**
       - Out of all the restaurant style Mexican places, I'd rank this one pretty high. However, I think I'll stick to fast food Tacos El Gordo next time I'm feeling like tacos.
