We came here twice on a recent work-trip to Vegas, and thoroughly enjoyed it each time. Really great staff: attentive, friendly, efficient. We came by after long work days both times, and appreciated being able to relax and be taken care of. Margaritas were good, salsa too. They made me a shrimp fajita quesadilla, even though it wasn't on the menu, and it was delicious. Guacamole was quite good. Others at the table had enchiladas, chicken mole, chicken quesadillas, and pretty much raved.  

We liked it a lot, and will definitely be back!
