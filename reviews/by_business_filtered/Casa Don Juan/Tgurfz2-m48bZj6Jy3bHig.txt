Working downtown, Casa Don Juan is sorta a staple in the lunch rotation. 
On 4-20-13, I was attending The Smith Center matinee, and decided to stop at Casa Don Juan for lunch before the show.
I was surprised to see how busy it was, but that never seems to effect the great service. 
The Gentleman who greets you at the door  (with the mustache) must have ESP. He is always ONE step ahead of whatever is going on.  He knows exactly what is going on, even before you know what you want. He walked us to our table, and shortly after that someone came over for our drink order.  
Our food came out quickly, and exactly as we ordered.  
Food always tastes great, and fast service.  
I think I will be dining at Casa Don Juan, more often!
