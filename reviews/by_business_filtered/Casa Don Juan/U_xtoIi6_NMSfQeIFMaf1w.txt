OK...I feel bad not giving them 5 stars.  The food is great.  Love the chips, salsa and guac...  What I don't love is using my groupon and being charged more at the table.  It sounds like fraud to me. Wait a minute...the hostess and waiter both said it is fraud too.  They blame Billy the manager and of course groupon.  The waiter was a nasty little guy till it came time for the tip.  The groupon clearly states 2 lunch entree's for $9.99.  Fine print states a value of up to just under $22.  All ok with me.  You can even take a peak at the menu via the groupon link.  The interesting "fraudy" part is that the prices reflected on the business website are not the same as on the menu.  Each item is about $2 more on the actual menu.  So it is impossible to actually use the groupon for the purchase price.  You have no choice but to pay more.  Again, the food is great. The groupon/fraud crap makes me not want to ever go back out of principal only.  Billy, fix the price discrepancy or honor the groupon...and teach your staff to not tell me it's "fraud" and they agree it is wrong.  The cashier stated that they have tried to call groupon and groupon is in control.  The interesting part is that the prices on the actual Casa Don Juan website are the same as on the groupon link.  This means that groupon has nothing to do with the price increase.  Casa Don Juan is getting greedy and misleading the customer by not honoring the groupon as it is intended.  There is not one item on the "lunch/dinner" menu that is $9.99.
