Called the restaurant from hops and nuts. Literally across the street. Hops and nuts provided the menu when we had asked what local restaurants delivered. We then proceeded to call this resistant to order food off of the current menu the partnered bar provided us. The lovely hostess Denise answered with an incredibly rude tone. She actually hung up on us a number of times on us stating she had no idea where hops was?? I provided the location I was calling from she continued to play dumb and act like we had no idea where this place was... It was next door... Literally right next door?? After realizing they might have someone new who had to clearly not know what neighboring business partners they had I offered to walk by. As I entered the building and let Denise she was nothing but rude and impolite. Far from anything a paid hostess would be. Hopefully management soon recognizes her poor performance and hires a better face for their business.
