The food was good, service was amazing, and the pina colada came in a pineapple. I didn't like that the semi attentive waiter, which later I found out that he is the one who keeps the full tip. The service was amazing because the guys in the blue shirts in which I thought were the main waiters made it a great experience!!! They were very attentive and nice! I I did split the tip after asking if they share and finding out they didn't.
