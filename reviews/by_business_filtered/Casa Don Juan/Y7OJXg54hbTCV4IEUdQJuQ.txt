Guacamole is yummy!!!! :D

I LOVE coming here to eat breakfast on the weekends. It's the perfect place to eat if you have a hangover too (Menudo), quiet, and no wait if you go between 9am-11am.... So my favorite meal to eat is JUEVOS RANCHEROS $9.. Now I must warn you, they give a very big proportion of food no matter which plate you get. I recommend either one of these plates: the NOPALES, JUEVOS RANCHEROS, CHILAQUILLES, AND you have to try A SIDE OF GUACAMOLE. Their guacamole is made a little differently than most places, no tomatoe, but diced onions and cilantro- YUM!! Aside from the good food, the staff is super friendly, helpful, and always on top of things like filling up your drink, getting you napkins or picking up your plate. You're most likely going to spend about $8-$16 per plate, a little pricey, but well worth it I think :)
