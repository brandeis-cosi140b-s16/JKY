You could find a crappy Mexican restaurant like this anywhere in America. Uninteresting menu, slow service, bad decor. The flies would not stay off of our bland enchiladas, so at least THEY enjoyed them. If you want to know what Mexican restaurants were like thirty years ago, you can't do much better than this  relic from a flavorless past.
