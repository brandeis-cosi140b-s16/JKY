While the food was good, they seemed very annoyed that we had Groupons.  The server came over and we let her know and she immediately sighed and looked like we just ruined her night.  She said we'd have to speak with her manager about it so she went and got him.  He was pleasant about it and reiterated the exact rules of the Groupon so we would be aware.

The rest of the night the server seemed bothered by us which started to becoming annoying.  But the food was good, so we'll be heading back, hopefully with a Groupon to see if the server is still as annoyed! haha
