Who's cooking here??  This food tastes like it came from a buffet, or a Robertos. The food lacks flavor, even the rice and beans!  I tried this place out on my birthday thinking I was getting authentic Mexican food and I was greatly disappointed after we got home with our to-go order. 

We ordered the pork chile verde--bland, beef in red sauce--also bland, the shrimp tacos--dry and bland, and a carnitas chimichanga which was incredibly salty and oily. Yuck.

Yelp reviewers have let me down on this one.  Plus the food is WAY over-priced. These 4 dishes cost $63!?!  They either over charged us or their prices are ridiculous for the lousy food they serve.
