When I entered the restaurant, I was very impressed with the decor, and the fact that we were promptly greeted. The server brought guacamole, salsa, and bean dip to the table with fresh chips. things were looking good! 
Guac was very tasty, bean dip very tasty, but the salsa was sort of thin and bland, and seemed like it had some sort of thickening agent in it. When the entrees arrived, they were underwhelming. I had a beef enchilada, beef taco and a chile relleno. I didn't care for the sauce at all. The taco was ok. the chile relleno had too much cheese, and I didn't care for the cheese they stuffed it with. I took about three bites, and that was it. 
Service was outstanding throughout. Although the service and decor were outstanding, I didn't care for the food at all, and will probably not be back.
