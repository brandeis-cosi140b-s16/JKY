There are authentic Mexican restaurants, and then there is Casa Don Juan, which serves the best chile relleno and enchilada combination ever created. The freshness of the homemade ingredients delights the senses and transports the diner to another world, long ago, before modern chemicals ruined the delicate flavors of fine food.  I ordered the chile verde, which was fantastic and on par with some of the best chili verde dishes I have enjoyed in California and Arizona.
