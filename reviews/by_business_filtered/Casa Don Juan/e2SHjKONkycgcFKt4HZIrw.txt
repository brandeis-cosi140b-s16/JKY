Solid Mexican place with great ambiance and friendly efficient service.  Great drinks.  Food was pretty good but not awesome.

First, if popularity is any indicator, this is a great restaurant.  It was packed on Sunday afternoon at 3 PM -- and that's in downtown.

The vibe is typical Mexican.  The waiters' costumes are pretty and authentic.  The service is friendly and efficient -- the waiters hustle.

The margaritas are great.   The guacamole is very good.  However, having such a good feeling about the place overall, I have to say I was a bit disappointed with my food.  The chile relleno was not very flavorful.  The taco was OK at best.  Overall I'd say "typical smashed bean and rich" Mexican food -- not worse but not better than the average -- in a much better than average environment.

The menu is huge so hopefully the other dishes impress.  Overall, I like the place and would come back.  (But skip the chile relleno.)
