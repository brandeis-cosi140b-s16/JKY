I made an online reservation through yelp for cinco de mayo. I received more than one email confirmation and text confirmations about my reservation. Once I arrived they told me they weren't accepting any online reservations.... Well that would have been nice to know before getting my phone blown up with "confirmations" that apparently weren't confirming crap! Strike one.

Later I ordered a patron margarita with salt along the rim. Instead of salt, my rim was covered in sugar. Yuck!!! The margarita mix itself was even a nightmare. Never bothered sending my margarita back because the waiter was hardly even around. 

Ordered a wet burrito with green sauce. The food runner brought out my wet burrito with red sauce instead. Didn't bother sending it back because at this point I was done with waiting and was starving. 

Only reason this place gets two stars is because their wet burrito was tasty despite having the wrong sauce.. Won't be back however.
