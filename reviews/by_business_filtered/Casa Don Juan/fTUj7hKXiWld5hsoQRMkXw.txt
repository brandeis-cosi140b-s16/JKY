4 of us came here with low expectations, and I'm still giving this place 1*. 

None of us were at all pleased with what we got. The only saving graces are:
* We probably didn't need to eat that much food anyway, so leaving 1/2-3/4 of our food was ok
* Right down the block from the Velveteen Rabbit, one of our favorite little spots for a drink.

Will not be back. Things said during our dinner: Too dry, flavorless, gross, something seems wrong.

To be fair, I've actually *heard* from someone that this place is decent, and they were shocked at my feedback. I hope I'm wrong, but our experience was atrocious.

Even the chips and salsa: the chips were stale and the salsa was awful.

There's plenty of better food around -- don't waste a meal here.
