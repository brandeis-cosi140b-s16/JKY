We went to eat here on a Saturday night. Called ahead first because they're was 8 of us. Food was great. Carne Asada is very tender and they have homemade tortillas. Priced very reasonable. Service was fast and great. We decided to go back the next morning on Sunday with s party of 25. Just as good and menudo was awesome.
