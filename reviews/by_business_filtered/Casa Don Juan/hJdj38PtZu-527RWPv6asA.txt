I first must say that in the last few months they changed their pricing on their menus.  I am EXTREMELY disappointed to find out that taking my family of four used to be around $40-45 with tip with 4 plates and water for each of us.  Now it's $60-$70 for the four of us for the same 4 plates and water for each of us.  My wife's plate used to be $8.99 for one taco, one enchilada, rice and beans.  Now it's $13.99 for the same plate!!!  Really Don Juans, it's necessary to charge it up $5 extra dollars for ONE plate?  I live in Henderson and would trek up to the north side of the strip for this and let's just say, NOT ANY MORE!!!  Very disappointed Don Juans, very disappointed!!!
