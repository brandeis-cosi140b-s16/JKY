I gave this restaurant 4 star ONLY because k haven't tasted everything. 

Their menudo is on point. Great Cadillac marg's. However, k had the chilaquiles con steak this past Sunday and omg, my mouth has watered ever since. A nice, tender piece of arrachera atop seasoned and sauces chilaquiles and an egg over medium? PERFECTION. The guac, SS's and bean dip w chips was mmmmm mmmm mmmm too!
