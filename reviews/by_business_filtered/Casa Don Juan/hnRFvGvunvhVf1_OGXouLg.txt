We had breakfast at this long established, downtown Mexican eatery on our first morning in town.  The restaurant is a festive motif.  We were served industrial tortilla chips, a watery salsa and a lightweight bean dip.  We each chose huevos rancheros that were accompanied by watery refried beans and the usual tasteless Spanish rice.  Nothing was bad, nor was anything particularly good.  Our bill came up short of our gift certificate's face value so we ordered 2 slices of (mediocre) flan to go.
