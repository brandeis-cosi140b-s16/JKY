When Downtown, my business partner and I will come here for lunch.

Growing up in the south, I have eaten a lot of Mexican food, This place will satisfy your craving. When you sit down , you get chips, salsa & beans.
Chips - great, Salsa - I've had better Beans - they need to be seasoned. 

 Big fan of their Caldo soup, however I wish they would trim the meat off the bones and just keep the bones in while cooking and not serving them to you. Great sides of onions, cilantro & limes to add in to your bowl of beef, vegetables & broth. 

Service is excellent! Atmosphere is good too!
