We were staying at the Stratosphere a couple years ago and we wanted some Mexican food. But we wanted a nicer then your average hole in the wall and by chance as we exited the freeway on the way to our hotel we came across CASA DON JUAN!!!
Pricey but the food is delicious!!
Now everytime were in Vegas we dine here and have yet to be disappointed...
I've only given 4 stars because we haven't tried everything on the menu, yet lol
