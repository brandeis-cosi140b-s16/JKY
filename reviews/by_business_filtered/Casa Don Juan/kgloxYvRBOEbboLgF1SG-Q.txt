We went with friends during first friday and despite the fact they were extremely busy, we were seated within a couple of minutes.
The wait staff is very attentive and quick.
The margaritas are okay... very large in size, but nothing spectacular in taste.
This same theme repeated itself with our meal..... very large portions, but nothing spectacular in taste.
The chips, salsa, and beans were pretty good but chips aren't warm or exceptionally fresh. The salsa was fresh but had no spice to it at all.
I had a chicken enchilada and a cheese enchilada with rice and beans.... it was okay... not bad.... not really anything to get excited about.
My husband had the whole fried fish (tilapia). He said it was good.
Our friends ordered the chicken fajitas and the steak fajitas. The portions are very large, but again flavors are bland, nothing seemed very fresh. It was just very ordinary and quite flavorless.
There are so many great Mexican restaurants in Las Vegas that I just can't see myself coming back to Casa Don Juan again.
