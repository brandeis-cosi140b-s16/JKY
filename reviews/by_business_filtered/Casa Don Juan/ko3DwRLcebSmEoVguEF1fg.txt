My husband and I and two other friends came here on Saturday, March 14th our experience was wasn't great at all. We waited a while for our order to be taken. We asked several times for water we never got. Our drinks ; mango margaritas and other drinks tasted awful like water no liquor whatsoever. Our food wasn't great at all it tasted like you something you buy at the market reheatable meals. Our waiter probably visited our table maybe twice in the two hours that we were there.  We should've just stopped at McDonald's it would've been way much better.  I wish I could give it zero stars but unfortunately Yelp doesn't allow me to.
