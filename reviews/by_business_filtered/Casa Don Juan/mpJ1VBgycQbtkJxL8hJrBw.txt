Second review... I gave five stars the first time but the chimichanga was not what I would expect from a Mexican restaurant. The food here is just okay... Maybe I'm just used to home made Mexican food because my mom cooks so delicious. 
I say give it a try and judge for yourself. My husband really likes the shrimp tostadas.
