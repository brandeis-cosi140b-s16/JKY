Vegas tends to be about chain restaurants, trendy bars, and over the top decor but if you're searching for a "hole-in-the-wall" type Mexican food joint, this would be the place. 

The theme is your (hate to say it) typical Mexican cheese factor with the bright colors, tacky uniforms, and singing guitar guy but once you plop down in a booth and get snacking on their chips, salsa and guacamole, you'll forgive the rest. 

Are the chips made fresh? Nah, is the guacamole and salsa? Who knows. What I CAN tell you is that it's good! I dined on the chicken tacos after 2 baskets of chips and salsa and I found the rice, beans, and entree itself to be mighty tasty. 

Is it a show stopping place for Mexican food? Not really but if you want that authentic, non-chain feel that few and far between seem to offer in this town, then check out Casa Don Juan's. 

4 margaritas (I had company OK), guacamole, 2 entrees, and feeling happy and full cost us about $40! Not bad for good eatin.
