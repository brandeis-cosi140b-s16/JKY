Terrible customer service. Our family went in for late breakfast and was seated on a wobbly table. We asked to be moved, but nothing was done. Waiter spilled our drink on one of the plates and took him over 20 minutes to replace. We were already done with our meals. Manager was called and he did not offer to comp the dish that was replaced. I have never heard that a manager is unable to fix bill. He said he was sorry, yet our experience was destroyed. Never again will I go there. Horrible Customer Service.
