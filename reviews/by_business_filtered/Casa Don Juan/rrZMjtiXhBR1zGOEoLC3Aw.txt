So this place has consistently been getting worse each time I've been coming here.  Not sure if they plan on getting better.

A huge vegetarian alert:  according to Javier, almost everything is cooked with lard....even the chips.

That's sad as the last time I asked he didn't mention that.  Service can definitely be improved.
