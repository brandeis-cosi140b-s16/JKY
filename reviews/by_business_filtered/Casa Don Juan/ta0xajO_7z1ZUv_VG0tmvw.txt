If you're looking for that delicious, authentic, hole-in-the-wall restaurant then you've found it! Just off the beaten path a bit, where tourists rarely venture, is Casa Don Juan.

The restaurant is quaint and comfortable with a lively Mexican atmosphere. Most of the staff members are very friendly and attentive. They will make excellent menu recommendations.

You have to get the queso dip! And the guacamole! Both really are amazing and make perfect starters. I've tried a lot on the menu and you honestly can't go wrong with whatever you choose. The food has a ton of flavor and is always prepared perfectly!

This is the kind of place you can go for dinner and drinks with a few friends and have a good time! You will have a delicious meal and leave satisfied.
