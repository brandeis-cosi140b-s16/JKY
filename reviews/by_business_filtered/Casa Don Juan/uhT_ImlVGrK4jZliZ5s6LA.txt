Vegas is seriously lacking on good Mexican food; almost as much as Chinese. Most of the Mexican restaurants we have tried are a small step up from Taco Bell. Casa Don Juan is the saving grace here...

Every time I have gone they have been incredibly busy, yet they are still quick to get chips, drinks and orders out. The food is amazing. The guac is def fresh, the cheese dip is a meal in itself and its always difficult to save room for the amazing fried ice cream. 

I have ordered something different every time I've gone - the veggie burrito and the taco's are probably the best in my book, but it all looks good.

If you haven't gone here, go. It's the anti typical Vegas Mexican Restaurant.
