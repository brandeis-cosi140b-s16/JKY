Definitely would come back here next time we come to Vegas.

My boyfriend and I came here first time . We were recommend by our cab driver that this place was awesome. & he did not let us down 

Service is great, seating was fast and food was served really quick. 

The plates are huge and the food is delicious  people are really friendly and check up on you to make sure everything is going really good. Good experience make sure to try the shrimp ceviche and wet burritos ...
