Yummy!  Yummy!  Yummy!  Get in my tummy.

We got take out from here on Christmas Eve based on yelp reviews and the fact that it would be open.  Ordered Deluxe Nachos, Taco Salad with shredded beef, Colorado Burrito with rice and beans, Tamale with rice and beans, Tacos al Carbon and 2 grilled cheese kids meals - one with rice and beans and the other with fries.  The total was $59 and it came with chips and salsa.  The service was friendly and the food was amazing.

I was craving it so much that we went back to dine in only 4 days later.  This time I ordered the combination plate with Colorado burrito, chili relleno and all beans.  My son tried a chimichanga and my daughter had the chicken strips.  The chips and salsa are so good.  I'm not sure if you get free refills on them though because they never offered.  Loved the burrito and chili relleno.  The beans are a little bit flavorless and the chimichanga was was easy to forget.... It was very lightly fried.  My daughter wouldn't really eat the chicken strips because it was a big breast of chicken breaded and fried and then sliced.  She didn't like that the strips were not fully breaded.

I look forward to going back again.

Cute and super clean facility.
