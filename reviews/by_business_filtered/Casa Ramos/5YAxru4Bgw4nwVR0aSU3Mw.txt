Me and my family visited this location, and I think the only word that fits this place is great!I I believe we went there on Valentine's Day and they had mariachis and the food was amazing plus our waiter Juan set our experience over-the-top. I would really enjoy if they kept the mariachis on the weekends. We will be returning, see you soon the Clark family!
