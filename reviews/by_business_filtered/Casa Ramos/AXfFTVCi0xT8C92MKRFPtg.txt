I a born in Mesa gal and know good Mexican food when I taste it.  I read all the reviews and decided to try this place.  The restaurant is on Main, between Stapley and Gilbert in the old "Golden Fork" building.  The interior is Mex Style with faux adobe, artwork and the like.  We were seated promptly for lunch and immediately brought chips and salsa.  Both were good.  Our server promptly took our order. We both had Lunch Special "2" which is a taco+enchilada served with beans and rice.  Plates were super hot, beans were good, rice was good but it ended for me there.  The cheese enchilada was bland and the taco meat too "Fake" tasting.  It had that taco seasoning flavor.  I was genuinely underwhelmed by the place.  It wasn't bad, wasn't good.  The carpet in the restaurant is filthy and must be replaced (this time put in tile) I found the carpet a that a little off putting.  $6.50 for a lunch special which is good.  Like I said,  the food was serviceable but certainly not in any way memorable.  They do have happy hour -- $3 house margaritas and 2 for 1 beer.  I might go back someday for that but I would never go again for the food.  The Filibertos next door has better food (and a drive through)  :-)
