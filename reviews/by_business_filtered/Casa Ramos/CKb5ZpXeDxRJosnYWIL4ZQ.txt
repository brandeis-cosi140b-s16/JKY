I was in Mesa for business and wanted some good Mexican. My hotel sent me to a different Mexican restaurant but when I got there they said they were closing. I jumped on Yelp and drove to Casa Ramos and I am glad that I did. Their chips and salsa were great. I ordered the Colorado burrito and the meat was tender and the sauce was perfect. I look forward to returning and trying other things on the menu.
