Great  food.  

The initial impression of the building sets the expectations low as does the average decor of the restaurant.  However, the first taste of the homemade salsa told me this could be a great meal- and it was.  

The pork carnitas were amazing as were all of the trimmings.  The tamales were a little thicker than they needed to be but the owner's personable son, tending bar, assured me they are working on bringing those up to par with the rest of the food.  

Highly recommend this place if you want some great Mexican food.
