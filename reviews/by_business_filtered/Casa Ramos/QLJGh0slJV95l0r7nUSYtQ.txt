LOVE this joint!  Our new favorite Mexican place, thanks to Yelpers!

Been there twice now in as many weeks, even took the kids.  I still can't get you out of my mind, Casa Ramos.

First of all, this MUST be a family joint because the service is incredible and you can tell they really care about pleasing you as a customer.   The chips are fresh and hot and they have a few different kick ass salsas.  Their 'house' salsa has the perfect amount of kick and chunk, they also offered us a milder sals for the wimpletons at the table, then they brought me the jalape√±o habanero salsa.  All three were fresh and tasty as hell.  I bet you can't have just one bowl of chips.

I get the carne asada burrito with green extra spicy enchilada sauce.  The meat is super tender, perfectly grilled skirt steak.  It practically melts in your mouth and you can tell its a good quality cut of meat.  My wife gets the chicken and steak fajitas, which were aslo amazing.

To top it off, we had fried ice cream.  Definitely a hand made house recipe and also seemed fresher than any fried ice cream we'd ever had.

God I love this place.  So much so, I had to dust off my yelp account to let everyone know.  Go, now, don't hesitate.  Oh and great house margaritas!
