I came here during the Lunch hour, and at first I was a little apprehensive about the place. It was completely empty, but reviews said it was good, so my Dad and I went in. The chips and salsa were excellent. I usually never find the "house" salsas of restaurants to be hot enough for me, but this one was spot on. I ordered chicken enchiladas and I was pleasantly surprised at how good they were! The chicken was shredded, moist, and nicely seasoned. The enchilada sauce itself was smooth, slightly spicy, and pretty good overall. The rice served with the dish was also very good. I would come back here again.
