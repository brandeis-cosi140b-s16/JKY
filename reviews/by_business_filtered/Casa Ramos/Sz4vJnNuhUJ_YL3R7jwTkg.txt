First of all, the rave reviews were accurate.  I brought my wife, my 3yr old son and my 94yr old grandmother to this place because we were looking for the best Mexican food in town.  I used Yelp to find this gem since I don't know the area very well.  It was hard to believe that a restaurant can maintain a 5 star rating, but now I see why.

Everyone was so accommodating.  The hostess seated us in a nice quiet booth so we could have a nice conversation.  She also offered to track down some crayons and sheets of paper for my son because they didn't have a kids coloring menu.  

The waitstaff were also extremely accommodating.  They were prompt with their service, but were also available to answer questions (which they had knowledgable answers).

The food was amazing and reasonable.  Everything is fresh and homemade.  Yes, the salsa is good, and the entrees were large and tasty, but what really made the experience special was the fried ice cream the size of my 3yr old's head.  I am not usually a fried ice cream guy, but somehow I made room.

The restaurant was very clean and pleasant.  I saw some reviews stating that the neighborhood looked sketchy, but I felt completely safe.  The parking lot was well lit and there were people coming and going regularly.  There was nothing rough about it.  I would gladly bring my family back.  

Thanks for the experience Casa Ramos!
