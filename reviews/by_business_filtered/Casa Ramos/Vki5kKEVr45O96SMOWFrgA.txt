I visited this place with a group of co-workers after work looking for a good margarita.  This was definitely the correct choice!  I myself ordered the Premium margarita with Penasco tequila, no salt, and on the rocks, and let me say WOW!  What a great drink, they didn't skimp on the pour and didn't over do it with flavors.  It really hit the spot after a long day.  Although we only ordered a couple appetizers, the food seemed to taste ok for being a basic nacho plate and a large quesadilla.
