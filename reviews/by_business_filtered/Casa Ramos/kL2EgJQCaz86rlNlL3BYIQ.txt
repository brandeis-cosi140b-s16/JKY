This place is great! A surprise spot in my neck of the woods I was unaware of. I'm a native to the east valley, so having Mexican food I can enjoy outside of my extended family's cooking is difficult. I can't give it 5 stars because the service didn't blow my socks off, but the food is outstanding. You have to ask for their hot green sauce, it will burn you. :)
