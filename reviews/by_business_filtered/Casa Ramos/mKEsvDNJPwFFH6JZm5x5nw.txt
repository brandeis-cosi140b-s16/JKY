Casa Ramos was a last minute change of plans. Upon walking in the place was Hot temperature wise, and uncomfortable.  The service was not great and not bad. They were quick to get our drinks and chips, but then took forever to come snd take our order. This was surprising since there wasn't too many people in the restaurant. I ordered the lunch special combo which comes with an Enchilada ,burrito, rice and beans. The burritos and Enchiladas were a solid 3 of 5 stars.  Not great but not bad. So hot restaurant , 2 stars, ok food 3 stars, and ok service. Just an ok rating in my book. One positive was the lemonade, it was really good
