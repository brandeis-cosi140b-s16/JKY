Chips and salsa were good - service was good. Once our order was taken, it took a considerable amount of time for our food to come out. At first, I almost became upset - but the food was well worth the wait! Someone in my party ordered the steak fajitas and the hot plate sizzled for a good 5-7 minutes at the table. Portions were large and the food was authentic. Will gladly eat there again!
