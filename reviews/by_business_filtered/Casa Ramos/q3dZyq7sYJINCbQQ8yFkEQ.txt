Unique and delicious Mexican food.  The shrimp dishes are our favorites, and Ben and Kenny are always up for new ideas.  I'm a little bias, though ... we have been dining at the Heber, AZ Casa Ramos since the day it opened. Friday, my mojo de ajo in the very nice Mesa location was perfect and then some. And the Cruz blanco margaritas might replace our normal Patrones in the future.
