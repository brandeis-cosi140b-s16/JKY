We we're served fermented salsa.  Unfortunately our 1.5 yr old didn't spot it.  When mom tasted it after a few minutes she freaked out a bit.  Serving spoiled food should is a huge problem!  At this point, the waiter should have been profusely apologizing and getting us margaritas.  

The food is OK.  I tried some garlic shrimp and a relle√±o on a previous visit.  Average food, above average for Mesa I suppose.  
 
The service has been slow and unapologetic on both visits, so I'll have to pass on this place from now on.
