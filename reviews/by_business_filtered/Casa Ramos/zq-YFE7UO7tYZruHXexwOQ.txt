If anyone EVER gives this place a low mark, then they do not know good Mexican food.  Service is always perfect; Kenny knows what we order to drink as soon as he sees us enter.  Special requests for unique dishes are honored with no problem--my husband likes the marinated meat they use for Tacos Pastor, but prefers to have it in a burrito version--no problem. I have tried a variety of different dishes but can't beat the price of the Burrito Colorado--ala carte with no rice and beans they only charge $3.50! Are you kidding? After I indulge on all the chips and salsa, I can barely finish it--so delicious and large portions.  I almost hate to give raving reviews because then our little secret restaurant becomes too popular, but I want to see Kenny succeed, so I will. You will not be unsatisfied.
