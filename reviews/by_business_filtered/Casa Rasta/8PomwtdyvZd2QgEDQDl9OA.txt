Casa Rasta has very good food but I'm still not convinced that it will be part of my regular restaurant rotation.  If you're hungry for decent Mexican/Caribbean fare, by all means go.  The food won't disappoint you and our waitress was wonderful -- very engaging but not over the top and annoying.  Our wait wasn't excessive but it was a bit trying, and it was also freezing -- we had to move tables.   CR has also landed a new location, perhaps after they work out some of the kinks, they can focus on the decor, which still has remnants of the previous restaurant Lunardis.  That aside, food was great -- I had a chorizo burrito, my husband had a goat burrito and my son had jerk chicken wings.  For dessert, we had a chocolate cheesecake that was far less cheesecakey than it was mousse-like.  Delicious.
