As much as I really want to give Casa Rasta a 3 star update, their food and the laid-back byob atmosphere continue to be its saving grace.

Unfortunately, that same laid-back environment is its biggest downfall.  After a bad experience at Casa (following what were typically good experiences at their original smaller location) we decided to give it another go.  Unfortunately, the same issues we experienced when they moved to their larger location endure months later.  On two occasions now, a majority of the menu has been unavailable and the service has been downright terrible.  Long wait times following being seated, infrequent visits, and worse of all, 1-1.5 hour plus waits for simple food that doesn't really dictate that kind of turnaround.

Casa Rasta will likely pull me in one more time before the end of summer (I can't help it), but a third strike will definitely put this promising establishment out of my repertoire of go-to's.
