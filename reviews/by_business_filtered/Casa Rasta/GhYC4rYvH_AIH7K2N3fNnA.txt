I finally got my husband to try Casa Rasta for dinner last weekend. I was so excited! That didn't last long. He really liked his $10 carnitas torta but my beef tacos ($4 each) looked and tasted like the meat had been sitting out on the counter all day long. Dry and unappetizing, to say the least. My husband may have liked his sandwich, but the meat had the same problem, dried out to the point of being crunchy on the edge (unintentional crunchiness for this dish). My tacos looked so lonely and naked sitting on the plate all curled up at the edges with hardly any condiments on them. I did add the complementary red and green salsas which helped enormously. At Mad Mex you get three tacos and beans and rice for $12-14 and they are so much better. We were there on a Saturday night and it was busy, so I don't understand dried out and tired food. Our server looked like he came straight from performing in High School Musical. The whole place seemed to run by high schoolers. He was nice but so awkward I thought he was performing from a script. We also had the avocado fries appetizer. I'd had this before and loved it but this time the $8 charge got me half of a very small avocado and the app was brought out with our meal. It wasn't hot, my tacos weren't hot, but oddly enough, my husband's torta was. Like everything else sat around and waited for the torta to be prepared. I loved this place when it was small and struggling. Success seems to have gone to their heads.
