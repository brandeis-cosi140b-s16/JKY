We moved to Beechview back in April and Casa Rasta was the restaurant we visited to celebrate when we got the keys to our new house. Our first visit there was amazing. So jaw-droppingly amazing that we have tried to go back to redeem all of our bad experiences and we keep leaving severely disappointed. While we hope the service and the food will improve, we are skeptical and have decided to take our support of local businesses elsewhere (particularly to El Milagro, on the other side of Beechview).

Our past 5 visits we went they have been out of at least 2 items -- ironically, it would seem, they are always the items that I want to order. So disappointment #1.

Since just prior to the opening of their East Liberty location, service has gone down the tubes. We often know more about the food than the servers, and we never have a visit to Casa Rasta last less than an hour -- even when our selections are easy, like tacos and burritos. It often takes at least 20 minutes for someone to come take our order, and then it often takes 30-40 minutes for our food to get out, even when the place is empty. When it's packed, be ready for a 2-hour visit. So, disappointment #2.

Additionally, the past handful of visits, at least one person in our party's food has been not just lukewarm, but cold. That being said, you feel like it's hardly worth complaining about because even when you send in complaints via email, you never get a response, and if you mention it there in the restaurant, you'd be waiting another 30 minutes just to get hot food when you've already likely waited for 45 minutes. So, disappointment #3.
