This place is a little slice of heaven tucked away in Beechview--I'm not sure I would've gave this place a second glance save for the outstanding Yelp reviews. If you love Mexi-type fare, this place is certainly for you. 

I went with a friend for an early dinner on the weekend, and the place was empty when we started, but overflowing by the time we left. If you have a larger party, you should consider making a reservation. The place is also BYOB, and they have a fantastic margarita mix I highly recommend to tequila lovers. It was just the perfect mix of sweet and citrusy, and I believe you get unlimited mix with corkage fee.

The space is cute with great art, and they have outdoor seating for warmer days. They also seem to do a hearty take-out business, which I'll have to remember for those strictly sweatpants kind of days. 

We ordered the Avocado Fries to start, and they were FANTASTIC. The concept of fried avocado sounded odd, but based on recommendations, we couldn't pass them up. They were crispy but avocao-y inside, and the sauce complimented the flavor perfectly. 

We also order the Flautas half veggie and half chicken. I just kept chomping on the little taquitos. They were delicious, and a great dish to share. 

I know I need to go visit again, because I spent the majority of my meal staring/drooling at what other people ordered. The menu is large and varied, and I'll be back again soon to try more dishes out.
