I enjoyed my first trip to Casa Rasta.  (There will DEFINITELY be many, many more visits, this just happened to be the first.)

Our server, Kim, was warm and inviting.  I asked her about the history of the restaurant and she explained it is family owned and most of the employees are friends.  It really shows that these people know and like each other.

A  friend recommended this restaurant me when I was complaining that I usually send my food back at chains restaurants because the food doesn't taste as good as  prices would suggest.  The prices at Casa Rasta could double and it would still be worth the cost.

The dining room is small so we were advised to make reservations for weekend evenings.  The interesting artwork on the walls is from local artist and is for sale, which I liked.

I don't even know where to start with the food. I like spice, spice and more spice.  The salsas fit the bill.  The guacamole had a lot of flavor.  The beans... oh the beans... were fantastic.  I'm from the southwestern US where beans are an art form and these were as well prepared as I have ever had.  The flautas was crispy and well seasoned.  The jerk chicken wings were delicious. Even the Yucca Chips were good, although, for some reason, I expected them to be warm and they weren't.  Nothing on the menu suggested the Yucca Chips were warm, so that was just me.  They were still really good.

To sum it all up, I was delighted.  The service, the food and the prices were better than any chain in the Pittsburgh area.  The food was delicious.  I wish I had found this little gem earlier.
