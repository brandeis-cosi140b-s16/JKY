Am I missing something?

Given the excellent reviews I dined here with great expectations.  The tacos were so lack luster I thought--the chef is having an off night.  I came back the very next night to try this place again and it was WORSE!

I'm sorry, I SO wanted to like this please because I.LOVE.TACOS.  Who does not love tacos?  How can a taco possibly go wrong?  I just don't know what happened.

The tortillas are made in house, but they taste like they were deep fried and are mushy.  I had the carnitas tacos and they were completely bland.  Everything needs salt, which honestly is kind of refreshing considering most restaurants over salt every thing.  This taco was basically wet soft meat in a mushy tortilla.  Queso fresco and some ripe tomatos could have saved this taco but neither was an option.  You get meat, in a soggy tortilla, with onions on it.  There are home made salsas available but both only added heat. not flavor.

The next night I came back and tried the fajitas.  You get a pile of gristly meat over pungent red peppers.  No cheese, no guacamole, no anything but meat and peppers to put in your soggy tortilla.

I am confused by all the great reviews.  This place is right next to Davio's and the entire time I was dining here I kept thinking how much better my meal would be if I were having dinner at Davio.

The staff is very friendly, but the food...  I honestly am so confused by the good reviews.  I really want to like this place.  The food is AWFUL.

Two stars for the friendly staff.
