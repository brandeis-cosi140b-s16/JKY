Decided to try this place after looking it up online......Never Again! Horrible food. Server was very unaware of what was going on. Every question asked about the menu she had no clue.  You can definitely tell the difference between someone who enjoys their job and someone who is just there for a paycheck. Not to mention food being unavailable. We ordered the Jambalaya, Coconut Tofu and Jerk Tofu..... horrible. The rice was not cooked all the way. Food was hard and very bland!  The Jambalaya was straight out of a Zatarain's with some Jamaican seasoning... as a business owner, professional chef, West Indian, world traveler and foodie this was by far the worst food I have ever had... overpriced and underrepresented.....


 Waste of money...

Staff needs to be trained better on customer service....
