I have wanted to try this place ever since Munch wrote it up in the P-G.  The timing was good because they just moved into a new sit-down location a couple of doors up from the old place right on the Red Line.  

I guess the biggest surprise is that Julie and I ate, and ate pretty well, for under $20 (including tip).  Our waiter, Sam, with his waiter in training, Manuel did a pretty good job serving us.  Sam spent some time explaining the entire menu to us.  I had brought beer and they brought out a frosted mug for me.  

I tend to like spicy; so I ordered Sam's recommended spicy dishes.  Whether you order a taco, tostada, burrito or quesadilla, you can order it with the different meat combos that they serve.  I ordered 3 soft corn tacos.  The tortillas seemed homemade-with a real strong corn flavor.  I ordered one with pulled pork, one with shrimp diablo and one with poblano chilis and potatoes.  Julie ordered a quesadilla with beef in mole sauce and a tostada with jamaican jerk chicken.  

Each taco I ate was spiecier than the last.  I usually like spicy; but this was over the top for me.  My taco with pulled pork had an avocado cream sauce and pineapple mixed in.  The pineapple was the best part because it gave some sweetness to the spicy pork.  The shrimp diablo had me hiccuping, which means I had gone too far with the spicy.  The poblano chili and potato had thin strips of fresh poblano chilis and a cream sauce on top.  Notwithstanding how spicy the tacos were, they were flavorful.  I recommend you ask the waiter to tone down the spicy (something I have never done before, but will the next time I am here). 

Julie's quesadilla with mole sauce was excellent. So was her jamaican jerk chicken with pieces of mango in it. 

When we arrived the place was pretty empty; but by the time we left, the place was packed.  The place is very casual and BYOB.  Don't expect an upscale meal here.  But the food is extremely fresh and different.  A great part of the SH scene.
