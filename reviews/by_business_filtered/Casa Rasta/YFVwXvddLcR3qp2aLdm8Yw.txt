How have I not reviewed my favorite Mexican fusion restaurant? I've only eaten at the restaurant once and had a nice time. I'm a big "to go" customer. Their salsa verde is sublime. Vegetarians, I insist you try the soyrizo and/or poblano and potato burritos (sometimes I ask for both in one burrito!) Yes. I am that loco.
