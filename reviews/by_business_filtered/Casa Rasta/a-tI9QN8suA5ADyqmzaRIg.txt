Really nice place, super friendly servers...they've all tried everything on the menu and the food tastes extremely authentic.  The art is always different each time I go, but very cool.  It's awesome that they promote local artists.

I haven't made it yet, but every other Thursday night they have live entertainment.  Something to look forward to when the snow stops!!!
