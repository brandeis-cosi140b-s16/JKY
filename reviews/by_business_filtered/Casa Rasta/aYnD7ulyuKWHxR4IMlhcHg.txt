My star rating may be a bit over exaggerating but I felt like this place had the makings of a 4 star experience.  I also was extremely hungry when I went here so most anything would have tasted wonderful.

We ordered the yucca chips and guacamole.  It would have been really great if it wasn't doused in a pound of salt.  You had to literally wipe the salt off the yucca chips.  The guac tasted salty too but I think if the yucca chips were normally salted this would have been a perfect combo because the guac tasted fresh and the chips were light and crispy.

I ordered the Jamaican Jerk Chicken taco and the Beef taco.  I had originally placed an order for the shrimp a la Diabla taco but we were told they ran out of shrimp.  I asked for a recommendation from the waiter and he mentioned that if I liked spicy food I should go with the Jamaican Jerk Chicken taco.  However after receiving both the chicken and beef taco - the beef definitely packed some heat while the Jamaican Jerk wasn't as sizzling as he suggested. 

Also the chicken did not look like chicken, it looked like beef but didn't have a strong beef flavor so I was utterly confused by what I was putting in to my mouth trying to discern the mystery meat.  They may have used dark chicken meat or it was saturated in some colored flavoring that made it unidentifiable to the naked eye and unsophisticated palette.  In any event, this wasn't  the star of the show.  I would highly recommend the Beef (Carne de Birria) taco.  

It's byob which is a plus and the staff was very friendly and we came about 30 minutes prior to closing so there's something to be said about that.  I would definitely return and explore the menu.
