Really!  What happened?
Also, what is your name, Really!
The sign on the side of the building says Abierto Abora : Las Palmas.
The menu which has taken all the tacos off, says Las Palmas : Casta Rasta.

Called at 4, 5, 5:30, 6 to see if still open...No Answer just a recording to leave a message.

There were a couple of empty tables when we arrived and one large table that was reserved.  All tables filled up later because of a large group that arrived later.  The menu has some interesting items but we decided to just have a burrito - I had the Carnitas.  It was not very good.  Did not have the flavor of Carnitas or taste like the Carnitas that use to come out of Casa Rasta. SWMBO had the Jamaican Jerk and it had big chunks of chicken and tasted like my pork burrito.

Our waitress was OK and able to answer some questions, but was the only waitress.  The Chef delivered our meals, he is the same Chef that was at Casa Rasta.
