The GUACAMOLE. Get it. So yummy with the yucca chips. For dinner, I had the delicious jumbalaya in all of its spicy two-different-kinds-of-chorizo goodness. The service is super friendly. The atmosphere is relaxed and comfortable - definitely a quaint spot I'll be returning to frequently. A tad on the pricey side, but well worth it in my opinion. Highly recommended.
