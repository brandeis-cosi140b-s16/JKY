Great new location for one of my favorite restaurants.  I went tonight (their 3rd night in the new location).  Finally some tables to sit at and talk.The food was great as always, however the service was a bit under par given how new the dining room was.  I had to find out waitress to ask for more water, and she never told us about the evening's specials (!).  I'm sure things will get better as they iron out the bugs, and that aside the food is always amazing.  Make sure you order a desert!
