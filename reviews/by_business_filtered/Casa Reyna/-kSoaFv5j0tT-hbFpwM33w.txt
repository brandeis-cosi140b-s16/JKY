Well, Pgh, you may have finally done it. You may have an actual decent, if not GOOD Mexican restaurant in your midst. I've been sampling Mexican from Leetsdale to Lawrenceville and been mostly disappointed. But now they're onto something!  A great looking space, xlnt service and delicious food. Chips and salsa and tortillas top notch! My carnitas chile verde was super tender and tasty. A little heavy on the salt, but haven't had such good Mx since leaving SF Bay. Also very generous drinks. I'm def. going back to try other dishes. Go dig.
