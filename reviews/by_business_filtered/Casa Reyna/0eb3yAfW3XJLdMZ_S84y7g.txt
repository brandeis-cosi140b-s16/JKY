Mexican food is the gateway to my soul I think... I will never not love Mexican food ever. Despite the fact that I could easily transform into the Mexican version of violet beiraguard from willy wonka if I ate it that frequently.. 

Anywho, casa Reyna is great. It's very authentic to me and the feel of the atmosphere alone speaks for itself. It's hidden in a cool little basement downstairs or you could opt for the outside if it's a nice day. The tequila selection is on point and if you like it like I do then it won't disappoint!! The service is very kind and fast so we had no issues. Definitely look forward to my return!
