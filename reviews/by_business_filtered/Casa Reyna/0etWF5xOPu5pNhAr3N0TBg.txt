Finally! I've found a good Mexican restaurant in Pittsburgh! I'm from Southern California, so I was raised on amazing Mexican food - and this is really good. 

I started out with a margarita - which came in an awesome shaker. It was pretty good, but I've noticed that margaritas out east are A LOT sweeter than margaritas in SoCal. If I want a perfect margarita ... I'm going to have to make it myself - at home. 

Instead of getting entrees, my mom and I ordered multiple appetizers. We got the mini taco plate with fish and shrimp, sweet corn tamales, the sope with vegetarian toppings, and rice/beans. The tacos were amazing - especially the fish. The sweet corn tamales cakes were just okay, not bad - but definitely not good. I've had tamales before and sweet corn tamale cakes - and they have never had cinnamon like these did. Just not good ... If you want really good sweet corn tamale cakes, go to Cheesecake Factory (do they have those out here?). The sope was good, but a little crunchy on the bottom - not sure if that's how they are supposed to be, but I've never had them like that before. The rice and black beans were good also. 

All and all, I will definitely go back - and I will have the fish tacos again! I will try their enchiladas one of these days.
