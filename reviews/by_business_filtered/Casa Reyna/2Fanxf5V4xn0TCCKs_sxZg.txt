Came here for my birthday after doing the Pittsburgh Party Pedaler. Perfect spot to get dinner if you are doing the bicycle bar, btw. Reserved a table for 14. Prompt service, attentive, orders correct, and most importantly great food. Of the 14 people in my party, not one complaint. Will definitely go again.
