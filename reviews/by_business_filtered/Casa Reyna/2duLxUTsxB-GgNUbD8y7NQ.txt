Had high hopes but what I found was an over-priced chi-chi's copy. I will say that the tortilla chips & salsas sampler WAS good n tasty, however. It's more like an on-the-main-drag tourist trap kind of restaurant than an honest attempt at authentic Mexican cuisine .  
I think i'd definetly be interested in buying a bunch of their salsas to go, sometime as well as their fresh tortilla chips but i'll skip the rest of it .
