Casa Reyna is the place I have been waiting for! Fast and friendly service and authentic delicious food at a good price. My favorite dish is the potato and chorizo tacos, they also have a large variety of delicious salsas. Good happy hour, you gotta go check it out. Best mexican food in the burgh by far - trust me I have tried them all!
