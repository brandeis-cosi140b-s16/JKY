Went on first night, service was great. The lamb 38.00 ( feeds 2) was moist and tasty but only 2 tortillas, I asked for more, got 2 more charged 1.25 extra. Love the food, though, space is very comfortable. Will go back, hope they give me more tortillas for the lamb as I did like it, especially with some of the yummy salsas.
