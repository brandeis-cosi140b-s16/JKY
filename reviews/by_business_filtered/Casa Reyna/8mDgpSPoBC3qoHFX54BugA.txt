I don't know how I got through 35.5 years on this planet without eating here.  It is amazing.  Yes, it's in a basement and kind of dungeon-y, but the food is out of this world.  The highlight of the meal (possibly my life) was the homemade tortilla chips and elote dip.  I've had dreams about this elote dip since.
