Good and authentic Mexican food, which is a rare and majestic thing in Pittsburgh!   I've found that, in general, some food is excellent, while others dishes are a bit underwhelming.  The tacos are in the "great" category, as are the more traditional and less Tex-mex-y dishes, such as the Carne en Chile Verde (braised pork), whereas the enchiladas are fine but nothing to freak out about.   I highly recommend all the salsas and house-made chips.  I also like that the margaritas come in a pitcher, which ends up being 2-3 glasses, so that's a good value. Next time I go I am trying the "Four Taditional Moles"

Last time I went we sat at the bar and the bartender was pretty knowledgeable about different tequilas, and extremely professional and friendly.  Kudos to him!
