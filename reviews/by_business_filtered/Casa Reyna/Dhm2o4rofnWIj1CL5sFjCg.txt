This place has potential but  tonight  it didn't .

The AC WAS NOT ON. it was a very humid evening,.

My blackberry margarita tasted watered down and very very weak. Even the color was weak
The same person was hostess bartender and server. Lol

The chipotle and salsa rosa were very good although needed  salt.

Chips were greasy and waxy tasting, yuk. They were shiny with grease.

Fish tacos had promise but were bland as could be and oil was dripping all over corn tortillas. They were drenched with oil

Refried beans were very good. 

Soups were awful, tasteless.
It was a slow night.

The atmosphere is very nice though
