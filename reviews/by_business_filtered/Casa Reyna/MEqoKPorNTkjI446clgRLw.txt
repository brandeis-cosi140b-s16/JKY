I never write reviews for restaurants based on the service, because I figure it varies a lot depending on the server/day/etc, and doesn't really impact the quality of food, or, usually, the experience. The service here was so bad, though.

It took awhile for our drinks and guacamole to come (made table side... By a child who can't be over 10-11), but not too horribly long. The guac (mediocre) didn't arrive with chips, which was weird, and we had to flag the server down and ask for them, at which point she asked us to "give her a minute," and came back about five min later with chips. She did seem really busy, so this, too, was fine. And then... We didn't see her again for about half an hour. From the time that we got our drinks, it took a full hour to get entrees - tacos and enchiladas shouldn't take anywhere near that long. During this hour, we also noticed a filthy rag that had apparently been left on our table before we sat down. Fun times. 

The tacos were actually pretty good, which is why I give two stars - but there is absolutely no excuse for having customers sit at a table for an hour and a half after ordering before their food comes, with no apology. Won't be back.
