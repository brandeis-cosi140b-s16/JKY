This is my second time here.  The food is hit or miss.  Misses are just meh, but the hits are good.

Tonight, I ordered the mini tacos and the Reyna Enchiladas.  

I ordered a split of steak and chorizo mini tacos.  They were both delicious--the steak tacos left my mouth a little dry, but they had a great flavor.  The chorizo were greasy and deliciousness wrapped in corn tortillas.

I ordered the Reyna Enchiladas as my entree, but to be honest, didn't like them enough to even finish.  Instead, I called the waitress back and ordered 4 more chorizo tacos.

I would definitely eat here again.
