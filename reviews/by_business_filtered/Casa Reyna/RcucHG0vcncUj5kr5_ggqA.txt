Super-sized margaritas, at a fabulous price!  We ordered two salsas, the tomatillo and chipotle--both were good but neither were very spicy as they were described (although my hubby and I indulge in spicy food all the time and our taste buds may be dead). We also ordered the elote dip which was refreshing! 

Hubby ordered the enchilada and steak dish (can't remember name), loved it!  I ordered the enchilada verde.  Dish was yummy but so huge I was only able to eat about a half of one!  

We will definitely go back!  The comments I read abt the waitstaff had us worried, but our waitress (blonde) was very attentive. I did see the other waitress checking her cell phone often :(
