SO SLOW!!!! The service was absolutely painful. The food was very overpriced for both the portion size and the quality. The food was totally adequate but nothing special. The draft beer was good (not too much to screw up there) but their "16 Oz draft" comes served in a 12 Oz glass, so be warned. First trip to the Strip, but it looked like there were much better places to drop $50.
