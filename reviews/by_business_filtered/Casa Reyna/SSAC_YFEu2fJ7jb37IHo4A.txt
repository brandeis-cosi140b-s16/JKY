I have eaten at Casa Reyna so many times & the food is always great. Love the atmosphere of the restaurant, they really nailed it. And as of last summer they opened outdoor seating which is always a plus in the summer. 
To start with, they offer 9 different salsas you can choice from. My favorite is the sweet mango & peanut. There's something for everybody, from mild to very hot. They make their chips onsite & they bring them out to you warm. The chips are bottomless so you can get refills. 
Also the Elote Dip appetizer is so good! Warm creamy cheesy corn that you eat with the chips. Fantastic!
I've tried a few different entrees. The jalape√±o tilapia with angel hair pasta is delicious. If you don't mind spicy this dish is a must try. Have not had a dish like this one at any other restaurant. However my favorite is the fish tacos. The fish is cooked perfectly, not greasy & lots of flavor. 
For dessert I highly recommend the tres leches cake. Which is Spanish for "3 milks cake". It's vanilla cake with vanilla icing & a vanilla cream poured over top. So sweet, creamy & delicious! 
At Casa Reyna service is always great & prices are very reasonable. They really have a lot of great dishes & I highly recommend them!
