Visited Casa Reyna on a Friday night and sat at an outside table, which seemed clearly preferable to one of the dungy basement tables. My margarita was quite good, but not sure worth $12 given the setting. Salsa sampler was decent. My main issue was with the tacos. I was really looking forward to their tacos after reading existing yelp reviews.... and let's just say I was pretty disappointed. They were just ok, not bad but not great. Lacking in flavor and tortillas were dry. And for the price (2 tacos plus a tiny side for $12) I will not be getting the tacos here if I ever return. Make no mistake, Pittsburgh, about where who has the best tacos in town - Edgar's in the Strip and Las Palmas in Oakland/Brookline!
