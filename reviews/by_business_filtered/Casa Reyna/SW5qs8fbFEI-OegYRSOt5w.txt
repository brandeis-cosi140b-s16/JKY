Wow, their catering service is TERRIBLE. I truly have no idea what the food is like as I've never tried it, but I won't be after the experience I had with their catering. They kept waffling back and forth, trying to get me to order more salsa's than what I asked for (three, just with chips) and then didn't give us a price quote. Well, later I found out why, because they wanted to upcharge it. I get it, I order catering for a big name institution in this city, they want to try to get as much money out of us as they think they can, but if I'd known we were going to be spending $2000 on chips and salsa (yes, really) I'd have told my boss we should get big tubs of salsa from costco.

Then they were late with the delivery and got lost. I understand Pittsburgh can be a tough city to navigate, especially if you're new (as their coordinator kept telling me) but the whole thing was just so frustrating. I've heard great things about their food, but at least for catering, it's just not worth the trouble of trying to get them.
