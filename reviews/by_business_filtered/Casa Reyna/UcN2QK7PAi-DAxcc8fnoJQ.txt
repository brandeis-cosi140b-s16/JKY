Hidden gem of the Strip District, the food is excellent and being in the basement gives the restaurant a unique vibe. The food was cooked perfectly, I highly recommend the shrimp quesadilla and the chicken tinga tostada, kind of messy but definitely worth it! We will be going back sooner than later!
