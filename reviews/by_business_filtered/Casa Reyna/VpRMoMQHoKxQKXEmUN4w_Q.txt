Ok, the chips and salsa are really good.  I'll give them that, but after that it goes downhill fast.  It took forever to get my water glass refilled and with somewhat spicy salsa, that's kind of important.  

The worst though was my food.  I ordered the chicken enchiladas with mole sauce (enmoladas I think is what the dish was called).  I really love good mole sauce but this was not it!  It was absolutely terrible which ruined the entire meal for me.  

My kids ordered the steak tacos.  The meat was very tough and hard to chew, especially for children.  It also had very little taste.

This is not a place to which we will be returning.  I am not spending that much money on bad food and so so service.  The two stars are mostly just for the chips and salsa.
