Kinda of disappointed...I love Mexican. I will start with the margaritas on a good note! They were perfectly blended and a huge portion for the price. See the pic. For $12 I got 2.5 glasses!
My husband thought his chorizo tacos were delish but my fish tacos were so fishy tasting...like bad fish. I'm a lil worried....
My daughter had eggs and bacon. They don't have a kids menu but this dish worked for her.
