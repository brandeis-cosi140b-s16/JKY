An employee from our division in Mexico was in Pittsburgh training and I was tasked with giving him a tour of the city.  He told me he hadn't had authentic Mexican food since coming to America and really wanted some.  I remembered wanting to try Casa Reyna. Antonio was impressed and thanked me for taking him somewhere that reminded him of home.
That right there folks deserves 4 stars in my book.

The beef tongue tacos and service were good as well.  The chips were just decent and the seating was really cramped.

If you want authentic Mexican take a trip to the Strip.

Oh yes.  Rhyme time.
