The caldo de res was to die for.  Maybe it's just the morning sickness, and this actually was appealing and stayed down, woohoo!  But it just hit the spot.
We were in the strip and getting hungry.  Fortunately I needed to make pozole so we found ourselves at the meximart at lunchtime.  It was too cold to sit outside and eat tacos so we headed downstairs for Casa Reyna.  It was a little funny, with the typical Mexican decor (wanted posters, corrugated metal "roof" over the bar, etc), but real napkins, etc.  We got the typical quesadillas for the kids and I got soup, my honey got tacos.  No free chips and salsa, but we ordered some and the chips were thick and crunchy and the salsa was small but good.  
Then the soup arrived.
Oh.my.god.
So it's now my new favorite.  
Honey's tacos were good, the quesadilla was "meh" so we'll order something different when we come back because I loved the soup and we're going back.  I'm sure I might eventually order something else, and I'll report what everyone else gets, but for now (and for probably the next six months until this baby stops making me throw up) it's soup for me.
(Ok, so the menu had a lot of your authentic options like four different types of mole, chilaquiles, regional dishes, etc - highly recommend if you want a better taste of Mexican cuisine.  They even had an elote dish as an appetizer, which I might get....with soup ;)
