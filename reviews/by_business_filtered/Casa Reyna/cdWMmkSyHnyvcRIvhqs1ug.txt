I just love Reynas!  Their tortillas are so amazing. Margaritas: to die for!  We had shrimp enchiladas, fish tacos and chile rellenos.   All great!  My only diss was that I was to wussy for their chipotle salsa, and that's on me, not them. I'll adjust my palate to live up to it. They give the consumer a choice of 6 different salsas. (We sampled the tomatillo and the aforementioned chipotle. ). Love the Reynas!
