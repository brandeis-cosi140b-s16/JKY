This is one of my favorite places in the Strip District. In the winter, the basement setting helps you forget about the dismal weather outside and in the nicer weather, you can snag an outside table. 

Margaritas seem a little pricey around $12, but then you realize you get the whole shaker which equates to two margaritas with house-made sour mix. 

I can't attest for the whole menu, because I'm in love with the Carnitas mini-tacos. The 4 mini-tacos are enough for me to make a meal out of when coupled with the table-side guac. The rice and beans leave something to be desired, so I don't even bother with them.
