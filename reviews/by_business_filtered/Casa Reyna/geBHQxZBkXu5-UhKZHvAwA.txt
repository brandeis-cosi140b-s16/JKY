stopped here last month with the BF. I have to say the place reminded me of an old church in CA where I used to live and it was very heart warming! restaurant sits downstairs in the "basement" of the store, very claustrophobic for me since the lighting were dimmed. we went there during the week and were the only ones there. we wanted to stay but there was absolutely no phone signal at all so we decided to order a quick taco appetizer $10 for 4 mini tacos...not that great, pretty bland. wished I was able to try a few more things but didn't get the chance :( the staff were very nice and attentive though.
