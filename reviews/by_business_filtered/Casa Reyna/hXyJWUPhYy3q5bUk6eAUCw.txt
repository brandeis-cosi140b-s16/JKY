"Mexican food" in Pittsburgh used to be something like a whisper in the wind, not quite sure if what you heard was actually said. The concept had been ignored, for the most part willfully by our 412 and 724 contemporaries satisfied with a Mad Mex or El Campesino imposter.

Slowly the tide began to turn with Reynas and Las Palmas taco stands creating a migration of the taste bud towards something more original, a secret they were finally willing to bestow upon our woefully ignorant palates. 

King Food said Reynas restaurant was legit. I was intrigued, but not compelled to immediate action. Deep down inside though, I knew if King Food said it was legit...that I had to try it out. I recently ventured there with him, my girlfriend and another friend to finally check it out. 

I had no idea how much they re-did the basement. It was a quaint cantina, replete with muralistic paintings and cozy lighting.

Our service was attentive and prompt. The salsa sampler...succulent smoky bliss. Every dish that was passed around (I had the Anchos Rellenos) was full of flavors and subtle spicing. 

My girlfriend had the Mole sampler, which was a diverse and delicious heaping of food.

I am glad that Reynas proved to Pgh that they are a Mex-I-Can.
