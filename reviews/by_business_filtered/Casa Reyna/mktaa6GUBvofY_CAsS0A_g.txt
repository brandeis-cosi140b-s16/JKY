Pittsburgh lacks good Mexican food. Casa Reyna delivers. 
The restaurant is downstairs. The vibe is relaxed. Servers are always friendly and smiling and never trying to upsell.

Start off with some chips and salsa. The spicy and sweet mango salsa are both good. They need better containers for their salsa though. They are kinda flat, and do not lend well to scooping. Also, the chips could be a little less oily, but I don't really care after a few tequila shots.

I am a fan of their fish tacos. The fish is always perfectly breaded, and they wrap it in hard, as well as a soft taco shell (delish!). Friends always liked what they ordered. I am always too busy with my fish tacos to pay attention.

If you think El Campesino or Mad Mex are good, come here for some schooling of your taste buds.
