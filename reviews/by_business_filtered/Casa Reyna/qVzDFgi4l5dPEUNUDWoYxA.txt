Friendly staff. Tortilla chips and salsas were good.  Horchata was excellent. The steak was severely charred and the lamb was bland/lacked seasoning. We were seated in the dining area directly under a television which was loud from where we were sitting. It would be understandable if we were in the bar area, but hearing Serena Williams grunt every 4 seconds detracted from the dining experience. 

Perhaps we'll give it another chance in a few months.
