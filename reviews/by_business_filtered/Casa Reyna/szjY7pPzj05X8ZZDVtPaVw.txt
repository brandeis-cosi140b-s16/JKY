The food here is very good, but not great. I had the enchiladas reynas. Again good, but not great. Could have done with some more flavors. 

We had salsa and chips, guac, and margaritas. Margarita was ok. Guac was yummy. Chips and salsa were excellent. 

I would give this place a strong 4 stars for food and atmosphere. The place had a very nice atmosphere though was a bit loud. 

The reason for the 3 stars was the service. While they were extremely nice when asked for anything, we had to ask, often. Missing parts of our orders, incorrect items on check and a standard dinner of drinks, apps, and entrees took over 2 hours. A few more servers would really bring this place up a notch. 

Would I go back? Yes. The menu is flushed out enough and the food was tasty. Would enjoy trying the fajitas server in a half pineapple one other party
Member had.
