I will preface this review by saying that I am typically not a big fan of Mexican food but I was set on trying something new and straying from default chicken tacos.

The atmosphere here was cool as I walked down the stairs into the basement,. The staffed seemed really nice and friendly.  I tried the Jalapeno Tilapia.  which is served in a cream sauce over angel hair pasta.  This was such an amazing choice.  The fish was so tender and just fell apart so nicely as I cut into it.  the sauce was a great blend and the pasta was perfect as well.  I wish I was a bit more hungry so I could enjoy more of the meal but I plan on warming back up here shortly for lunch.  For not being a big fan of Mexican food and venturing into trying something out of my ordinary, Casa Reyna made it a very rewarding adventure.
