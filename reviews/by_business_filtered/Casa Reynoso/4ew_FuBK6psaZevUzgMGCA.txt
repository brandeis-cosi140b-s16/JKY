If i could give this place a gazillion stars i would... the service is spotty, and the decor is nothing special, but my god the food is to die for if you like authentic, bad for you Mexican food. the family that owns this place is from Globe, and i hear that city is known for some damn good mexi food (other than that it's pretty much a dump).

when i walk in this joint, it smells like my grandmother's kitchen, and that makes my mouth start watering on the spot. the refried beans are unbelievable and the tortillas are huge, with the brown spots on them that let you know their homemade in house. (p.s., if you don't know, Mexican food is supposed to be made with lard, so if you're vegan, be wary of this spot, because this is def a lard-use mexi joint)

i keep it simple with a red tamale and a bean and cheese burrito. the price is on par with a place like Macayo's. $8 for the plates that would have say, two tacos and beans and rice. and single items range from $3.99 and up. be warned, the first bowl of chips is free, "thereafter you pay." i know that's lame, but what can you do? they have the food equivalent of crack and they know it. i seriously love this joint!
