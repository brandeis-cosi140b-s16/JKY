After reading the Yelp reviews I took my family here (they are visiting from out of state). I really would have been better off going to Garcia's or one of the other chains. I really prefer to support locally owned business, but only if they are at least trying. 

The service here is poor. The waitress was good enough--she just did not have enough help. You can tell the place is pinching pennies--for instance, they charge for extra chips in addition to understaffing the place.

The food, with one exception, everyone agreed was average. The exception was the menudo, which my wife said was super excellent. Nothing was bad, it is just that nothing other than the menudo stood out. 

I really wanted to like this place better--especially since everyone counts on me to find the good places and I told everyone a locally owned place was bound to be better than the chains. Oh well, at least Luigi's Pizza was good at dinnertime today. One out of two for the day.
