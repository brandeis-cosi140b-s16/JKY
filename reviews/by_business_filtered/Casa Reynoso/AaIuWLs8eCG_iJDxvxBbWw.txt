Casa Reynoso was a favorite lunch spot for some of my coworkers, so one day, I decided to join them. Overall, I was impressed with the food -- I had an enchilada style burrito. The only downfall was the pricing: everything comes a la carte, so if you want sides, your meal will probably be above $10 (which is a bit more than most places). Overall, good experience though.
