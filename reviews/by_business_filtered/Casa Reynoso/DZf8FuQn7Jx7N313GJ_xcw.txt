Don't listen to any of the bad reviews.  This is by far the best Mexican restaurant in the valley!  I've also been to the one in Chandler and the original restaurant in Globe called La Casita.  Regardless of the location, the food is always the same and nothing less than superb!  Don't get me wrong, it is a humble, family owned hole in the wall but the food is incredible.  The service is sketchy at times (probably because they have their staff members pulling double and triple duty) and the prices are a bit more than most places but they make up for it with the food.  The biggest complaint most people have is the lack of an endless supply of free chips.  Believe me people...you don't want to fill up on boring chips anyway because the food is that good.  

I usually get a combo plate consisting of a chicken taco, chicken enchilada with rice and beans.  I also sometimes mix it up with a bean burrito every now and again.  BTW, the burritos are great reheated if you want to take a few home a la carte to savor the goodness.  The refried beans are very tasty and the enchilada sauce is by far the best I've had anywhere else.  The salsa is a bit spicy for my taste but good nonetheless.  In my opinion, there are only a handful of Mexican places that can even come close to being in the same category as Reynoso's (Macayo's & El Matador to name just a few).  So if you're looking for authentic great tasting Mexican food, look no further than Reynoso's.  My family and I have been coming here for years and will continue to do so.
