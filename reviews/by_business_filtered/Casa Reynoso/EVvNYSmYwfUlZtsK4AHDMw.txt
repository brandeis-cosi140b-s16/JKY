They've got some bomb ass chile relleno here!  Everytime I go in I tell myself "ok, let's try something new this time" - but always seem to end up with a steaming hot plate of chile relleno.  I don't know what they're doing different here, but this one stands out.

The green chili is bomb too, I'd put that $h!t on my cheerios.
