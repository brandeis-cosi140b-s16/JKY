I ordered combination #6 - enchilada,   Chile Rellano, rice and beans.

Plate was SUpER hot.  Oven to table!

Chili Rellano was good!  A little greasy though!

Enchilada was good with a tasty red sauce!

Rice and beans were good too!

Chips might have been a day or two old.

Salsa was good with a touch of spiciness.  It was a bit thinner (vs chunky) than I prefer but still good.
