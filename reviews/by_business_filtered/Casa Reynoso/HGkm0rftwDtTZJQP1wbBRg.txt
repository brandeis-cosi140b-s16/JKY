Wow! is all we can say about this place. It is a family-run restaurant that has been around for many years, and after tasting the food we can see why it's a mainstay in Tempe. It's in the corner of a Fry's shopping center and very unassuming, but don't let the decor fool you. The food is fantastic!

The salsa comes in a little carafe and you get individual bowls to fill for dipping your chips. The food was authentic and amazing, brought to the table piping hot and full of flavor. The (beef) red chili was delicious as were the chile relleno, whole pinto beans and rice. The service was very attentive, and the iced tea glass was quart-sized and never empty. 

Only gave it 4 stars because the ambiance is older, but who cares when you're getting the real deal when it comes to the food? We will definitely go back here again and again.
