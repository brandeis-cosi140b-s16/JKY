Service is often pretty crappy, but their food is good.  The Gollo burro is one of their specialties, getting it "green style" is key.  My family and I ordered take out from there a couple weeks ago and they definitely skimped on the portions.  My bean burrito barely had anything to it and my side of rice was only a couple bites.  Kind of frustrating.  Usually bad service can be easily forgotten by good food and decent prices, but I think I will keep my trips to Casa R to a minimum.
