I had the combo plate with chile relleno (the Globe version is better, but it was good), shredded beef taco, and cheese enchilada.  I thought the food was very good.  I forgot to ask about the hotter salsa (doh) but enjoyed their regular salsa and chips.  The iced tea was very, very good.  Overall, with the extremely excellent service, this was a great choice and a great visit.
