Just got back from eating here a few mins ago. We just moved to Tempe, and this restaurant is right around the corner from our house. We didn't want to spend a whole lot, but we wanted to give this place a chance. We ordered tacos a la carte and a small side of rice. We stuck with water for drinks. They kept our waters, chips and (delicious) salsa filled without much prompting. It took awhile for our food to arrive, but our waitress apologized saying a huge take-away order was placed right when we were seated. The tacos were very good, though a little small, and the rice excellent. I would definitely come back here. 

The only con is that there were a lot of screaming kids there, and that always puts me off my meal with parents that can't control their kids running around and throwing food and the restaurant doesn't ask them to be more respectful.
