Went here for dinner with my boyfriend and we were not overwhelmed. Mediocre food, but they apparently use family recipes. Maybe we ordered the wrong thing, but our dinners weren't anything special. 

We ordered cheese enchiladas, machaca burro, beef taco, rice and beans. The cheese enchiladas, rice and beans were typical Mexican good, tasty but not impressive. The enchilada sauce wasn't that great. The hard shell beef taco was soggy but the meat was flavorful. The machaca burro was dry. I was hoping for a better mix of beef, tomatoes, chilies and onions, but it was mainly beef. Definitely needed a better ratio of meat and veggies. 

The highlight of the meal was the salsa and guacamole. I would recommend getting guac!

I doubt I'll come back to Casa Reynoso. I was disappointed in the food, but it was a good value ($25 for our whole meal), nice atmosphere, and pleasant employees.
