Went here for dinner last night with a family friend in from out of town and a few others. This used to be one of her favorites when she lived here.

It's homey. It's old school. The menu is far more limited than your average Mexican joint. And I have had everything at least a little better somewhere else. No one raved (or even commented) about their food except for the cheese crisp we shared and her chile relleno. Oh, and they raved about the cheesecake I made and brought in for my friend, of course. Even the waitresses begged for a piece, which doesn't speak well for their own desserts.

Service was fine and our drinks were constantly filled. We might return if we find ourselves across the street at Pets Inc and hungry for Mexican.
