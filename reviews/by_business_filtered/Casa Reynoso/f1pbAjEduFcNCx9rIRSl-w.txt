Hands down, this family owned and operated restaurant offers authentic Mexican/American food.  I visit often and order the 1/3 plate, with green chile, beans and rice.  Their tortillas are handmade daily and served buttered, so they always taste fresh.  This place reminds me of my grandmother's cooking, I have not found anything better outside my grandma's house.  I always order their house margarita, which is good.  The family runs this restaurant, so you have younger generations serving and greeting next to older generations.  The service is slower than a typical chain restaurants, so you do have to make sure to carve some time out of your schedule to stop and enjoy.  The food makes up for the slow service.  They are very friendly and by now they know my family by name and are always happy to see us.  The place is very dark inside, no natural light and the decor is a bit outdated.  It is a family friendly restaurant that can accommodate large parties, which we appreciate, having a large family.  Sundays are always busy from open to close, so we like to visit during the week or on a Friday night.  This is a place we frequent because simply we have not found anything that compares to it.
