I am going to start this out with 4 stars, because I really only have had one entree here...and it's a 5 star one. Will re-review when I have tried more. 
This place is NOT a dive, as I have seen written on another review. They clearly do not know what a dive is. If they want to see a dive that would have been closer to this family's old restaurant (El Rey) they had in globe which I drove all the way from Tempe a few times to eat at. That was my destination. I would never call it a dive though, I have too much respect for their food. I prefer, hole in the wall or hidden gem. It did have torn seats, but I loved it all. It had such an authenticity and reminded me of times past. 

Back to Casa Reynoso. I had the bean burrito green enchilada style once, and have been hard pressed to try anything else. I could eat it every day. They make some of the best beans I have had, and the burrito enchilada style is pretty near perfection.

I mainly get to-go here, but last night actually ate there. Again, not a dive, no complaints whatsoever in seating, decor, etc. Also, not as loud as most chains. Our server (manager I think) was a bit obnoxious, but not enough to deter me from going again. 

All in all, I highly recommend this place. I was bummed when the El Rey closed (I found out after taking a drive up), but I was SO elated to know the family had other restaurants down here. This one's about a mile from my house. SWEET!
