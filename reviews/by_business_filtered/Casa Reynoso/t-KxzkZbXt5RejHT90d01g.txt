This place is solid. They had great Tex-Mex cuisine, amazing service, and a comfortable, unpretentious atmosphere. I would give it five stars but it wasn't like their food was mind blowingly original, it was just really good. Well, then again, when I think about it, my mind was pretty blown by the salsa. They had ridiculously good salsa. I highly recommend this place.
