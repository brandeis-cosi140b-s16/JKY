The food at Reynoso is always amazing the problem we have continued running into here is the service. Don't get me wrong the people are awesome and friendly it just takes forever to get anything done. We tried to go here a couple Sundays ago, we got in about 10:30 or 11 there were a few folks in front of us waiting even though the dinning room was empty. No big deal. So we put our name on the list watched the folks in front of us get seated then they seated a party of two that came in about ten minutes after us. We just turned around and left. It's a pattern of just horrible service, Once we waited about 20 minutes after we finished eating to get the check then she went up and paid while we waited for the waitress that dropped of the check to come back with boxes it took another 10 minutes. The always apologies and are super nice about it but it just isn't enough. 

So after many years of loving Reynoso we have just decided not to bother it ends up stressing us out, and dinning out should be a relaxing experience.

If we want Mexican on the weekend we just make sure to stop by Rito's now that they have Saturday hours. You have to wait but the food is worth it and it's never a hassle.
