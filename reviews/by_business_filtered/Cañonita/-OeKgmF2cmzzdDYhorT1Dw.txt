As I was recently strolling the strip with my sister (as in literally walked from the Cosmo to the Venetian -- not an easy feat!), we got a little hungry and stopped by this place to get a snack.  I'll admit, I'm weary of some restaurants on the strip, particularly Mexican as it has always turned out to be a disappointing experience for me (i.e., Gardunos at the Palms, Isla at TI, Yolos at Planet Hollywood).

I was pleasantly surprised to find a nice Happy Hour at this place (http://www.venetian.com/uploadedImages/The_Venetian/Content_Blocks/Restaurants/Casual_Dining/2011CANHappyHourPromoeBlast.jpg#zoom=100).  $3 well drinks and $5 classic and specialty margaritas from 3pm to 6pm and 9pm to closing.

We had the $5 prickly pear margaritas, which were actually pretty good as well as chips and guacamole.  The guac was nothing to write home about but was decent.  However, the drinks -- and HH prices -- were excellent, particularly because it doesn't seem like many strip joints offer decent happy hour options.

The restaurant is also along the fake Grand Canal, so the singing gondoliers are fun entertainment.
