I had been to this restaurant before, a couple of years ago, and we went again because of the ambiance and good food.

This time food wasn't great, it was okay, and service was bad.

We made a reservation for 6 at 8:15.  I was really hungry, so I suggested to the group that we go a little early to see if we could get in.  I know that on some occasions ( i.e. when restaurants are busy) that just doesn't work, which would have been fine.  However, there were a total of 3 tables occupied in the restaurant and when we walked up to say we were a little early, they looked at us like, "how dare you!"

It then took about ten minutes for one man to set up 6 sets of utensils, while three other servers stood around. Also, the hosts didn't smile at all. 

Our server was nice and helpful about the menu, but the food and drinks still came out slower than we would have hoped.

Finally, the reason I only give this place one star is because when I checked my checking account balance, my debit card was charged $16 more than it should have been!
I don't know who's editing the tips on credit card receipts, whether it be the server, manager, whatever, but that's just really sheisty. I'm a server, and I have never tried to basically, steal money from someone on the 'tips' line.
