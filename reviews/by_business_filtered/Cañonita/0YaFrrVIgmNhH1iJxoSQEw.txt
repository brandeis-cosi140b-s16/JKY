The location and atmosphere of this place is quite nice!  However, the menus we were given were all torn up at the corners, which was surprising for a pretty nice restaurant.  It definitely cheapened the place and lowered our expectations.

I ordered the Watermelon Margarita and it was extremely good!  Most margarita's I had in Vegas were way too sweet, but this one was perfect.  
We also ordered chips and salsa - again, very good.  The chips were fresh and the salsa was spicy!

Our meals (beef & chicken enchiladas) were very very bland.  After the spicy salsa with the chips and our server's warning of some spice in the meal, we were expecting something...but seriously - nope.  No spice, no flavor, bland, bland, bland.  

Our server was very nice and attentive, which we found everywhere in Vegas - which is a really good thing.

But I would not go back here or recommend it to anyone going either.  Sorry!
