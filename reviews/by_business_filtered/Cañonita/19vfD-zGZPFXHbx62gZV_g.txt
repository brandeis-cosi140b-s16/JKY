my friends and i stopped by after being recommended to go there and right away we realized the service was horrible. multiple tables were seated after us and they received not only their food but checks before us. in between our dishes the waitress took over 35 minutes and once we ordered came back to tell us 30 mins later that a certain dish was not available. i have 2 friends that are vegetarians and they were not allowed to swap out for other meals. the pepsi we ordered came out flat without carbonation. they also said that the dishes on their menu can change from time to time. I WOULD DEF. TELL YOU NOT TO GO, ESPECIALLY NOT WITH A GROUP. the full meal took close to 2 hrs and we were the first table seated when they opened. horrible!!!!!!!!
