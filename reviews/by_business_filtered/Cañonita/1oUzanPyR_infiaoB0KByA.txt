Let me start by saying that I don't really care for the Venetian Grand Canal Shoppes.  When I'm in Las Vegas I don't care to spend time wandering around a mall, especially one so big that I've gotten lost more than once (sad but true).  There's only one thing that keeps me visiting the Grand Canal Shoppes, and that's Taqueria Cañonita.  This is one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas, so I seek them out whenever I can.  I've never had a bad dish on the menu, though my favorite is the Tres Tacos.   Served with black beans and cilantro rice, you just cannot go wrong with any of their taco varieties.  I can't even pick a favorite, they are all good.  

Taqueria Cañonita also makes some tasty, tasty margaritas.   For Cinco de Mayo they had a special margarita that involved Serrano peppers that was amazing.  If there isn't a good special going on, The Cañonita Margarita, made with Patron, is also a favorite.  You just cannot go wrong with Patron!  Just watch out because those suckers will sneak up on you!

Whether you sit on the "patio" along the canal or in the bar, this place is always fun.  The one and only reason they don't get 5 stars is because the restroom is located outside the restaurant in the Grand Canal Shoppes food court, which after a few shots of Patron is not exactly ideal.  Still, I'll let it slide and I look forward to visiting them again next time I'm in Las Vegas!
