Being in Nevada, I was looking fwd to down and dirty tacos and gauc.  The restaurant is a little fru fru probably catering to tourists who want more ambiance than qlty.

It's location is fabulous, right along the canals with the gondolas passing by.  Food was good, I had beef and chicken tacos, they were soft shell and didn't give an option for hard shell.  But it was ok...if you prefer more authentic, I think you need to go off the strip.
