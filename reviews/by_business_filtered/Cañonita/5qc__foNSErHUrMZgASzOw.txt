Best Mexican I've ever had,  amazing how starting with the perfect drink can set the tone for the rest.  Best regular margarita and best jalapeno margarita I've ever had,  without question. The atmosphere is great,  feels like you're outside at Venetians grand canal,  every few minutes you hear a different Italian gondola singer.   Had the taco assortment,  I'm a sucker for cilantro,  ever aspect of the meal was great and compared to a few other high dollar meals we had in Vegas this trip,  Canonita stands out in my mind as the best.
