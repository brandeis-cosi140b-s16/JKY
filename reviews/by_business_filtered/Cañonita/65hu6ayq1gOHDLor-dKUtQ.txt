Easily my favorite meal out of the entire Las Vegas trip. The only reason I'm giving four stars instead of five is the service. It took nearly ten minutes to seat us when over half the restaurant was empty. Our server also made sure to put the 'wait' into waiter. 
The food though... the food was freaking fantastic and so were the sangria de rojo and regular sangrias. Barbacoa, fajitas, burritos - all outstanding. The sangria de rojo is an awesome mix of a red sangria and a margarita. Heavenly!
I like to sit near the canal and watch the gondolas. 
You could say the place is pricey, but I had plenty of terrible meals for the same price as here. Nothing is cheap here. 
Don't miss this place.
