Pleasantly surprised. Although not on the menu, I managed to order a spicy margarita. This is one of the best margaritas I've every had. For this spice loving girl, it came across powerfully spicy while still maintaining a margarita taste.  The pork barbacoa was a hearty well seasoned portion that properly pulled apart with ease. The salsa was a perfect slightly spicy thin consistency. Only the gauc and lack of tinga style chicken knocked this review down.
