Like everyone else has stated, this place is superb from location, price, taste, service, etc.  Everything one would want in a restaurant, Canonita possesses.

I had the taco plate for $15... each taco (SIX of them) was a different combination of filling (meat + seafood) and flavors, all on double corn tortillas.  It was a crap load of food but after a long day of traveling and walking, it hit the spot.

I was with a group and we had a plethora of margaritas and tequila shots (a few on the house) and our waiter brought us some pineapple slices soaked in tequila that were also on the house and pretty much knocked everyone on their ass.

We all left with a satisfying buzz and a full stomach.

It has made it onto my must-dine list when I'm in Vegas and that's not an easy accomplishment.
