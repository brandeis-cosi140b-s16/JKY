My husband would scoff at a 4-star rating for this restaurant, because he thought his steak fajitas were way too chewy and cheap tasting. However, I thought for $22 per person, the prix fixe was an excellent value. Chips, guac and salsa? Delicious. My chopped salad was also great, although his tortilla soup wasn't as appetizing (it's not the broth-based soup you're using to seeing at restaurants). I thought the steak fajitas were fine for the price. Three leisurely courses seated on the canal, watching tourists pretend they're glad they spent $60 to float in a fake boat in two feet of water. That's Vegas!
