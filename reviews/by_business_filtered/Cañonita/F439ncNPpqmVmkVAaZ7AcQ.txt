This is our favorite restaurant in las vegas! The margaritas, chips, and entrees are excellent! In particular, the carne asada, wild mushroom enchiladas, barbacoa, and churros are  my favorites. We have been enjoying this place for 13+ years. I have always loved the food and enjoyed the additions/changes that they have made over the years. I was so appreciative last month, when my waitress asked the CHEF to make us churros during lunch (the churros are only on the breakfast menu). She made my day! Those churros are the best churros I've ever had. Thank you, Canonita, for always making my Vegas trips extra special!
