We came here for my birthday and both the food and atmosphere were excellent. I was actually in the mood for the type of Mexican restaurant like the one in the movie Dodgeball. You know, the Dirty Sanchez. And no, there's no need for you to make any jokes right here! Anyway Canonita is definitely on the other end of the spectrum; it's the type that doesn't serve margaritas by the pitcher. Still tasty in served in a glass though. I had the carne asada, which was delicious. Did I have a lobster tail with it? ...I'm sure it was delicious if I did.

I loved the setting! We sat in the "outdoor" area of the restaurant. The Venetian was nice enough to turn down the lights to create a "dusk" effect since it was dinner time. If only I could've seen the sun set behind the Kenneth Cole store across the walkway!
