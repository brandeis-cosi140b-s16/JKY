They put crack in the salsa 

That's the only rational explanation 

Because its not the chips, I've had better, and looking at the salsa its nothing special, looks like some regular old fire roasted fare. 

But then you taste it, damnnnnn, before you know it you're on your third cup of it. 

I've been coming here every Vegas trip for years, they must have a high turnover as far as staff goes becuase I don't recognize one person each time. Its a little cheesy watching the singing gondolas go by while you're drinking overpriced Don Juilio Real and munching on the chips and salsa, but hey its Vegas. 

Back to the salsa, because as far as the food goes, we're spolied in L.A., we get better mexican food at little holes in the wall and at home than we do in these high end joints. It seems like they've kicked the salsa up a notch in recent years, still gabacho friendly but with a little bit more of a kick.
