I've only been here for happy hour so I can't say too much. The food, eh! We had the queso with chicken and there was about one piece of diced chicken for i think $2 extra, that was a ripoff! The drinks here are pretty good for happy hour and they have it from 4-6 and 9-close (I think those are the hours)

What keeps me coming back is the wonderful location has, and you can be asked to be seated along the water and watch tourists take the gondola ride!
