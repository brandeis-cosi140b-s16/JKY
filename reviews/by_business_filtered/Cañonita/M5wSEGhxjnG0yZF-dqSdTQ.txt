5 STARS: BEST FLAUTAS IN THE WORLD!

If you have ever ate flautas, you know that they are fried which makes them crunchy on the outside with different filings on the inside-almost like a taquito. Anyway, the faults here are perfectly fried with not too much crunch-it doesn't hurt the rook of you mouth when you bite into it AND the filling inside with the different dipping sauces are amazing. 
The food is very reasonably priced for Vegas and being in the Canal Shops. 
Our server was very nice and attentive.

Lastly, the BEST part about this restaurant is the location. Should you decide to try this yummy establishment, be sure to request a table alongside the actual canal where they are performing the gondola rides. Huge plus is you get to hear the gondola singers while you enjoy your mexican food. 

Great experience and so fun!
