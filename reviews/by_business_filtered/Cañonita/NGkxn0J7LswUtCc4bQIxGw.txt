Do yourself a favor and go to one of the other Mexican restaurants in Vegas if you want more than a margarita and chips & salsa.  

As many other reviewers commented, if you go, it can be nice to sit in the fake "outside" by the canal.  And my meal started in a pleasant enough fashion, with the previously-mentioned good margarita and chips and salsa.

But everything fell apart when my entree came out.  Chicken enchiladas are pretty difficult to screw up, but they somehow found a way to do so.  This was the most bland Mexican food I ever tasted in my life.  Diner meatloaf in southern Indiana is more interesting.  The black beans tasted like water.  I'm not joking.  Water.  The "cilantro rice" tasted like it just came out of the boil-in-a-bag.  The "queso fresco" on top of the enchiladas certainly didn't taste like any kind of real cheese.  And the enchiladas themselves were skimpy on the chicken and heavy on the lettuce (a clear cost-saving measure).  Oh, and yes, the chicken also didn't even taste like anything. 

And of course, if you just want the 'rita, save yourself having to tip your sever and get your drink in the food court location of this restaurant that's steps away from the location by the "canal".
