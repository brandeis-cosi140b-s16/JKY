I was surprised to find a Mexican restaurant in the middle of an Italian styled/themed atmosphere. We rushed on over to be seated right away! 

We were seated immediately right by the river so we got to see/experience the Gondola's float by as well as listen to the amazing songs of their driver. Luckily we arrived during happy hour and was recommended by our waiter to try their margaritas; so I ordered one while my boyfriend stuck with water and Sprite. It didn't take long to get our drinks either; I'm a super fan of speedy and professional service. =)

Dishes: I ordered the Mexico City beef enchiladas and my boyfriend ordered the Carne Asada Nortena. Our appetizer was the pork empanadas. Dessert was their famous tres leches. Everything was divine! The cilantro rice was flavorful and the carne asada was rich and tangy. Yum yum yum!

Only downside is the location of restrooms; it's by the food court. It's not a bad/far walk but kinda strange. The food though was excellent, the service was quick, and the ambiance was fun and relaxing. If we're in the area again, we'll be back!
