This place is located in the Venetian and has great tacos, burritos and enchiladas.  The service is always good and I frequently take colleagues here.  My favorite appetizer is the chips, salsa and guacamole and the drinks are delicious as well!  The prices are a bit high but I get a corporate discount which is nice.  Would recommend for a nice Mexican food night out!
