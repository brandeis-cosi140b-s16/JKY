Came back for apps and drinks for happy hour hopping....

the salsa trios still on the happy hour menu  :) love this item!!!
we also tried the 1/2 Steak 1/2 Chicken Quesadilla (also HHr menu)
the Beef Empanadas (apps on regular menu) sweet and smoky yumm

drinks were a blackberry margarita (beautiful and refreshing.. but very sweet) bf had a couple of this red hot mixed drink (not my thing but he had two.. ) we also had a few well drinks since couple bucks each.. our bartenders were awesome, didn't charge for the extra chip refills and made very strong drinks!  

STILL haven't made it in for dinner!! but when i do it'll be the Santa Rosa barbacoa De puerco!!! guy down the bar from me had it and it looked unbelievable!!!!
