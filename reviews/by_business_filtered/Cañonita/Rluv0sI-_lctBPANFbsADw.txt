I've been here twice and have not been disappointed yet.  It won't put a big dent in your wallet and you leave rubbing your tummy yummily.
If you can, get a seat on the 'patio' near the canal and be entertained by the passing gondolas.  Smoke chicken quesadillas, corn enchiladas with grilled chicken, and the Cancun blue crab cakes... I'm getting hungry already.  Don't forget to save room for the coconut custard brulee!
