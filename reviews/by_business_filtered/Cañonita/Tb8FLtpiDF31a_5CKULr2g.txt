The food was fantastic!  The only reason it got a four instead of five star is because it said there was outdoor seating.  The seating, although along a balcony overlooking the venetian boats, was INDOORS. There was fake sky and fake buildings and fake facades, but it was inside.  But, the food was delicious!!
