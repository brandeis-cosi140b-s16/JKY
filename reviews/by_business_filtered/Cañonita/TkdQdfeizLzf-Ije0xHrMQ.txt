This is by far, my favorite Mexican restaurant. I have been here at least once for every visit that I have made to Las Vegas, to mark the completeness of my time spent in the desert :) I have brought several friends, and they are as pleased as I am. I remember my first time dining here, as someone at a nearby table attempted to order a chimichanga. The server said to me "this is Mexican SOUL food! None of that Taco Bell stuff..", and he was right. Everything here (from the fabulous choices of margarita, to the horchata and desserts), is SOOO finger-licking good. After one visit, I had finally had enough of being without my favorite horchata, and asked the chef for a recipe. Not only did he write it down for me, but he emailed it to me as well! As I'm writing this review, my mouth is watering..but I know that nothing in Seattle will compare to this food.
