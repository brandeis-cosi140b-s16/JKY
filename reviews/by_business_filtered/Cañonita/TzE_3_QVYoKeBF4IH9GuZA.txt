Great service! Great food! But one thing I want to mention is your hostess, I think Linda or Ronda, I don't recall, she was tall. She was great and on top of everything. Her leadership was impressive. She greeted my colleagues and I with a great smile and attitude. 
We were a party of 5 and while she was trying to get someone to do it nobody did it, so she said give me a minute let me set up your table. The hostess had it ready in no time. She got the menus, explained it to us as well as the happy hour menu and gave us a few suggestions on dishes. She always had a smile on, even when it was really busy.  
We decided to go again the next day and the hostess was there again.  We requested the same table and she set it up for us and welcomed us back. Even though we took up the table for quite a while.
Will definitely be back again!
