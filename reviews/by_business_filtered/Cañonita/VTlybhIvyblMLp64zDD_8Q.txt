This was my first time to Las Vegas. I was here on business and was a little overwhelmed by the crowds and craziness. I walked around a lot looking for a place I could have a drink and feel comfortable by myself. I finally found myself in the Venetian. As I walked through I noticed a Mexican restaurant. Not in the mood for wine (as it was unbearably hot out) I opted for a margarita. Javier, the server/bartender was very gracious and friendly. The couple next to me ordered Guacamole and some sort of tomato based shrimp and mussels. It looked great. I had already eaten so just stuck with a drink. Javier was helpful in selecting a top shelf tequila, there was a vast selection. I ended up getting their Jalape√±o Margarita, which is made by steeping tequila, sugar and oranges in a large glass container. They also offer a sweeter pineapple based option, which Javier offered to me in a taster sized glass. Very delicious, kind of like a dessert. Thanks for making me feel welcome and giving me a place to rest my feet and cool down.
