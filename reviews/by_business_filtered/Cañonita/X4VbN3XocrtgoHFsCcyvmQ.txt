My wife and I have stayed at the Venetian twice and the Palazzo right beside it once but this seems to be our favorite lunch stop when we're here. Helps get you in the mood to being in Las Vegas first off with sipping their Cadillac Margarita while sitting by the Grand Canal.  We tend to stick to just the chips with salsa and guacamole and splitting the 6 tacos platter which is perfect. We've always had luck getting great service here and a table by the canal, so that tipped my star rating from 3 to 4.  I've never been for dinner, and doubt I ever would when there are so many other excellent dinner restaurants in the Venetian alone.
