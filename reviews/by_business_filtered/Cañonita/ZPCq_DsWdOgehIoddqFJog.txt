A group of 8 of us ducked into this place after a) not feeling the overpriced food court and b) not feeling ballerific enough to eat some place fancy. If you read my other reviews, you know I'm especially hard on any Mexican food, especially ones located under a fake blue sky and a much cleaner version of Venice's grand canal. 

Boy, was I surprised. I started off with a few bites of the ceviche and ordinary chips and salsa, which were both surprisingly tasty. I ordered the three pork tacos with corn tortillas and they were done very well. Their flavors weren't too strong, which I liked. 

Can I just write that it tasted, well, good?

Oh, and the horchata...magnificent! Perfectly balanced between sweetness and thickness. One of the best cups I've had.

For the price, atmosphere, location, and food, this place strikes a good balance for those on a budget but don't want to wander onto the strip looking for the McD's/Denny's/Chipotle around the corner.
