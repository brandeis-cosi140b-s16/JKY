Whenever I go to Vegas, I always want to eat here.  Yes, yes, I know that Los Angeles should have better Mexican food than Vegas, and I have to say that most of the time, it does.  However, there is one particular dish here that I ALWAYS get, so although I may not be the best judge in determining if this restaurant is particularly good overall, at least I know one thing...their barbarcoa plate is DEEEEELICIOUS!  I mean, I have tried bites of other items on their menu from people that I'm eating with, and they all seem pretty decent, however none of them have compared to the barbarcoa.  It's so tender that no knife is needed; the meat just falls apart when poked gently with the fork.  It comes with cilantro rice, which is really good too, black beans, which I don't really eat cuz I'm simply not a fan of beans, and tortillas.  They also have strong, but tasty drinks here, and the servers have always been nice.  And, you can pretend you sitting outside a Venetian restaurant because its right by the gondola ride.  What more can you ask for?!?
