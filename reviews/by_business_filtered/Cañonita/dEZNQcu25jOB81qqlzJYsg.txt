We hosted 25 friends for my wife's birthday party at Canonita Taqueria over the Labor Day weekend.  Everyone from the busboys to the waiters to Michael, the manager did everything right and made it a memorable event.  The food was amazing and the margaritas were deceptively potent.  Everyone went away happy (and buzzed).  We couldn't have been more pleased.
