I think the food is pretty OK.  What really disappointed me was the way they charged for everything.  Like 50 cents for this, or a dollar for that.  Come on- do I need to pay extra for Salsa?!?  Do you even want to live in a a place where you gotta pay extra for salsa.  Salsa should be free- you get it when you sit down.  There is a big picture here people- look at it.  

Anyway try Dos Caminos instead...
