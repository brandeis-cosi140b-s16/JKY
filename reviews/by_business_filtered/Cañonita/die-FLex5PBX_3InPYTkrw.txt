this place has a lot of potential for great food. flavor profiles are good but quality really suffers. We ordered flautas and received taquitos (the smallest flautas I've ever seen in my life!), we ordered tres tacos but the menu failed to mention these are actually street tacos (extremely small tres bite tacos) and they only came in one small corn tortilla each instead of 2. We were told the tres tacos were all white meat but it as mixed (no problem with but it would've been nice to know...the manager said it's supposed to be all white so I have no idea what happened there). We asked if we could special order some nachos and we were told the chef has "attempted many times to make nachos but keeps failing" - at first we didn't understand exactly what that meant, the manger later told me they don't have the proper cheese and they cheese they use doesn't melt well and the chef wouldn't send it out with her name on it and doesn't see it as presentable - but that's what we wanted melted cheese or not and frankly, the chef sent out our other food seemingly not caring if her name was on that and it wasn't that great. The refried beans with chroizo is defintely worth it. Overall it was a waste - $55 for okay service, one order of "street" tacos, 2 orders of "flautas" and the chips and salsa we had to pay for. When I addressed my concerns with the manager she didn't really seem to care and stood by the food (absolutely great and a quality I admire in a manager but I really feel she should've bent a little as we left feeling like she didn't care about our experience) we are locals and will never go back to this restaurant. Your money is much better spent in the Venetian food court.
