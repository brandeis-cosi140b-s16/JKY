We went there with a party of 13 for lunch.  Food was good.  Menu had a lot of choices.  A free appetizer - warm chips w/ fresh salsa and guacamole - was also served.  This was DELICIOUS!  I think we got a few "refills" before our orders arrived.  We found out afterwards that the restaurant made their own chips on the premise.

The service was excellent.  When our waiter found out that it was my Mom's birthday, he promptly gave her a tequila when drinks were served.  At the end of lunch, he gave her a surprise dessert with happy birthday written on the plate.  Last but not least, he gave us more chips as take-out free of charge.

The restaurant was right on the Grand Canal level.  So even though we were inside, it felt that we were "outside" when we were seated at the "patio."  All in all, very excellent eating experience and highly recommended.
