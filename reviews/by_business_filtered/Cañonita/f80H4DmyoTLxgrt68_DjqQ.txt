Probably one of the worst experiences I've had at a restaurant at the venetian. Firstly, the tall hostess with short brown hair was obviously in a pissy mood. When we asked for a specific table with a good view she made it seems like it was such an issue. Not what I want to be greeted with. Then our food was slow to come out even though we just ordered the fish tacos and a shrimp cocktail. The tortillas were flavorless and basically fell apart in my hands. The fish was Talapia which I should have known not to order since it's the cheapest fish a resturant could buy. Lastly, this place claims it's "Mexican soul food" which makes no sense. By definition soul food is traditional African American cuisine so what the heck? I really would only recommend for drinks with a good view of the canal.
