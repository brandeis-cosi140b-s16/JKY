This outfit to me is 5 stars, within their target market.  The food is fantastic, the portions are neither too small or too big, the service is impeccable, the view in Venetian is great on the faux canal, you can't go wrong.  If you wanna go wrong in Venetian go to the worse-location, ludicrously priced and portioned Aqua-Knox and land an arrogant waiter or slow cocktail waitress.  

Ca√±onita has delivered 5 stars repeatedly to me, co-workers and customers.
