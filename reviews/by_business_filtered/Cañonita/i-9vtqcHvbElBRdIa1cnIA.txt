I've eaten here a few times. The food is very good and the atmosphere is cool. You get to watch touristas go by in gondolas while you eat and drink.

The guac is delicious and I reccomend the carnitas and carne asada.

The pina colada served in a coconut is ok, too, its called coca pina and just seems to taste better in a coconut.

Unlike most Mexican places, they do charge for chips and salsa, But being Vegas, I was surprised they did not charge for the water!
