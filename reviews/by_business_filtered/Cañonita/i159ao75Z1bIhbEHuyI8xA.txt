First of all, this place is right on the canal (the only place to be so) and therefore that alone earns it several of its stars. I mean, when you have something as special and romantic as a Venice canal with gondolas passing by every 15mnts and gondoliers serenading their guests, why wouldn't you take full advantage of it!! 

The place itself was very vegetarian-friendly, albeit relied heavily on mushrooms (which I'm allergic to). The only downside of this place was that they were unwilling to do any substitutions at all, which means for a mushroom-allergic person such as myself, there weren't really that many vegetarian options left. We tried the guac-chips and fondido as well as sides of beans and cilantro rice.
