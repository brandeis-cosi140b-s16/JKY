We used open table to book a nice dinner for three, toward the end of a 12 day stay in Vegas.  My sisters and I really enjoy Mexican food, and the place was a lovely treat.  Although it's TOUGH to find it in the mix of all the other stores and restaraunts.  Overall a lovely meal, and 5$ cocktails were a nice surprise. :)
