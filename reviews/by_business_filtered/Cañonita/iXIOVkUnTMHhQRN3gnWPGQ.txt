Well, I payed for not listening to my fellow yelpers. Being from Texas, I have very high standards for Mexican food. This did not meet those expectations. Chips and salsa aren't free. No retried beans. No Spanish rice. No sweetnlow. But forget all that, the food is bland. No taste. Even the salsa. Disappointed for sure.
