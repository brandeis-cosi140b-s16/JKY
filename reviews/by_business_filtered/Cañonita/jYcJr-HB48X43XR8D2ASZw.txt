Just OK Mexican food. 

I had the 3 ceviches off the appetizers, the chips and salsa, and the tres leches cake. The ceviches were good except for the mahi one. The chips and salsa were really good and a great value for just $3 (even though I think all Mexican restaurants should serve this for free). The tres leches cake was kind of disappointing. I love tres leches cake and I know how to make a very good one and this one was kind of dry and not as spongy as it should be. 

The best part about this place is happy hour. Margaritas are $5 and well drinks are $3. That's great for Vegas prices! Also, the location of this place is cool--right by the cannel. 

In other words, come for happy hour.
