At the end of 2009's "SBC Goes to Vegas" epic comedy/tragedy, JMC, Cobber, and I spent one last day in Vegas, the start of which JMC led us to this spot overlooking the Venetian Canal. We imbibed carafe after carafe of a delicious sangria. I took note.

This year, at the end of a traditional/annual BFF/coworker trip, Sarah E, Sarah M, KarKar, and I spent an extra day in Vegas, the start of which led us to this same spot for lunch, touting it's sangria. It did not disappoint my hazy recollection.

We were quickly seated by the hostess, the restaurant/"patio" on the waterfront being sparsely occupied on a Tuesday afternoon. Julio, our server - an elder but spirited gentleman - came over with menus, introduced himself, and immediately prompted us for drinks to start...
"A pitcher of sangria, please?"
"Excellente. Four glasses?
"Yes, please. Thank you."

With drinks on their way and requisite chips & salsa on the table, lunch/sustenance was in order. Both Sarahs ordered the Tres Tacos plates while KarKar went with lighter fare, having a bowl of the Corn & Green Chile Soup. I ordered the smoked chicken quesadilla, thinking it would be like... um, one big quesadilla, but they (3) were [pleasantly] more akin to grill flattened/pressed tacos.

The Corn & Green Chile soup was flavorful! A bit of sweet from the corn, heat from the green chile, a hearty fullness of potato, and depth/salt from smoked bacon.

The taco combination platters and the smoked chicken quesadilla plate satisfying and freshly flavored. Each taco was dressed with toppings complimentary to their filling - shredded chicken salpicon, mushrooms with queso blanco/fresco, and [grilled] fish with a pineapple salsa. The three palm-sized smoked chicken quesadillas are heavy with chicken and cheese. Both platters come garnished with a sharp and tangy serano slaw, black beans, and fresh flavorful cilantro rice.

Back to what brought us here... the Sangria.

Now its hard to tell (especially in Vegas) just how good/effective a sangria can be. It's *meant* to creep, right? (JM, Cobes, and I went 2-3 carafes not realizing the fade!) But I must say, the sangria here is good. Not too tart, not too sweet. Retains the silken feel of red wine and the warm flush of brandy is subtle. It's a slow ride into troubled waters. What a perfect way to ease into the crazy. Gimme more!

Safe to say, for casual dining, good people watching, and a creeper of a drink, I'd gladly add Canonita to the yearly tradition.

No, really. I have a note to myself on my phone from last year...
 "Must do Sangria again!"
I don't remember writing it.
