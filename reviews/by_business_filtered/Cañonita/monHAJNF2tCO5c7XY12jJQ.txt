My friends and I wanted a good bite that was neither fast foody or wouldn't break the bank.

Great choice. Food was delicious including appetizers, entrees and margaritas.

To plus, the setting is very nice- an "open air"/replica of the day time sky ceiling and location next to a "Venetian canal" added great ambiance. Well done.
