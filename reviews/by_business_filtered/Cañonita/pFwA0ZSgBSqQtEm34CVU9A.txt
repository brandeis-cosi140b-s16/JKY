I patronize this place for one primary reason: the coca pina cocktail. IT's over-priced for sure, but is oh-so delicious. Delicious! And it's served in an actual coconut. Do you like coconut? Then you should come drink this cocktail. It's everything a coconut drink should be. It's so yummy that I can down 4-5 before realizing I just drank that many. It's sweet and smooth and is just plain yummy. So come on in to the bar and devour a few of these.

Oh, and they have food too. The food is pretty tasty as well. Seems quite authentic and worth the price. Plus, the service is very attentive.
