we came here for happy hour while shopping around the canals. cute place, we sat in the bar and split the grilled tilapia fish tacos (3 rico tacos) topped with a pineapple/mango salsa for $6, and the chips and tres salsa trio also $5-6. the salsas were super delicious. the tilapia tacos weren't so great, the fish tasted fishy but the pineapple mango salsa was tasty! the margaritas for $5 weren't very big but they were really refreshing and packed a punch! would come back for more tasty apps (minus the tilapia) and drinks.
