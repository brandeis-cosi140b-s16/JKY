Insanely good Flautas!!!!!!!!!!!! This place is in the Venetian and was incredible. It kind of just looks like a Mexican bar by the shops, but it is a fantastic restaurant. 

Obviously I had the flautas and they were soooooo good!!! The sauce was like nothing I have ever tasted before and I hope I can find a place in Arizona that has something remotely close to it. 

My wife had the tacos with chicken, rice and beans. Everything was delicious!!! I could not believe how much good food we got for the price and their drinks were just as good. 

This was the number one surprise find for me after a week in Vegas. There is even seating alone the river area passing through the hotel giving you the sense that you are out side by the river in Italy.
