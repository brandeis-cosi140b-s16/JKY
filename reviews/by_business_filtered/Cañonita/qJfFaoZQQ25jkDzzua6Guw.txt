A bit of a disappointment.

After Phantom of the Opera, we decided to stop and have a drink. We decided to go to Taqueria Canonita because we can sit next to the canals and watch the gondaliers. We have also eaten here in the past and the food was very good.

The hostess was very friendly and promptly seated us next to the canal. We waited for quite awhile before the waiter came over to bring water, it went south from here. He took the drink order and we never saw him again. The manager delivered our drinks, brought the water we had originally requested and that was the extent of our service.

This was very disappointing as the restaurant was by no means full. The waiter never checked back in nor did the manager. He dropped the check on the table without even stopping and was observed chit chatting over off to the side while tables were being ignored. We left cash to cover the drinks, no tip.

Although the food is good, and the ambiance of being next to the canal is nice, the service of an eatery speaks volumes to me. I doubt I will ever go back. If I treated my clients with that same type of service I would be out of business. Maybe they ought to think of that, my bill pays your wages, without a client you won't have a job. Enough preaching. Just disappointed in the lack of service I am seeing in some of my past favorites in Las Vegas.
