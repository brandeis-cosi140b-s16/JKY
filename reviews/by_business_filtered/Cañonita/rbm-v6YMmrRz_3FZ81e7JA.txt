Although the waitstaff was excellent and environment was nice; just overlooking the gondola rides the food was quite sad. 

They use the phrase soul food however there is definitely no soul in this food. The restaurants food didn't have any flavor at all; it was incredible plain.  I have tasted more flavor from the seasoning packets at the grocery store. I recommend you go somewhere else and save your money. The only thing delicious here are the chips.
