I had the pleasure of dining here today (6/11/10) actually while exploring the Venetian for all its wonders. It happened to be happy hour when we were passing by.  The big happy hour menu is what caught our attention and from there we were drawn in like moths to a flame. 

We were seated very quickly and the setting overlooked the Venetian's waterway. A nice romantic scene for you and your loved one. The waiter Alejandro who's name brought Lady GaGa's song to mind immediately. Alejandro, Alejandro, Ale, Ale, Ale, Ale, Alejandro... however many times she repeats it. He was awesome.

I was in a chicken taco kind of mood as usual, but I quickly changed my mind after I saw the chicken enchiladas. You had your choice of toppings but I can only remember the molé poblano for whatever reason. My wife opted for the chicken tacos surprisingly. 

Of course I ordered a Modelo (it was fitting at the time) and my wife ordered the cape cod. We should have ordered chips and salsa because the drinks came right away which was cool, but since we haven't really eaten anything prior to, our buzz started to kick in after a few rounds. The cape cod was very strong as you can taste more vodka then cranberry juice, but we were in Vegas so who cared. The stronger the better.  

When the food arrived we were slightly tipsy and before my wife got the opportunity top dig in I reached for my fork and blocked her from grabbing the chicken tacos. I wanted to take a few snaps of them as they were. It's what I do. 

The chicken tacos according to my wife were very flavorful and juicy. My chicken enchiladas were excellent and I would highly recommend them topped with the molé poblano sauce as it adds a wonderful kick. The black beans and cilantro rice were the perfect sides. 

If you get the opportunity give it a try and if possible see if you can get seated in Alejandro's section. He was very attentive. We had an awesome experience!
