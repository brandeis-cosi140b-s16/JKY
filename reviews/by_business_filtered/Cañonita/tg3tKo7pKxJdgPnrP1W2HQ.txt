Food was amazing! Super delicious, wonderfully prices and great porky on sizes. A little upset the meal didn't come with chips and salsa but other than that I love this place. 
The biggest issues that I had was with the hostess. Upon entering the restaurant I was told rudely that "UM YEAH WE DON'T ALLOW OUTSIDE DRINKS IN HERE SO THROW THAT AWAY NOW". If she had simply informed me politely that they didn't allow outside drinks that would have been fine but she pretty much went out of her way to make a scene. When I finished my drink and was seated with my party the ENTIRE night she kept motioning and pointing to me, telling the wait staff to keep and eye on me and kept shorting me dirty looks and shaking her head. A shame that the hostess really ruined a great meal for me and my party...just remember: it's not what you say but how you say it!
