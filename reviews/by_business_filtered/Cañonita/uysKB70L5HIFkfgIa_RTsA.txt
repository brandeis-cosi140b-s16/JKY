You MUST eat here if you visit The Venetian in Vegas. Looking back, I don't think that I've ever skipped lunch/dinner at this joint on any of my visits to Vegas since 2002. The most awesome part about dining here is the fact that you're eating delicious food and drinking bomb-azz sangria right next to the Grand Canal, serenaded by the gondola singers and getting that awesome water reflection off the roof and the lights surrounding the area.

I want to quote About.com's review on Taqueria Canonita (because this is exactly how I feel and couldn't describe it better):
"This inspired eatery takes the flavors of Old Mexico and serves them with an exciting, New American ambiance- all beside the gracefully flowing Grand Canal. Experience true "south of the border" taste and tradition with authentic Mexican offerings like chile rellenos, tacos al carbon or shrimp quesadillas. The taste of their hand-made corn tortillas alone is enough to transport you to another world. The dcor is as vivid as the menu with casual ambiance, high ceilings and bright, bold colors. Taqueria Caonita's lively exhibition kitchen is the restaurant's centerpiece. Enjoy your meal amidst the sculpted steel and wrought-iron gates, colorful Mexican tiles and authentic Mexican folk art. Even better, Taqueria Caonita's patio is set beside the Grand Canal, offering terrific views of our Venetian streetscapes and passing gondolas."

I would also like to add that 90% of the servers who work here are easy on the eyes and know what customer service is all about ;) which makes for an even better dining experience.
