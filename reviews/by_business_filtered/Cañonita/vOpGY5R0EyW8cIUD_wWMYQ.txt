After getting in mid Saturday afternoon we were hungry for Mexican food. Walking into the Venetian and scanning the canal we settled on Taqueria Canonita. We were seated quickly right at the canal with a great view of everyone on their Gondolas. 

Everything on the menu looked good and so did all the plates we saw. We did choose to get their $29.99 app, entree, and dessert. Good value there. Salads were big and very fresh, the tortilla-esque  soup had good kick to it, enchiladas were perfect, and the desserts were perfectly portioned and tasty.

Drinks were actually pretty well priced for Vegas...obviously not considering all the free ones you can get on the casino floor. Mojitos are good and well sized for $9 and their sangrias, especially the white, are top notch.

Great casual restaurant but nothing in paticular stood out to me to make it a 5 star. Great casual place to stop for a walking break and snack. 

Spend-o-meter: We spent $80 with drinks but really the 2 full 3 course meals were $29ea.
Value: If you pass on alcohol than it's a great value...alcohol probably takes it just outside of good value. 
Will I go back: Yes...too many good looking dishes I wanted to try. Their salsas and guac seem to make a good impression on everyone.

Definately visit Taqueria Canonita at the Venetian...you'll be glad you did.
