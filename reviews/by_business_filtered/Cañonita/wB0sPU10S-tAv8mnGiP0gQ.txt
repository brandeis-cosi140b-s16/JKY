We searched for this place. It turns out that we hit the jackpot! If you want to learn, as an adult, about various tequilas....this is the place. We did not have food but we did learn much, from Alex, how what tequila was and truly is. This place is classy and open to all with the restaurant attached. The menu looked great. We hope to return. They have been there 16 years.
