I have been to a lot of Mexican restaurants in Vegas and the rest of America but this place is up-scale.  Some real traditional Mexican cooking with good quality fresh ingredients.  You might have to listen to some tourists on the canal and some gondola captain singing, but the food is great.   Fresh flour tortillas, Pork Empanadas, with a fantastic red sauce.  Some of the best guacamole that wasn't all garlicy.  It was good and fresh.  Also had a fantastic vegy chile relleno with dried fruit, masa crust, wonderful roasted vegetables, rice and a great poblano sauce  and would be just fantastic if not for the goat cheese.  Why must I always have to eat goat cheese and butternutt squash in nice restaurants.  The salsa is a smoky variety with good chips and some fantastic queso or fundido.  This place has been around a long time and is really good.
