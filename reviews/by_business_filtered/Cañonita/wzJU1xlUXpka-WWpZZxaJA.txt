Restaurant was packed so we didn't bother to wait so I can only rate on their margaritas to-go. My friend ordered a watermelon margarita in their 48oz tube. We're not the type to walk around Vegas with a huge tube of alcohol, or lack of in this case, but my friend's been saying he would get one of those one day but we didn't think it would cost us $31! Seriously it would've been a great deal if it had a lot of alcohol in it, but it just tasted like bland watermelon juice. 
I'm glad that we didn't wait 30mins for dinner because it doesn't seem like the food would've been good. We headed to Dos Caminos @ the Palazzo which has better ratings. Drinks were great over there.
