Overall I was unsatisfied. The service wasn't anything to write home about. The food was incredibly bland. It didn't help that one of my dinning partners claimed it to be the best mexican food restaurant she has ever been to. Yeah maybe just a little too much hype going on. Take a pass on this place there are so many better choices in Vegas.
