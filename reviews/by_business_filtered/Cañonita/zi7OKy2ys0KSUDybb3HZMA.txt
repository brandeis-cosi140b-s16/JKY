This was an almost daily happy hour haunt for me on my week long Vegas voyage and I'm really upset I didn't get to eat an actual meal here. So this review is mostly for the bar.

The happy hour is from 3-6pm and 9pm-close. $3 wells and beers and $5 margaritas and specialty drinks, one of which was a Long Island Iced Tea! 

There is a bartender who is there almost daily and while he is seemingly polite and friendly he is absolutely buried all the time. Hire this guy some help! And be nice to him, he works hard.

The margaritas are pretty good, not quite as artisinal as some places but good ingredients and a nice amount of the strong stuff. The long islands are served in a short glass but have plenty of kick for the price. Just a great spot to start the day-drinking off right.

The food I was lucky enough to try was awesome. The salsa is made with roasted chilis and has an amazing depth of flavor. Some of my favorite ever. The queso is ridiculous. Get it with the jalapenos and bask in a bowl of awesome cheese. I do wish they gave you more tortillas with it. If you combine it with the salsa you will not be disappointed.

Everything else on the menu sounded really awesome and I will have to eat an actual meal here on my next trip out. It's a favorite.
