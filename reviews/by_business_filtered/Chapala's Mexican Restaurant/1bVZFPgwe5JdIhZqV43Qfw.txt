As longtime Vegas residents, we used to really like this place. It's gone downhill. Kind of depressing ambience, I mean there's a difference between not-lavishly-decorated and just plain blah. The food wasn't great, and we were very disappointed in the processed faux guacamole we got for five bucks that was advertised as fresh-made.
