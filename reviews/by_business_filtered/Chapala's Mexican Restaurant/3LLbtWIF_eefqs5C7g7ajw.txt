Love the food. Crazy good flavor while remaining very simple. The burritos aren't filled with rice and beans like most places. Ask for a carne asada taco or burrito and that's what you get. Onions, cilantro, and dead cow cooked to perfection. High quality beef. 
And the Cadillac margarita is the best in this or any other town. Unbelievable. 
Yum yum
