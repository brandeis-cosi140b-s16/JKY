this place is great.  i just recently moved to this side of town and have been here twice now.  the reviews so far are mostly mediocre, but personally, i have loved the food.  it's all home made, the beans are great, tons of selections, etc.  

service is excellent!  they couldn't have been nicer and my water glass was never empty.  go there, see for yourself!  ;)
