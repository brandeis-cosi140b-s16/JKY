Terrible service. Not friendly. Very negative experience. 

Never a yes, always a no we can't mentality. Just not a good vibe from the staff. Dining with friends is supposed to be a good time, not an unpleasant one. 

Food was edible but not worth a return. The burritos were ok, not much to them, it was like there was a lack of food love by the chef. The plates that my frieds ordered looked like baby puke and you could even tell that is was a quesadilla. It was smimming in everything around it. 

I won't be recommending this place to people and if they mention that they are going I will say don't go, go to XYZ, service it much better and so is the food. 

I am not a picky eater, nor a food snob, but this place is not worth the time or money that you spend there. 

AND TO STRESS AGAIN... THE CASHIER WAS JUST A RUDE RUDE RUDE WOMAN!!! If you hate your life and your job that much, then you shouldn't  work in customer service. 

Really how hard is it to be friendly and smile to people. This is a city where it is acceptable to at least pretend to be happy and smile to your customers. 

I'd rather go to a taco shack!
