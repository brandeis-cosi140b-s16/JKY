My husband and I like to consider ourselves Mexican food aficionados. As our favorite type of cuisine and my husband from San Diego, we find there are not too many good Mexican "sit down" restaurants in Vegas. Yah...you can go with these people who don't know true good Mexican food and join the "Vegas Michoacan" bandwagon with their ridiculous prices and bad food OR you can eat at Chapala's delicious food and enjoy their great prices.  My husband and I frequent Chapala's and love, love their beans. Good Mexican food is all about good beans for us and they hit the mark. The rice is tasty as well. I always get the enchiladas or ground beef taco, or both! The enchilada sauce is my style - not too red, more of an orangey color and lots of cheese...sometimes a special surprise...hot and gooey cheese that has snuck its self under the rice! I am not sure about the unfriendly service people state on here, we have never experienced it - maybe it is just one server and we have never had that one?? They are always pleasant and the food comes out super fast. Their prices rock! Under $9 for a 2 item combo and under $8 for a 1 item combo! The chips are always good and warmed...One complaint, they are definitely lacking in the salsa department. The mild tastes like plain tomato sauce. I do like the hot chunky salsa, sometimes super hot. My trick is to spoon some of the hot into the mild and it makes a good salsa! I will forgive them for the not so great salsa because of the excellent tasting beans and enchiladas!
