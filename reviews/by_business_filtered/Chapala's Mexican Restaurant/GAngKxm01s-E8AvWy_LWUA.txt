Ordered the shrimp cocktail for starters at lunch, and it was absolutely delicious!  The shrimp were sweet and cold, the cocktail sauce had just the right spice to it ~ thoroughly enjoyed and will be returning soon!  The rest of the meal was good, like the refried beans were very tasty.....saw other dishes being served and they all looked and smelled great.  Prices were very reasonable, everything was clean.
