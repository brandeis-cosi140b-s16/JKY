**********TACO TUESDAY*********

My first ever Taco Tuesday was here.  Went with a LOT of rowdy people and the place was seemingly cool with the huge loud crowd, and even was able to seat us (I'm talking like 50 people).

I got a meal #27, don't remember exactly what it was but it included tacos and beans and was pretty epic-tasting.  The meal combo seemed so perfect that all of my friends got the #27 and loved it just as much.  However, my friend Greg did not get the #27 and was temporarily shunned for doing so. 

The chips are epic, as was the salsa and the interior decor.  

Also epic are their margaritas (and from what I remember, cheap too).  There is a seperate bar area you can go to get away from your crowd and order drinks.  Bar is especially cool because there are pictures of el guapo and wooden ships to look at while you order/drink.  

Cabs were ready and willing to take us back to the strip after we were finished eating.  I rode with chuckyhacks and it was fun.

WOULD GO AGAIN, HAD A BLAST, 11/10 STARS.
