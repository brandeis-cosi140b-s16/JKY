Last night was our second time at Chapala's.  The food was good, inexpensive but tasty and with big portions.  
I had the chile relleno served a la carter.  For $4, I wasn't expecting much but the portion was huge and I was full with just that (and the chips of course).  The relleno is stuffed with cheese, and the plating is pretty average. I've also had the beef chimichanga and the appetizer sampler.  
I think the food is flavored for Americans more than a true Mexican palate.  This isn't trendy food or a trendy atmosphere.  
But I give it four stars because they serve good tasting, well priced, large portions of food.  They have good service (for the most part), and while your neighbors may be loud, they don't pipe the music in at such a volume that you can't have a conversation.  Oh, and it is easy to get a parking space.
