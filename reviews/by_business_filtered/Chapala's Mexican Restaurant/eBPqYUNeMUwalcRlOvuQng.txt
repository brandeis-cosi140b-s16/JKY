If you want an old school restaurant with old school Mexican food at reasonable prices, Chapala's is for you.  The staff is friendly and accommodating, the atmosphere is laid back and family-friendly, and the food is really good.  It was the best Mexican I've had in a long while, and I'm from Los Angeles.  Great job!
