3 Stars for Taste

Chapala's Mexican Restaurant has been around for years.  According to the waiter, they recently moved to this location to here.  The prices here are pretty good.  For $13, you can get their 3 item combo which also includes rice & beans. I chose their Chicken Taco, Chicken Enchilada, and Chili Relleno.  Tough for me to say it wasn't good because I demolished it.  All items were good, but nothing that really sets them apart from all other dine in Mexican Restaurants.  Besides, I still prefer your hole in the wall type south of the border stops. 

Food came out quick and this was probably due to the fact that we were the only guest here. I can't imagine how this place is when it's busy.  Service here was okay and with lunch comes free chips with salsa.  The basket for the chips is small, but refills are free.  Not the best chips in town, but will hit the spot while you wait for your food. 

Overall 3 Stars because they are just okay.
