I have been coming to this place since I was a kid. Before they used to have a smaller, more intimate location with a large water fountain. It was beautiful and the staff would treat you like family with amazing food.

Now, they have moved to a larger location. It kinda reminds me of a Mexican Denny's.

It is not as good as it once was, and much of the original staff is now gone. However, I still believe it's the best Mexican food in town. A step down from what it once was, but still, the best.
