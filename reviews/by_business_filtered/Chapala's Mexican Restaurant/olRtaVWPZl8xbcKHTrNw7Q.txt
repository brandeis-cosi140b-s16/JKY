Came here on Valentine's Day and had a great meal! Our waitress was very friendly.  Our food arrived quickly and was very tasty. My friend said his cheese quesadilla was probably the best one he ever had. They didn't skimp on the sour cream and guacamole like many Mexican restaurants do. The prices were reasonable and the amount of food was generous. With so many competing restaurants in the area this place should do well if they continue to provide good food and good service.
