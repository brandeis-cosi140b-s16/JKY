Food portions were awful! The salsa was too spicy but not a traditional salsa spicy. It killed all flavoring into. The guacamole had ONLY avocado and about 5 pomegranate seeds. And my tortilla soup was cold and about 6oz for 8 bucks so not worth it. Not to mention I ordered to go and it took 40 min to get me my food. Very very annoying. Will NEVER return.
