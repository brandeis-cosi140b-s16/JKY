Arrived in Vegas and wandered the strip looking for a reasonably priced breakfast without going the fast food route. This restaurant is located just off the hustle bustle of the strip, near the High Roller ride. Our waiters, Chad and Charles, were very friendly and attentive. My mate and I each enjoyed a full breakfast (eggs, bacon, toast, potatoes and beans) for $12 each which is pretty reasonable for Vegas. We ate outside in shady comfort with some great people watching for entertainment.
