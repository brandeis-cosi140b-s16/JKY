Ok where do I begin...? First we were sat very quickly at a table being cleared... Food still on the seats of the chairs so just wiping onto the ground, nice... Second ordered drinks. 2 beers for the guys, very safe bet if you are going here... I ordered a Poncho Villa which was to have spicy tequila lime juice fresh watermelon cucumber and mint, let just say poorly executed by the bartender no mint and then garnish with a crappy cherry and an orange wedge REALLY.... Taste your drinks before they go out because that one was bad, it was undrinkable.... Now to the food, wow where do I began...? We ordered Filet Steak Nachos, I would like to know what the meat was, and the chip were stale, canned cheese sauce and bad presentation... Next was the Botana Platter.... Just say NO to this... it was cold and not good looking on the plate and the meat on the dish cooked to death and to top it off dirty oil... Next up was the Tinga Chicken Tostada's. I don't know what the meat was. Was it chicken? This mystery meat was a dry and cooked to death flavorless failure... The kitchen staff should be ashamed of the food coming out of that kitchen... My note is you have a prime location, you could have some great food and cocktails coming out of that kitchen and bar it's not that hard... Being a local who enjoys coming down to the strip once in a while was very disappointed with your Restaurant...I urge you to shut your doors today and not reopen until your entire concept is re-evaluated and start over.
