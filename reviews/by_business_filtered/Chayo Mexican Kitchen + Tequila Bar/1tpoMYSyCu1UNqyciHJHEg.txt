Visiting Vegas from San Diego with a girlfriend and had to check out the linq.  Came across this very cool restautant, Chayo.  The decor was very inviting and we love Mexican food (again, from San Diego) .... thank goodness we decided to go in.  Sat down and was greeted by a super friendly waiter.  The chips and salsa were delicious.  I love spicy food so the red salsa was my favorite.  Chips were warm and seasoned.   My girlfriend and I decided to go family style and shared the chicken enchiladas and Mahi Mahi...wow. We ate our plates clean. I will say it's a little pricer than the Mexican restaurants we go to back home, but I'm sure being on the strip has something to do with it.  We will definitely be returning with friends....and we may even try the bull riding.  That's right, theres a mechanical bull and a DJ in the restaurant...Whatt?!?!? That's a good time! 

Oh, try the Office cocktail... so refreshing.
