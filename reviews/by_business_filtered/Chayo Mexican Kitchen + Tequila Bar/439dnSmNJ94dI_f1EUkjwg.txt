Came on Memorial Day hungover and hungry. Ordered the shrimp ceviche and the breakfast burrito. Both were pretty good. The ceviche is different than what I'm used to. It was more of a tomato based ceviche, but still good. The breakfast burrito was good, but I think the beans overpowered the other ingredients.

Christina was our server and she was super nice! She was constantly checking up on us during our meal. Service was good and she was very friendly.
