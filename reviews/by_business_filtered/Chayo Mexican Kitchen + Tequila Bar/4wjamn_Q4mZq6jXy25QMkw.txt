After being greeted by some positive, smiling girls at the podium by the entrance, we decided to sit in the wonderful bar area that opens up to outside to the patio by the new Linq. 

It was happy hour so I took advantage of the 2 for 1 margaritas. They were perfect! Absolutely delicious. 

To pair with the drinks, we ordered some guacamole that had pomegranate seeds in it. What a delightful touch. So fresh. 

We had a big dinner planned so the only other item we shared were the lobster tacos. Pretty good value during happy hour as these were just to die for. Maybe the best lobster tacos I've ever tried. 

Service was attentive and professional. Btw- there's a cool mechanical bull in the middle of the restaurant you should check out too!
