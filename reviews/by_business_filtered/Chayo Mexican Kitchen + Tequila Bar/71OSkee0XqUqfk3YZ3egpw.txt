We decided to go to the Linq, walk around and celebrate St. Patrick's Day there. Chayo seemed appealing with their decoration so we decided to sit and eat lunch there.

Our experience was absolutely horrible. The restaurant wasn't as packed as we anticipated (for being St. Patty's day). When we sat, we waited a bit to be served. We placed our drinks order. We waited like 20 min for them to be delivered. We finally placed our food order and it took forever to arrive as well. We ordered chicken, fried fish, and lobster tacos to start and they were all pretty bland and simple. Definitely not worth the price. When we got our tacos, we ordered some hot sauce to make them a little tasty. They took so long to bring the hot sauce that we finished every single one of our tacos!! When someone finally brought the hot sauce, they just dropped it off quickly and they even forgot to take the wrapper off! So WE had to do that. Thanks! Great service! 

We constantly had empty plates on our table. The busser would take so long to clear our table that we had glasses of beer stacked on top of each other. 

Every time that we would order a beer, it would literally take 20 min to get it. So be aware of this! 

When we finished eating the tacos (starters) the busser was already setting the table for dessert when we didn't even order our main course. My friend ordered the shrimp fajitas as a main course and they were extremely greasy. Wish we had just gone straight to dessert instead. 

It really was a horrible service even though 70% of the tables in the restaurant were empty. I wouldn't go back to this place at all!
