First off the chips & salsa are great they have a good quality chip (that's good by itself) and the salsa is spicy. But has a good combination of flavors. I ordered the taco combination platter consisting of carnitas,chicken,prime beef. Comes with beans and rice. The beans are flavored spicy the rice is plain, but when you mix'em together you have a treat. Overall my tacos were delicious would definitely go back again.
