Worst service ever. We walked in this morning and got seated right away. Not too many people for breakfast yet. The waitress walked by us about 5 times without even glancing our way. Finally I stopped her and ask her if someone could take our order and she said I will be with you right away. After about 10 minutes, and her walking by us another 5x we got up and left. We were there probably 15 to 20 minutes with no one even asking us if we wanted coffee. When we walked out I told the hostess that they had the worst service ever. She asked us if we were sitting by the mechanical bull and I said yes, and she just made a sorry looking face but never even apologized. Will never return to this place and I will never recommend it. If I could give it negative stars I would.
