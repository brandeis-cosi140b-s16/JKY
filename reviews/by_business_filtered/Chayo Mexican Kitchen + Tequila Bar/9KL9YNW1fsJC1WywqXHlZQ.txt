We got seated inside and waited about 15 to 20 minutes to see if anybody was even going to acknowledge our presence. At that point we went back up to the hostess and asked if we could be re-seated outside. Those tables were all taken but she said if we went back to our table she would make sure we got waited on. She sent over the waiter who never apologized for his lack of attention to us. The food was good but nothing out of the ordinary. Plus the waiter did not even come by once to see if we needed anything after our food was delivered - never refilled our drinks or anything. We could see him off in the distance talking to other waiters!

The gentleman who delivered our food said he would bring over some homemade salsa and that never happened either!! That probably was the worst service I've ever had at a restaurant! Don't go there!!
