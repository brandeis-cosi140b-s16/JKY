My family and I were pressed for time and was really hungry. We literally looked at the first empty restaurant and asked for a party of 11. I wish we looked in a different direction. When we told the hostess she just looked at me like I was a crazy person for asking for a table for 11. After staring at me for a bit, she said "ok." and walked away. I assumed that she was going to go look for a spot to put us, but then she never came back. We stood there for 10 minutes without anyone saying to us or helping us out. Then another woman came up to us and politely said, "have you been help?" She ended up seating us right away, which was really strange because that other girl just disappeared or just didn't want to help us.

Our server took our order pretty quickly and our food and drinks didn't take too long to come out either. However, once she dropped off the food, we never really saw her until she dropped off the plates. The restaurant was almost empty so I don't know what she was doing or where she went. We also didn't get any silverware with our food, so we were just waiting around for someone to drop it off for us. To top it off, when we did ask someone to help us, they responded with, "that's not my job." and another person said "I'm not allowed to bring food out." I have worked in a restaurant for over 5 years and this type of behavior baffles me.

The only redeeming things about this place were their margaritas, filet steak nachos, and chicken enchiladas. Those all tasted pretty good, but nothing special. However, my boyfriend ordered the Mexico city burrito and it was literally the smallest burrito I have ever seen in my life. For $18 we expected something either huge or extremely delicious, but it was neither.

Overall, horrible experience! I would have given it zero stars but the margaritas, nachos and enchiladas saved it.
