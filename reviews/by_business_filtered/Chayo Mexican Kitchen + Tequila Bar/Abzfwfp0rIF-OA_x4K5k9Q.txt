Ate here about 2 weeks after it opened and the issue I found was even though we went at around 2ish there was no greeter and we decided to just go up to bar.  No sure why you spend cash loads of money to build a really cool restaurant and then just go with subpar servers and probably poor management.      

On good side the food was pretty good although probably a little bit over priced for what you get but hey it's the Vegas strip.  This place if it can get its act together can kill it with the high roller drawing in huge crowds and having indoor outdoor seating it will be a fun spot.  

Beer was good and bartender good as well.  Clean up it up with more attentive service and better hosts and improve food a bit and it will do great.    Might be a winner after they make some changes:)
