We came here for a late breakfast and couldn't have made a better choice!! All the staff were so friendly and Rachel, our lovely server, was awesome!! I had the breakfast skillet and Jus had the breakfast burrito and we shared French toast. Everything was so tasty and perfectly portioned.  Must try!!
