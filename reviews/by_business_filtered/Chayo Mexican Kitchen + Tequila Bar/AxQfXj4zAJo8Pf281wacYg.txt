Christina was the best waitress I have had in Vegas. This was my first time staying her with my mom and we were starving. We saw Chayo and it looked awesome so we came in. We were seated in Christina's section and she was so friendly right off the beat, made us feel very welcome, and took care of us with the brightest smile. Please don't let her go unrecognized!
