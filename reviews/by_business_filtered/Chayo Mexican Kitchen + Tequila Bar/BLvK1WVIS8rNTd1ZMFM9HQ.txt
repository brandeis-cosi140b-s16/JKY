My boyfriend and I had a guest in town so we decided to take him down to the Linq. We wanted to have a great view of the ferris wheel and chose Chayo because they have a balcony area and considering the only other bar open that night with a balcony was Yardhouse, which we've been to a dozen times in Town Square.

I must say the look and atmosphere of Chayo is really wonderful. It's whimsical and inviting from the outside, and once you enter there is a mechanical bull in the center of the restaurant. We ended up at the bar to wait for seating on the balcony. There was a bartender there who was phenomenal. I didn't catch his name but he was older. He was incredibly nice and informative. The hostesses, server, and even our busser were all wonderful, as well. The food being served looked good and smelled even better while we waited, so I was excited to try it!

UNFORTUNATELY.

This was an incredibly MUNDANE mexican food experience. The food was so bland. It was definitely edible, don't get me wrong, but I payed $18 for really blah chicken enchiladas. The guy sitting next to me at the bar had ordered them and they looked wonderful so thats why I chose them. 

So. Much. Regret. I also got the $8 INCREDIBLY TINY tortilla soup which was basically tomato water. It honestly looks like it comes in a shot glass. The chips they served tasted great and the salsa was ok, nothing special. My boyfriend even said we should have just stuck to our local Super Burrito! Ugh. The only thing making up for the food was the view. 

I wanted to give this place a try because for some bizarre reason I thought it'd be different than a few other mexican strip restaurants, but no, I was so, so wrong. The price isn't really the issue, I ALWAYS expect to pay absurd amounts for food/drink when I come to the strip. 

I really hope this place improves their menu. The pleasant staff and beautiful look of the restaurant should be reason to improve the quality of your food.
