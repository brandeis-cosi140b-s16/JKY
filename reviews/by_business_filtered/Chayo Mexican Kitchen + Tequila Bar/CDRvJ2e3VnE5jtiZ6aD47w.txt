Four of us, well dressed.  Just off a flight from Austin.  Met friends who live in Vegas and know the town, and wanted to try a new place for a late afternoon cocktail mid-week. Friendly (if inefficient) servers; the outside patio bar upstairs is quite nice. BUT... Chayo is a complete and total ripoff.  If you want to pay $100 for bad chips, 4 EXTREMELY watery highballs (like a G&T with absolutely NO whiff of gin), and you like to be overcharged, then this is the place for you.  There are plenty of better choices. Ugh.
