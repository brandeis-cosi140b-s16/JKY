Arrived in Vegas from the Midwest after a predawn flight with our stomachs yearning for lunch. We saw Chayos and swooped in. We were seated outside and handed breakfast menus. Oh well. We both ordered pancakes with bananas in syrup. Delicious! People seated near us had ordered omelettes that looked beautiful...and gigantic. Our server was pleasant and fairly attentive, but then again, we were pleasant to him. The "Uh-oh" moment came when we received the bill. We handed him the credit card and he said, "Oh, didn't the hostess tell you that we can only take cash today? We are having trouble with our computers." Well, no, she didn't say anything other than, "follow me" as she scurried outside. Yes, we had cash. No, I didn't plan on using it for food while here. What if we DIDN'T have any?!? Crazy. So, we paid...in cash...and we won't be back even though they have good food. They have a terribly incompetent team of workers with an obviously equally negligent manager.  If you go, make sure to ask about the day's payment options.
