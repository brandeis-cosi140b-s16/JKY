Christina was awesome! Very chill, attentive, and overall great server....we are now friends because she is from SoCal like me.

The food was delicious! I definitely recommend the lobster tacos. The restaurant is very relax during lunch time and it is cool to see people ride the mechanical bull.

Check this place out!!!!!
