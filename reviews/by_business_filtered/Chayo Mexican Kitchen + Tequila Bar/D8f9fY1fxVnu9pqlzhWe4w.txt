low budget Mexican food, with some "make it look good" add-on's, at Las Vegas strip prices. The burrito was nothing more than what you would get at a taco truck, and the enchilada's were all tortilla. The service was very so-so, and the bartender didn't even know how to make a coffee with Kahlua and Bailey's, yet they tried to charge it as two drinks($25)...not worth your time.
