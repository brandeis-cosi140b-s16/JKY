I'd pass on this.  There are plenty of places on the strip who do great Mexican food.  This is not one of them.  They got one star because I can't give them none.  We just wanted a nice jalape√±o infused margarita but 3 tries later and we gave up.  The manager was snotty and not interested in making customers happy.  Just don't bother.

I added a star due to the fact that I received an almost immediate response from the management who were quite concerned about the service.  So I am thinking this is certainly not the way their staff has been trained.  I will give it another try
