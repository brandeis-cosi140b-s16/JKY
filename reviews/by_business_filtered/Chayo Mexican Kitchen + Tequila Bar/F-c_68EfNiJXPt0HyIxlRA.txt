I really wanted to give this place 1 star, but given that I never stepped into this place this review is only for the food. My friend told me he was going to stop by this place to pick up some food. I told him to order me a burrito. He ordered the tacos for himself. Looking at the pictures, the food looks delicious. I would like to give this place a second chance. My food was tasteless. No flavor. I got the carnitas. The sauce on the side didn't help either. Bland taste. My friends tacos had also no flavor. I don't know if I'm missing something, but an $18 burrito better taste something like $18. Overpriced. I could of gotten way more better Mexican food for less. This was the closet thing since there was no taqueria near by my hotel.
