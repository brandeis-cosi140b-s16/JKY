So within the Linq next to an entrance to the Flamingo sits Chayo and certainly it was quite a fiesta..Now whether that's good or bad I guess the remainder will help determine?

It had almost a dive bar feel to me as it was a very small enclosure, but with it being NFL Sunday it did seem to house quite the mass of people..Atmosphere wise it was certainly popping, but a draw back for me was the street performers to the right from the flamingo charging pictures with a parrot..Can't say hearing those things squawk through the entire meal makes me feel like a high roller!

Foodwise I was sold on the lobster tacos..They came out in a quantity of 3 and more towards street taco size, but I did find them to be well worth it..The lobster itself came battered and fried which oddly enough worked for me and the tortilla itself did have a light feel to it and I wasn't left heavy as the meal concluded

Our server seemed a bit off though as his one liners were met with crickets and he didn't take too kindly to us not wanting to try the specials of the night..He wasn't quite his joking self when I passed on ordering the highly recommended chicken or steak burrito..It was almost as if I was in an abusive relationship and not allowed to order for myself when it came down to it

 Overall I can look past a weird waiter and just say I would give this another go for a mexican craving walking around the Linq..Maybe next time I will not have to drive so that I can take in the alky and review that as well!
