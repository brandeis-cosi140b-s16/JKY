We stopped at Chayo over the weekend while exploring around the LINQ. 
The front patio is nice and great people watching. The service was not the best.
The guy tried, but after ordering one of the top shelf margaritas I switched the house margarita for drink #2. I ordered another margarita and out came the premium margarita. He sort of looked at me and walked away. Charging me for the higher priced drink. After that we left.
