I came here on a Sunday morning around 10am, and we wanted to grab a bite and get some Bloody Mary's . I'm glad we popped in. They don't serve breakfast. They have the traditional Mexican fare. I had the  chicken enchiladas,  it doesn't come with rice nor beans, it's was tasty. My boyfriend scored when he ordered the carnitas taco plate. It came with rice and frijoles de la olla. (Which is pinto beans with a tad bit of chorizo)  quite excellent,  reminded me of childhood.  Recommend the carnitas taco plate.

Absolutely wonderful Bloody Mary mix, which is house made and we were offered a taste before we picked regular or spicy. I ordered spicy and it was just enough kick of horse radish.  Yummy!!! My boyfriend ordered regular, drank half of it and added a corona,  the best bloody beer in Nevada.
