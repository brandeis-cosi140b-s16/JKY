Chayo has the best food ever. I had the vegetarian enchiladas, which were sooo delicious. The ambiance was also very impressive. It provided a calm atmosphere in the midst of the crazy Las Vegas strip. Samantha was our waitress and she was very pleasant!! My friend wanted some vegetarian creation and Samantha did her best and made it happen. I highly recommend this place. I would definitely go back next time I'm in Vegas!
