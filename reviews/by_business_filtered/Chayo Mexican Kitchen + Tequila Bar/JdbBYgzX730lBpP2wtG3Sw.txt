Went here on 3-27-15 around 7pm male bartender had long dirty blond hair gelled back. (No name tag) My friend and I ask him for a water because our food was spicy, as I sat at the bar I saw him grab ONE clean glass, and one DIRTY glass covered in salt. He took both in his hand and put them under the counter, and rinsed them off, thinking I would not notice. He then proceeded to fill both the clean and dirty glass with ice and water. Then without hesitation, put them down in front of us. I was extremely grossed out. There was salt in my glass, at the bottom. WILL NEVER EAT HERE EVER AGAIN! 

I am a server and I would never do this, it reflected in his tip. Extremely disappointed, this guy needs a write up or to get fired! Get rid of jerks like him!
