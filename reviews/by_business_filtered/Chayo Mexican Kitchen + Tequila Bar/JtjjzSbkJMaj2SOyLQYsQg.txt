Wanted to like this place more due to its location on the strip and at the Linq. Pretty fun to watch guys and girls on dates get thrown off the mechanical bull. Chicken enchiladas were solid. Fresh blackened peppers and corn was good. Service was ok. Weren't flexible on options and were slow. Often seems busy. May try ahi next time if not just to see more macho men thrown on their heads by the bull. Live music close at the boulevard bar.
