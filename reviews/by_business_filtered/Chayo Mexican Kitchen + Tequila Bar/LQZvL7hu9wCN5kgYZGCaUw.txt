This place was very very good! Prices were pretty low too. We got the guacamole and chips which was topped with pomegranate. It was pretty tasty. We also got the Mexican corn which came with 3mini corns powered with cheese,mayo, chile, and lemon! I got the lobster tacos and it came in 3. It was deep fried lobster topped with chipotle sauce, purple cabbage. It was pretty crispy and delicious although I would have preferred the non fried. My boyfriend got the Torta and felt everything was pretty soggy. It came with shredded chicken, purple onion, and slices of avocado. The side was a small salad with a creamy dressing. We sat outside and the whole area was covered with umbrellas so it was nice and cool in the July weather. Restrooms are upstairs but don't worry they also have an elevator you can use to get up there if needed. They also have an upstairs area with dinning, patio, and a bar. Downstairs in the center they do have an electronic bull to get your ride on or be entertained by those who challenge the bull. Our waiter seemed like he was in a rush and just there, he came, he went, we left. Food was great and we will be back! Oh and you get the High roller view!
