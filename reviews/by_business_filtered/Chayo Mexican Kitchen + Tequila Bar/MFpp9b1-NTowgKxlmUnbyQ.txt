We were in town for a bachelorette party and it was our big night out on the town. After the High Roller, we walked down expecting out rooftop patio to be all ready for us at Chayo (as I requested in my reservation). I called several days before the reservation to confirm the patio. When we arrived, the server brought us into the restaurant and sat us in the main area. I asked to speak with the bar manager, Cary, and he informed me that the patio was closed. I was frustrated that no one had called to inform me that my reservation had changed, and Cary completely understood. He actually opened up the rooftop patio just for our group! 

AWESOME customer service and way to make the night special. We had the whole patio to ourselves, amazing server Malorie was on top of everything, and the food was good. It turned out to be the perfect setting for us! 

The food is worthy of 4 stars. Service is worthy of 5 stars! Environment gets 5 stars. Unknown staff that failed to follow up with me regarding my reservation gets 1 star.

I will return next time I'm in Vegas!
