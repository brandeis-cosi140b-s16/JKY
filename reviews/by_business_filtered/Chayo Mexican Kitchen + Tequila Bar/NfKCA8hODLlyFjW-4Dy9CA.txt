If you like blah wanna be Mexican food go here. 

Had the lobster tacos... Not good. 

Sopes not good... not worth the money 

Cold tortillas, small servings for the prices... Americanized Mexican food for sure but not that great even for that. 

White peach margarita was good and our server was nice :)
