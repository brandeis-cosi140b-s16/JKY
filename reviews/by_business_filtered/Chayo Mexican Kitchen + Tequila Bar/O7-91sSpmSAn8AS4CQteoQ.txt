I was excited to learn that there was a new Tequila Bar in town and my boyfriend and I visited Chayo on a Friday afternoon for his birthday.  Chayo is easy to access if you park at the Flamingo, as you land right at the doors of Chayo when you exit the casino.  Chayo is beautifully decorated and a great place to people-watch.  Although other reviews state that the service was poor, we didn't experience this.  Our server was Masih and he was very attentive and entertaining.  In terms of ambiance, I'd give Chayo 5 stars.  In terms of food and beverage, it gets 3 stars.  Let me explain: 1) the cups seemed dirty and water spotted, which prompted me to ask for a straw; 2) We ordered chips and salsa and the salsa was tasty; 3) Empanadas were $10 as an appetizer and they were delicious; 4) street corn was a side for $8 and it was also tasty; 5) the Sangria ($10) left a lot to be desired as it didn't even have any pieces of fruit in it; the house Margarita was actually good at $14, and shots of other various tequilas were a bit over priced.  We went with the intention of trying a few different tequilas, but at $14+ dollars per shot, we only had one!  We tried the Avion Silver which was good.  

All in all, one shot, one margarita, one Sangria, chips and salsa, street corn, and an appetizer brought our bill to $67.  We didn't even get to the main courses!  I probably wouldn't go back to Chayo until they get realistic with their prices.
