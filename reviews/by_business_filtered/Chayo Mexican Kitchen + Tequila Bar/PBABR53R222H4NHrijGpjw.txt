Food was ok. Waiter was beyond rude. Seated quickly, ignored for a full 17 minutes before the waiter deemed us worth the trouble of waiting on. When our food arrived, it was unceremoniously thrown/dumped onto our table. Serious attitude thrown my husbands way. 
Both guys got major heartburn, yuck. 
Go somewhere else.
