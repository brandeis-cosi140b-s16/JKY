My wife and I visited Las Vegas last week and our final day in the city we had a quick dinner here.  On the positive side, the food was delicious!  I had the enchiladas and my wife had the chicken tacos.  Having said that, I'll be honest and say that the portions were quite small given the prices.

The service left something to be desired.  When we had our server's attention he was great.  But during our visit we spent long periods of time with no sight of him and on three occasions had to ask other servers for basic things - like for cutlery about eight minutes AFTER our food arrived.

Not sure if it was because of the lack of service, but our server did comp our two helpings of chips and salsa we ordered.
