Food was good, service was ok,it was slow on a Fri. but noticed the some of the staff had no training, and acted like they didn't want to be there, I'm a local resident so I'm sure the tourist think we have this all over. TRAIN YOUR STAFF!!! Our server was pleasant,and fast,but the rest forget it!! MARGARITAS were BAD!! for 14$ each.
