HORRIBLE service. The hostess was rude when my friend and I walked up to get seated. She just stared at us for 10 seconds and then asked "can I help you?". Um, yeah. Seat us. Once we sat down our waitress came over fairly quickly but it was all down hill from there. It took forever to get our order taken, when we asked for chips and salsa the waitress looked at me like I was asking for a pony wearing a crown. 

We ordered the steak nachos, no pico and sour cream on the side. When the nachos arrived there was no sour cream, no plates and no silverware. When we got the waitresses attention to let her know the sour cream was missing she looked around the table like we were HIDING it asking "oh you didn't get it?". Seriously? 20 minutes later we got all the aforementioned items but it was too late to salvage any part of this dining experience. 

The nachos was mediocre at best. Service was horrible. Unless you are starving, go somewhere else.
