Right outside the Flamingo hotel/casino, on the LINQ, sits a nice Mexican place. Outdoor seating is great for watching the crowds flow by. Our waiter was very attentive and very informative when asked questions about the menu. Drinks came quickly, with recommendations from our waiter. The food was really good...not great. I really liked the pulled pork gorditas...at least one other in our party wasn't as happy with their meal. "too much sauce...". Overall, a place we would come back to.
