It was a slow Thursday night, and my wife and I and another couple were walking around, checkin out places to eat.  The menu looked good on the street, so we went in.  

We ordered the chips N salsa and guacamole.  The salsa was good, so we asked for another cup of it to finish off the massive pile of chips.  The waiter said "Sure!" but never brought it.

I asked what Margarita the waiter suggested and took him up on it.  He came back a few minutes later and said they were out of the ingredients.  The girls had Skinny Margaritas that came in what looked like "toy" glasses and had hardly any tequila.  Not very "Vegas"...

We ordered the nachos and some sample platter.  The nachos were a pile of chips with canned cheese dumped on it with a pile of beans on that.  It reminded me of a bowling alley.  The sample platter had no flavor.

We had enough at that point.  No offer for more drinks.... no, "How is everything"...  we paid our over-priced $120 bill and left.
