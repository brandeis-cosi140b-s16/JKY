We went yesterday for dinner. The decor is average and the noise level was off the chart. The food was average. We ordered a chicken and shrimp fajitas, the marinate was good and it tasted frech. Service was good. Decor and ambiance 6/10. Food 6/10 and service 8/10 with total 20/30. I give 3 stars and a half.
