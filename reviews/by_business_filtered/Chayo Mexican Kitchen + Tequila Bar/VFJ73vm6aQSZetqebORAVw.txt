Awesome! I had the nachos and they were beyond epic. I posted a picture of me and my friends at the table and the first comment was "awesome nachos." the server, Becka, was all sorts of fun and made our experience the best. She made us laugh and kept the drinks coming at precisely the proper pace. Recommended!
