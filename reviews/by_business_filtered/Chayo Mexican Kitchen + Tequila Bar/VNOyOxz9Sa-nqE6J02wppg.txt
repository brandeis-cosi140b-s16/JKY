After a hot 3 days of  EDC we were craving mexican food, and since Chayo Mexican Kitchen is located right next to the flamingo we decided to try it out.  Let's start by saying that the service was great and fast, but the food was a bit disappointing. 

FOOD: 
Filet Steak Nachos $19 :On the menu it said enough for two, but when it came out " MAN" it's big enough for 4 people. The flavor was great, but the filet steak was pain and wasn't season  or wasn't season enough!  

Beer Battered Lobster Tacos  $19: I was disappointed with this dish. The presentation was nice and everything ,but the star of the dish the lobster was way over cook . It was super dry and chewy. The chipotle mayo they put on was very good tho. 

Sorry Chayo I'm just not a fan yet !
