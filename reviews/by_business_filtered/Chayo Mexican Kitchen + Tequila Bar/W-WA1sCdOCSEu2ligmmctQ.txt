BEST tacos I have ever had. Tuesdays are BOGO taco nights and as I feel the place is pretty pricey for what you get any other night of the week, so this was the perfect night to try it out. I had the vegetarian tacos on corn tortillas (gluten free option) and guacamole. I've never had more flavorful and original tacos. 

The pancho villa from the cocktail menu was just okay, I liked the spiciness, but it wasn't the best cocktail I had ever had. The margaritas were nothing to write home about either, but their selection of tequila is awesome.

There was a 7 year old child in the group, a picky eater, and they had a good kids menu for him too! 

Servers here were pleasant, but not that helpful in trying to decided as the menu has so many options.
