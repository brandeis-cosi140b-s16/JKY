I'm currently sitting at a table here and it's awful. The waitress is terrible. It took us 20 minutes to get chips and water. We ordered a pitcher of margaritas and it was just a pitcher of sweet and sour. The food tasted like it had been sitting under a heat lamp. The guac isn't fresh and can't be made to order cause it's pre-made and shipped here. The fries showed up uncooked in the middle. We told the waitress we didn't like anything and she didn't seem to care. Just don't come here. This place is disgusting.
