This place played great Spanish music also our server was very nice and helpful, seeing as I am the most indecisive person in the world. I was suggested the lobster tacos but I chose to get the fish tacos, which were awesome! Very crunchy and flavorful not super greasy! The beans that come with it are great but the rice was just plain, that was a surprise to me so I poured the beans on top of the rice and it was very satisfying! I would definitely come again! Next trip to Vegas!
