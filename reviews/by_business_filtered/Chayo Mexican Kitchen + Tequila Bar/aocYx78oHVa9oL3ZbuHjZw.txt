We saw this place the last time we were at the Linq & wanted to try it but never got around to it. This time we weren't very hungry but decided to stop in & give it a try. The atmosphere is nice and we were seated right away. Our server was Christina. She was amazing. She has a great personality, and you like her right off the bat. Very knowledgable, personable and friendly. I am a Customer Services Trainer and I am super critical about customer service. She was above the charts awesome! Thank you Christina!!!

We decided to share some tapas... Chicken gorditas, chorizo sopes & chips/guac. EVERYTHING was delicious! When I checked in on FB my cousin insisted we try the lobster tacos. We didn't get a chance to but we will definitely visit again. I really enjoyed the chorizo sopes! Great flavor and perfectly garnished! 

My only disappointment...which is minor...is that they can make a michelada but not with the traditional clamato base. I would have had a few beers if they would've been able to offer a proper michelada. :(
