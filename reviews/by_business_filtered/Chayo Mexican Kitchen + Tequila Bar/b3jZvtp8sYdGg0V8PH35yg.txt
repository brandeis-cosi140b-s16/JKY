Another place on the strip...another place that's over priced and maybe not worth it. 

Came here with a group of friends last weekend. Everything was good, service was good, but good god...they charge a lot for everything. Especially their drinks that have hardly any alcohol. (Ironically, the name has "Tequila Bar" in it.)

The patio downstairs and upstairs is very nice. I can see why people would want that with the Linq to look at. They also have a bull to ride on, and you know some drunk ladies love some bull riding...

I give this place a solid 3 stars. Good food, good service, clean, but for the prices, I think it should be a little better in all areas except the decor. The decor is very nice and they want it to seem upscale. They're just lacking with quality. 

The margaritas were very sweet with little tequila. I ordered one that was supposed to be more tart.
I had the carnitas and they were good, and good if you're not very hungry. Most of their food is smaller portions. I almost always get carnitas when I eat at Mexican restaurants. 
The lobster tacos were okay - they were a bit too salty for me.
One thing I really did enjoy was the guac. That was some good guac. 

Over all, we had 4 margaritas, carnita tacos, lobster tacos and guac - it was $120 with tip. I don't think it's worth this price. But, whatevs. It was good enough and we all had a good time.
