I hate complaining, and I hate that I have to complain about a restaurant in such a cool part of town.  We're locals and visit the LINQ when we're feeling a little fancy.  We went to Chayo when it first opened for my last birthday, and the service was pretty abysmal.  I was drinking that night, and nothing bothered me too much.  However, it took about 40 minutes to get our food on a Tuesday night.  No one offered an explanation, and our table of six agreed that it must have been those bugs that every restaurant needs to iron out at the beginning or the size of the party and didn't hold it against them.

Tonight, however, solidified our original impressions.  My boyfriend and I sat down and quickly ordered our drinks/food.  The server, a tall, blonde woman, was incredibly helpful and we truly appreciated her help.  However, the food runner sat our food down at another table after about 25 minutes of waiting, and didn't bring our refire for an additional 23 minutes.  When he did, the food was cold.

Our server was great and had some of our check comp'd, but the runner was having a really rough night.  At least two tables in our immediate vicinity also had some of their checks covered.

The food is good, but the expiditing and running left something to be desired. Hopefully they can get it together soon!
