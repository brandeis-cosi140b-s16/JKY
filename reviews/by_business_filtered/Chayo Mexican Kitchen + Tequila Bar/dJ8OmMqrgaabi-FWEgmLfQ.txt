I would give less stars if I could. My friends and I were unfortunate enough to have Conrad as our bartender. It was clear to me he chose the wrong industry to work in. Who made this guy a bartender? Aside from not giving a damn enough to try to give proper greeting or even decent service, when told that his attitude sucks his reply was to laugh and say "oh no don't Yelp me"!  Wasn't going to, but what the hell. Business owners should know when their employees make their business look like a joke.
