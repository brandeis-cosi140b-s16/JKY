As the rating stars say when selecting them, "Meh. I've experienced better."

There wasn't anything really bad, I guess, but the food wasn't good. It was mediocre, it did the job. My companions drank and the drinks appeared to be interesting and they enjoyed them but they weren't magic either. The service was so-so. We had two drinks and a couple appetizers to keep the booze-crawl going and headed out.
