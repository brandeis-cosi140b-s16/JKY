"What makes it a 'mexican mule'?" 

That was the question of the night. "russian standard vodka + fever tree ginger beer +
fresh cucumber + fresh lime," the menu reads. 

I ordered "the office" (lemongrass infused patron silver tequila +
st-germain + fresh lemon + cucumber soda) and found it a little too sweet and syrupy.

And that's all we had.
