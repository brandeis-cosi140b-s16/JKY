This place was really cool.  It has a mechanical bull and great decor, with a southwest sugar skull day of the dead type theme.  We had initially gone just to have a few drinks but decided to order dinner while we there as well.

We had actually stumbled upon it trying to see if the Linq was up and running yet, but we are glad we found it.  The food is tapas style and I definitely recommend the Lobster Taco's and the Sope's.  Both were delicious.  Their drinks pretty good too.  The waitresses and female bartenders have a whole lot of cleavage hanging out which is fine unless you have young kids, but really it wouldn't even hit the Richter Scale of things you don't want your kids to see if you have them on the Las Vegas strip anyways.  Call me conservative.  Very pretty girls though.

If you are going up the stairs to use the bathroom, be sure to check out all the sombrero's on the wall in the staircase.  Very cool.  I loved the decor.  I wished there was more people there and that the mechanical bull was going when we were there but I think we caught them seriously a few days after they opened.  

I will definitely be going back and taking friends there while they are in town.
