One of the worst service and food I've had in awhile! 

Came here for dinner before a night out for my cousin's bachelorette party. Our waiter, Kyle, was very friendly...only good thing that came out of that experience.

We came to the nearly empty restaurant around 9 and it took over an hour to get our food!!! You could feel the energy and excitement leave our table as we waited and waited, starving at this point. When we asked our waiter what was happening, he said the guys working the kitchen were running behind with the cooking. Behind?! There wasn't even a lot people there for it to be busy! We waited so long, my cousin (bride to be!) ended up getting sick from feeling starved. It wasn't until a friend made a complaint to our waiter, who relayed the frustration to the kitchen, that we received some chips and guacamole to try and hold us over until we received our meal. More than an hour later our food finally arrived. Too bad some of our party was either past the hunger or too full from eating chips that they couldn't eat their actually meal, and for the rest, too full from eating too fast because we were so hungry!

As for the food, I had the fish tacos and chicken nachos that was shared. The fish tacos was the worst I ever had! It was too dry, too hard, and too overcooked! No flavor at all! The chicken nachos was just okay, there wasn't anything special about them. Food all around was awful, but our party was so hungry that they just ate their dinner anyways. Also, since it was nearly midnight by the time we got our checks, it was too late to try to get food anywhere else before going out for the bachelorette party. 

This was a terrible experience to begin our night out for my cousin's bachelorette, and really out a damper on everyone's mood and night.
