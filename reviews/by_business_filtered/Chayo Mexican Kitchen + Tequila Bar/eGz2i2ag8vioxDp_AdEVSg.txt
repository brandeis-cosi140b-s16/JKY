Our server Christina was great. She's bomb.com
Our $3.50 coffees served in little Styrofoam cups weren't. I'm sorry but coffee mugs should be abundant in a big restaurant like this that serves breakfast. Otherwise the Chayo breakfast which had 2 types of chilaquilles was good and filling. I guess the coffee thing bugged me...meh
