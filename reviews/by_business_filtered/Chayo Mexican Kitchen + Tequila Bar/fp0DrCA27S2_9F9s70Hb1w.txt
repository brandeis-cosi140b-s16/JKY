What a great little place located in the new Linq area of the strip! I'm so glad we gave it a shot! This is not your typical kitschy Mexican joint. It has a cool, modern, and tastefully done Day of the Dead theme going on and is very spacious inside. The service didn't start out so hot, as it took our server a while to come to the table, but it wasn't a huge deal because it gave us plenty of time to look over the menu and she was great after her late arrival. 

I was disappointed that you have to pay for a basket of chips and salsa. However, after our food came out I quickly realized that we didn't even need them. I've never seen such large portions come out of a Mexican kitchen before! This was a plus because it allowed the four of us at our table to try a good portion of everyone's selections. We had a mix of shrimp fajitas, lobster tacos, chicken enchiladas, and pulled chicken tacos. My favorites were the chicken enchiladas, which really reminded me more of soft tacos complete with avocado slices on top, and the lobster tacos that were loaded with lightly battered and fried lobster chunks. The fajitas were the only dish to come with a side, but sides are offered for $5-$8 each.

I'd love to return for my own order of those lobster tacos at some point. Until then...
