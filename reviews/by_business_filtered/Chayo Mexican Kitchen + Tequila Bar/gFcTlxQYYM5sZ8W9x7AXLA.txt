I dug this place. DÃ©cor reminded me of Pink Taco in LA. We ate an early dinner (4ish) so we were not drinking yet and can not comment on cocktails. Wait staff was being trained so we have a couple hiccups, but nothing bad at all. They were fast and friendly. Menu is not your standard Mexican; think more trendy, out of the box. But we all ordered different taco (lobster, fish, pork) and everyone loved their choices. I thought it was excellent; the fish was fresh and NOT fishy, beans were the bomb!  And the salsa as perfect. Its not cheep - 3 fish tacos are $18-19 dollars. This is more of an upscale tequila bar that serves food. But the food is pretty good!!
