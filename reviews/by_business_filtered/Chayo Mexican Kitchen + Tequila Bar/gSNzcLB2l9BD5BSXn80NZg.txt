Wow!!! Initially, I was turned off by the pomegranate seeds in the guacamole and high brow names for their tequila cocktails, but his place has made a believer out of me. Dare I even say - best Mexican restaurant in the city? I think so! The prices seem steep until you receive your meal. My fajita plate could serve two people easily, and in my native state of Texas would have been labeled as such. Best part of this whole experience was the grilled cactus that lay at the bottom of my fajitas. CACTUS! Any place that serves cactus is a winner in my book. Will come back again and again for this quality of service and food.
