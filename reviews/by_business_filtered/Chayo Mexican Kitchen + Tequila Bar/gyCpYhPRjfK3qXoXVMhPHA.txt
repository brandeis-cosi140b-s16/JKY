"Meh. I've experienced better." is definitely the right way to put it. Came here with my cousins for their happy hour - which is actually decent. Decor and atmosphere is nice, but it's their food and prices that isn't going to keep me going here. Way overpriced for what you pay for, especially for their entrees and tapas.
