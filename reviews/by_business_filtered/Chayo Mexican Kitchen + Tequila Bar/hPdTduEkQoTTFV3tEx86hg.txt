This should be a 5 star rating if the service was on top of their game.

Right when we got into the location, both hostesses were really attentive. They say us down in a good manner which was pretty impressive until we got sat.  It took 5 minutes before someone took care of us. I don't what's going on with the server who's supposed to be in that section but we ended having someone else taking care of us. She was the superhero at that moment. After that, everything went smoothly and the food was great but I was disappointed with the chicken fajita. It normally comes with rice and beans but our server told us that it was an additional charge. Anyway, the food is great.
