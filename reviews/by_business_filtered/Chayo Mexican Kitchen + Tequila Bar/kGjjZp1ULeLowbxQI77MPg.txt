Less than impressed with this restaurant.  I have eaten here twice and love the venue, but the food is disappointing.  The carnitas taco meat was very tough and difficult to eat.  The nacho plate had an odd liquid cheese and had huge slices of jalepenos that were inedible.  The only reason I gave this restaurant 2 stars is because of the atmosphere.
