This is my second time here. We had a great high top table half in and half out on the patio.  Beautiful day to enjoy the weather and people watching at the linq.  It was a Sunday and happy hour, however no food options for happy hour only buy on get one free margaritas $4 beer specials and well drink specials.  Our server was Chad C.  He was friendly and attentive but lost a point because I had to ask for water.  Sorry chad, but a responsible server should always server water with alcohol, especially with food.  Salsa with the chips is great and spicy...loved it.  We ordered tacos, one order shrimp, one order grilled fish, two orders ribeye.  Delicious!!!!!!!  However they should be for $18 each.  You get three small tacos making it $6 per taco. It came with a scoop of rice and a cup of beans. I guess I shouldn't complain about high prices since we are on the strip, but just be warned.  Overall price isn't a deal breaker since the food is worth it.  We will definitely go back if we are in the area, but wouldn't make a special trip to the strip for it.   Saved $36 since we did happy hour margaritas! That's a bonus.
