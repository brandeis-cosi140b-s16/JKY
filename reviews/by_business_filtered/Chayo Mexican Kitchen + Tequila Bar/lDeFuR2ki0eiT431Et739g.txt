Expensive & mediocre tacos. The chips & salsa were just okay & cost $3. The fish & carnitas tacos were just so so & for $13 for three tacos & no rice & beans I expected much better. The margaritas are good but again, expensive. I wouldn't have minded so much if the food was good & they comped the chips but it's pretty much just a tourist rip off. It was entertaining to watch people riding the mechanical bull though.
