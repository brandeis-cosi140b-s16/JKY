Fantastic ambiance with meringue music.  My carne asada tacos were awesome.  Can't say the same about my friend's nachos.  Came out with barely anything on it.  Server didn't check on us so friend had to get up and ask for help.  Took a while to get the nachos back with more on them.  Basically had to pack them to go at that point to avoid being late for the Divas show upstairs.  Service was disappointing.
