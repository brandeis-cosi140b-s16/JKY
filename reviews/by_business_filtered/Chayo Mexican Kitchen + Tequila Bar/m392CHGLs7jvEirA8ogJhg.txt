We had a 14 person group seated at a large table that fit us all.  The music playing was too loud to hear the individuals across the large table so the experience was shortened to that of conversation with whomever was seated directly next to you.  The outdoor seating appeared as the better location to be seated.  Service was extremely slow to get our first drink and immediately i was underwhelmed.  Once the food arrived all was saved..it was delicious!  We tried most appetizers on the menu and various style tacos, the tuna, and a few other selections.  The food, the presentation, the timeliness of receiving the food once ordered were all excellent.  There's a bull to ride in the center of the restaurant (if you're in to that sort of thing) and it provided interesting entertainment throughout dinner.

If your at the Linq, i would say, stop in for a nice lunch or dinner, just not if your in a hurry!
