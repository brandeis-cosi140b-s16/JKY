As we walked in the restaurant, tacos were being served every where. Why? Because it was 1/2 off Tacos and 2 for 1 margaritas on Tuesday! Chayo would have gotten 4 stars except that the server didn't recommend or tell us about the specials for Tuesday. After I brought it up he said "Oh, I forgot it was Tuesday. Sorry, I live in Vegas and I never know what day it is?" I thought I'm a local, I know what day it is and funny you knew you had to show up to work today?!" Why don't you be honest and tell us you didn't want us to order the 1/2 off tacos or margarita  because you want a higher check average. Besides the server experience, the food was tasty. We enjoyed the rib eye tacos and lobster tacos.  But before we enjoyed the tasty tacos we enjoyed the yummy shrimp ceviche with pork grinds. It was really good.  I never thought about eating ceviche with pork grinds.  We ended the night with the tres leches. I had better but it was pretty good to fulfill my craving for tres leches. Fun atmosphere for date night or night with friends.  The place would gave gotten 4 stars if the server was honest from the beginning.
