I wish I had read the yelp reviews before going to Chayo!!
This place is bad!!!
Overpriced... don't get me wrong, I will spend $$ for good food!! I don't want to be charged for bad food, and really bad food at that!!
Service is terrible... slow... rude... a little condescending even.
We started with the guacamole with pork rinds... the smallest portion of guacamole I have ever been served.
We also had the lobster tacos as an appetizer..... bad.. dry... no flavor at all!!!!
I was hesitant after that to even order an entr√©e. (yes the waiter hadn't came to take or order for our entree, until we had completely finished our appetizers)
We decided to share the steak fajitas..... big mistake... big... huge... 
Don't do it... go somewhere else
