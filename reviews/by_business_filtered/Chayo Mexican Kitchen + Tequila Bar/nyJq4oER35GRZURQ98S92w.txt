first off, the location is great.  right on the pedestrian mall leading to the Linq.  top it off with outdoor seating, fully stocked bar, and great mexican food.  definitely try the house-made guacamole with chips and the fish tacos.  amazingly good.  tequila does weird things to my brain but chayo's has a nice selection of beer & wine so i can stay happy all night.
