Place is great for Latin night..food is great.  Upstairs bartender on friday night forgot his name, very arrogant fool.  Very bad service..very rare do i not leave a tip, but wow this guy was over the top rude. Talking crap about us to other waiters. This guy is in the wrong buisness,  I'm shure this guy will not have a job for long.
