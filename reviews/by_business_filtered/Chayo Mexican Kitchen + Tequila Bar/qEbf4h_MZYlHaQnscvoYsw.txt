Had the fish tacos and lobster tacos. The food isn't bad, but it's nothing to write home about either. Same with the service. Overall an average 3-star experience. I'm knocking down a star, however, for the shady practice of offering salsa, chips, and guac prior to the meal even though it's not free as described by a previous Yelper as well. I didn't fall for it since I fell for it one other time at another Mexican restaurant and have learned to check the menu once offered since then, but I still find it to be a shady practice. Shame shame.
