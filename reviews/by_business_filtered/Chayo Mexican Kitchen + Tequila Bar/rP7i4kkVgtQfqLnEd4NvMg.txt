My friends and I prefer Latin music & happened to stumble upon this place after an unsuccessful Google search for a Latin nightclub. We were hungry, and were told there'd be a 40 minute wait for a table, but we were encouraged to enter the bar area and dance while we wait.

The DJ and crowd were great! The DJ played a lot of popular Latin music & my friends and I danced the night away. After an hour and a half, we still weren't called to a table, so we checked in with the hostess and were promptly seated.

The food was delicious, but the service was very slow. I will definitely return for the music & will try the restaurant when it's not too busy.
