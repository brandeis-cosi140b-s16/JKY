Love Mexican food..so had to try. 

It's was so good!!!! I loved everything, the food taste, food proportion, restaurant set up!!  a must try when in Vegas!! Plus the linq is a cool place to check out too!! 

Although, we sat in the back and I went with my parents. They play like today's music and I guess there's a speaker right in the back corner and that's where we were sitting and my parents said it was WAYYY too loud for their taste! A total younger vibe!!
