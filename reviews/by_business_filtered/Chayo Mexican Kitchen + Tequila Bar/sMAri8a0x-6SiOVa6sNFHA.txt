All about the service. Was here once before and very average. Came back (meeting spot for a friend) much better service. 1 concern, portion sizes seem to be on the very small side. I'm not 280lb guy, but the 3 tacos are rather small. Like the 3 tacos sizes you would get from Taco Bell. Quality, yeah, head and shoulders better than that, but just about the same size. Good, just small for the money.
