The only reason I've given them 1 star because you can't give a -1. 
Service-Poor! the waiter was no place to be found most of the evening. We ordered 2 appetizers and never received them, we were shocked when the entree's came out and no appetizer. When we finally did get the waiter and explained we never received our food, all he said was "dahhh, do you want me to take it off your bill??? REALLY? Food- Blah...The entree's were dry, no taste and wayyyy over priced. 
This place will be gone within a 6 months, or sooner. 
Out of Towners BEWARE- There are way better mexican places in LV, don't waste your money.
