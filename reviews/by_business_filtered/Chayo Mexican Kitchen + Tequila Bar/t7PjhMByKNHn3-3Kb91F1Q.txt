There was seriously nothing I liked about this restaurant. First, The music was WAY too loud. It should be advertised as more of a club and not a restaurant if that's what they want to promote. We were there on a Saturday night at about 8:30 and we asked to be seated more in the back booths because we couldn't hear each other and they said we had to buy a bottle to sit in a booth. There is no dance floor and this is not a club so I thought it was total bs. 2nd, the food was horrible and totally overpriced. 3rd, we got 2 flights of patron tequila shots and I really doubt they actually gave us patron. I've been a bartender and it tasted more like cheap bottom shelf tequila. And it took like 30 minutes to get our drinks even though it was not crowded at all. 3 plates of tacos and 2 flights of crappy tequila cost $120. Rip off. We will never go back.
