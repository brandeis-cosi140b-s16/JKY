Basic Mexican food.  Disinterested staff.  Sat at the bar for dinner and bartender seemed annoyed we asked for a food menu.  We decided to move to a booth after the bartender disappeared.  Our new waitress was fine.  No menu explanation.  Luckily we saw the Taco Tuesday sign on the way in and asked about it.  

Ended up going with at least one of each taco.  Most of them have mayo based chipotle sauces and are similar to anything you'd get at Del Taco.

I'd go back but wouldn't be excited about it.
