After reading the yelp reviews I was hesitant to eat here but decided what the hell. I thought the food was actually good. We had lobster tacos which I loved and the pork tacos which were good as well. The chicken fajita was good but not great and the Mexican corn was good as well. Overall I thought the food and the atmosphere were worth three stars at least. We got to sit outside and witness the action of the linq on a beautiful night. 

My biggest complaint is the service. Not great by any means. I know being a hostess can be very annoying but you should not portray that you are annoyed to your guests. The welcome was not friendly. Also, the service was very slow and my water never got refilled so I had to steal my bf's.

Good but not great. This restaurant defiantly has a few issues they could work on.
