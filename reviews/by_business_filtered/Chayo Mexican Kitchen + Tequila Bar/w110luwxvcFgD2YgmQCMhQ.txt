Soi loved this place.

So I went to Purple Zebra and got a giant frozen drink that Vegas is known for. However my mom was hungry. After a nice host outside said it was cool to bring in my extra alcohol we were seated. 

I have to say the margarita, for being at a Mexican restaurant, was a major fail. It was just bad. Even though the waiter was really nice about taking it back and replacing it with a different margarita. The second margarita was bad too. So just avoid margaritas.

But everything else was amazing.

You know how you can eat something and taste love? Well the carnitas tacos I had tasted like love. Just ooey gooey flavorful love. And the guacamole with pomegranate seeds.. #idied So. Freaking. Good. I also had rice. Green rice. That kinda looked like throw up. But if you close your eyes and open your mouth you'll be taken on a journey. A journey into epic rice land full of love and yumminess.

Just yeah... Go there.
