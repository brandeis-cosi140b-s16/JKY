Let's start with good. 
They make a good margarita. However, all four of us asked for salted margaritas, not one of them had salt. 
Food, was tasty, nothing special or memorable. 

I've been living in Vegas for about three months now at a hotel while here on a contract, as such I've become very familiar with the food offerings along the strip. 

Now, on to the review. 


The disappointing 
- Took forever to get a server at our table, we had to flag them down after 2 water refills. 
- see salt comment above 
- entrées are laughable small, they arrived and we ordered another appetizer for the table. Tapas sizing, entrée pricing. Definitely not good value. 
- additional appetizer never arrived, it was apparently delivered to the table next to us. Server tried to convince us to order more. Check please! 

I realize we're on the strip, however, most places even at strip prices offer good value for the amount of food. This place, nope, nada, niet, nee, non... 

If this was the last place to eat on the strip, I would probably choose to starve. 

My recommendation, have reservations, serious reservations about eating here and go elsewhere. Gnaw your own arm if it comes to it.
