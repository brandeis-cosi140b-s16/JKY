Went in for tapas at the bar.  Ordered a overpriced draft beer and a quesadilla tapa.  Took forever to come.  When it did, they brought me chicken fajitas instead.  The young female bartender said she thought that's what I told her.  They brought them back and said my quesadilla would be out shortly.  20 mins later, well after my friend finished his tapa, they brought me a tapa.  They delivered three small chicken tacos instead.  I told the bartender again that I ordered the quesadilla.  She replied, "those are quesadillas."  The couple next to us said, I thought you ordered the quesadilla?  I live in San Diego and know what a quesadilla is.  One of the two key ingredients in a quesadilla is cheese, essentially the Mexican version of a grilled cheese sandwich which is nearly impossible to screw up.  Don't let the nice atmosphere of this place draw you in.  If I were able to give no stars I would.
