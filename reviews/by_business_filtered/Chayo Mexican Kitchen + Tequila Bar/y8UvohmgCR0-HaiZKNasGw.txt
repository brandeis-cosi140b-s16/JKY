I don't like giving poor reviews, but the quality of food for what they charge just isn't worth it.  I understand it's Vegas, but......

We were looking for a late breakfast/early lunch on a Saturday before catching our flight home.  Our normal spot, Hash House A Go Go, was absolutely packed and we didn't want to wait so we figure we'd try Chayo.  The ambience was nice and host staff friendly.  

We were seated and ordered drinks.  I ordered a margarita, friend ordered a mojito.  My margarita was good, but her mojito was...well....yellow.  I've never seen a yellow mojito before.  She sent it back and when they brought her another one it looked (and tasted) like an actual mojito! I don't know what that first one was.  

That was about the only positive part - decent (although expensive) drinks.  The food was less than mediocre.  My friend ordered a simple caesar salad with dressing on the side.  They brought her mayonaise.  Yes, mayonaise.  She asked for oil and vinegar instead, she was told they don't have oil and vinegar and brought her some citrus type stuff that again, was pretty much just mayo with lemon juice squeezed into it.  I've worked in enough kitchens and made enough dressings from scratch to know that most of the creamy dressings are mayo based, but it's NOT ALL MAYO!!!!!  Who wants to put mayo on their salads?  The salad itself - ugh.  The greens were very limp, not crisp.  Chicken was dry.  

I ordered the tacos.  Very underwhelming.  They lacked flavor.  Sorry, not a fan.
