A hidden gem that almost provided the perfect combination of service, food, and price.

Time: Late lunch

Ambiance: Tasteful DÃ­a de Muertos theme.

Crowd: Better dressed tourists, and disproportionately appreciative Hispanics.

Menu: Americanized Mexican

Service: Friendly and attentive, but was presented a dirty spoon and a drink was delayed.

Food Ordered: Ceviche shrimp, sopas, diablo shrimp, and a mojito.

Food Quality: The ceviche tasted wonderful and made me forget that there was no fish.  The sopas were delicate, delicious, and lasted mere seconds on my plate.  The diablo shrimp huge in portion and the spiciest thing I have tasted in weeks.  Sadly, the flavor was not quite up to the heat.  Finally, the mojito was refreshing, but a little light on the alcohol.    

Value: Not cheap, but a fair price for a great meal.

If you want a great Mexican restaurant that is unappreciated, look no further.
