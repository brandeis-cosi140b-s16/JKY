Went here on St.Patricks day with my boyfriend. We sat on the top deck patio for margaritas and apps. Our server was amazing, we asked for recommendations and ordered that. What we received was amazing and more than enough food! The whole dining experience was amazing because he provided excellent service. I don't remember his name but he had tanned skin and longish curly hair. He made our visit unforgettable. This is now one of my favorite restaurants and it tell everybody to go try it!
