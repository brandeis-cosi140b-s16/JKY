I'd give this place a 3.5star rating for food. 

Appetizers- The tortilla soup was amazing, but had no chicken or cheese, which all other tortilla soups I've had all contained. So this one just seemed like it was missing something, but it did taste amazing. They don't provide free chips and salsa- they're $3. The chips are seasoned, but neither the chips nor salsa are very flavorful. 

Entrées- I had the beef short rib and my gf had the fish tacos. My dish was okay. The short rib was super tender and the plating looked amazing, but lacked flavor in the meat and in the mashed potatoes. My gf's tacos were good, but had too much sauce that tasted like mayonnaise.

Dessert- I got the tres leche, and again, it was only okay. I'm used to having tres leche very moist and sweet, but this one was dry and not very sweet. Honestly, the food isn't bad, but it's just not something I'll rave about.

Reason to go:
The staff was SUPER friendly and nice. The location is perfect, located in the new Linq project in the center of the Las Vegas strip. They have outside seating, so you can enjoy the fresh air and people watch while you dine. My gf and her friend loved The Señorita margarita (made with moscato d'Asti)
