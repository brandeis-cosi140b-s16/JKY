We went here twice on are holiday and I loved it we had  tacos they were the best I have ever tasted. They have taco Tuesday and it's $3 each but if you get three you get rice and spices beans and it's just delicious. I also has a magerita and they was lovely too i tried a salty and sour and they were both tasty.
The atmosphere was great Really friendly staff they couldnt do enough for you. When I'm next in Vegas I'm definitely returning.
