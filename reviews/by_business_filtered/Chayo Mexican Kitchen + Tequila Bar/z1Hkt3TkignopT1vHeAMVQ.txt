I'm going to give this four stars for value and a good experience.  We stopped by for breakfast and they were able to sit our party of 9 or so quickly.  There was a large computer issue that caused our food to be delayed, but the manager let us know and apologized for the delay and error (much appreciated).  The food was tasty priced very reasonably.
