We came in for dinner before dancing and were not disappointed. The atmosphere is modern cool with a mexican flare. I love the wall of wrestler masks and the mechanical bull is a great crowd drawer. 

The drinks, the food...sooooo good! I had the Senorita and lobster fajitas with yuca fries! Yum!! My drink was so delicious, tasty and not watered down; which is rare on the strip! There was plenty of lobster fir my fajitas, no skimping there and the yuca fries were thick and crispy! I can't wait for it to get warmer and they open up the outdoor patio! 

A great place to eat and feel fancy with a 20% discount for locals. Hurry and visit!!
