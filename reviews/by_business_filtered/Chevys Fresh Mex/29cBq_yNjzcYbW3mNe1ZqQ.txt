My favorite part of Chevy's is the chips and salsa, which is why I am giving this 3 stars.  The Chips and Salsa are very good.  Chips almost always come out hot and fresh, and the salsa has a very good flavor to it.  I love salsa though, and it always bugs me when these places bring you a bowl of chips and a little tiny bowl of salsa which is what happens at Chevy's.  I get about 10 chips in, and already need more salsa.  The food is 'OK' here.  I don't think I have ever had a bad experience, but at the same time I have gotten the same foods several other places that were better.  The simple cheese enchiladas just don't have the same great flavor I wish them to have, the enchilada sauce is a little plain, or they don't put enough on it.  Burritos are pretty huge, but I honestly have not tried one myself.  Others I have eaten with ordered burritos and said they were good, but until I have one, I cannot say for sure.  Prices are a bit spendy here too.  I think most combination plates are about 10% higher than they should be.  They try to make it look like it's worth the cost by bringing your food out on this huge plate, but really most of the plate is filled with decoration and empty space is left all over.  If you like to drink, they have a good selection of beers, wines, margaritas or whatever, but since I do not drink I cannot comment on the quality or price.  This location is in the MALL, so it can be convenient if shopping in the area, but can also cause the place to be louder if that is something that would bother people.  If I have the option, I will save my money and go to El Torito instead.
