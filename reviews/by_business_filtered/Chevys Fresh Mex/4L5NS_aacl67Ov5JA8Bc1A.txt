Talk about a Mexican Fiesta!  This was a great place to quench our thirst after a couple of hours of shopping.  That's exactly what we did yesterday.  

The place is located in the Galleria mall, although there is an entrance/exit and outside seating that could be accessed independently and not by going into the mall first.  

When we entered to get seated, we asked the first desk representative if they had a happy hour and she said only on Tuesdays.  C'MON!  They gotta step up their game.  Who has a happy hour ONLY on one day a week.  That's no bueno, but definitely didn't stop us.  

The place was literally a Mexican cantina.  Bright colors everywhere, wood finishes, sombreros, and other Latin decor.  I felt as if we were taken to the streets of Cabo San Lucas.  Our server was very nice, but was super slow.  Didn't necessarily drink our table right away, but did bring a lot of chips and salsa throughout our visit, which made up for it.  

Today we got a couple of rounds of Coronas, Cadillac Marguaritas and a plate of the Original Fajita Nachos.  They all came to about $37 minus the tip.  The Coronas obviously tasted like Coronas and although I didn't try the Margs, it looked really refreshing.  The Fajita Nachos were bomb!  Each chip came with chicken (you can always choose steak instead) and melted jack cheese.  There was about 20-25 topped chips around a huge platter.  In the middle of the platter there was guacamole, lettuce, tomatoes, sour cream and a few slices of jalapenos. The combination was great.  The chicken was seasoned nicely and I loved how they prepared each chip and made them ready for the other toppings.  Super convenient and very flavorful

Definitely a place you've got to visit at one point.  The food is good and the service is good.  After a day of shopping, come by and check these guys out.
