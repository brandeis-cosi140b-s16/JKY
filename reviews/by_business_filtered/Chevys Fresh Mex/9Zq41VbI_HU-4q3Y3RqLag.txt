Wow. So i know i JUST raved about the best bar service i'd gotten in a while (or ever in vegas), but believe it or not, chevy's just topped it! We went in (my first time by the way) to watch the first half of the basketball game and Marcus was our bartender and he was great! He chatted with us about the game, was friendly, attentive, funny, and rooted for us to win our parlay (which we didn't :( blast!) 

The dos equis was cold, the chips and salsa were bottomless, and the chicken quesadilla was good. But honestly, we'll be back for the service.
