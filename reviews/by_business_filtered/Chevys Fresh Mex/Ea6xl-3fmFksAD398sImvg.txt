This was the only Chevy's in the state of Nevada located in the Galleria Mall in Henderson.  I haven't been to a Chevy's in over 5 years because they haven't been around where I have lived.

We went for Happy Hour in the Cantina.  The appetizers were discounted, but not cheap.  We started with the $3.99 Margaritas.

Then we ordered the Original Fajita Nachos and the Border Wings.  The appetizers came within minutes of each other.

The Original Fajita Nachos were individual tortilla chips with a layer of refried beans topped with chopped steak and cheddar.  There was also a side of guacamole and sour cream.  They were so good that we ordered another one.

We ordered the spicy wing sauce on the side on the Border Wings.  There were 10 crisp wings served with a side of Ranch.

I asked the server if I could use a Military discount for Happy Hour.  He asked the manager and gave us the discount.  

We will be back.
