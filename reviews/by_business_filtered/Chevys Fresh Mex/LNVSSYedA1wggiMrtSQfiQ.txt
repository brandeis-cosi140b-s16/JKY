We came here b/c we had a desire to try something new (to us) and we'd never been to Chevy's, close to the house and we had a $5 off coupon from that book you buy for $30. Only $25 left toward making our cash bk from that awesome little deal! 
I went with the Fresh Mex Artichoke Mushroom enchiladas. and I secretly think to myself wow for someone from West TX who loves meat and would really like a shirt like Jessica Simpson's that says "Real Women eat meat" .. I havent been eating meat all that often lately. hmmm. strange. But I also love anything that has poblano & mushroom and artichoke. hmm. win win win. 
I loved it. i was expecting a crappy kind of enchilada but it was actually kinda good. and knowing I was only paying $4.99 b/c of the coupon made it taste just a lil better! The chips here are very thin which I like the salsa is good but a lil to much chunky onions in the salsa. 
I'd def. order this again and picture is posted online with my check in here from last night. 
My bf ordered the taste of Chevy's and he said that I won last night (aka who got the better tasting meal) Nuff said. 
I did however taste a lil bite of the enchiladas and the tamales (offered but not asked for.. he's so precious...) and the tamale was GOOD. everything else was just ok. 
Bottom line, I really liked this dish till I looked up the calories which werent listed on my calorie count application on my phone (android) damn. this was 1120! damn. Good think I dint eat all of it! 
I would have def. ordered this again. or would order it again and just eat half. Very good.
