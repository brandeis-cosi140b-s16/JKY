They don't skimp on the chips and salsa, they keep it coming. I ordered a combo with a desert. The taco, was good, the enchilada, was ok. I loved the rice and beans! That fried ice cream stuff......They can keep it. 
My husband got a combo as well, but he also got that thing called a tamale! What the heck is the mushy stuff? It was horrible! I think I will just stick to the taco rice and beans next time.
