Horrible horrible horrible and that is the nicest words I can use. Arrived for lunch and we ordered al a carte burritos. First issue, it took over an hour and 20 min to even receive our food. Then second issue, we cut into or burritos and they are ice cold as though they took the beans, cheese, and steak rifht out of a bag and rolled it into the tortilla. After bringing this to the attention of our waiter he just takes the plates and walks away. Then, we are given our bills which charged over 13 dollars for an al a carte burrito. Wth?? So we ask for a Manger as the manager approaches we are scolded by him and basically made out to be cheap skates in front of everyone and are told we are ignorant of we think cheese should always be melted.

Absolutely horrible. Horrible food, horrible manager, and way way over priced do not waste your time.
