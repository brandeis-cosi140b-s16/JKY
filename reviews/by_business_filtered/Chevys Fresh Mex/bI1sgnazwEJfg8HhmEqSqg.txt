Oh Chevys, how I have missed you since your departure from the shores of north lake, Woodbridge in irvine, ca. But here you are again, of all places, galleria mall in Henderson. 

Why is Chevys so awesome? First, the chips. They're fried from really thin pieces of tortilla making them extra crispy and light tasting. Next, they have great, fresh salsa, complimentary with the chips. I love their crispy shell tacos, although I wish they had a shredded beef option instead of their ground beef. You can get a combo plate for less than 15 bucks and it comes with your choice of enchilada, chile relleno, or even another taco (my choice). The plate also has sides of sweet corn cake, beans, and rice. 

They also have a seasonal lemonade, my favorite has been the watermelon. I have tried their flan and fried ice cream, both very delicious as well.

The service is usually good, however I have had one moron tell me I couldn't get a booth because the section was closed - it was full and had a couple servers walking through it. 

It's great for kids, as I can speak from my own childhood in Irvine, and you are definitely depriving them if you don't take them here. They'll even do a birthday song for you and I think some small dessert.

I don't believe I have seen any souvenir Chevy's bucket sombreros that I recall from a while back, wtf?
