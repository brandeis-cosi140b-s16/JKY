ok the highlight of my last visit BESIDES our server Marco... was the most freakingdeliciousawesome pineapple coconut margarita. I can sum it up in one word. 
YUMMY! 
I actually wish I would have had three of those instead of my meal ... but my meal was pretty good also and so I only had ONE.
The Chips were good. 
The fajitas were good. 
But the margarita... phenomenal ... 
I think my next time there will just be a chips and salsa... margarita day...
anyone wanna join me?
