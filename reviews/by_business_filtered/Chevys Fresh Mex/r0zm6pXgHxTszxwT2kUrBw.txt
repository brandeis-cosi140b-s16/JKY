Waited over 15 minutes and nobody even acknowledged we had been seated. We we're put away from others probably because we had a toddler with us. i even went and asked for a booster seat where i seemed to interupt the hostesses doing their makeup, and still got no service from anyone. finally waited long enough left menus there and walked to red Robin where we had great service.
