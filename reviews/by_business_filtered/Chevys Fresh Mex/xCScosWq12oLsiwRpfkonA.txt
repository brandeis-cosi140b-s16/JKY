Updating to add that managememt reached out to me asking for more info, which I sent, claiming they wanted to send me a giftcard to make up for my bad experience. Not something I would have asked for but I thought, what the heck, they are trying, so I'll give them another try...3 1/2 months later...no gift card has arrived. Way to make a bad experience worse Chevys!
