My husband and I sometimes eat here if we're out running errands and craving Mexican food. It's a convenient location for us. 

I really like the crab and shrimp enchiladas, mostly because of the tasty habanero pesto sauce that comes on top. The chips and salsa are really good. The steak fajitas are good because the meat is very flavorful. I'm not a huge fan of the chicken tacos because the chicken is pretty dry and flavorless. 

The last time we had lunch here the service was ridiculously slow. It did seem to be just our waiter because tables with other servers were getting food and attention. I also find that the servers consistently push the alcoholic drinks to the point of being annoying. On one visit I decided in the car on the way that I would get a margarita, but the server was so ridiculous in her margarita pitch that I had to go with water. I didn't want her to think that being obnoxious wins. Since the alcohol pitch has been so intense among several waiters on several different occasions I can only assume that this is part of the training. A tip I learned in one of my professional sales classes in college- people want to buy things, but they don't want to be sold to.
