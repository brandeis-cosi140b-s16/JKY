My roommate from college and best friend is from New Mexico, so since I first met her, she started feeding me New Mexican food (and I am thankful for this because I LOVE New Mexican food!) I've had homemade New Mexican meals, have been to New Mexico and had food there, and have had New Mexican food in different cities. So when I heard about Chile Addiction, I went and tried it. It was so worth it. Me and my friend went all out, because we wanted to try so many different things. First, they serve you complimentary chips and salsa, which is what they do in every true New Mexican restaurant (good start ;) ). We shared as an appetizer the green chile stew, which was spicy and wonderful. We then decided to try the red chile enchiladas with a fried egg on top, and the stuffed sopapilla (this one with green chile). We both shared the two meals, and they were both delicious. We finished it all, and then even had room for dessert!!! We couldn't leave without eating some sopapillas with honey, which are always a must, and were of course delicious. We also decided to try the fried ice cream. It was the first time any of us had had fried ice cream, and it exceeded both of our expectations. Also, we got it for free just for checking in on Yelp! So food was delicious, and our server was super friendly and helpful. Five stars well earned!!!!
