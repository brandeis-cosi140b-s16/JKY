I love spicy food and was told about this place from a friend. 
 We pulled up around 7:30 on a Friday evening and it wasn't busy at all. So I was a bit skeptical. I'm not going to lie I really thought it was going to be a gringo spot. 
Service was great along with the decor. The waiter helped with recommendations and the menu. I was pleased with the portion to value and the side choices (I actually didn't have to get refried beans I don't eat).
I was very surprised the chile verde was actually hot. It was a pleasant hot I could taste my food but it had the prefect kick. My husband had the carne adovado stacks with the red sauce and it was yummy. I could have just ate the carne, red sauce and sopaipillas. Everything had flavor but wasn't salty and nothing was bland. It's not the traditional Mexican meals which is a nice change. I wish they were closer to my house because I visit more often.
