You can get Mexican food anywhere, you can only get authentic New Mexican food from a few places in Las Vegas; Chile Addiction is one. Huevos Rancheros with red chile and carne adovado like you might find at Garcias or Durans in Albuquerque. Nice open atmosphere and great service. They'll be seeing me a lot!
