Great New Mexican food! The green chile stew and the chili con queso were delicious. My husband had the beef burrito and really enjoyed it. The only thing i was not a big fan of was their salsa, but I can over look that because the food was so good. I'll definitely be going back for seconds, thirds, etc.!
