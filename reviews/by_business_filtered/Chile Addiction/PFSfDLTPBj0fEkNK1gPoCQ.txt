Food was great! Started out with fresh guacamole- needed a little salt but once I added from the table it was perfect. I had the chile rellano with green chile and hubby had chicken tamales stacked with green chile- both very good, good portion size. Only downside - service was slow. Not because they were inept but because they were so busy and hadn't expected the huge increase in business.  I am sure they will hire more staff because I don't see them slowing down.
