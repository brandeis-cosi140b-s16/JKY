First, the good. I like the decor and the layout of the restaurant. It seemed clean and well thought out.

Now the "not-so-goods" - The food is WAY over the top spicy. I've had New Mexican food before and I loved it. Using various chilies to enhance the flavor of traditional Mexican dishes is a brilliant thing when done well. In the case of Chile Addiction, I don't think the cook knows the difference between flavor and just plain over-spicing. To add to the insult of food so hot that you can no longer taste the other ingredients, when my wife asked our server how the chicken in her dish was prepared (prior to ordering), his response was "Ummm.... well... it's kind of braised... umm ... you know" which didn't really mean much. Being of Mexican descent, my wife eats super spicy food pretty regularly and she couldn't finish her meal either. :(

Anyway, in our party of five only one of us finished our meal and even she said she could only taste chili-peppers and black ground pepper. Why would anyone want to eat enchiladas or chimichangas where you can't taste meat, cheese, or other ingredients??

Also, the Spanish Rice was soft and mushy and the refried beans were goopy and stiff and as if from a can. Darn it! I really wanted to like this place.
