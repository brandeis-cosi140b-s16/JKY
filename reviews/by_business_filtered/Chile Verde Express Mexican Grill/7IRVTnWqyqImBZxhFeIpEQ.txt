The food here is excellent, delicious, yummy, and all the other things you might say about a ...wait for it... restaurant/take out/taqueria located in a fuel depot. In its defense however this is no regular fuel depot. This place has gambling (duh), a post office, and a car wash, oil change, smog, and in the Summer (sometimes) shaved ice.

Everything my family and I have eaten here has been delicious, they LOVE the carne asada fries! I LOVE the "little-donkeys" and the "cheese sandwiches" so to speak.

We used to go here much more often, however ordering for a large family takes the one man show quite a while to make (and time IS of the essence these days right?) as well as the biggest blow of all to me... he only accepts CA$H now... no more debit, no more credit. I don't know about you, but even in this gambling town I pretty much don't carry any cash (FYI would be pickpockets/thieves).

So, if you are flush with cash, have lots of time, and want really good food to go, this is a great place to get it from.

PS- the salsa, when he says hot is hot... he means it. My tabasco drinking days are behind me, however I can rest assured telling you, their red salsa is so hot, it is almost unpleasant to eat it on your food.

Take care, don't wait up for me okay?
