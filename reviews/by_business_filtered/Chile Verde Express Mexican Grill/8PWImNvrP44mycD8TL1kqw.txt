It's inside of the gas station store. I walked around looking for this place outside and was confused for a moment there. 

Carne asada tacos- 3 star. Not the best ever, but good in Las Vegas. It definitely beats the other famous spot that has a 1 hour line called Tacos El Gordo. I'm giving up on Vegas in regards to mexican food--it just can't beat california no matter what. 

I wasn't too fond of the salsa verde or the red salsa. Chips were okay. I will report back after trying their burritos one day. 

The owner/cook is a machine--I've never seen someone so quick and efficient. I thoroughly enjoyed watching the man in action while eating.
