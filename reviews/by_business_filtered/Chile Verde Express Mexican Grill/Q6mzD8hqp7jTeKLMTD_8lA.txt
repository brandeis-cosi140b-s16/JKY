Tried this place based on a friends recommendation and yelp reviews. This is a place that holds true to its reviews. It is located inside a gas station. The portions are huge and the food is delicious. We ordered carne asada nachos and chicken tortas. Both were amazing! I would definitely come here again! Move over Robertos. My new favorite mexican joint. Oh and the tortilla chips are the freshest I've ever had! They are cooked to order!! I don't know how many restaurants can say that.
