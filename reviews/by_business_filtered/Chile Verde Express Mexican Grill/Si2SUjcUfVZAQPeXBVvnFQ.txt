My fianc√© and I always go out of our way to grab lunch here whenever we are in Vegas. We've sampled quite a number of things from the menu and you really can't go wrong with anything on there. 

If you're not in a rush, it's worth the wait. As other reviewers have mentioned, the place is run by a single person hence the reason why the wait can be long and the hours seem limited. Despite thesd points, we feel it's completely worth the hassle. His kitchen is kept very clean and he washes his hands and wears new gloves in between handling cash and cooking up delicious Mexican food. We will continue to support his business whenever we're in Vegas!
