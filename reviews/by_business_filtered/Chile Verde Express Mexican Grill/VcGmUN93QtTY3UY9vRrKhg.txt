Chile Verde has ruined me!  I can't be happy with Cafe Rio, Qdoba, etc.  This guy is amazing, he makes all his chips and shells from scratch!  I am not a person that has ever gone to a gas station to eat and now I am here at least once a week!  Everything is awesome, Chicken taquitos, chimichunga, taco salads, tacos, nachos.  I honestly think there is not a thing that isn't great on the menu!  Every time I go I try something new and am never disappointed.  When he is cooking the meat you can also have him fry up some peppers and onions, yummy!  I LOVE spicy and hot salsa and his red sauce is no joke!  It is clean and there is space to eat there.  He is working hard and sometimes there is quite a wait but oh so worth it!
