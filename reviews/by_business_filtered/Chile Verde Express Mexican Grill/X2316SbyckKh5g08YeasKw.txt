This is a cool concept - Mexican express in a gas station. I'm addicted to their Chile Verde. Carnitas Burito is mucho delicioso!!! The poor guy is often alone - cooking, taking orders, cash register, packing to-go food..  but its definitely worth waiting! Towards the bathroom there's a funky seating with few tables, chairs, couch..even massage chairs and foot massagers while you wait for your food. Don't know what to say about this seating/waiting/dining area combo .......cute?  maybe convenient :)  Definitely my Mexican express!
