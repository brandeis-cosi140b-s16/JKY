People kept telling me about this place and I NEVER THOUGHT would say BOMB TACOS AND NACHOS FOR SURE...in a gas station?! But YES - THEY ARE AMAZING! 

Went there for the oil change free car wash deal and decided to get the carne asada nachos while I waited..I am now super addicted. I never buy food in a gas station either but I kept hearing this was where to go (pictures on yelp sold me). Little bit of a wait since it was just one guy on the grill but wow was it worth it.

Chips so good & the carne had great flavor. Just had to write a review and noticed others saying it was better than Robertos - which i agree. I must not be alone...when I turned around with my food,I realized three people were ordering take out for their families...it says a lot when a person stops at a gas station and orders to go in my opinion it confirms it is good.
