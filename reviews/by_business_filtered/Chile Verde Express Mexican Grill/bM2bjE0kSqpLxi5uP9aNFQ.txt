The first and obvious question about this place is: Why will I buy a Mexican food inside a gas station?

Why not?

Try the Chili Verde plate, especially the Chile Verde (making the 2014 Desert Companion list of Delicious Meal under $10), Carne Asada Fries and the Rolled Taco with Guacamole, and you will be a fan of this one-man-chef's cooking. 91.37% guaranteed.

Disclaimer: prepare to wait longer because of the solo service mentioned above.

If you're comfortable eating on the counter or on a bench outside while watching the car detailing, treat yourself casually with the experience. Did I not tell you this fast food is INSIDE the gas station? Or if you're like me, bring it at Exploration Peak Park. Enjoy!
