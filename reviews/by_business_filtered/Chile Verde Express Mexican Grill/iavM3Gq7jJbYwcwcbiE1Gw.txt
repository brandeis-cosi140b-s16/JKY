Ok i had to try this place from the reviews it was a no brainer. I had the carne asada burrito. Food was solid but it wasnt the best i have ever had. It was good.I just moved here from los angeles and have been eating mexican food my whole life so all i can say is that in this town that there seems to be a shortage of quality food places and thats why people get blown away whenever something decent comes along. dont get me wrong this place was solid..fresh tortillas,lots of meat good quality meat too. The only thing i would say is that there is only 1 man working there i presume he is the owner,but I mean come on YOU NEED HELP...you cant do it all yourself it's not efficient for you or the customers. Im assuming he does this either because he is looking for help or he doesent want to pay for help.In any event he could definitely increase his sales with some assistance.Otherwise a solid choice for mexican food.
