I agree with the last review. Best Authentic Mexican food in town. I have eaten at a ton of Mexican Food places in town and you wouldn't expect such a great place to be in a gas station, but it is delicious!. Food taste fresh and not greasy. The staff is always SUPER nice and accommodating. A lot of Mexican food places in town tend to feel really dirty inside and Chile Verde is not at all like that. It is always really clean. The prices are right in line with what you would pay at a don tortaco or faustos, but I can tell you right now the food is WAY better.
