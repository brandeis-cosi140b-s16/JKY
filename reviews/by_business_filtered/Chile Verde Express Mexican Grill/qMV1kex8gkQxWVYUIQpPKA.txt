Food is really good but the service is very slow. Owned by husband and wife but they should def hire another cook or employee. I had the enchiladas and chix hard tacos. Cant go wrong with those dishes. They have a large flatscreen tv which was cool cuz i was watching a playoff game and eating at the same time. Oh and its inside a gas station so u can easily get beer n other treats.
