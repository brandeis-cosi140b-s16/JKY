The food is good here but the service is horrible! I was here three times and got horrible service. I was there first and the guy asked the guy behind me for the order. I was there first and I am a girl!!!!?!!! Lady first?!!!!!last time I was here I was told I need to wait for 45 mins for my order. The lady was rude too. I love the food but I really don't appreciate the service.
