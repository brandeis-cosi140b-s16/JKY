Good mexican food, real fresh. I had the chicken chimichanga plate and my husband had the green chile verde plate.  The prices are pretty reasonalble too, our food came up to $14.00 something. There was only one guy cooking in there on a Saturday and it seemed really busy but we got our food in a reasonable time. I recommend it and will be back.
