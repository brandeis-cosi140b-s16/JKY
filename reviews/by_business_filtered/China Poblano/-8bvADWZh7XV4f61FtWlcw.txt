Love this place. The entire theme/concept is awesome. I mean, Chinese meets mexican... c'mon:) Probably my favorite restaurant ever. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is its pricey to say the least. But... some of the most delicious food I've ever tasted. Try the guacamole... out of this world!
