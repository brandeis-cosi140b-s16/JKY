Great place.  There for lunch.  Energetic atmosphere, fantastic service, and wonderful food.  I will go back, but recommend stick with either Chinese or Mexican, not sure about both in one sitting.  Full flavors and good cocktails.  Chinese was the standout, but their guacamole was one of the best I've had.
