A-OK.  We came here for a late night meal and enjoyed sitting "outside..."  This is actually a space outside the actual restaurant and overlooking the sports book and Cosmo club.  Thus....great people watching.  Our service was mediocre at best.  The guac was OK, and the asian buns (When Pigs Fly) were good but too pricey.
