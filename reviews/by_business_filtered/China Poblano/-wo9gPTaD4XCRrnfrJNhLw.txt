We were scoping out the spiffy new Cosmopolitan Hotel when we passed by this very interesting looking restaurant. There were two "to-go counters" on either side of the entrance--one said "OPEN: Chinese Food," the other "OPEN: Mexican Food." Intrigued, we decided to see if we could get in for dinner on the spot and got lucky scoring the table of a no-show reserved party. Vegas can be a gamble, but sometimes you do win!

As its name (and exterior!) would suggest, China (pronounced chee-na) Poblano is an experiment in mixing Asian and Latin cuisine. From dim sum to tacos to noodles with huitlacoche (corn smut, apparently), this is where Chinatown meets the Mission. Yes, I'm sort of from San Francisco.

I give this place 5 stars for the decor (and service, which was also very good). The outside that's set up to look like a city street with cheap Mexican and Chinese eateries side by side is a front for a very swanky restaurant on the inside. Bicycle wheels hanging from the ceiling, random Asian and Native American-looking knickknacks stacked upon the walls in artsy fartsy fashion, splashes of colorful paint... I was in interior design heaven. Great job on that.

On the other hand, for the food and its value, I can only give three stars. It was delicious, but ridiculously overpriced. $12.88 for four pieces of har gao? Teeny tiny pieces too, like a third the size of the shrimp dumplings you can get at any authentic Chinese restaurant. $15.88 for won ton noodle soup?? $15 for guacamole?!?! I get it that this is a trendy fusion restaurant and that the chef is famous, but come on now. Ethnic street food in a fancy hotel in Las Vegas is still ethnic street food, which means it should be cheap. Essentially, you are paying to dine in this very nicely and expensively decorated business venture.

All things considered, it was a satisfying meal and I'm glad I got to try this place. Our party of six ordered about half the menu and doubled up on some dishes as well. Clearly I was not buying dinner that evening... I'll save whatever money I bring back from Vegas for my neighborhood taqueria, thank you.
