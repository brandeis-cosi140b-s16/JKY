I'm glad I tried this place despite the 3 star average rating from the Yelpers!   This place is great if you are in the mood to step out-side the box. 

We came with a group of people (which I think is the key to really maximizing your enjoyment to this place) because you can order a larger variety of items and share in the experience.  

- When Pigs Fly  - Good
- Har Gau (shimp/pork belly) - Good
- Pozole Rojo - I can make a better version
- Carnitas - OMG A must try!
- Polla a la Parilla - Good
- Guacamole - it was on the spicy side - I liked it my table-mates didn't
- Tuna Ceviche - pretty tasty
- Tres Lychees (dessert) was SO good!!!!

I'm glad I tried this place.
