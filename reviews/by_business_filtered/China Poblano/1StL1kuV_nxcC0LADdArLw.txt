We came here for lunch and loved it. Yelp had three stars but our experience was five. We had the guacamole (awesome!) carnitas and mole tacos. They also have a duck toungue taco called silencio. I laughed. I had a flight of tequila and enjoyed the sangrita, but the signature margarita with it's salt air was far better. Had a little kick, but it was awesome. At lunch on a Tuesday the service was quick and our server, Rich, was awesome.
