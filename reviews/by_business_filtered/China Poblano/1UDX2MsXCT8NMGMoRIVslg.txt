Had a late lunch here on my last trip to Vegas.  Started with chips and salsa, the salsa had a nice smoky flavor and just a hint of spiciness  Tried a couple of the tacos and the Lucky 6 dim sum.  Great flavors all the way around but the dim sum stood out more than the tacos did.

Service was pretty decent and the menu has lots of things I'd like to try.  I will definitely put China Poblano towards the top of my list to try again the next time I'm in Vegas.
