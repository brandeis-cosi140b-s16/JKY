I have been here a couple times with work colleagues and have always had good meals.  I was there recently again and we shared a variety of dishes.  They had a special noodle dish the night we were there.  It was one long continuous noodle with pork belly and veggies.  It was very tasty.  We also had tuna tartar, Mongolian beef, chicken lettuce wraps, queso fundido, some tacos.  Probably a few other things.  Everything was very tasty - nothing too spicy but definitely flavorful.  The guys had the salt air margaritas and loved those.  This is definitely a great place to go to share food and try lots of yummy things.  I definitely will be back.
