Food lacks flavor. Portions are crazy small for the price. We got the tasting menu and they couldnt even get the time of are food out right. I'm leaving hungry and unsatisfied. Also  everything taste like it came out of a can. Service was horrible, they wiped the table while we where sitting there. They didn't refill are water. Everything was gross I had to spit some of there food.
