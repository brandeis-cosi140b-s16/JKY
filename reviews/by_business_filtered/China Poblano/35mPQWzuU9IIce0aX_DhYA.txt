This is my 2nd time coming to this restaurant and we really enjoyed it. We ordered the Chef's Experience tasting menu for a party of 5. They allowed one person in our party to order individually due to dietary restrictions. The tasting menu is $55 and well worth it. A well paced meal starting with the gold fleck dumplings. The 2nd course was a guacamole stuffed jicama cup. The hearts of Palm salad was spicy and tasty. I honestly can't remember everything but we had duck in steamed bun taco wrapper, noodles, veggie rice, carnitas tacos,shrimp, pork stuffed wontons with sesame paste, buns with a codensed milk dipping sauce, and we ended with churros and a mango rice pudding. Excellent value and delicious. I highly suggest the salt air margarita. It was my favorite off the margarita flight. Service was average and a noisy stimulating environment. I would suggest this place to anyone with a mildly adventurous food palette .
