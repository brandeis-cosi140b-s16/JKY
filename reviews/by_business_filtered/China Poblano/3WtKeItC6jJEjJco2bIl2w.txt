If I was rating on taste alone, the food is flavorful and is well balanced and has good contrast in textures and deserves the four stars. I enjoyed the pork belly taco as well as the carnitas taco. The noodle dishes are flavorful as well. The handmade noodles have just the right chew. I do have to warn you that if you are hungry, this is probably not the right place for you unless you are prepared to spend a little extra casino winnings. If you are hungry , the torta is the way to go, but it doesn't quite have the same complexities of flavor as the other dishes. If I were to rate based on value, probably closer to 2.5 stars.
