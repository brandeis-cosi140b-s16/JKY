We had a 7:30 reservation on the Saturday of Easter weekend.  We were celebrating our mothers 79th birthday and the staff was wonderful in wishing her a happy birthday.

Lychee sour - 3 stars - drink was super small and just ok.
Carnitas taco - 3.5 - I did not have these however 2 people thought they were great and one thought they were solid but nothing special. So I am averaging:-)
Tuna ceviche - 4 stars - this was really good. The flavor was layered.  The amaranth seeds and pecans added a nice crunch.  I am not normally a fan of pecans but I enjoyed them in this dish.  
Guacamole - 2.5 stars - ok.  Basically avacodo and lime.  Could use some spice!  We added habanero sauce.
Ensalada Cesar - 3 stars - ok. Normal basic salad.  Dressing was well coated but had a light flavor.  
Chicken Ji Song - 3 stars - solid lettuce cups.
Shrimp Mojo - 3.5 stars - good.  Unique burnt garlic flavor

Ambience - 3 stars - cool decor but didn't feel as fine dining as the prices suggest. 

Service - 4 stars - outstanding!  Friendly and attentive.  We were brought two desserts on the house for our moms bday! Very impressive!

Noise - 3 stars - music was really loud and table next to us was one foot away and with loud talkers sometimes it was hard to focus on our conversation. 

Our bill was $160 plus tip for a party of four. Note - we only ordered 3 drinks so most of the bill was for food! 

3 stars overall but would bump to 3.5 stars due to the amazing service!  If you have already eaten that a lot of places in Vegas and are just looking for someplace new then I would consider going here.   However, if you have not eaten a lot of places in Vegas there are a lot more other restaurants higher up on my list for around the same price that I would try first.
