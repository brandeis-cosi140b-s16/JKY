Definitely get the addictive lotus chips and playful, flavorful Silencio (ha!) duck tongue taco. The Viva China taco with oyster and beef tendon wasn't bursting with flavor, and the Golden Pigs steamed buns were dry and would have benefitted from more filling. And if you're feeling lucky, cross your fingers that a sampler of dumplings accidentally gets dropped at your table by a server who immediately disappears, because it's going to be your favorite dish of the night.

The changing wall art of iconic/iconoclast figures gives the small space a lot of personality, and I just loved the warm colors and rustic feel. It's Vegas, so it's a little bit put-on, but isn't everything?
