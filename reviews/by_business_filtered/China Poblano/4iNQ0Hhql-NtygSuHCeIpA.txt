Came back for another try and had an awesome meal.  Service is still excellent. The waiter was very knowledgeable of the menu and gave suggestions on pairing foods. I felt as though the chef was waiting on us.  The twenty vegetable fried rice is delicious. I suggest adding a protein. The shrimp mojo is a must.  Try one of their many cocktails as well!
