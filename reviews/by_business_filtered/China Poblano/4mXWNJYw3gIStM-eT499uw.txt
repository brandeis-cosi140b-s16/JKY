I have to say, the staff were all very pleasant and helpful. 
Helpful was good Because the menu confused us.
Is it tapas, is it an Asian Mexican fusion...
No. You can order Mexican food or Chinese food.
I was hoping for fusion. Seemed interesting and curious when i thought that.
Ended up a bit disappointed.  And overwhelmed.
I had something with the number 18 in it. Smelled awesome. Tasted pretty decent. We shared the When Pigs Fly and it was ok. 
I wouldn't tell anyone that they HAVE to go there. 
I feel badly bashing it, It just wasn't that great. 
I feel like the prices were high for what it was, although it Is The Strip and that's what happens.
Again, friendly staff. Also a real cool atmosphere and clean bathrooms
