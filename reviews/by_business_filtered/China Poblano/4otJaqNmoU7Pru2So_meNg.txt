As a Vegas regular visitor I'd have to say this was easily in the top 3 most memorable and delicious lunches I've had on The Strip at any price point. We got the 18 Monk Noodle, Beef Sui Mai, Tinga Poblana taco, Pescado a la Plancha taco and Mango Sticky Rice and it was a nice sized meal for two. 

The Mango Sticky Rice was the standout - crispy rice puffs sprinkled over light fluffy cream, with ripe, cold mango chunks at the bottom

There was a 15 minute wait for a table for 2 on a holiday weekend Saturday afternoon so very accessible.
