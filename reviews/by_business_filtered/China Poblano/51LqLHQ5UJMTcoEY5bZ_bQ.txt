First off, the service was superb!  Our waitress and busboys were moving like lightning with a packed restaurant.  We ordered the Day of the Dead tasting menu for a party of seven and had:

-When Pigs Fly
-Siu Mai
-Taquitos
-Guacamole in small pasta cups
-Lamb pot stickers
-Fried wonton
-Dan Dan Mian
-Tuna ceviche
-Chicken Ji Song
-Col de asparagus
-Shrimp Mojo
-Dessert with coffee ice cream, bananas and chocolate

It wasn't cheap at $65/person, but dang there was a lot of food.  The food was good, not great, sometimes a little bland.  That, and the fact that a tiny margarita costs $13, lost them the fifth star.  Once again, great service!
