I have been wanting to come here for two years... seriously, that long!  Every time I head out to Las Vegas I try and make a point to dine but it just never worked out... that is until this week, when my boyfriend and I made it to lunch.  Finally!

Started off with cocktails (blood orange margarita), and I was impressed.  It was really well-balanced and not too sweet.  We had the guacamole, which was very good.  We ordered it "medium" but I think it could have used a little more kick.  The chips were fresh and completely addictive, and the salsa was really delicious- excellent smoky flavor.  We each ordered a taco (carnitas and pescado frito).  Serving size is small but we were going for a "light lunch" so it worked out.  My boyfriend liked the carnitas taco so much he ordered another.  It was really a decent amount of food when you consider the large, molcajete-like bowl of guacamole too.

All in all, it was pretty good!  It's hard to "wow" in Las Vegas because there are so many great restaurant choices.  The ambiance and decor are really neat and lend to the overall feel of the place.  We had great service and enjoyed the food a lot, but I definitely think it's more of a lunch spot.
