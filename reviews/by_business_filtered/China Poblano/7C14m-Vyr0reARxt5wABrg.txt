My group settled on eating here since it was in our hotel, and we were starving.  The food was OK, but the dishes we ordered weren't meant for sharing -- even though the server said they were.

We found ourselves having just a taste of each dish and still hungry about $30/person later.

The place is amazingly decorated, we had plenty of space at our table, we were sat right away, and the service was great ... but the food just wasn't worth it.

"At least we gave it a shot", was the overall feeling ... *shrugs*.
