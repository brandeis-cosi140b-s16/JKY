pretty much horrid.

this is NOT fusion food.  it's basically chinese food juxtaposed with mexican food.

the waiter asked us if we wanted chips and salsa and we said yes, like we would at any other mexican restaurant.  little did we know we'd be paying $4.

poor ger-ger wanted guacamole not having seeing the menu and didn't realize it cost $15!  

extra chips?  another $2

shu mai that taste like it came from costco, six little pieces, $14.

what a rip off.

never again.
