Do not waste your time or money.  On a recent trip to Vegas, my friends and I thought we would give China Poblano a try. We all thought the portions were very small and over priced. My taco order was served with my friend's order and I was not even offered a plate to place my order on. I can honestly say, it was the first time I have left an establishment feeling hungry. There are so may great places in Vegas to enjoy a meal. This is not one though.
