My friend and I came here for an early dinner after spending all day at the pool. The concept of Mexican and Chinese fusion was enticing, but unfortunately it was poorly executed. The spring rolls and potstickers tasted like something you could get at a fast food Chinese food. The queso dip was slightly better but still pretty average. Overall, I was not impressed, and will not be back.
