I live local to the DC area, so I've had a lot of Jose Andres' cooking in his various Washington restaurants-- some of my favorite places and food, although at all of them, meal+drinks at non-happy-hour prices will put a dent in your wallet.  I was curious to see how his Vegas efforts were doing, so checked this one out on a recent Vegas trip.

Even in a town full of esoteric and unusual design, it has an eye catching design and great decor.  The number of tables inside is limited, but there are 2 large bars, and various randomish seating outside.  It's pretty unique looking, bright colors.  There's a carryout window.

Service was over-attentive.  The female server thought the habanero salsa was far too hot to possibly have by itself (we found it hot but enjoyed it by itself)...

That salsa and chips were both very good.  A chinese-mexican fusion taco wasn't worth repeating.  A barbacoa taco was some of the best barbacoa I've had!  Drinks pricey but strong.  The GF had one with ground-mezcal-worm on the rim, I had one less exciting-- both great.

The prices are highish-- this is a fancy restaurant, it's Jose Andres, and it's on prime real estate.  A full dinner will set you back if you have much appetite at all.  Two tacos, a small steak entree, two drinks, and chips/salsa were about $75 after tip.

This is Vegas, and there is people-watching-- there's a fair amount of foot traffic from people staying at the Cosmopolitan.

If you're looking for American-Chinese food (you know, the crap they serve in altogether far too many suburban joints) or for Tex-Mex, this isn't the place.

For some top-shelf drinks and innovative cooking, you've come to the right place.  Just expect dinner to be expensive!
