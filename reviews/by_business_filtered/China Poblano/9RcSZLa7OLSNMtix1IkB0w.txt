Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich red braised pork $8.88. A little salty and greasy but tasty. It has an interesting 'English muffin' type bread and a juicy pulled pork filling. Be aware these portion sizes are itty bitty. I also ordered the 'fresh' squeezed papaya and mango juice. It tasted watered down and not sweet at all.
