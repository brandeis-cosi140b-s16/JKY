This place is just ok.  I came here because a friend recommended it.  The food is super expensive for Dim Sum and Mexican food!  Seriously, who pays $16 for Dim Sum items (each)?  The lobster taco which was super small, but tasty cost $10/each.  Veggie fried Rice is $20.  Korean BBQ is $30.  I don't mind spending $$$$ for food, but not for dim sum or mexican.  I do not plan to visit this place when I go back.  There are way better places in Las Vegas.
