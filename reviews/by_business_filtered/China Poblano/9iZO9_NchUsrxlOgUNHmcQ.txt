DO NOT waste your money and time!!  This is the most disgusting place in Las Vegas we have ever been to!!  Expensive and VERY small portions...overly salty..everything is drowned with soy sauce...you see I am Chinese and I know what REAL dim sum and chinese cusine should taste like and its certainly NOT THIS!!!  We spent $50 on 3 dishes plus one taco and we left still hungry..this place should NOT be in business!!!  GROSS!!!
