Dang. The Vegas crowd is harsh - or at least very conservative with their stars.  Came here over the weekend with a bachelorette party and I think everyone thoroughly enjoyed their food and drinks.

Between me and two other girls, we split: papas fritas (fries with rich mole sauce), open sesame (chilled noodle salad), Beijing glass (cellophane noodles in soup), tuna cevhiche (veeeerrrrry interesting crunch), and dan dan mien (noodles with a spicy kick).

I had a Mexican Mimosa and other people in the group had the lychee sour cocktail and blood orange margarita.

Seriously no complaints about the food except that the portions are tiny.  However, considering how many dishes we ordered for three girls (we eventually cancelled our order for 20 vegetable fried rice), I think we did just fine.  Sure, it was a little pricey, but you're in Vegas and you're at the Cosmopolitan.  The Strip is littered with Panda Expresses if you want something cheap.

Now that I've returned from Vegas, and my coworker (who recommended China Poblano to me) and I are discussing the different dishes that we've eaten here, I'm itching to go back.
