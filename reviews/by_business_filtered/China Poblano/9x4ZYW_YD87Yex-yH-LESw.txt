I must preface this review by saying that it's given with knowledge that it's on-strip(pricey) and gourmet(small portions).  I just love the fact that I could get such a variety of food of my two favorite types, Mexican and Chinese. 

I love tacos and noodles so I for the second visit I stayed with the same noodles with a variety of seafood that I felt was just perfect for sharing.  The noodles were just right along with seafood that was far more than I expected in a shared dish.  As for the tacos I've tried the lengua, pescado frito, and carnitas.  While they were all delicious and I really love how the serving dish keeps them upright for great presentation the carnitas prompted myself and my friend to order a couple more, the sauce and the pork rind just adds the right flavor.  

If you can expense a meal or up for a pricey tasting of a delicious variety with friends this is the place to eat.
