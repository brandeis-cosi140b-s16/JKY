So when the server tells you "We're not a fusion restaurant. When you order your meals they come from separate kitchens" call me interested.  

The food here is great. Maybe I was starving, but it was very tasty. I do regret not getting the queso dip (I think), dang table next to me was rubbing it in my face. 

The dan dan noodles were good, nothing to write home about. The chiqules (I butchered another dish name) was amazingly tasty. Um the Pappas were delectable. The 20 vegetable fried rice was also super yummy. And for dessert, the tapioca pudding ball thing was great. 

Me: really 20 vegetables? 

Server: "I promise you that our fried rice has 20 different local and seasonal vegetables."

Here's the negative: price and size. 

Me: Will this fill us up?

Server: "I always suggest each person order at least 4 items, think tapas."

That wouldn't be a big deal if everything wasn't $9 or more. 

So in all, it is pricey (hey, its the strip) but totally worth trying if you don't mind "taking a mark" against yourself. That's casino talk, right?
