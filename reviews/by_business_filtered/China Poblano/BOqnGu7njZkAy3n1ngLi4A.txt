We live in Vegas and have enjoyed dozens of restaurants from fine to walk ups. Rarely do we not get a good meal. We tried this one on a Sunday afternoon and should have turned around as soon as the snotty hostess  seated us next to the silverware station when very few of the tables were occupied. We asked a few questions about the menu and were told, "You have to order bunches of them." Tacos were $10.50 to 5.85. After seeing the tiny taco at the next table I ordered the shrimp and ham with cellophane noodles. My wife ordered salt and pepper tofu. What I got was a small bowl of tasteless soup with two shrimp, that I had to de head, and some tofu. My wife got four small pieces of tofu on a plate. Without drinks we spent $40 dollars and were hungry and angry we'ed been had.
