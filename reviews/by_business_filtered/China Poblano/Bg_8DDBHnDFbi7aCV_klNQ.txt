Everyone's reviews are spot on. This place was only OK for me. The tacos are small. Chicken Mole Taco was gross - swimming in sauce. Fish taco smelled fishy to me - not a good sign. My friend also got extremely ill after eating here.  The chips are good, but $15 for guacamole? I can make better guac than this place. Margaritas are also about$14 a pop and are small. Like most of the cosmopolitan... this place is overpriced. I'd rather make a run for the border.
