This place is nasty. Plain nasty. The bill came out to 500.00 for god knows what. We where three couples and it wasnt my choice to go there, but never again.When we left I had to order room service because i didnt eat at all. Food is nasty and stupid combo far as Chines/mexican food. Who ever thought of this business Was on drugs when they came out with a stupid idea. NASTYYYYY.
