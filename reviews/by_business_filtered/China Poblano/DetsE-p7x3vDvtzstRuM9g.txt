Have you ever had to eat trash and have to pay for it ? Well this is the spot if you know Mexican food or Born Mexican you will know the food here is horrible by just looking at the prices. The food is pathetic the prices are insane 15 dollars for chips and guacamole come on man . Who spends 5 dollars on a "gourmet" taco it should be gourtrash it's nothing special please do not step in here I should've went to the Golden Arches and had a gourmet Big Mac
