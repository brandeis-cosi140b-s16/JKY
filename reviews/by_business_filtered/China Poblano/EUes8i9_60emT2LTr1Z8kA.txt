What a delightful surprise!  I merely wanted a quick lunch after checking into the hotel, and someone said there was a "Chinese Mexican" place.  It tweaked my curiosity, so I tried it. The food was really interesting.  It's the best of Chinese and Mexican, but all prepared in a unique and stylish manner.  Expensive, with entree prices for small portions, but well worth it.
