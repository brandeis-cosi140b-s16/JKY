Not crazy about the seating arrangements.  It is the unfortunate long wall bench seat with several small tables in front and small ottoman types seats on the opposite side of the table.  The decor is nice to look at the wall is covered kabuki masks and Oaxaca animals.  We started with a taco each my friend had the Pollo Con Mole Poblano and I had the Barbacoa De Res.  We both like them very much.  We ordered the Shrimp Mojo to share.  it was smoking and very well executed. We also ordered the 20 vegetable fried rice which sounds either odd or no big deal.  It was my favorite dish I would go back just to order that.  My friend said he would go back just to have the shrimp mojo again.  Now for the drinks, we both ordered the margarita flight which had three minis consisting of the salt air, a pomegranate salt air, and the blood orange chili.  I like the blood orange chili the best since it has the balance with citrus  and heat.  The salt air is basically a salt foam on top.  Which makes the drink too salty.  But the pomegranate version is very good.  I would recommend giving it try especially since the dishes are served family styled and meant to be shared.
