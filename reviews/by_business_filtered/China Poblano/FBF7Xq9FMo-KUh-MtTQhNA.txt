Came here in December on a impromtu Vegas trip after the first night had a raging hangover so Chinese and Mexican sounded perfect.  I ordered a blood mary to start... ehhh it had soo much tabasco in it - it was kinda gross.  I ordered the queso fundido with chorizo and that's why i gave this place 3 stars, it was cheezy, gooey, salty and savory yumminess.  Also, ordered some tacos.. they are super tiny but have unique choices (carnitas (yum) and pork belly (ehh) I like crispy pork belly so it just tasted fatty.  I will try this place one more time to sample the Chinese part
