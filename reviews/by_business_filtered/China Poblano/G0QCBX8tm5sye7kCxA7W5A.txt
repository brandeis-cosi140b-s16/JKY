We decided to finally stop by and check out this fusion inside The Cosmopolitan, since my man loves Mexican and I love Chinese food. It was pretty empty when we visited (around 3 pm) and we sat down at the bar where we got to watch some of the staff preparing tortillas. The prices were definitely Strip-worthy, so as budget conscious people, we only picked 3 items.

Chips and salsa - for $4, it was a decent choice, and the salsa was indeed yummy.

Coctel de Camarones - on the pricey side for it's size ($15), though very nicely presented. We were disappointed that it did not come with chips (it IS similar to ceviche) but we made do with the chips from the appetizer (which apparently, weren't refillable). It was very delicious; however, we weren't a big fan.

They had specials on the menu (which oddly enough, was only written on one of the two menus we received and isn't on the website menu) and our server suggested we try one of them. Not a big fan either - it was a meat tortilla sandwich on top of a sauce (which made the tortilla itself soggy), and the flavors were nothing spectacular.

Service was great however, and pretty fast. I'd try this place again, but I may stick to the China side of the menu (that said, I may just go to Chinatown instead).
