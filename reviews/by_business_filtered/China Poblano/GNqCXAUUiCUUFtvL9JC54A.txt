We went to this place as Jaleo was not open for lunch and looking at the menu it looked like we might like it. we had to get the server to explain a few items, but once we understood what we would like, ordering was easy and it was great to share. The Kao Lao Lao was a real find, it was steamed to perfection and wonderful. We also had the Unruly Monk and that was our favorite, but the Lemon Tree Shrimp was a real miss. I do understand what others say about the service; the service was just OK and it did appear that the server was not really happy to be there. Otherwise I think we will definitely be back.
