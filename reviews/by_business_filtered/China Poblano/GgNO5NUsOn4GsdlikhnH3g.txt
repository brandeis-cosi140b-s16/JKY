Walking in the place has a very relaxed vibe and beware the chairs are heavier than they look. Ha

Our waiter recommended the mango margarita which has the perfect hint of spice. I took him up on it and was not sorry. We ordered the chips and salsa, fried wontons, several tacos and a Caesar salad. The first thing that came out was our tacos, random. 

However, they were delicious! If you're not too hungry go that route. The salsa is a chipotle style so it was a nice contrast. They add a spice to the chips that rocks. The wontons are not crazy deep fried and they come with a nice sauce. I didn't eat the salad but my mate said it was the best he's had in awhile, I'll take his word for it. 

It was a casual easy going experience and I definitely recommend trying it!
