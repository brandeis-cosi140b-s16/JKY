When I first saw China Poblano, I thought it was just some gussied up Chinese joint at the Cosmopolitan.  When I looked a little closer, I realized it was some kind of combo Mexican-Chinese restaurant.  When I checked them out on my phone, I learned they were a Jose Andres creation.  When my friends suggested them for lunch, I was game.  When we were done, I was sorely unimpressed.

Now, it's probably my fault for assuming, but looking at the place, I was under the impression that China Poblano offered a fusion of Chinese and Mexican food.  In reality, they mostly offer Chinese AND Mexican food.  As in, one and the other.  Not as in, a melding of two very different cuisines.  Disappointing enough already, but that also meant having to get two things in order to try both sides of the menu.  After asking the waiter for suggestions, I took his advice and ordered a couple of tacos to go with my noodle dish (he warned that the portions were "small-ish"):

- Dan Dan Mian (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog?select=1znpnNpUi4mUde6NTXRxEA) - underwhelming.  The noodles themselves were okay and I liked how the pork sauce was actually spicy, but the dish seemed salty.  Really, the only flavors I could really get out of it was spiciness and saltiness.  I didn't expect much and they still fell short.
- Carnitas Taco (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog?select=BqnTT9gfKS5Ol5gszHWr2A) - FAIL.  Unlike my noodle dish, I actually had hopes for this one.  Rather than crispy, grilled meat, I was greeted with a mound of shredded pork dripping with oil (check out the ends of the wrapper) and a topping of deep fried fat (think pork rinds but worse).  No bueno.
- Pescado Frito (fried fish) Taco (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog?select=ilJU8hdfD1EXVL_EZKfFeA) - by default, it was the best thing I had.  On its own, it was only decent.  The fish and pickled onions worked, but I thought the flavor was too muted.  If it was a little stronger, I would have liked it more.

Given the celebrity chef owner and China Poblano's location on the Strip, the meal wasn't cheap.  To charge $5.50 for that carnitas taco (and to a lesser extent, $6.50 for that pescado taco) is practically criminal though.  With just the $12 I spent on the tacos, I can find a better Chinese noodle dish and tacos, and still have change to tip.  Unless you're a big Jose Andres fan, you're better off going elsewhere (like Holstein's next door).
