If I could give this place 0 stars I would! The only reason it deserves a 1 is because their Micheladas were pretty decent. 

Where do I start? The prices, portions, excessive use of salt and sugar? To start off I ordered chips and salsa. When the chips and salsa arrived I was excited to try the salsa since it looked dark and spicy (I'm Mexican and this resembled the salsa I make at home). WRONG!!!!! This salsa tasted so sweet it was such a disappointment. For my main entree I ordered two tacos one of which was the carnitas and the other was chicken. The carnitas was excessively greasy and the chicken taco was again very sweet. My fianc√© ordered the shrimp poblano which was again extremely sweet. I understand not all Mexican food is made the same but the food at this particular restaurant tasted very foreign to me. 

Not to mention they played a lot of bachata music which is not Mexican at all!! However, since there were tons of white people dining here they wouldn't know the difference. 

In conclusion, I was very disappointed with my meal and since the prices are not fair for the quality of the food I will not be coming back to this restaurant nor will I recommend this place to my family or friends!
