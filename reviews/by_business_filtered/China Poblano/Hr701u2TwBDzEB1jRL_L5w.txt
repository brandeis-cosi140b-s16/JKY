Not Bad...  But Could Be Better!

Chinese and Mexican... Two of my favorite types of food! I was intrigued to eat here when I was walking by this place and decided to have brunch here. Here is what we ordered and my thoughts:

Chilaquiles con Chorizo - Best Dish We Ate, Flavors Were Amazing
Huevo Motule√±o - Not Bad But Pork Belly Overcooked
When Pigs Fly - Yummy Dim Sum, Try It With The Habanero Salsa
Barbacoa de Res Tacos - Juicy & Flavorful
Setas Tacos - Good Concept But Messy

Overall the food was good but not great. The place is a little over priced as well. If you want a quick snack then definitely go by here and try the tacos.
