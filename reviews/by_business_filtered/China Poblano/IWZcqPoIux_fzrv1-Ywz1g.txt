Holy Moly Guacamole!!

I LOVE hot food, AND being indoors!!  This place has them BOTH!!  China De Mexico (as it's known to me and my friends) is hip, is hop, is what's happening!!  Now I've never eaten there, nor have I been, I'm on a fixed income and live very far away.  But I know what I like and I like China Poblano.  But if was able to eat there I think it would go a little something like this:  "Hello waiter, may I come indoor and order hot food?"  "Ce Senor, would you like the chop sticks?"  "Yes, my new best friend, I would."  
And so on.
