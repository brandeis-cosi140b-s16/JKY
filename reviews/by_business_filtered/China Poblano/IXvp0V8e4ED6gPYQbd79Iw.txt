Interesting concept - Mexican Chinese fusion. Some of the dishes come out better than others. Love the shrimp mojo with black garlic and the 20 vegetable fried rice. The clams with buckwheat noodles were way too salty and heavy on the sauce. The dishes are a bit pricey - but not dull. A good selection of cocktails but no draft beer.
