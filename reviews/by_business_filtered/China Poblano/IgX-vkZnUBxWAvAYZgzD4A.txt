Be warned - you're thinking take out but you get REALLY REALLY small portions for what you pay for.  The food itself isn't bad, but they really skimp on portion size.  It's really expensive for what you get!!!  I've tried the dan dan noodles and another dish.  Again, it's not bad, just really small and really expensive.
