Im always quite iffy on this place. I love Jose Andres, Im a huge fan of his work for the Bazaar, but this place just seems A-OK for me.

I love the concept of Mexican and Asian. It is honestly a dream come true for me. Tacos and Noodles! What an awesome combo, especially if one is inebriated. I usually only dine here based on the sole reason of convience.

Tacos and Noodles (especially the noodle soups) just dont seem worth it to me to pay those extra bucks. I understand that it is by Jose Andres, and I understand that its expensive, and I understand that its meant to be in small portions, and I understand that its suppose to be gourmet-esque, a cream of the crop type of ideal.
BUT...
I just dont see the possibility of tacos and noodle soups being capable of elevated at that high of a level. Its like taking something wayyy out of its comfort zone and making it work. 

Long story short, the food is delicious, the prices are pretty high, the portions are very small, the location is very convenient for those staying in the Cosmopolitan. 

Will I ever eat here sober? NO
Will I ever eat her inebriated? YES

UNTIL THEN!! ^-^
