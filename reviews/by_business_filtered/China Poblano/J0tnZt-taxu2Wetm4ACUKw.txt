This restaurant was good but so overrated. I was expecting an amazing meal but it was not that special. Some really cool drinks, creative items & good tacos but I wouldn't bother going back. The 20 veg fried rice from best thing I ever ate was totally unimpressive, I was surprised by how weak this restaurant is considering how much hype I've heard about it & that its a Jose Andres restaurant
I would not bother going back
