Chinese / Mexican is a weird combination, but they appeared to make it work. The Chicken Ji Song was okay for Chinese food. The har gow was disgusting. When Pigs Fly? No. They don't. Just steamed bbq pork buns. Chinese takeout places here in SF sell better bbq pork buns than this place. Conchinita taco? Pretty good flavors. My pork wasn't shredded enough, but most people at the table said it was good. Arrachera con Salsa Molcajete? Damn good. Skirt steak was a little rare, but I understand that you can't cook this too much. Tuna Ceviche - DELICIOUS! I've never had better ceviche. Not in Miami or SF. This was the best I've had. Fried Rice was just okay.

If I were to go again, here are the items I might order again:
Tuna Ceviche - for sure!
Chicken Ji Song - probably.
Arrachera con Salsa Molcajete - maybe.

I think I would try avoiding the Chinese food more and going more for the Mexican.
