Our first visit, the menu and concept looked interesting and good. We had a great experience. The service from start to finish was great, our server had good suggestions and the manager stopping by a couple times was super friendly. The beef and lettuce entre was very good, tender and seasoned quite well I thought. Sui Mai was very good. A fun selection of tacos, carnitas, fish and lobster tacos were great and try the silencio, unique and delicious. The kumamoto oyster in a taco with lychee and beef tendon was an awesome concept! My only thing on it was too much of the beef tendon, maybe could be done a little differently but still liked. I'm a tequila lover and loved the tequila selection, great place to try some of the higher end tequilas with their flights. And a creative list of drinks and margaritas, they know how to make one. The golden pigs I believe they were called, fried pork buns -- Awesome. Almost like desert. We'll be back to try more from the menu for sure. Thank you!
