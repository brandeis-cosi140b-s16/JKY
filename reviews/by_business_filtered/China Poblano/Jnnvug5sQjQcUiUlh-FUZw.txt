I was one of the few people up bright and early after a night of partying and decided to trek the strip with one of the girls. We came upon this restaurant and got lured in by the window displaying noodles being made. I suppose this isn't so much an "Asian fusion" restaurant; it merely serves both Chinese and Mexican food "side-by-side" as it advertises, which doesn't seem that great, does it? I mean, one side is going to suck, right? 

And it's not that great. Granted, I only tried the Mexican food, but at 13 bucks for some shiu-mai, I'm not that much of a sucker. So my friend and I went for the tacos.  I got the barbacoa and was told the mushroom was highly recommended. At 4.50 a pop, I'm expecting some high quality stuff. But alas, all I got was some pretty ho-hum tacos on a nice looking frosty plate. My friend ordered the cochinta, and said she'd come back for that again 

We also ordered off the brunch menu. I forget the name, but it's akin to a glamorized version of nachos topped with fried egg. Extremely forgettable.  

I will give them this though - service was AMAZING. These were some of the nicest fellows ever and really made us feel quite comfortable. Unfortunately, I don't think the food is up to par.
