SMALLEST PORTIONS EVER! What is this? A restaurant for ants?!? Don't assume serving size is based on price. I had the world's tiniest har gau for $13. (Normal price at a dim sum restaurant for it would've been $2 or under.)  It says you can do family style, but some of the things on the menu are bowls of noodle soup and things that are hard to share.

High prices, very courteous service but slooow, and heavy sauces on the food.  Kinda reminds me of PF Changs.  Eclectic/weird theme and decor with faces of Chinese and Mexican people flashing on the wall.  Overall good ambiance for groups, though the place just seems like its trying too hard to be something better than it is. If you're gonna drop cash on a nice dinner, I think there are better places.
