Overall disappointed. The portion sizes were terrible for the price and the bartender (since we sat at the bar) failed to tell us that the dish we ordered and appetizer would not be enough for a lunch for two. We ordered the pigs on horseback due to its hype. They were definitely the best thing we had though they were on the dry side and lacked something I think a crisp vinegar style dipping sauce could have easily fixed. We also ordered the Beijing Glass noodles which promised to be a light vegetarian dish to compliment our heavy pork break appetizer. The noodles came out and the whole dish was a little larger than my fist. More of a side really. It seemed like they had marinated everything in sesame oil and had little other flavor. Since we were still hungry we ordered a couple of tacos thinking the other side of the menu would be good. Wrong. The Tinga Poblano was really flavorless and the cochinita was even worse. The pork had a bland dipped-in-A1 taste and the onions didn't add anything to the dish other than filler that distracted me from the taco. The service was terrible. Our bartender was attentive to our waters but failed to help us decide anything and generally acted aloof and a bit shady. The decor was enjoyable and the idea I think is awesome. I really hope they step their game up. Probably the worst restaurant to eat at in the cosmo. I will not be returning.
