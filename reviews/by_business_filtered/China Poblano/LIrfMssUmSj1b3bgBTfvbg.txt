I see this place has some not so good reviews.  I stopped in looking for something different for lunch while I was out on the strip and China Poblano did not disappoint.  I sat at the bar on the right side of the restaurant and was quickly presented with a menu.  Service was good, not the best I've had but it was perfectly fine.  The food was outstanding!  

I started with the lotus chips and they were crispy, and uniquely seasoned.  I then got the Lengua taco and the lamb potstickers.  Both of these were also delicious and perfectly seasoned.  Since I had been imbibing at the Diamond Lounge I did not order any drinks.  The food was 5 stars easy, the service was between a 3 and 4, but the prices . . . man it hurt.  Seriously $6 for one taco, and that was it just the taco, and $13 for 5 potstickers?  I know it's the strip but I'd expect these prices up on the third floor of the Cosmo not the second.  But, the food was so good I'm going to give 4 stars and will probably make my way there again.
