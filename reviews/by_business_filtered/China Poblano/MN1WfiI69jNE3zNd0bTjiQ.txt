This review is only for the Mexican food at China Poblano. The pork carnitas tacos and fried fish tacos are really good. They're about $4.50 each which seems like a lot, but I think it's reasonable for good quality food on the strip. Everything is a la carte, so I'd recommend the chips and guacamole too. 

Service is pretty fast, and location is ideal - right by Marquee. Perfect for quick food after the day club.
