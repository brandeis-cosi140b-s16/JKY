Had just arrived in Vegas and started walking around

While looking for a place to eat we came across China Poblano, we were seated promptly and Corrine approached us as our server. She took drink right away and asked if we had eaten here before. We told her it was our first time and she walked is thru the menu and suggestions. EVERYTHING SHE RECOMMENDED WAS AMAAAAZING!!!! The pork carnitas AMAAAAAZING! The queso delicious!! And she recommended the pork belly, lettuce and tomato with this amazing sauce!! She took care of us and the server assistants were on top of bussing tables!
I recommend this place to anyone who comes to the strip in Vegas! Will be eating again before we leave! And ask for Corrine she's awesome!
