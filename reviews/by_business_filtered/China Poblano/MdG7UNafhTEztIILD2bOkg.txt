China Poblano, like many things in Vegas, is a unique experience. It's not Chinese/Mexican fusion, it's a menu that serves both traditional Mexican and Chinese dishes. It sounded like a good idea .... it just didn't deliver. 

They have an excellent selection of tacos, my favorite was the Carnitas which comes with pork rinds and a squeeze of lime juice. If they opened a food truck that served Carnitas tacos I would follow them around the country getting fatter by the day. Most of our group ordered from the Chinese side of the menu, and everything they ordered was disappointing. The dumplings were tiny and the noodles were flavorless.

The highlight of the meal was the salt air margarita. It is a shaken margarita served with a light airy foam that replaces the traditional salted rim. The salty foam cuts the heavy handed pour of tequila, making it the perfect way to start a night of excess.

Come for the salt air margarita, order some Carnitas tacos, and after you'll be ready for a night on the town.
