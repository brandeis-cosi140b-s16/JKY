We had a great Christmas lunch here. 

Overall the food was good, but nothing to rave about. It takes some time to get used to having Chinese and Mexican at the same time. I recommend the rou jia mo street sandwich, shrimp mojo, and lamb potstickers. Papas frites (fries) were excellent as well, but I would order it with the toppings on the side. Just don't get the 20 vegetable fried rice...it was boring, the portion was tiny, and definitely not worth $16.88!

The main reason I'm giving it 5 stars is the desserts. They were amazing! we had mango sticky rice, happy buddha gello, and coconut tapioca balls. They were all delicious without being too sweet. 

I also loved the interior with funky mix of Mexican and Chinese decorations.
