Not a fan went in for a quick $60 snack ! This place is not cheap portions are small. I wanted dim sum but they all had pork. I asked if there was one without pork and the guy told me beef. I ordered the vegetable dumplings that came out really bland and wet. They gave me soy sauce I asked if he had anything spicy to mix in brought out a sauce and charged me $2. I also had to ask three times for the sauce and I was sitting right at the bar stool infront of the guy. I would pass on this place definitely not worth it. The soup was also pretty bland.
