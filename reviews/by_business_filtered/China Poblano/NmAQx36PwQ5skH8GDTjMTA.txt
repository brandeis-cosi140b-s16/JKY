THIS PLACE WAS A MAJOR LET DOWN!!! Over priced flavorless Dim Sum( and I've had some shitty Dim Sum in my life) The portions were very pricey and minuscule. I could tell the server knew I didn't like my food and then she proceeded to avoid my table out of fear I guess. Either way don't go here unless you don't mind wasting time and taste buds.
