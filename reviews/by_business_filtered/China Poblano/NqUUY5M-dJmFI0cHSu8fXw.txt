My favorite of The Cosmopolitan restaurants, this unusual but excellent restaurant by Jose Andres is casual, fun, and excellent. The menu offers dishes that I have never experienced, especially in their combinations. It was artfully presented, and the taste was pure delight. I loved the Dan Dan noodles, the guacamole was heavenly, and the sticky rice may be one of the best desserts in Vegas. This is an affordable and wonderful experience that I highly recommend, and hats off to the waiters for informed and engaging service.
