This is my second trip here and came with work team. This time was even better. We sampled various Dim Sum, Tacos, Pork Buns, vegetables and others. All were great and most surprising was the soup filled Dim Sum which was a first for me. You can tell the quality ingredients are used compared to regular Dim Sum. Enjoyed everything and will keep coming back.
