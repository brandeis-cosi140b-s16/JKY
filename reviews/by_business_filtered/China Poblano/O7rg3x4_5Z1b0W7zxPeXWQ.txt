My wife and I dined here on Christmas Eve with another couple. The restaurant was maybe two-thirds full and we were happy to be sat at our table 20 minutes prior to the start of our 7:00pm reservation. Our drink and food orders were taken promptly and all was going well until we received the bill. 

This was at 7:30pm.

Our waiter assured us that it was no problem to split the checks per couple. We obliged and he said he would return with a check for each couple. The checks he dropped were wrong and we asked for them to be corrected. In addition, I reminded him that I had comp points on my Cosmopolitan players card that I would like to be used. I even wrote it on the itemized receipt as a reminder. 

He returned with the correct checks and took our credit cards as well as my Players Card, came back to our table with the cards swiped and I notice he hadn't used my comp points. He took my check again and applied the comp points.

We leave the restaurant at 8:25pm.

It took us longer to pay our bill than it did for us order and eat our food. We could not have been more disappointed with our experience. To make matters worse our waiter did not even acknowledge the fact that he took 55 minutes to cash us out. 

As a Vegas local it always amazes me that, in a town that prides itself on the Hospitality industry, that we would find such terrible customer service. 

My wife and I will not be back. The food was alright, but the lack of attention to detail by our server ruined our dining experience.
