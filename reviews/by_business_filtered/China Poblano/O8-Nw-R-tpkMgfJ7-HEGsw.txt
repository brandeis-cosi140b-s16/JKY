My husband and I spent a lot of time at the Aria when we were in Vegas last.  For dinner before a show we ended up at China Poblano intrigued by the combination of two of our favorite foods.  After all, what could be better than a restaurant that serves both Chinese and Mexican food?  How amazing would it be to gorge myself on salsa and crab wontons?  

I was a little disappointed in our magical adventure into Chinese/Mexican fusion, mostly because the Mexican far outshined the Chinese.  We enjoyed the fresh made chips, salsa, various tacos, and homemade margarita mix.  In my opinion, the number one item on the menu was the bean taco.  Whatever they did to the refried beans made them super smooth and full of flavor, I actually ended up ordering another after my first.  

The Chinese portion of our meal fell very short.  Usually one of our favorite dishes, the Hot and Sour soup was so gelatinous that we barely even ate any and the pork buns lacked flavor and were not cooked well.  

Overall it isn't a place I would visit if it were in my hometown and we definitely wont go back on our next trip to Vegas.
