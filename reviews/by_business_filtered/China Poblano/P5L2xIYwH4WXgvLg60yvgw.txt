Just OK.

We decided to check out China Poblano soley based on its convenient location inside The Cosmopolitan.  We met up with my cousins prior to our reservations at The Chandelier bar.  I decided to get a fresh cocktail before heading up.  We walked up to give them our reservation name and we were told that we couldn't enter unless I finished my very full cocktail or dumped it out.  What?  We are still in Vegas right?  I tried to comply, but just couldn't stomach slamming an entire cocktail with no food in my stomach.  Not to mention, I am close to being a 40 year old woman...come on!!!  My husBAND approached them again and politely questioned their policy.  A few moments later they came over and told us that we could enter with the drink.  

The service from that point on was spot on.  Absolutely no complaints in that department.

The food was just OK...nothing special.  We all ordered multiple dishes to share so we tried  a bit of everything.  Nothing particular stood out.

The decor is interesting.  I did find the little pull out stools in the middle of the dining room a little odd and uncomfortable...just awkward really.

I wouldn't not recommend this place to anyone, but wouldn't go out of my way to recommend it to anyone.
