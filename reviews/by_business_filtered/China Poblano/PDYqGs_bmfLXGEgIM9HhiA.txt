Another over priced restaurant with wannabe authentic taste. Five dollars for a taco? lol Sure, the tortillas are hand made but everything else is mediocre... Taste is ehh the aguachiles is a joke, small plate with a couple of scallops on it. 
Not to mention our waiter over charged us. Not a good reputation to leave to a new costumer. Won't go back rather go to a taco truck.
