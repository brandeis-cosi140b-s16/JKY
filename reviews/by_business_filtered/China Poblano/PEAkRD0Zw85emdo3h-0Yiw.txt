This is probably the worst restaurant I've ever been to.  I'm not a picky eater so that's saying a heck of a lot.  First of all I don't think you can come up with a poorer idea than Chinese and Mexican food.  2 of the most common food staples, you're really not gonna fool anyone with gimmicks west of the Mississippi. The only reason we found this place was because we were starving and saw Mexican food on the sign, and figured how can you go wrong.  Ordered a ginger ale and sprite which came in like 10 oz little bottles.  We looked at the menu and knew we were in trouble.  Just nothing you would expect from Chinese or Mexican food, and then the waiter explained the small portions.  Um small portions and Mexican food?  Yikes.  The servers were nice to us so we didn't want to be completely rude and just walk out so we ordered a house margarita and chips/salsa out of pity.  $30+ for 10 oz sodas, margarita, and chips.  Average margarita in a "small portioned" little glass for $15, wonderful lol.  A complete waste of time and money, took the loss and couldn't wait to get out of there.  Honestly I was just embarrassed to be there.

I don't have a problem paying Vegas prices I get it, otherwise I wouldn't visit here.  But this place is nothing short of insulting, you can get dumplings and street tacos at home.  If you want atmosphere you're better off at a real lounge.  If you want good food, go to Chinatown.
