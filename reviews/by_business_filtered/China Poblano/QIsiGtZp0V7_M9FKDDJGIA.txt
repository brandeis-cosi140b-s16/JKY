Barely a shadow of Chinese or Mexican food based on taste, texture, or portion.  Hostess was clueless. 1) First told us there was no reservation 2) told us we have to wait for a table after finding our reservation 3) we mention our friend's have arrived and she said we were the first of the party to be here 4) walked past her and FOUND our friend's sitting down under our reservation.  You'd be better off going to any place on Spring Mountain or Roberto's
