When I saw China Poblano on Food TV's "Best Thing I Ever Ate: Las Vegas," I knew we had to go when we were out there. It's a restaurant designed for us, really - Mexican and Chinese. Not fusion, but three separate kitchens taking care of both of our food needs at once, without one of us sitting and watching the other eat. Being that it was José Andrés, we had high hopes, and they were met easily.

His plate: Papas Fritas with Mexican cream and queso fresco; Carnitas taco (braised baby pig, pork rinds, spicy salsa verde cruda); Pescado Frito taco (fried fish, salsa Mexicana)

Her plate: "When Pigs Fly" - delicate steamed buns with Chinese barbecue pork; "Ocean Nest" - scallops/shrimp/king crab/lobster/pan-fried egg noodles/ seasonal vegetables; "Salt Air Margarita"

To share: Chips and Salsa - fresh tortilla chips, house-made chipotle salsa

The chips and salsa were good, though nothing out of this world. The pork buns were the only actually disappointing part of the meal - the dough is a little gummy and maybe overworked - though the filling was flavorful and moist, and happily not over-salty. We ended up taking these home and they were better as cold leftovers in the middle of the night.

My pan-fried egg noodles were nice and crisp, with a deliciously oceany broth. There was no king crab, which I'd been looking forward to, but the shrimp had their heads on and were fantastically fresh. The bok choy was the perfect choice for the 'seasonal vegetable' and I'd definitely get this dish again. The ocean flavor was just so good.

The fries were described as good, but not memorable. D's tacos were both fantastic, full of flavor and great textural contrasts. The carnitas were not slimy, as they are at some restaurants, and were nicely accented by the pork rinds on top. Since we've been home, the tacos have been mentioned a few times. We'd love it if José added a China Poblano in DC, but we'll also definitely visit it again when we're in Vegas next year.
