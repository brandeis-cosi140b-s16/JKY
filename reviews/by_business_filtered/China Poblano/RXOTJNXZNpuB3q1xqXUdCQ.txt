i've always had great experiences at this place. great food, great service. I dont like sitting on the little stool thing but i can easily get over that. 

we went there for my fiance's birthday, we has tacos, pozole, a couple orders of dim sum, noodles and a couple of deserts.

He ordered a Manhattan, which sat in the window a bit to long so he was a little disappointing but it wasn't a huge deal.

all in all we were very happy with the experience and will be returning soon!
