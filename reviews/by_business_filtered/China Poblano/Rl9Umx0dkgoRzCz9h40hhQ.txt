the staff was nice, food tasted good, but it was pretty expensive.  i got a scallop ceviche which was 4 tiny little limes with some seasoning on each lime and then a bay scallop ontop of it and that was $12, and then i got some soup with chinese sausage in it that i didn't even it noticed it had sausage as it was just mush with not much flavor.  the soup itself was good, just wish i could have noticed it had the sausage.  drinks are small, margarita was like $12ish and was maybe 4 ounces.  the food tasted pretty good, but way too pricey for how small the portions are.  i probably won't be back
