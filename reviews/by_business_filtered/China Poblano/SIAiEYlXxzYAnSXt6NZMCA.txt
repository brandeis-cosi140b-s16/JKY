Interesting blend of Chinese and Mexican food.  Very unique and a little fancy at times.

We had the following dishes - click on the menu above:

Dont Be Jealous
 hot and sour soup, pork, tofu, bamboo shoots, dried mushrooms 
Good soup.

Beijing Glass
 bean sprouts, jicama, avocado, cellophane noodles, carrot, chinese cabbage, sesame dressing
I liked this one - it's like a noodle salad.  The jicama gives it a bit of a crunch.

Dan Dan Mian
 hand-cut wheat noodles, spicy pork sauce
Not bad dan dan noodles - with peanuts

Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich
 red braised pork
It's the chinese pau with this most delicious tender pork.  A winner!

Twenty-vegetable Fried Rice
 fresh vegetables, fried rice
I can see lots of vege all finely chopped in this delectable dish.

Barbacoa De Res
 oaxacan-style barbeque beef, guajillo chile, pickled cactus paddle
Neat taco!  I like the flavours!

Carnitas
 braised baby pig, pork rinds, spicy salsa verde cruda 
Very good taco!  

I wanted to give this place a try because of the unique blends of 2 cuisines.  Will I come back?  Sure!
