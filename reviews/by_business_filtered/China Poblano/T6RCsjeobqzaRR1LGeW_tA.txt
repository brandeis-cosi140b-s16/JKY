Real good food it's definitely  different.  It's China and Mexico meet.  That in itself should  spark intrest.  Don't try to change anything   because  they will tell u the chef will not do it and there are good reasons because of the flavor that each dish provides.  The portions are small which gives u the ability to try multiple  items on the menu but be sure to do both China and Mexico because  that is what it's about
