Let's start with the good stuff about China Poblano:

- Super cute and trendy decor, we had such a great time noticing the small details around us as we waited on food.  It almost feels like dining in an eclectic art gallery, fun.

- The service was pretty solid, not rushed nor too pushy -- but very attentive with water glasses filled at all times, friendly rapport and helpful suggestions.

- The drinks were interesting.  Not strong or obsess about the cocktail menu until you return amazing, but definitely stood out above most of the rest of our Vegas beverages.  In particular, the Blood Orange Chile Pequin Margarita  had a unique flavor (not as spicy as we'd like it, but that's not unusual as we're freaky about our spiciness) -- and the Salt Air Margarita was an experience.

But now for the food....

It was just 'meh'.  Probably lower than meh... 'eh'?  

I love fusion cuisine and small plate dining as much as the next food geek, but for the price and build up everything really fell short.  The chips and tortillas tasted store bought (or crappily made, if actually done in-house), the ceviche tasted borderline 'off', even the queso fundido was barely mediocre (who knew you could mess that up).  

For the price and the buzz we heard, it was a total let down.  A great meal and a couple of nice dinner drinks are priceless in our household.  But this particular dinner for two set us back around $160 and was instantly regretted.  We stopped elsewhere to grab a (much tastier and filling) bite before heading back to the room for the night.  

My advice:  grab a drink and enjoy the vibe, then move on for dinner.
