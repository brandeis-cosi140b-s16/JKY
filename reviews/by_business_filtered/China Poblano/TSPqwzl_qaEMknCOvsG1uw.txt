A headache indeed. The menu items had weird names accompanied with descriptions that only baffled my friends and I even more. Although the waitress who helped my table was more than helpful to recommend menu items, the food was small in portions (just like any other restaurant here in Vegas) and were not good. 

The 20 Vegetable Fried Rice was okay. I'm of Chinese ethnicity, so I feel like my mother's cooking could single-handedly run the Chinese side of this Chinese-Mexican fusion (wtf?) restaurant out of business; the Tuna Ceviche and carnitas were okay.
