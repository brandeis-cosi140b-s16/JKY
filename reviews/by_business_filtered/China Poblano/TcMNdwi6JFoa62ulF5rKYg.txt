Ever had that awkward moment where you enter a restaurant alone and someone else just happens to enter alone at the same time, thereby causing the restaurant staff to assume you are a party of two? 

Yeah, me neither...until this visit.

If this other party was male, it would have been relatively simple for me to just speak up and say: "I'm not with him." End of story. 

But this time, the person who entered right next to me was a woman and we took the only two empty seats - right next to each other - at the bar section. Admittedly, to the casual observer, it must have appeared we were together. 

A nice server came over and began reviewing the menus for us. She glanced back and forth between us and recommended a couple of plates for sharing. Usually not at a loss for words, I found myself struggling to think of what to say to let the server know we were not together without sounding insulting or dismissive to the other guest. 

Fortunately, she took care of this by saying with a smile "Oh, we're not together." 

Thank you whoever you were!

Okay now onto the review...so I like this place well enough. It has a very diverse and unique menu blending Chinese and Mexican dishes. Service was smart, friendly, and prompt. Based on a few recommendations from my server, I tried three dishes: shrimp and black peppers, a chicken taco, and a beef tongue taco. Each was tasty, nothing spectacular, but good. Beef tongue taco was fine. If you've never had it, it's basically like a nice cut of roast. 

The portions are VERY small. I had three tacos and went to have lunch somewhere afterwards. Think " very light appetizers" and you'll get along just fine. 

So based on the mediocre food and very small portions, I'm going with three stars. But the service is superb and I love the atmosphere and location, right in the heart of the Cosmopolitan's busy second level.
