No lie, the neon lights drew me in.  One screamed "Mexican Food" and the other "Chinese Food" - made me curious.  Not to mention, a Chinese woman making fresh noodles in one window while a Mexican women with her tortillas in another window.

The menu made me just as curious - fancy tacos.  Each taco between $4-6, but with ridiculous combinations.  I tried:

Viva China - Kumamoto steamed oyster, beef tendon, Sichuan sauce - the beef tendon was absolutely delicious with a wonderful crispy/chewy texture, but it was unfortunately overpowered by the oyster.  Two strong flavors that battled it out, but didn't come together in the end.

Carnitas - Deliciously braised pork complete with large chicharrones, perfectly complemented with a salsa verde - I could have had a few of those.. 

Also had the Chilaquiles off the brunch menu - reminded me of super soaked nachos with a fried egg on top.  The table loved it.

Huitlacoche Noodles - for mushroom lovers only, but if you love mushrooms and quite a hefty amount of spice - you'll love this dish.  They fail to mention the chiles in the dish.

Chips & Salsa - the smoked flavor was strange at first but I grew to enjoy it.

Salt Air Margarita - a very delicious margarita  in which case they salt is in the foam making each sip perfectly balanced.

The service was great, the ambiance makes it a great lunch/brunch place.  Overall, a good place to try if you're near the Cosmopolitan.
