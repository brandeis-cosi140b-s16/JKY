Such a disappointing place!  While I lived in DC several years ago, I visited many of his restaurants there and they were all amazing.  I was so hopeful for China Poblano...but oh no, what happened?  The service was not good and the food was terrible and ridiculously overpriced.  The Sprite I ordered was $5 and the Coke was $5.88...nowhere on the menu does it reveal these crazy prices!  But, back to the food...the vegetable fried rice had no taste whatsoever and the ocean's nest barely had any seafood in it...just a lot of large vegetables!  There are so many other great choices in Vegas and I am so disappointed we spent $80 here...ouch!
