This restaurant is definitely more gimmick than quality. I am all for fusion, but I don't think it worked successfully here. The steam buns were dry and the glob of hoisin wasn't really helping. The dumpling filling is ok and the noodle wasn't too thick, but pretty over priced. Yeah, I get it, it's Vegas!  But, I still want quality for the price tag that's being demanded. The tuna tartar was odd. It had some spice in it that wasn't fully ground, so the texture was crunchy without being a pleasant taste. Next time I'll hit up secret pizza when I am in the Cosmo.
