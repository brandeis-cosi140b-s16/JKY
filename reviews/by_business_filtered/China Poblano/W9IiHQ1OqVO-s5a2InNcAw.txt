Average to meh..

Granted we were a little tipsy coming in after having a couple of pints at Todd English's P.U.B at Crystals but the food was just okay. Definitely just order from the Mexican side of menu as the Chinese we ordered was bland and barely touched. 

One good thing- the service. Everyone was friendly and willing to accommodate our semi-drunken table. Oh Vegas..

I would TOTALLY recommend Holstein's next door over China-Poblano if you are standing there conflicted between the two.
