I'm sad to see that this place isn't rated higher!  My husband and I eat here every time we go to Vegas, sometimes more than once.  We love it!

Our favorites:

Salt Air Margarita (actually, they have lots of great cocktails!)
Golden Pigs 
20 Vegetable Fried Rice

Go!  You won't be disappointed!  

Atmosphere is casual, service is friendly and prices are reasonable (for Vegas).
