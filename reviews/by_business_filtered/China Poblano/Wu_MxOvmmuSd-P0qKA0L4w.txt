Some girlfriends and I spent the weekend of 4/20 in Vegas...which was kinda amazing. But do you know what lacked amazingness? This place!

My friend REALLY wanted to go here because she has some kind of "foodie crush" on the dude that opened the place. Or the head chef. Or someone important like that. We all assumed it was going to be a Mexican/Chinese fusion- but the two sides of the menu (and the dishes) are completely separate.

While the atmosphere, and the idea, are both super fun, the place lacks execution. I was not a fan of my soup, and while my lemon shrimp were bomb in flavor, they didn't sit well later!

With so many culinary gems in the city of sin, I suggest you indulge elsewhere!
