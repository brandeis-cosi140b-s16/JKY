I do not understand how this place only has three stars. It was amazing. No, it is not "fusion" - it is Chinese food and Mexican food, but shutup. It was AWESOME.

We let our waiter be our guide and worked our way through the most incredible, soft, pillowy steam buns, lobster and pork tacos, flavorful shrimp mojo, sui mai, har gow, fried steam buns, and mango "sticky rice". 

Everything was full of flavor, inventive, and fun. Our waiter recommended the golden pig (fried) steam buns for last, since they come with a sweetened condensed milk and reminded him more of a dessert, and he was 100% right. It made for a good transitional course.

Will definitely be back. Enjoyed every bite.
