This place is fun and I love the concept, but the execution culinary-wise is not quite up to snuff.

This is an interesting concept: Take the best of both culinary cultures, and blend some to create unique dishes. It's fusion, but not totally, since some of the dishes remain faithful to the traditional recipes.

We ordered and shared family style, so that meant we sampled a bunch of tacos and noodles. Some were nice hits, some were really bad misses.

Highlights:
Huitlacoche Noodles - I've always wanted to try huitlacoche (corn smut fungus), and it integrates seamlessly into this Chinese-styled dish. However, they skimped on how much huitlacoche they gave. Also it takes on flavors so well that I couldn't tell what was the corn itself or if it just absorbed the black bean sauce. Still very tasty though.
Pozole - I love pozole already and it's funny because there's tons of hominy in this dish (whereas the huitlacoche was lacking). The twist is that they give Chinese shrimp crackers to dip instead. Yum.
Dim Sum - In general all the dim sum was good, but not great here.

Lowlights:
Unholy Monk Soup - The blandest, blandest soup evar. Don't monks usually deprive themselves of earthly pleasures? Eat this and you'll feel like a monk too - this dish deprives you of all flavor. Don't give alms to this one.
Viva China Tacos - This has oysters. I pretty much only like oysters fresh & raw with lemon. When oysters get messed with any more than that, they tend to taste funky. The rest of the taco - very good. The oyster part - bad.

So while this place has a great concept, some of the dishes just aren't very good. I like how they maintain both traditional and want to mix it up too. The bad dishes were very bad, the good dishes were pretty good. I guarantee that you'll have fun here though.
