Terrible: courses arrived at different times (explanation was that there are 3 kitchens so of course we should understand), the advertised shredded chicken came in big pieces including cartilage and a hunk of boiled skin (explanation was that the chef says the skin adds flavor), lots of unnecessary fat in the dishes we ordered, and all this with high prices.  Go somewhere else.
