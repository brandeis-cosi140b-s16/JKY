We decided to check this place out of curiosity. The cuisine is suppose to be Chinese and Mexican fusion but it's actually just the type of food that they serve there. 

To drink I ordered the Michelada with a Corona Light. It was pretty tasty and just what I needed after a serious night of heavy drinking ha 

For my main dish, I ordered the Chilaquiles: eggs, tortilla chips, cheese, cilantro, onions and topped with green chile sauce. It was okay. I've had better.
