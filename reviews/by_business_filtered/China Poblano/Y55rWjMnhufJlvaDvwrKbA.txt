SNACKS!  :)

Hit up CP for some late night snacks.....well.... it was around 11pm which is late for me to be eating.

This is more like a 3.5 star place but I'm rounding up because the service was really good.

In any case, there were 4 of us and we were sat quickly.  
It's a tapas-style restaurant that serves dim sum and mexican dishes.  Odd, I know but it works at this casual, unique, hip establishment.

We ordered:

Chips and Salsa - the Salsa was really good!  Good heat but not super hot... just great flavor.

Papas Mole - These were 'ok'.... french fries with mole sauce.

Chilaquiles - BEYOND YUM!  These are the reason I'd go back again.  Melty, crunchy, with just the right amount of "spice" ... but it wasn't "spicy" per se... it was just lots of great flavor!  :)

When Pigs Fly - not bad but I don't think I'd order them again... were rather plain

Carnitas Tacos - YUM!  Definitely would get these again

Lengua Taco - I didn't try these but the guy who ate it really liked it
