EXPENSIVE !!!
Expect to be paying about $5.50-$10 for ONE TACO.

I mean don't get me wrong, the tacos are pretty good, but DAMMM its expensive for such a small portion. They don't even use special taco shells, its just regular tortilla tacos.

Viva China Taco
(beef tendon/kumamoto oysters) $5.50

This taco was really unique. The beef tendon was dried and had the texture of really thin beef jerky. It was glazed in an asian flavor sauce. Served with ONE semi-raw oyster and seaweed. It was different but good.

Carnitas Taco $5.50
(braised baby pig, pork rinds, spicy salsa verde cruda)

This taco was basically filled with pulled pork. Topped with a spicy salsa that resembled spicy guacamole with chopped onions. Then two small pieces of pork rinds. It was good as well.

18 Monk Noodle $14.88
(hand cut wheat noodles, shiitake, crispy sweet potato, soy sauce)

Honestly, these noodles were kind of disgusting. First of all, it was a really tiny portion served in a large bowl. The noodles were completely over-sauced and drenched in soy sauce which made it salty. It was definitely not worth the price tag and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone!

Overall, we bought one bowl of noodles, and three tacos, and the bill came out to about $50. Not coming back here again.
