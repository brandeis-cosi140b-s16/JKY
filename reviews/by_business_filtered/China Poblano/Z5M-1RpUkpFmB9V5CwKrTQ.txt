We had tacos and the vegetable fried rice. The tacos were just ok. Had a lot of oil and they only provide one corn tortilla so everything broke through..it was a mess. The vegetable fried rice was good, but again a lot of oil. The portion too is a little small...for $20 a dang order...uhhhh, no thanks ...I can go to a hole in the wall for a fraction of the price and a little less oil.
