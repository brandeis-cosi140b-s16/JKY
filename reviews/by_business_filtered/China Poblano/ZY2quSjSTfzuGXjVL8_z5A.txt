Jose Andres is a culinary mastermind so I was very excited when I saw that this was his place, but besides the sign exhibiting his name the excitement withdrew quickly.
I came here with a great friend from Hong Kong so the expectations were good quality Chinese food.

The food was very average with there signature "20 vegetable fried rice" for $19.88 being nothing more than your average fried rice that was actually over-seasoned with oyster sauce making it terribly salty and almost unpalatable. 

The pork buns were average but (4) for $13.88 was hefty price to pay for average dim sum pork buns.

The hot and sour soup had a strong after taste. 

The service was good and quick. The food came out very quickly which made us wonder if it was all prepared before hand.

One MUST TRY is the the drinks! I highly recommend Jose Andres' margarita . They had option to add pomegranate and that was just one amazing creation. 
Small quantity and $15 but a must try.
