I liked this place a lot. 

Atmosphere - clean, fun and different. There's cool masks on the walls and pictures of the Dahli Llama and other losers like that, ;). 

Service - the hostess was nice, our main server was knowledgable and spoke spanish well for a white guy. The other servers and bussers were extra nice and on top of everything. 

Food - excellent , we did the $55 chef's tasting menu. It was 9 dishes and two desserts. I liked everything except one, a black spicy shrimp dish. The one that stood out the most was the tuna ceviche, it was "whoa". 

Drinks - we also paired our tasting with a drink tasting for $32, 4 drinks, all good with one great one....their margarita, it's the best one I've ever had.

Everyone! Go here, on a weekday, do the tasting menu, and smile.
