Over priced Chinese/Mexican Food. We went here, because I saw it on The Best Thing I Ever Ate. Can't remember who, but the guy who liked it loved the Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice. So we got it, and that was our favorite out of everything we had. Other than that, everything else was just okay or underseasoned (needed a bit more salt).

A must:
Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice
When Pigs Fly

Just Okay:
Sui Mai Beef
Dan Dan Mian
Chips and Salsa
Guacamole

Not good:
Cochinita Tacos
Pollo a la Parrilla Tacos
Papas fritas with XO Sauce

Drinks:
Au Bon Climat Chardonnay: good
Salt Air Margarita: our friend got this, and she really liked it.

Service was good. The servers suggested 3 - 4 dishes per person, but I really think 2 - 3 would be more than enough. We had a great time. Good place to try, but we won't be back.... well, maybe just for the fried rice.
