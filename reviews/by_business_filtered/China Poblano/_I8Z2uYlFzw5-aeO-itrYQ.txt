At first we were skeptical of the Chinese/Mexican combination, but it was delicious and flowed effortlessly from dish to dish. For five of us, we ordered 6 dishes and a taco each and it was the perfect amount of food. The chips and guac was really amazing, but so was everything we ordered. Our best meal in Vegas!
