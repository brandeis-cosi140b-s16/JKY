China Poblano is an Asian/Mexican fusion restaurant that has good intentions but I think misses the mark on communicating their vision and does not get you good bang for your buck.  

I went here for brunch, as the Cosmopolitan is limited on breakfast options.  The group I went with was also not very familiar with the fusion concept.  When we were looking through the menu, many of them were confused because the menu wasnt clearly communicating what was a "traditional" asian item, "traditional" mexican item & "fusion" item.  They also didn't have a good enough description as to what was in a taco, on a tortilla or what was a soup/ceviche on their brunch menu.  Most of my party had no idea what they ordered until it arrived.

I thought it was too expensive for what you got.  First, chips, guacamole, salsa were all extra costs.  Our salsa literally looked like a splash of salsa in the bowl.  If you're going to charge me for it, it better be a bowl of salsa.  Many of the items were about $5-$10 and you literally got (1) taco with no sides of beans or rice.  You would have to spend about $20 each to get a decent meal.

I got the chilaquiles, which are normally my favorite brunch item.  When they arrived, it was not what I qualify as a good chilaquiles.  The chips barely had any sauce on them, it was too cheesy and chorizo was just plopped down on top of it.  I basically had chili cheese nachos and was disappointed.
