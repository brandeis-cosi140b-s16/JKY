We stopped in here for quick bite. The pomegranate margarita is delicious but small. The guacamole was fresh and made to my spiciness level. The chips served with it were warm and a good thickness. There was however a hair in my friend's ceviche. The staff was extremely apologetic, took the item off the bill, and gave a us a free desert. Finding hair in your food is disgusting but honestly it's bound to happen from time to time and the staff handled the situation perfectly. I would eat here again.
