I had an absolutely terrible experience here and I think it ruined the celebrity chef name too. 
This was last summer and I finally got around to writing the review. I still have the bad aftertaste in my mouth and I swore never to go back there again. EVER. I'd love to give them zero star if I could. 

The service: slow and inattentive. 
The communication between servers and chefs was terrible - our dish somehow went "missing" and we waited and waited, we didn't get any apologies for that. 
We ordered our drinks first hand, but the drinks came towards the end of the dinner. If we didn't remind them, we probably wouldn't have gotten them. 

Their guac was so bland and expensive. We mixed it with the salsa because it was that bland. I can make a better batch of guacamole for 10th of the price. The siu mai was just bad. Everything was so small and expensive for no apparent reason. I'm sorry I even wasted time and money on this place. 

Ok, maybe it's fine to go one time for the novelty of the Mexican/Chinese fusion idea, but definitely not worth the price. They made so many mistakes and failed to make up for it all! The waitress came and suggested that she was sorry, but please, we all knew she didn't mean any of it when she sounded and looked so irritated the whole time that I was complaining about the entire experience in front of her. I don't remember if I tipped, but if I did, I shouldn't have.
