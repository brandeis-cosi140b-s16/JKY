For the people giving this place 1 star solely because of the value. go back to Taco Bell and PF Changs.  That's probably more your speed.  

Yes the portions are small, but it's designed like that.  NEWS FLASH, hand-made food and top quality costs more to make than pre-cooked, frozen, processed food.... that's why its more expensive.  


Food is fantastic and the drinks are extremely creative.  

Jose Andres is a genius and a pioneer.
