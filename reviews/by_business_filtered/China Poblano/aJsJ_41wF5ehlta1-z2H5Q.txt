Chinese food and Mexican food in one - what more could you ask for?

I'm honestly pretty shocked about the lack of positive reviews for China Poblano.  It's Vegas - everything is expensive and probably not big enough (insert double entendre here).  Stop your whining and realize it's tapas-style.  If you have 10 hungry bachelorette party girls like we were, order two of each type, eat family style, order a strong drink, and shut your trap.

For Vegas shu mai, I thought it was pretty good.  We ordered two servings of the Lucky 8, which I recommend so you can get a taste of each type of shu mai they serve. All were tasty and topped with something interesting, like radish or goji berry. The har gau was ok; I have had better. The Don't Be Jealous hot and sour soup had a wonderful kick of spices. Drinks ordered included the Singapore Sling and the Lychee Sour, both of which were flavorful and interesting. I myself had vodka with fresh cantaloupe juice, which snuck up on you and hit you like an unruly child. Other dishes ordered at our table included a caesar salad (with way too much parmesan), When Pigs Fly, shrimp, and numerous tacos. As far as pork buns go, the When Pigs Fly was a little meh. I like the pork to be red and drier than this was.

The coup de grace of my palate was the Viva China taco. This is definitely the best non-traditional taco I've ever had. A taco with beef tendon and oyster - the crispiness of the tendon punctuated with the creamy oyster was mind-blowing. 

Lots of good tastes, a few mediocre tastes. But definitely deserving of a higher rating than the uno estrellas some other folks are giving. I'd go back.  Viva China Poblano!
