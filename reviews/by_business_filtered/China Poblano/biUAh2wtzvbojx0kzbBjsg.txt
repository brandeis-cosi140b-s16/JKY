Not worth your money and time. The atmosphere and decor is really cute but sad to say, that is not enough to bring me back. The Tuna Ceviche was probably the most exciting thing there. The tanginess and these crunch lil things which I suspect is fried roe makes the dish! The tacos were blah and bland and most dissapointing of all was some wheat noodles with tiger sauce. We thought the sauce sounded exciting and exotic but it was just chinese fermented bean sauce. This sauce does nothing to boost the flavor of the horribly bland wheat noodles. Totally disappointing and I will not be back!.
