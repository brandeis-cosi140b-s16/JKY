From what I gather, China Poblano is supposed to be a fusion restaurant--fusing the flavors of China and Mexico.  But it's poorly executed.  There's no fusion about it.  The Chinese dishes come from one kitchen; the Mexican dishes come from another.  But they're completely separate concepts mishmashed into one (loud) restaurant.  Nothing blew any of us away...but the check sure did.  I gather that it's supposed to be served tapas style...but I'm pretty sure that takes away from part of what I love best about eating Chinese and Mexican foods: over-indulgence on the cheap.  China Poblano misses the mark.
