I was super stoked to check this place out, considering it's in my favorite hotel & I wuv me some Chinese & Mexican grub...... :( super sad face after eating there though. The food was pretty decent, but the prices were absolutely ******RIDICULOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It's basically a tapas place, don't get the 'swallow a cloud soup', it was bland. But the pigs fly dim sung was delish! We spent over $75 for LUNCH, let me repeat, for lunch, two people, no booze!! Crap! And we left hungry! What the eff!?! I would like to go back again to try some more concoctions, but NOT based on their pricing. Geesh! :/
