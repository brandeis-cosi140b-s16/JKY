China Poblano is located in the posh Cosmopolitan Hotel.  With it's unique design and great location, it seems to attract many people.  There were plenty on the menu which consisted of Mexican and Chinese...a weird but doable combo.  We ordered quite a few items since everything was tapas style, but the only item we both really liked was When Pigs Fly....the bbq pork bun was tasty - the bun itself kind of tasted like the inside of a pretzel, which was very interesting.  Nothing else really stood out to us.  

The service was a-ok....we were seated, greeted, and served.  She didn't have much of a personality until it was time for us to give us the check.  It was also pretty pricey....3 tacos, guacamole, and 2 other chinese dishes plus dessert was over $150, really?  Our overall experience is was meh.
