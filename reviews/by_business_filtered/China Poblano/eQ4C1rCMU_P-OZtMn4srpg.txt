Small portions, high prices.. at least the place looks nice.

Now this is probably one of those places you need to go to more than once to get an accurate opinion, but I was pretty disappointed. This is a cheaper version of a Jose Andres restaurant, (cause not eveyone can afford to eat at E)

There are a couple good menu items, the chilaqulies are good if you are a cheese fanatic, the pork belly tacos are great, with thin slices of pineapple, and the Dan Dan Mien is delicious with home made noodles. The lengua tacos were decent, nothing special but not bad. Remember everything here is tapa sized, very small portions. Each person needs to order about 3-4 dishes in order to get full. 

Two menu items here ran about $30 which is very expensive for the average Mexican/Chinese food you get here. Yes its a fusion restaurant, but you can get better food at Komex. The place itself looks great. Very trippy looking restaurant, kind reminds you of a neon enfused hole-in-the wall.  But honestly, after such a disappointing first visit I don't think I could every come back.
