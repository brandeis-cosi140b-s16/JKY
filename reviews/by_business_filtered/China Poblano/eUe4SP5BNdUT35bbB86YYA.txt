"We have three kitchens, and everything comes out when it's ready, so it may not be together, ok?" Well...not really. I ordered 2 tacos and hubby got Chinese Spare Ribs, I got one taco while he just sat there for a long time, his food came, and my second taco came out after he was through and we were twiddling our thumbs. I somewhat appreciate their honesty, but...no...bring it out at the same time. The guacamole was wonderful -- order it with crunchy chips like I saw (after we just ordered it) other tables had. The guac alone was worth it. My Pescado Estilo Baja taco not as good as the Carnitas, a surprise. A good idea, though, if some of your party wants Chinese and some want Mexican...
