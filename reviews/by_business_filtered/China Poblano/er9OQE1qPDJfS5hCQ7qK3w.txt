We came for a Saturday lunch, and it was only 2/3 full. The menu is pretty big including chinese and mexican dishes. Maybe that is why some of them are outstanding while some of them are not good. 
The duck tongue taco is to die for. The favor, the texture, and the garnish went soooo well together. I can come back only for this!!
the quail egg Sui Mai was very refined and you can really taste a true meaning of Asian Fusion.
The wonton noodle soup is just a very ordinary but overpriced noodle soup. Not recommended. 
viva China taco was the worse of the meal. The beef tendon was so sticky and the oyster was not fresh. 
the infamous 20-veg fired rice was not bad but not as special as i expected.
great place to visit once because it is very special.
