My first time at the Cosmopolitan hotel and was hungry so went upstairs to find this restaurant! 
Got seated right away and asked the server what their most popular dishes were from the China menu section and he told us couple options.
Bf ordered dan dan mian (kind of dry but was still delish) and I ordered the twenty-vegetable fried rice which was very delish!
I did not feel guilty after eating my dish because it was full of different types of vegetables!
