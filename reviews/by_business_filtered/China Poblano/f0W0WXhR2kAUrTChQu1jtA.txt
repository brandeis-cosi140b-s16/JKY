Located in the Cosmopolitan next to the entrance of Marquee. It's a cute restaurant with Chinese/Mexican decor. On the outside, you can order food at the "take out" windows (left is Chinese, right is Mexican). The type of food you get is made in that specific kitchen so everything comes out at different times. The interior decor was just as good as the outside. Mad props to the decorator. 

ALSO, came with a group of 12 without a reservation, though the place was busy they managed to seat us in 5 minutes on a Saturday. The service inside was just as good. Our waiter was very knowledgeable.

Pretty much everything here is made to share, with the exception of the tacos. They suggest that each person have 2-3 plates to themselves. If you eat a lot like me and are on a budget, this place isn't for you or maybe just get a taco.

Highlights:
*Canitas Taco $5.50 - pretty good but was oily
*Mongolian Beef Lettuce $18.88 - type of meat they used was great, lettuce was good with the sauce. Highly suggest this dish.
*Pozole Rojo with a shot of reposado tequila $15 (w/out shot $12) - they tell you to add the shot to the pozole but I suggest you don't and just take the shot straight. Some people liked it in the soup, and others didn't
*Dan Dan Mian $12.88 - not bad/pretty average.
*Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice $19.88 - really good! You can add meat for an additional price but it's great the way it is

If you don't want to make a decision on individual items, they do offer 3 tasting menus (Chef's Experience $55/person - combination of China/Mexico dishes, Jose's Way $75/person - more unique dishes, & China Poblano Cocktail Experience $35 - 4 of their unique cocktails)
