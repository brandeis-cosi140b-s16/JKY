We came to check this restaurant out for a capstone graduation.
I was excited to try this place out it should give you the best of both 
worlds. Chinese, Mexican.. Makes me happy. 
We started with chips, salsa and guacamole.
Hmmm... If you consider some of your specialty as well mexican than your guacamole should be TOPS!!
Well it wasn't. I was pretty disappointed by the guac. I mean, The guac I make at my house is better than what I ate there. From there we also had the Sui Mai which was ok. It wasn't bad but it wasn't great either well, let me correct that.. the scallop Sui Mai was GREAT.... the traditional shrimp/pork.. well not so much! 
We did try the twenty vegetable fried rice which was good. Probably the best thing on the table for me. 
I also had the fish taco which was good. 
Overall the food was good/ok for the price, I would expect better tasting food. I just wasn't overly impressed I guess..
