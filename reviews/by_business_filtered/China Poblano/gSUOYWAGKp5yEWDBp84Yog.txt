Came here for lunch.

Atmosphere - great and good for a large group

Service - friendly and appropriate
Drinks- tried the salted air margarita - also excellent.  Instead of the salt around the glass it was a cloud
Of salt air which is perfect as you get the best ratio of salt to margarita without it being overwhelming.

Food - Setas tacos (mushroom). Amazing! Best tortilla I have ever had, can taste the freshness and I am usually not a fan of corn tortillas.  Mushrooms were seasoned great in an adobo like sauce on a bed of guacamole which was perfect.  The right amount of seasoning and spice.

20 veggies fried - yes 20 different types of veggies are in it, who knew fried rice could be so good.  A must order and if you like spice ask for a side of the chili sauce.

Churros- excellent, not too greasy and the chocolate dayes was fluffy and not too thick. 

Overall a great meal
