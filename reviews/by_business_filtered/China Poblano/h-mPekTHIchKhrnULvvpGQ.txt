Get ready for the most rushed dining experience of your life! At one point, while I was biting into a taco, I had a server reach over my head to grab a plate. Really, guy? 

The food here is total bullshit. $5.50 gets you one taco, with a dry factory made tortilla, some dry meat, and here's the showstopper - pickled onions. Boom. Gourmet. Dude, I've had better tacos at some of the most ghetto taquerias and the price was nothing close to $5 fucking fifty. Get a grip. Oh yeah, it's Vegas. Boom. Roasted.
