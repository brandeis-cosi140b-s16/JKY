I wasn't impressed. The decor was nice and atmosphere was as well nice however food and service were just bleh. We had requested more chips which we never received. Then when the entree came one person received and he finished then next persons came and then 10 min later the last. So we all ate at different times. I didn't even say anything because it should be obvious to not let that happen. The food was just ok and I wouldn't recommend that you make this a stop.
