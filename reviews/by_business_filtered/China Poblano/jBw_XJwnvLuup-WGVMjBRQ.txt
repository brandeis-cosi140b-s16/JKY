Had an early dinner at China Poblano when I was in Vegas for a conference.  I enjoyed it - the duck tongue taco was awesome, as was a special of XO sea scallops and green beans.  I also enjoyed the cocktails and wines by the glass (and while the food prices were steep, I felt that the alcohol prices were reasonable, all things considered).  Service at the bar was good.
