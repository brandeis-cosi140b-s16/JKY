Went with a colleague to dinner. Knew there were going to be small portions. Shocked at how small they really were. On the good side, "gaspacho" was amazing (5 stars), the noodles - ehh (3 stars). Service was good, but apparently we didn't fit "their mold" as we were seated at a counter. 

All in all, won't be back but worth giving it a try.
