The service was friendly and attentive on a busy night during a convention.

I was in town for work, so I just grabbed a seat at the bar. The server was helpful in working my way through the menu. 

I had a taco night and a noodle dish. Both were pretty tasty. The best tip from the server was to get sides of the homemade chili oil and habanero salsa. I think those made the meal for me.

I am just not too crazy about this trend at upscale Mexican places where they charged you a few bucks for chips and salsa. Oh well.
