Who knew that Chinese food and Mexican food would go well together?  This "collaboration" (how our waitress puts it) is the genius of this place.  Even though portions were small, each dish was very high quality.  If you're looking to get stuffed to the point where you want to vomit, then head to the never-ending selection of buffets in Vegas.  If you want to be surprised and have a lively conversation with your dining partner(s) about the delicious food you're eating, then you have to try this place.  Here's what we ordered:

-Rou Jia Mou street sandwich:  Wow!  So tasty and good.  The bread part reminded me of Northern Chinese scallion pancakes (minus the scallions) and the pork filling was so good.
-Tuna ceviche:  High quality dish with some surprising crunch.  I had to ask the waitress what gave the crunchy texture and it turned out to be amaranth seeds which I've never had before.
-Barbacoa de res tacos:  Good.  Nothing to complain about.
-Sui Mai scallops dim sum:  Yes, it's a traditional dim sum item you can get in any dim sum restaurant but done very well.
-Cajeta flan:  Very creamy and smooth.  Great dessert but I thought the addition of the ice cream was unecessary. 
-Singapore Sling:  So good, I had to drink 2 of them.  Perfect before hitting the slots ;)
