I was curious about the Chinese / Mexican fusion so I decided to check this place out.  We had the Unruly monk which had a strong ginger taste but I wanted to try hand cut noodles.  The other ingredients were great (poached egg, mushrooms and bok choy.  We also tried Chilaquiles which where great. The carnitas tacos were ok, but I'll order something else next time.
