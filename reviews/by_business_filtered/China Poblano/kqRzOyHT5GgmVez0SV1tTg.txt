I had heard great things about China Poblano, so I thought I'd give it a try. Being a local, I love trying new restaurants and being able to give visitors recommendations for them! This one, however, will not be one I'll recommend.

The food was good..nothing too special. The prices were OUTRAGEOUS for what you get. If I'm going to pay $10 per tiny taco, I'd rather not be sitting on a wooden bench...The one strong point of the meal was the salt air margarita. Delicious! (And it better be for $16)

For the 4 people we had there, the bill came out to $240...and we ate everything! Not worth it. Save your money and go somewhere better like STK or Mastro's.
