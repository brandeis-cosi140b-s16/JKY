We loved China Polano!!  It was perfect for our group of 4.  We thought it would be a fusion of Chinese and Latin foods, but it was pretty much split down the middle of half Chinese foods and half Latin foods.  We went for the pork, ribs and refried bean tacos (loved them all, especially the pork and bean tacos!).  Our eyes were definitely bigger than our stomachs because we also ordered the fresh guacamole and chips, beans, cheese, chips, pork bao, and the mongolian beef.  There were lots of ooos and ahhs from our table as these foods were comforting and all so tasty!  We were so impressed!  I can't wait to come back here again next time I am in Vegas!!
