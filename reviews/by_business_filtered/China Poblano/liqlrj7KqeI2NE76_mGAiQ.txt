The menu is very large.  Almost TOO big... I recommend that you do what we did and turn over some decision making to the waiter. 

We had the garlic shrimp...which should be labeled with a DONT EAT ON A FIRAT DATE logo or come with a bottle of listerine...JEEZ!  It was excellent.  

We also had the mini burgers, liked them so much that we ordered 2 more!  

We also had the tomato bread or some thing?  Listen, it's Vegas, there were cocktails involved, I don't remember what it was called!  Order it; ridiculous.

We went crazy and then had the fig jam cheese for dessert.  It's $30, and totally worth it!!!
