A strange combination, but one that works. Personally, I would say the Chinese half of the menu outshines the Mexican portion, but both are filled with many good choices that are more than enough to fill you up.

First off, the specialty cocktails here are great, and should not be avoided it you can help it.  The highlights from each of the menus would have to be: 'When Pigs Fly' (char siu bao) from the Chinese manu, and the Carnitas tacos from the Mexican menu.  The Beef Sui Mai is also good, but I would avoid the Traditional Sui Mai which is a bit bland.  The lamb potstickers, mongolian beef, and Dan Dan Mian are also great, along with tuna ceviche and queso fundido from the Mexican side of the menu.

Like it's neighbor Holstein's, this place is definitely best for lunch, but you'll be perfectly happy having dinner here as well.

China Poblano takes a very novel idea, and executes it well enough.  Is it the best Chinese or Mexican food you'll find on the strip? No, but its very good, and when combined into one restaurant, you have a very unique place to eat that doesn't disappoint.
