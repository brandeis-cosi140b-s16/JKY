Let Down. 

The concept is basically glorifying street food from China and Mexico, and by glorifying I mean marking the price up 200% and decreasing the size portions to basically nibbles.  The funny thing is, the whole concept behind street food is that it is really good and really cheap and you don't have to pay $4 for a taco the size of your pinky for it to be delicious. This place turns that truth on its head by doing exactly the opposite -- charging you a ton of money for mediocre "tastes" of food. I couldn't help but feel like the owners of this place are bleeding the patrons white, that is the bottom line people.  

For the price of food and all the press I was expecting this place to be upscale.  It's not that either. Avoid at all costs.  

**This review is based upon trying the following:
--pomegranate margarita (didn't like at all, too tart)
--When Pigs Fly
--Dan dan noodles
--Lengua tacos
--Pork belly tacos with pineapple
--Carnitas

Can you believe all of this was $100+? Avoid.
