I read a recent review about this restaurant in the LA times, so I decided to give it a try on my most recent visit.   The food was eclectic and spectacular.  

the decor was fun.  a mix of Chinese and Mexican art.  On one wall was a panel of different Chinese opera masks and Mexican art pieces.  The other wall had two large video screens with images of Chinese and Mexican people which changes.  The feel was casual and elegant at the same time.

Our server was Nicole.  She was very courteous, knowledgeable, and gave great recommendations on food.  On her suggestion, we ordered the day's special:  marinated beef skirt steak with poblano peppers.  It was full of flavor.  It tasted better with their homemade guacamole and tortillas.  I also tried the duck tongue taco.  I know it sounds strange, but the flavor was great:  sweet with a crunchy texture of the tongue.  It had a few pieces of lychee fruit on top also.  The scallop ceviche was fun too.  a fresh scallop served on top of a small wedge of lime.  You're supposed to put the scallop in your mouth while squeezing out the lime juice at the same time.  Lastly, the dessert was excellent.  I don't remember the name of the dessert, but it came in a chocolate shell in the shape of a Chinese soldier filled with chocolate mousse served on top of ginger ice cream...very unique.

Overall, a great experience.  It's a fun restaurant.  The main downside is the price.  the dessert itself cost more than any other of the dishes we ordered.  The food is served tapas style, so you only get a small amount per order.  

we ate mostly from the mexican menu on this visit.  On the next visit, I'm gonna try some of the Asian fare.
