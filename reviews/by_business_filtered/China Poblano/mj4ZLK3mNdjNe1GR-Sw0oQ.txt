High hopes all around here as east meets...um, south as I've never really come across a Mexa-Chinese restaurant, or Chin-exico as the decor, menu and ambience display so. Unfortunately, it wasn't the fusion (I know that word gets thrown around all over the place these days) I was expecting. Instead, it was Chinese AND Mexican. Instead of bouncing around the global menu like a worldly tapas joint, the dishes were a little imbalanced, non-sensical and downright combative as you would expect would happen if China decided one day to take on the southern area of North America. I found myself going back and forth trying to come up with some method to the madness and it just never really took. I was going to give it 1 star, but added another because the margaritas were tasty and it was within arm's length of the Aria Hotel and Casino, which could lend 3 more stars here as 5 is not enough to rate the timeliness and creativity of a brand new Vegas strip hotel...but that's for another rant. 

Keep yourself in the eastern or western hemisphere when making the decision to give it a go. It just couldn't muster up the flair that a place like this would need to hide the fact that the menu is just lazy, I said it.
