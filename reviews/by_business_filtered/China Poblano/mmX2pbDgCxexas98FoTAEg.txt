I was staying at the Cosmopolitan and while my friend napped, I decided to check out the hotel and maybe get a snack. I had done some research prior to the trip, and China Poblano was on my list of places to eat. And even though we had reservations for dinner in about 3 hours time, I stopped in kinda pigged out. I started with pork and shrimp fried won tons. These were melt in your mouth, savory deliciousness. They came with a sesame dipping sauce and they were just what I had hoped for. Because the menu is Chinese and Mexican food, I felt the need to try a taco too. I went with the setas taco, which is wild mushroom and guacamole. And also very tasty. To drink, I had one of the juices of the day, which was cherry. If I drank alcohol, I could've had that as a mimosa. When I was finished, I was presented a dessert menu. Now, I knew better, but they had churros, so I had to go for it. Those were decent and came with Mexican hot chocolate for dipping. I personally found the flavors didn't mix well, but others might think it's delicious. I ate the churros and drank the hot chocolate, win-win.

China Poblano isn't cheap, but nothing within the walls of the Cosmopolitan is. I was on vacation and I didn't care. If you are on a budget, I'd take a look at the prices first, but I promise, it will be money well spent if you go for it.
