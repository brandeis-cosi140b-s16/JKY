I had visited China Poblano a few years ago on a visit to vegas and had such fond memories I had to go back. I love all of Jose Andres' DC restaurants so naturally I had to visit one of this Vegas restaurants. 

There was no wait for a party of one to get seated at the bar (30-45 minute wait for parties of 2-4). Sitting at the bar is the way to go if you are dining alone! The bartender was very attentive, he quickly took my drink order and made suggestions for my food order. I personally love the salt air margaritas (I opted for pomegranate, yum!). The foamy salt never mixes with your margarita so you just get a lovely taste of salt with every sip, less salty than big chunks of salt on the rim of the glass in my opinion.

The Bartender said the Dan Dan Mian was one of their most popular dishes and that the shrimp mojo was a personal favorite so I went with those 2 items for dinner. I really enjoyed the Dan Dan Mian, the noodles were the perfect texture and it wasn't too spicy for a spice wimp like me. The serving size is a little small so you may want an appetizer to go with it. The seasoning on the shrimp was really delicious, though a little on the salty side. 

I'll definitely be back, hopefully I won't be traveling alone next time because there are so many dishes that would be great for sharing!
