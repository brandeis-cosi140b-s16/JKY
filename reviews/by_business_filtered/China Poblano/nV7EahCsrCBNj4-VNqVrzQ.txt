I LOVE LOVE LOVE China Poblano!! The (Mexican) menu is similar to Oyamel in DC and every bit as delicious..add some amazing Chinese food. The ceviche is my absolute favorite!! Nothing compares--the crispy texture of the amaranth with the soft, fresh fish is a force to be reckoned with. I love the cocktails--Lychee is the best one!! The pork tacos are amazing. The Kao Lao Lao noodles, with dragon sauce, are my favorite item on the menu...aside from the ceviche. The service never disappoints. The servers know and love the menu. I absolutely love China Poblano and I will continue to make a stop on every visit to Vegas!
