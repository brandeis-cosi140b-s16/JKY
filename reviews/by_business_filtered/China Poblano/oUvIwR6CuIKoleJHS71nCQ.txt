I was fortunate enough to stumble upon this gem, located in The Cosmopolitan, the last time I was in Las Vegas. Let me be clear, this hotel has an amazing array of food and has not led me wrong yet. So it was by no surprise that when we decided to try China Poblano, we were not disappointed. Little did we know we were in for a culinary adventure.
