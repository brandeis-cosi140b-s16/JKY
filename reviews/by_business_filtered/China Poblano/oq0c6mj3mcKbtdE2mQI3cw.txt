Literally the worst restaurant my friends and I have ever had. Dim sum sucks. The Asian soups were totally bland and the tacos were only decent at best. If you crave Mexican food, might as well go to Taco Bell and save your $$$$$$$$$$. For all of its high prices, you would think it's good or at least edible, but it's not even worth trying. RUN!!!!!!!!!!!


Note: this review was only for the food since the service didn't even worth any star either. But it is also worth mentioning the service was slow, inattentive, and the restaurant wasn't even busy on a Wednesday night.
