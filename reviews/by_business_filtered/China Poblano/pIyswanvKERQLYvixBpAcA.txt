Oh my, Chinese and Mexican fusion...I should have thought of that earlier. Despite how different the 2 cuisines might look, they have a lot of similarities.

We started with some drinks. I had the "salt air" margarita -- and oh my. This works a lot better than salt around the rim because you can just get a mouthful of the salt while drinking. The undesired effect is that you might get a "milk mustache" after you drink it, but hey, it's cute, right? Definitely a must-try if you like margaritas.

The food here is served in small plates, so it's a good idea to share everything so you get to try a bunch of stuff. We ordered quite a few things to share, and some of them, unfortunately, were on the saltier side (smoking chef?), but other than that everything tasted good.

Of all the things, I recommend trying the siu mai (thin skin, delicious pork), the chile en nogata (the walnut cream really made the dish) and the lamb potstickers (it's got that crispy lace which is oh so hard to make!). They have a few items with the Shirley Lee family XO sauce, but I'm not a fan of that...I prefer other brands' XO sauce much better. If you like handmade noodles, you might want to try them here too -- while they're not the best I've had, they were hearty and rustic, and will surely win a few hearts.

Overall, it's a very interesting place where you can get the best of both worlds. When you're surrounded by all different sorts of restaurants in Vegas, it's nice to see something different.
