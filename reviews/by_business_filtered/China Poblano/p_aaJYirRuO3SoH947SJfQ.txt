Usually I read lots of reviews before eating anywhere, but seeing as we were on vacation, my wife and I took a risk and went into China Poblano blind.  Good thing, because had I trusted Yelp's 3-star review, I might have missed out on a memorable meal.

Trendy and quirky beyond belief, this restaurant exudes cool (or hipster, depending on your view, but I took it as cool).  It has booths and community tables, and the dishes are all small plates from Mexican and Chinese cuisine... not much fusion, but it's nice to mix and match.  My wife and I shared chips and salsa, with hot, fresh chips and a smoky chipotle salsa with just the right amount of kick.  I got a carnitas taco, which was succulent and had homemade pork rinds on top.  My wife liked her barbacoa taco as well.

For our "main courses" (although remember, it's small plates, so that doesn't really apply), I had the lemon tree shrimp, which was unbelievably good.  The shrimp tasted fresh, and the sauce was redolent with black pepper and celery, and the occasional chunk of citrus fruit.  My wife had the Beijing glass, a noodle dish that was not to my taste, but it looked beautiful, with all the components (noodles and tons of different Asian veggies) sectioned out in the bowl, waiting to be mixed.  She loved it.

Some people are complaining about the size of the dishes.  Well, it's small plates, and you're supposed to order 2-3 items.  The wait staff tells you that.  Our waitress even asked us during lunch if we were satisfied with the amount of food we had ordered -- and we were.  Far too many restaurants go for quantity over quality, but China Poblano serves properly sized meals.  Two or three dishes really should be enough to fill up one person.  If not, I dunno, go to one of the millions of buffets on the Strip instead.  If I'm going to spend $30 on a meal, I'd honestly rather have high-quality food than "all-you-can-eat."
