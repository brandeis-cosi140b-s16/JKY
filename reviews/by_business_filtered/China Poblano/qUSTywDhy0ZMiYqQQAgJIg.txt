Terrific place. It would get 5 stars if it weren't for the incredible noise.  Very loud.  Food is delicious and service is impeccable.  It is basically a tapas Mexican/Chinese restaurant.  Price is fair, but not cheap.  You must absolutely try both sides of the menu (Mex and Chinese) as both offer a variety of different variations on some classics and new twists on the respective cuisine.  They also offer a variety of specials each night. Not for little kids for sure.
