My work group of 5 had a reservation for a Friday afternoon and there was no wait time. I love the color scheme and the fact that everyone spoke to us as we walked in. I ordered Chilaquiles, which had an authentic taste and just the right heat. Two of my co-workers ordered the infamous Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice. I was a little hesitant because I am not a big fan of fried rice, but it was amazing! Very distinct flavors. 

A major advantage to this restaurant is the vegetarian options. The only disadvantage, which has nothing to do with the food is the seating options. Although most people are in Vegas on vacation and wearing casual to club wear, it was a little difficult to get in and out of the bench style seating in a *work appropriate* length dress :(.

On a positive note, our waiter Josue' was very attentive to our needs and made excellent recommendations.
