This place is overrated.  People probably end up eating here because it's located in a newer and trendier hotel. 
Top Ramen tastes better than the soup I ordered, Swallow a Cloud ( Hong Kong wonton/shrimp/pork/bok choy ).  The wontons were the only things I ate.  The noodles were undercooked and did not absorb any flavor from the broth.  It is not worth $17.
The Traditional Sui Mai was delicious.  The price was $13 but it's probably because they were sprinkled edible gold flakes.  I'm sure I wouldn't have tasted any difference.

My friend had a couple of the tacos and said they were pretty good.  Unfortunately, I can't remember which ones.  I think one had carnitas or pork belly (a special).  

I expect to pay a little more for dining in Vegas.. but for not this type of experience.  I will not give the restaurant another try.
