My reason for two stars was based on how excessively greasy the food is. How are steamed Sui mui  dumplings greasy? The  fried spring rolls were  super greasy, but at least we knew that was a possibility since they were fried. I did not expect my mushroom tacos to be dripping grease. Add this to the small portions and high prices mentioned by others and I would suggest you would be better off else where.
