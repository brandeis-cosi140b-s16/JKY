What a rude restaurant. We called and they would not  take a reservation but guaranteed that we would get a table.  We showed up at 10:45pm and we're turned away. After speaking to the manager, he admitted that they were slow, thus they were only serving take out. . That is a pathetic excuse to leave work early. . He offered his phone number so we could get a "Prime"  table "tomorrow." This is not a way to run a business.
