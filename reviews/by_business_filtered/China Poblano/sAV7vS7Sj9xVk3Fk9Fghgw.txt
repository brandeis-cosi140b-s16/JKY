One of my gripes about this place is that's overpriced. I know it's Vegas, but their taco is smaller than my hand. And my hand is tiny! I lifted up my taco and realized it was dripping, so I tilted it to the side and had to wait for the oil to drain. I also shared one of the noodles and it was just a bit average. There was just nothing about the food here that stuck to me. The service was good though. The server was patient with the group of girls and accommodating to our checks. Would I come here again? If I didn't want to leave my hotel, yes.
