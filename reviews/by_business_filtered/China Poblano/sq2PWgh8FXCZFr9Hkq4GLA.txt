I must have amnesia because I really don't know why I keep coming back here. My first time was when it first opened a few years ago, and I believe I have a review for "the worst thing I've ever eaten" see: beef tendon taco w/ bad oyster. About a year and a half ago I went back, and was again taken aback by the incredibly mediocre food and astronomical prices. 

A few weeks ago a friend and I were prowling the town, looking for a fun spot to grab a bite before we headed to Drais for Chromeo (woo!), and she'd never been, and again, I guess I blacked out momentarily from hunger, because I was like "okay! let's go here!". WRONG. It was empty per usual... even though it was 9pm on a Friday night. We each ordered a blood orange margarita at $15 a pop, and they didn't even have the courtesy to fill them to top of the glass. We split the queso fundido, and there was nothing fun about it. It was a glop of starchy melted cheese. A 5 year old could make it by literally putting a block of monterey jack in the microwave. A very expensive block of $10 cheese. 

I had the special, a pork belly taco w/ pineapple at $4 which was nothing special at all, and the Dan Dan Mian Noodles for $13 which were spicy, excessively sweet, and quite glue-y. She had a bowl of noodles as well, and somehow our bill came to almost $100 w/ tip. WHAT. 

Jose Andres- what are you doing. You are amazing, Jaleo is amazing (the one in DC is 10x better), Bazaar is amazing, this restaurant is a stain on your reputation. The only pros are the service, which is always great, the manager did come over to see how things were, and we said great, because it's not her fault the food sucks. The servers are attentive as well. The first time I was there I saw Mario Batali eating in the back in his famous orange crocs, so I suppose that's cool. All this experience did was remind me why I avoid strip celebrity-name restaurants.
