I am giving a 2 star rating only because for the price I could've eaten much better.  The 20 vegetable fried rice was delicious but other than than the $6 2 bite tacos were average.  The $16 dumplings (4 of them) were average and everything else was just ok.  For 4 adults and 2 kids we spent $198 and left hungry.  Our server was great and that is the only reason I didn't leave or complain.  Don't waste your time here unless you are looking to drop a couple hundred and leave hungry...
