We went to the Cosmo for a concert and thought a quick snack would be good before drinking the rest of the night.  The only restaurant without a long wait was China Poblano and while it wasn't our first choice, we weren't disappointed!  In fact, we were pleasantly surprised.

The restaurant is very quirky in design with numerous tapas style dishes of Asian and Mexican influences.  They had cocktails from both ends of the globe, our cocktail of choice was the Singapore Sling (highly recommended) and we enjoyed some dishes from both origins.  Cochinita tacos were delicious, as were the Lemon Tree Shrimp.  All-in-all, a bit pricey for the amount of food you get, but it was expected.  After-all, we were at the Cosmo.
