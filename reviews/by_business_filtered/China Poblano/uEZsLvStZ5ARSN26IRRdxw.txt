2.5 stars.  I'll round it up due to good service.

I've been here a few times.  It's kind of hit or miss for me.  It's not Chinese-Mexican fusion.  It's half chinese food and half mexican food.  The two don't really flow together for me.

I must say, though, that the salt foam margaritas are genius.  The tuna tartare in quinoa is fantastic.  The tacos are good but SO DAMNED EXPENSIVE!  A three inch tortilla with 2 knobs of lobster knuckle meat for 10 bucks?!?!?  No bueno.  Likewise the barbacoa tacos are tiny and 4.50 a pop.  Wow.  The tacos were darn good tho for the most part.
