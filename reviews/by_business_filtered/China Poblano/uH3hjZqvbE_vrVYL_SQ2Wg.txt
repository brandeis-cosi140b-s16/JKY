Well stopped to get a quick bite while the room was being cleaned. We got the quesa funding and the chips and salsa. The chips were incredible, salsa was a little sweet, and the cheese on the corn tortillas were slightly greasy but full of flavor. Pretty price for the amount you get, but these appetizers are good for about two people.
