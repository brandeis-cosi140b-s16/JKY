Stumbled upon this restaurant while looking for something new on the strip. We succeeded!  First, the decor is pretty funky....a good fusion of Mexican and Asian crafts and art. I loved the "staircase" waiting area with cushions and the metallic art on the walls of lizards and ancient masks.  The food wasn't the best I've had but definitely hit the spot. Some dishes were top notch: Beijing glass noodles, twenty vegetable fried rice (little salty).  Others were good: Carnitas tacos and Lucky 8 Sui Mai. The "when pigs fly" steam buns were so-so, at least when compared to traditional dim sum.  I was not a big fan of the Dan Dan noodles which are one of my favorite dishes when traveling in China.  Service was excellent...at least our waitress...even though we got there right before the kitchen closed we never felt rushed.  Bottom line, don't come here expecting traditional Chinese dim sum, but you will get a good meal if you choose wisely from the menu.  Ask your server for suggestions...but beware of the "upsell". I would definitely go back!
