Great atmosphere and a really fun blend of Mexican and Chinese. Interesting concept and many of the dishes seemed quite inspired. Food portions are small and quite expensive. The lotus chips were good, the eggplant and seta taco was okay, but the vegetable friend rice was top notch. 

We had a great waitress too, who was really friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. She was bit robotic in her run down of the menu (she gave the same exact speech to the party next to us 5 minutes later), but was attentive and gave us good recommendations. The food also comes out fast, which is a plus.
