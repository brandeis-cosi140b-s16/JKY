Ate at China Poblano when I was in Vegas last week and hadn't looked at any Yelp reviews prior. I'm surprised to find it only has 3 stars on here. I thought it was AMAZING. Most importanly, it was priced appropriately, unlike so many places in Vegas.

Some notes:

-The atmosphere was fun (decor is amazing!)
-Service was great
-Food was creative and delicious
-A few dishes were a miss (a noodle soup with the word "ugly" in the name), but most were spot on. 
-Mexican food was slightly better than the Chinese, but that makes sense given Jose's backgound. 
-The salt-air margaritas are genius.
