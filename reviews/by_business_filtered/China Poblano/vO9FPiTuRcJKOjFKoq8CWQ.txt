Looking at the menu was upsetting. 

I think it set the mood all wrong. 
$5 for ONE taco
$8 for FRENCH FRIES the size of an in n out fries.
$12 for a bowl of SOUP/POSOLE


Then we were like screw it we are hungry so we are just going to order. The restaurant is located in Cosmo on the second floor I believe. It's casual but pricey. Half the restaurant is Asian cuisine and the other half is Mexican. We came in cause it looked casual and the ambience was nice and colorful casual informal unlike many of the other eateries in Cosmo. 

Food was average not that great for my expectations of a $5 taco and $8 fries.
French fries were just whatever in a small basket with a mole taste like soy sauce dipping sauce. We asked for ketchup. NO KETCHUP?? But you serve fries I just don't understand. 

Soup was all right. Posole. Usually I like posole but this one was Okay. Had to add a bunch of limes. 

The Hawaiian heart of Palm salad was unique. My mom liked it cause she has never had it. 

Overall would not come back again. 
Only nice thing was that the man gave us a disclaimer that everything was tapas style. 

I love tapas but here is not the place to eat when you're hungry and want good food worth your buck.
