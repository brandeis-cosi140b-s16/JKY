A friend and I were looking around The Cosmo for a food court, and we thought we walked into one when entering China Poblano.

Boy, were we wrong.

We were immediately greeted by a very enthusiastic host who was knowledgeable of pretty much the whole menu.  He recommended things like ceviche, the house fried rice (which apparently is internationally recognized) and some various kinds of dim sum.

To put it very plainly, China Poblano is a tapas bar and restaurant that specializes in both Chinese and Mexican finger food.

The thing is everything here is a bit pricey.

That being said, I elected to just get some chips, guac, and salsa.  I'm normally pretty picky with my guacamole, but I must say that it was probably the best green stuff I've ever had that I didn't make myself.  That says a lot.  The chips were fresh and the salsa added a nice spicy kick.

My friend ordered a dim sum sampler that included two pieces each of whatever dumplings they had, which was also pretty good.

Overall, while we were disappointed that we'd be spending a whole lot more than we would at the food court, we walked out of the eatery pleasantly surprised.  I'll definitely be back to try that fried rice the host was talking about.
