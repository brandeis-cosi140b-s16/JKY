Poor guys, it looked like everyone were under a lot of pressure. The service times were horrible. 
Though we had 5 different people bring out food to us, it felt like they were understaffed or the manager just didnt have the experience to get everything right though it looked like they were working their asses off. 

Some of the food didnt even taste that great, I didnt like my mushroom noodles and could eat only half of it. 

They should stop making it look or feel like a classy restaurant and just deliver tasty food faster, just like they try to make it look. ( Street style chinese and mexican food )
