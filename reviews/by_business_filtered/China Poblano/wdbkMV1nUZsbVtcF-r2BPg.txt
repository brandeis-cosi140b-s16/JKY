Really wonderful, adventurous casual dining on the strip.  

While I am not a fan of the Cosmopolitan's brand of chrome and disco decorating, I was immediately taken with the bright colors and fusion of elements in the China Poblano Restaurant.  Immediately one becomes aware of two contrasting cuisines.  As you enter there are two bar areas where diners can watch various food preparations.  One side is devoted to Mexican food and the other to Chinese food.  

This dichotomy is reflected in the menu as well which is divided up largely by types of dishes and the two cuisines.  A closer look shows a comingling of cuisines within though.  

The 20 vegetable vegetable fried rice was so yummy.  As full of vegetables as its name suggests.  The Lamb pot stickers were served under a dome of incredibly thin and delicate pastry.  There was the hint of cumin lurking around the dish that was a beautiful almost haunting harmony with the delicious pot stickers.  One of my favorite dishes while I was in Vegas!

We also enjoyed the guacamole and Golden Pigs (fried AND steamed pork dumplings that were served with a sweet condensed milk sauce, a wonderful balance between sweet and salty flavors).

Finally a Jericalla which was described as an Oaxacan chocolate custard with  passion fruit and chocolate sorbet.  This was an amazingly light and lovely dish.  Beautifully layered as a parfait with solid chocolate in with the creamy elements and contrasting in texture.  Just an amazing combination of tangy fruitiness and deep chocolate flavor.  Really worthwhile.

While this is slightly expensive for casual dining, the quality of ingredients, thoughtful food combinations, beautiful presentations and wonderful service made it a terrific choice for us.  I will brave the overstuffed glamor of the Cosmopolitan for a repeat visit.
