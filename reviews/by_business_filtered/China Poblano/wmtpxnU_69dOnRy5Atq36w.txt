I really should have read the reviews before we stopped by. The food was not bad, but it was not great either. Definitely overpriced for what we got. We tried the When Pigs Fly pork buns, the Lucky 6 Siu Mai, the Don't Be Jealous hot and sour soup, and the Shrimp Mojo with an order of homemade tortillas. The only items worth eating were the shrimp and the hot and sour soup. We made little shrimp tacos and it was actually tasty. The pork buns weren't too bad either. I ended up coming back to LA and ordered real dim sum since my experience here was so lackluster. The restaurant was confusing and I was not feeling the concept. I would honestly skip this place. There are so many better restaurants out there that I would not waste my calories here. Not like I have been counting or anything, because I really have not. The staff was attentive though..
