The dishes were surprisingly small so we ended up ordering quite a few. Pricey, but nothing unusual for Vegas. I didn't find anything really memorable. The food was okay. None of us were sure what to order, so we went with the waiter's suggestions.

The meal started off great. The chips and house made guacamole were really good. I couldn't stop eating the chips. Sodium was a absolute treat tonight. I could definitely taste all this good stuff.

Each of the dishes, served tapas style, was definitely small and probably meant to be shared. I had the six dishes below. Most of them lacked flavor. Maybe it was the chef's off night. The best dishes though were definitely the Shrimp Mojo and the Gan Pung Ji chicken wings.

The Shrimp Mojo - Not the most appealing to look at, but each piece was delectable. We should of just ordered more of this.

Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice - At the very least, taste like something, please!

Dan Dan Mian - What exactly am I eating? There's so little pork that I only taste wheaty noodles and peanut sauce.

Chicken Ji Song - This looked like it was going to be good, if only we were able to find where the chef had hidden all the flavor.

Bistec con Mole Amarillo y Hongos - The grilled hanger steak, another dish that looked great, but alas, it too suffered from blanditis.

The Gan Pung Ji chicken wings - The only other dish worth ordering. So tasty...and so spicy too.

Service was excellent. Our waiter was attentive, did his best with the suggestions and came back often to ask if everything was okay.

Probably a place to visit for something out of the ordinary. It's a fusion place after all, but I wouldn't come hungry. This place didn't really hit the spot. At least you'll have room for late night eats!
