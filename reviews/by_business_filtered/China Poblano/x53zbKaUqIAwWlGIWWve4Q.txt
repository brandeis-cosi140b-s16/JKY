Really disappointed by this restaurant. Wallpaper was dirty, full of tears, and peeling away from the wall. Food was overly salty and greasy. The shrimp gyoza were served in a puddle of water without any sort of presentation or flavor for that matter (How do you fuck up a shrimp dumpling?!). An 8 oz can of Coke will set you back $5 (no refills).  Value is not a term to describe this restaurant. C-, fortunately our only bad meal in Vegas.
