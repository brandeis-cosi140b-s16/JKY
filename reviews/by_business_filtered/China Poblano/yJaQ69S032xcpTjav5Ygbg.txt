I am pretty surprised by the negative reviews because I had a terrific experience at China Poblano.  Maybe it's because I took a lot of the waiter's recommendations, but every dish I ordered was at hit.  (And lest you think, he was trying to pad the bill, I told him I was torn between two dishes and he steered me towards the less-expensive one.)

I would highly recommend the Kao Lao Lao, which are described as steamed noodles, but were more like rolled tortilla strips served with a flavorful dipping sauce, and the carnitas taco, with tender meat and a wonderful contrast of textures with its crispy toppings.

I also had the lamb pot stickers, which were beautifully presented (although perhaps a little greasy) and the dancing eggplant, which was roasted until creamy.

The service was great and the decor is very cute.  Everything was all really flavorful and beautiful on the plate.  I look forward to returning.
