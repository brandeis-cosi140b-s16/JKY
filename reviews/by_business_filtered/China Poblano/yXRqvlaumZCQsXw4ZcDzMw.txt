So when I heard Chinese Mexican fusion I expected something different than what it was. However, I wasn't disappointed when I saw the menu. It's broken up into Mexican style dishes and Chinese style dishes. Our server said it was similar to a "tapas" place with small plates that were meant to be shared, or to order two plates per person for a full meal. I ordered the Mexican asparagus and the Chinese Dancing Eggplant. The asparagus was amazing and I devoured all of it. Honestly would have been okay with just that because it was a pretty decent portion. The eggplant wasn't really what I expected. It's covered in a soy sauce glaze and these fish flakes (I forget the actual name, but they smell and taste really fishy). The eggplant was not the texture I expected. Was hoping for something I would have to chew rather than something that just slid down my throat. The taste was okay but I couldn't do the slimy-ish texture. We had them bring chips and salsa for the table and both were really good. I ordered the classic margarita and was not disappointed. If I ever make it back I really want to try the margarita flight, as a friend did and said it was amazing. Our server was great, answered all of our questions and made some great recommendations around the table that were raved about. He had no trouble dealing with the 14 rambunctious girls there for a bachelorette party and all of our food came out fairly quickly!

My gripe with this place is that even though it seems like there are a lot of choices, I had a tough time finding something to order other than my asparagus (which I was really excited about). I wish I would have ordered the tacos because they looked really good. A friend had the dan dan and said it was pretty spicy, but lost ordered off the Mexican portion of the menu.
