Loved it. Chinese and Mexican tapas. I would give it 5 stars but the prices for drinks    are a bit much. $18.00 for a gin and tonic and $15.00 for a margarita. Yes, the drinks were good but not that good. Service was great,nice, attentive and cleared empty plates quickly. Onto the food. We had the following, sorry don't remember specific names of things. 
1. Taco - yummy and authentic
2. Spring rolls- a bit greasy but delicious
3. Odon noodles- very spicy
4. Dumplings- very good
5. 20 vegetable fried rice- omg it's a must try and add beef or chicken for more deliciousness. 

So these 5 items are plenty for two people. This and the 2 drinks= $ 117.00 before tip

Will I back.....you betcha!
