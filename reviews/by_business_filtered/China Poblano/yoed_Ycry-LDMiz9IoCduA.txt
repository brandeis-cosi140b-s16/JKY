Great concept for a restaurant; however, we were not impressed. Came here with a group of 4 and each of us were disappointed with the variety of food we ordered. We didn't finish any dish, aside from the traditional Siu Mai and left the restaurant still hungry. 
Go to Holsteins instead.. It's right next door!
