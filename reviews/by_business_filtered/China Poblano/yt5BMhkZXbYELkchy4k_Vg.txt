The people working there are REALLY nice! but the food sucks, We got the monk..something, don't be jealous, the mongolian beef. 

The mongolian beef with lettuce looked like dog food, actually dog food looks better.
a few pieces of diced beef (the size of half a penny) thrown on lettuce. Bland and overpriced.

My friend didn't finish her monk noodle soup. Bland and overpriced.

The hot and sour soup is GOOD.
