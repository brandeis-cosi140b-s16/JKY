Never tried any Jose Andrew resteraunts but I personally thought this concept was a stretch. If it is a fusion concept, I don't think they succeeded successfully. I had one taco. And it was below average. That's all I ordered. Nothing on the menu seemed appealing....the whole wheat and oat noodles threw me off. Cold noodles never sound appealing either. The presentation of the tacos was cool.
