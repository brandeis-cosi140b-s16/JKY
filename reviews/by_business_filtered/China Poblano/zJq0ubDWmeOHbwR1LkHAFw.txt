Reservation tip--we called for a table and were told they were booked.  When I went online to OpenTable, I was able to secure a reservation which was promptly honored, no questions asked.  So if you're having a hard time getting a table, it's worth trying reserving in another way.

Not much I can say about the great food and service that others have not.  We did the tasting menu as it turned into a great deal--a ton of food, very reasonably priced (especially for Vegas!) and it saved us from having to narrow down all the different choices on the broad menu.  All the greatness that we've come to expect from Jose.
