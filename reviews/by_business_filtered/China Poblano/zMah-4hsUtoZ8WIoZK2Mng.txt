Great spot for a casual lunch, especially if you're staying at The Cosmopolitan. We ate in our bathing suits and I didn't feel judged. My friends and I ordered our own tacos, which we all enjoyed, but we also split a few other dishes. The twenty-vegetable fried rice is a must... definitely one of their signature dishes. Great mix of Chinese- and Mexican-inspired small plates. All perfect for sharing (tacos aside... get your own). Good drinks, too.
