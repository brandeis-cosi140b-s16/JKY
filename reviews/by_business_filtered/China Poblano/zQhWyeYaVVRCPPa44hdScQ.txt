Loved it... 

Tacos were amazballs, fruit salad was tasty and very cool looking, noodles were very good... uh.. and  I can't remember what else I had but that was good too... Hey I was in vegas give me a break.

For a dude that loves mexican food and chinese food like me it doesn't get much better than this. Jose Andres, the homie, did it right with this one. 

Yea it's not cheap, and yea it's small plates, but yea it's pretty damn good. You're in vegas, relax, enjoy it and stop being so cheap... Or go find a strip mall with a Panda Express and a Roberto's and enjoy that with your malt liquor. PS - everyone that is complaining about price, realize what hotel you are in. Sorry to inform you but they tore down the Boardwalk Casino about 6 year ago to build this gem; it ain't coming back.
