Chino is the best most unique food joint in the Phoenix area.  I was turned onto it over 10 years ago when I used to golf at the local muni track right across the street.  I now live further away but still eat there every time I'm in the area.

My favorite combo:
1.  jerk chicken
2. chili relleno
refried beans
