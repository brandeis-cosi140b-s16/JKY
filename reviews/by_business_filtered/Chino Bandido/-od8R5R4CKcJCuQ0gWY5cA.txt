After watching Guy Fieri on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives review of Chino Bandido i decided to give it a try. On the show the owner said you can make something like  20 thousand different combinations. Wow! Sounds great right? 
To begin this multi-cultural journey I decided to look at their menu online where they have a tutorial to learn how to order. Easy enough. As I spouted out my order "can I get a combination 8, 9B JFR; BLK" I realized I had no clue what I was about to get myself into.  

The combination of all of the flavors was just odd. I really really wanted to like it, but in the end it was just a heap of odd-tasting food that just didn't work. I will give it to them for doing something new, but be forewarned the jerk chicken will light your face on fire!
