Close your eyes. Now imagine a dish that's equal parts Chinese and Mexican with a bit of Caribbean jerk thrown in...got it? Probably not, because these flavors seem like they would be the craziest of combinations. Well, over at Chino Bandido they have done just that, and very successfully might I add. 
This is not a first visit review- I have been stopping into Chino's for lunches for about four years now so this is more of a collective critique. Even though the menu consists of pictures and explanations it can still be a little daunting to a first timer so don't be afraid to let the cashier know that you are on your maiden voyage, they will walk you through the basics and even have you taste a few things so you don't get in over your head spice-wise. Aside from a variety of items on the menu, anything can be served "as is", as a burrito, or quesadilla and they come with your choice of beans (Jamaican style black or chorro) and rice (chicken, pork, jerk or white) so needless to say the combinations are endless. Touching on all items would make for way longer of a review than anyone would ever read so I'll just hit a few of my fav's. First off is the Jade red chicken- this is the house favorite and one of mine as well, think Mexican version of sweet and sour chicken but better. Jerk chicken- now beware, this flavorful version packs a deceiving punch but its worth it if you're a jerk fan. The emerald chicken is a surprisingly fresh green onion and ginger dish that seems to be on the lighter side of the mostly dense menu. There are also the chicken or pork carnitas which always seem to be extremely juicy and work great in a quesadilla or solo. No desert necessary every dish comes with a fresh made snickerdoodle. The staff is always as friendly as can be and I'm not sure you can find a larger portion for your buck. For the freshest go during prime lunch or dinner hours as I've found they sometimes let items sit a bit through the off peak.
