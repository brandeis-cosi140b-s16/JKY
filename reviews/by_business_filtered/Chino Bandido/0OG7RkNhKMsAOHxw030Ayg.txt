My girlfriend and I saw Chino Bandido on Diners Drive-ins & Dives and decided to check it out while visiting Phoenix last weekend. What a disappointment!  Erik T. and Roland W. are on-the-money with their reviews. While the employees were nice and very helpful with their overly complicated ordering process, the place was dirty and it took way too long to get our food. We thought the refried beans and fried rice were good but my machaca was bone-dry and my girl's gringo chicken and emerald chicken were absolutely flavorless. The egg foo yung was just OK.  

We'd have been better off going to Taco Bell.  Way over-hyped.
