My family and I have been coming to Chinos for close to 15 years now and it seems to me that ever since it was featured on DDD that prices have gone up and portions have gone down. 

I usually pass on the rice and ask for a double order of beans. This passed visit, my wife ordered a small side of beans with her quesadilla. They put my double order of beans in a big styrofoam container and only filled it up to the small beans container level. I compared the two and realized I got duped. Jade red chicken is still delicious but the portions look like more of a kids meal. My machaca burrito looked like something from Taco Bells value meal. 

Foods good but that value isn't there anymore. We as a family are probably going to find a new tradition to eat at. It's always sad to see a place my family has been eating for this long to go this far downhill.
