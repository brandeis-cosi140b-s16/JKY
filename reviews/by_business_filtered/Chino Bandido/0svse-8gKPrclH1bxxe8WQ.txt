The first thing I thought of when I heard of Chino Bandido nearly 10 years ago was that Chinese-Mexican food does not seem like a good mix.  Boy was I incorrect about that, it is definitely an experience.  I cannot get enough Jade Red Chicken and Black Beans, they are the two things I constantly crave from Chino's.  

I have tried everything on the menu (they give you samples if you've never been there before), and I eat other things there often, but I ALWAYS get the Jade Red Chicken.  I love how you can make any entree into a quesadilla or burrito.  The place is kind of a dive, but that adds to its charm.  Plus, you and a group of friends can have a play a rousing game of Jenga while waiting for your food, it's the makings of a fun time.  

I understand that this place is not for everybody, but I would say that you should give a try and see what you think, it just might surprise you.

Don't forget the snicker-doodles.
