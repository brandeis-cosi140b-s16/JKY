I ate here for the first time today.  The guy at the counter asked me if it was my first time there, and when I explained that it was, he took me to the side and let me sample 6 items off of the menu.  He also explained how to order (which allows you to pick from 14 different meats and gives you the option of eatting them over rice, in a burrito, or in a quesadilla--all for the same cost). You also have the choice between black beans and refried beans.  And you have the choice of 4 different types of fried rice. Finally the combos come with a free cookie. 

I ordered a combo with a carnitas burrito, red jade chicken over jerk fried rice, refried beans, and an oatmeal cookie.  The red jade chicken really stands out here, and there is no question why it is the most popular item on the menu.  The caritas were good as well as the rice.  The beans were okay but nothing spectacular.  Finally, the oatmeal cookie was surprising delicious.

While I've had better food, this place definitely gives you a bang for your buck (my entire meal with a drink was about 10 dollars).  The employees were also very nice.  While this was my first visit, it will not be my last.
