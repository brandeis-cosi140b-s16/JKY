I haven't been to this in over 2 years (due to moving out of state) but someone mentioned it earlier today and I haven't stopped thinking about it. 

I recall always getting a carnitas quesadilla and jade red chicken lunch special. The black beans are OUT OF THIS WORLD. I tried many times to recreate them but have been unsuccessful every time.

If you have questioned this place - stop it and go to it. Yeah it's in a dirty ass strip mall but who cares. It's worth it.
