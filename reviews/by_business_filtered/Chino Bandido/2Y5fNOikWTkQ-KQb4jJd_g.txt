I love Asian fusion foods! I finally got to try Chino Bandido after hearing about it years ago and seeing it featured on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives.

I didn't have high expectations for this place, and it was a good thing I didn't. The concept is great, because I've had bomb Asian-Mexican fusion cuisines.  But Chino Bandido may have been lacked in authentic flavor for me. I got the Jen Red Pork + Chile Relleno Combo with Jerk Fried Rice and Black Beans.  It wasn't bad, but I felt that it could have been better.  The meat was a little too greasy for me. 

2.5 stars because I've had much better, but wouldn't oppose to coming back here.  Customer service was decent so I'd like to round up for that.  Also got free Snickerdoodle cookies with our orders.  How can you not like that?
