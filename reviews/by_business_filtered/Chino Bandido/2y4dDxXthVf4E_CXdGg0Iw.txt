After all the hype, went for a girl's night out.  Food was OK, not what I thought of as outstanding.  They only had plastic forks and knives and I couldn't cut my fried chile relleno with it.  

Food was OK, but my friend's dish was too spicey.  I  have had better food elsewhere, didn't think the Chinese/Mexican combo was all that noticeable.

I also think if they invested in some nice furniture (instead of plastic chairs) and silverware it might be more appealing.
