I think my expectations for this place was too high. I had tried some samples, like the jerk fried rice, which I thought was bland. But with all the yelp reviews raving about the jerk fried rice, I assumed maybe the sample I was given was just off target but a larger sample of the food would be more flavorful. I was wrong. The jerk fried rice was nothing to brag about it. It tasted like rice with a little bit of spice.

The Jade chicken was actually good and had a nice spiciness to it.  If I were to visit this place again, I would order the Jade chicken again.

I really wanted some vegetables with my meal, like some beef and broccoli, but all they had was shredded lettuce. I was very disappointed and I think all the boring lettuce ruined my meal, worse than the jerk fried rice.

In my opinion, the food here was full of sodium.  I was extremely thirsty after my meal and had a slight headache after leaving here. I'm guessing this place might use MSG. Not good.

I think the thing that tasted the best was the free snicker doodle cookie that came with the meal. That was good.

I was impressed that the cashier area was very high tech because everything was processed on iPads. Unfortunately I would rather be more impressed with the food than how they charge my credit card.
