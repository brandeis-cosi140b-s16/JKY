Sorry we were so looking forward to eating here as we have visited their other location & loved the food, unfortunately after a 40 min wait & still no food we along with other patrons asked for a refund & left. Not sure what's going on here as we watched the kitchen help through the window & they appeared untrained confused & clueless. Not sure if the chef quit & they were trying to improvise but I've never had to leave a restaurant hungry. So sad
