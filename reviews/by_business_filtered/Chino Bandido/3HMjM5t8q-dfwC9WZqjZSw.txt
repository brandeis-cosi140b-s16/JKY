I absolutely like this fusion.  Definitely visit their website to learn how to order if you can in advance if not the service is definitely friendly.  If you walk in for your first time ask for a sample, they will give you sample taste for their most popular items.  I fell in love with the red jade chicken and the carnitas.  I prefer the pork fried rice.  I don't get my stuff in a burrito nor a quesadilla because i feel you get more meat if you order outside a tortilla.  I drove from downtown here twice in 2 weeks just to eat here and once from Laveen.  Definitely worth it in my opinion.
