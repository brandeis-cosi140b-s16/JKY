I don't think there is anything worse about this place than it's location. When a bigger landmark is a sign next door that says "Wide Shoes" you are in geographical hell. This place is rarely busy but has tons of space and lots of potential. I have eaten there a bunch and love it. The jerk rice is killer. (someone here totally dissed it saying the only spice in it was pepper...umm...no) You really should try it and you will see. The combinations I have found to be my favorite are jade red chicken or sweet roasted pork in a quesadilla. Those are combinations of flavors that you would never expect to be that good. 

In my opinion they could make some changes and be making 10 times the money. 
#1. Get a normal freakin menu. You can't go this place and say I will have a number six with a large soft drink. None of us want to work or do much thinking to order our food. They want to do their sample demonstrations and they usually have time since NOBODY GOES THERE. I wish they would even have the guts to pilot a simplified menu--I think they would be shocked at how much more business they would get. 
#2 Get a few conventional items on the menu i.e. Nachos or chips and salsa or something that is a good snacky kind of food. 
#3 Come up with a signature item or two and give them original names rather than all of the all-menu-items-are-equal approach. 

It is worth checking out if you have not been there and I enjoy eating there still. It's a bit cafeteria/industrial warehouseish with not much to check out other than the statue of the panda in a sombrero.
