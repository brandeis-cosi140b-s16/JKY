I'll spare you from having to read more comments about how weird or cool the ethnic combinations are. It's a wonderful concept and I'm sure you all get it by now, so shall we just move along?

To start, the guys behind the counter (upon finding out it's your first time there) will give you a good amount of samples for you to try. I appreciated that.

For the most part, the items were pretty flavorful. And having the option of eating it on its own, in a quesadilla, or a burrito made it that much more fun.

I had the Jade Red Chicken (by itself) and the Chili Relleno in a quesadilla. And on the side, I had chicken fried rice and jerk fried rice. No complaints about any of those things.

If I lived in the area (or less than a 5 hour drive away), I'd eat here every once in a while as my comfort food since I love Chinese and Mexican food.
