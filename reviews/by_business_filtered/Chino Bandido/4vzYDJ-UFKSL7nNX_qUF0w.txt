To say I don't get the appeal of Chino Bandido would be an understatement.

I don't really need to say anything about this place...just look at the picture above! That's what the food looks like!  Need I really say more?

Well, I'm going to:

OK, so they serve both Mexican and Chinese food. SO WHAT? It's not even like they serve a hybrid of Mexican and Chinese food. You know, if they served Kung Pao enchiladas, that might be interesting, but this is just Chinese food and Mexican food next to eachother in the same aluminum takeout bowl (yes, even if you'e not taking out). Oh, and by the way, did I mention it's SHITTY Chinese and Mexican food. 

That being said, if you love Panda Express, you might like the Chinese food at Chino Bandido. If you like super-over-fried, heartburn-enducing flavorless cardboard, you might like their Mexican food. And If you like using plastic silverware to try and cut through said cardboard as it sits in said aluminum take-out bowl while countless shirtless 10-year-olds drool over every dirty inch of your favorite restaurant, then this might just be your favorite restaurant.

On the plus side, they give you a free cookie.
