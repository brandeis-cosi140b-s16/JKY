First time at Chino Bandito. Arrived at 5:30 on a Thursday evening and only 12 diners. Hmm. 

I ordered Pollo Diablo, Jen Red Pork, Black Beans and Jerk Fried Rice. All items were presented in bite-sized portions. They were fresh but lacked a lot of pizazz that I'd been hearing about. The pollo Diablo was supposed to be the hottest item out there. It was medium heat. I think it needed sauce cuz it seemed more like chicken nuggets with some spice to me. 

The Jen Red was good but, again, not very saucy. The rice was okay.  Just not much flavor exuding from it. The beans were pretty awful. They were runny and tasted canned. 

The cookie on the side was a nice touch. 

Not sure if I'll be back. It's not in a great location, the decor is despicable (card tables, plastic chairs, dirty floor and snapshots of kids for art) and an annoying TV. I felt like I was in school, eating a school lunch. 

These guys need to get a clue that folks want ambiance with their meal, not crap they thought was cute when they were young.
