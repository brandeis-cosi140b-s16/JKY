I have been a fan of Chino for a few years now, right before they hit the popularity of DDD.  

If you are looking for a total DDD experience in the Phoenix area, this is the place.  The food is absolutely incredible and the flavors it offers is something totally unique to this establishment that infused Caribbean, Mexican and Chinese flavors into some tasty dishes. 

There is a warning, this is not a place for the pretentious or anyone wanting a fine dining experience, this is DDD and if you stay to eat it will be off of cheap folding tables and inexpensive chairs.  At Chino, it is all about the food.  

One concern is that I have seen a bit of a decline in the quality and portions of the food over the past two years.  Quite frankly I would pay more to ensure that both quality and portions return to what I experienced before this place became popular.
