I loved there food the chinese food was authentic.. This was down the street from the hotel I was staying at for business. It absolutely the best fusion chinese and mexican food I had ever tasted.. 

I had ordered the Jamican jerk rice with ginger chicken and chop suey quesedilla.. I wish they had one where I live.. 

I can see why Diners and Drive In's give this place such a good rating it is awesome :)
