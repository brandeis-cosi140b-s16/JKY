I wonder what samples Jan D received? If they had given me samples, it would have saved me $8.74 because I would have run out the door right after the first bite.

I think the place everyone else ate at, has been replaced and I found myself at the new Chino Bandido, a shit dump that serves food that tastes worse than if a Panda Express threw up on Del Taco. I should have known this would be a disaster if Guy Fieri has been here. When is his 15 minutes up? Every time I go somewhere that Guy Fieri has featured on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives, it always turns out to be one of the worst places I have ever been. Guy Fieri knows as much about food as McDonalds does. First, I didn't even get what I ordered, They make a huge deal about how to order, how about getting the order right? What they gave me couldn't have been more opposite to what I ordered. I ordered black beans and plain fried rice. They gave me refried beans and pork fried rice, or some fried rice that was contaminated with a pseudo disgusting meat-like product. I ordered a jade red burrito, they gave me something with slimy pork inside, and I asked for a veggie quesadilla, they gave me a quesadilla with gross fatty chicken and a horrible sauce. The bag was filled with grease, even on the bottom of it. It made a bag from Five Guys look healthy.

I guess for some, it is a novelty to mix Asian and Mexican. If you really want to enjoy such fusion, head to Vegas and try China Poblano, the creation of Jose Andres. If you are drunk or high, between the hours of 11 am and 9 pm and in Phoenix, and you have a need to consume a pile of shit, this place will satisfy such a craving.
