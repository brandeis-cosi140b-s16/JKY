I came here after much hype having seen it on Diners, Drive-ins, & Dives and some other top 100 restaurants show on the Travel Chanel. Over hyped. The food was OK and not what they had made it seem to be. The snicker-doodle was good, but no one goes there just for that. The place itself is a little dirty and sketchy with its plastic tables and chairs, this is defenatly a take-out place rather than a sit-down place, or "takee-outee" as their sign suggests.  I like the idea of Chinese and Mexican fusion, but here it's not executed well. There's a sit-down restaurant on 15th Ave & Indian School called Red Dragon (formerly Daily Buffet), they too fuse Chinese and Mexican though not the same format as Chino's; here you can order individual items off the menu or pay for the buffet around lunchtime and pick and choose from the Chinese hot table and Mexican hot table...so Chino isn't alone in the fusion idea. For now I'll give Chino Bandido 3 stars and doubt I would be back.
