The food is good for a first time visit but if you know meat, you will figure out that there is higher quality meat out there for the same price. The Portion sizes seem to have gone down considerably from when I first started going there and I am sure other people might have noticed this too. I love their cheesed up quesadilla but somehow I am still hungry when I leave. One worst turn down for my wife is the cleanliness issue. Don't look at the floor while you eat since it might kill your appetite.
