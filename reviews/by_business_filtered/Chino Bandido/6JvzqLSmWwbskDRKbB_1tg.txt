The food was great! They have a pretty unique way of ordering by having you pick each food item in your combo by checking boxes. I had the Pollo Diablo, Emerald Chicken, and the Jerk Chicken. All were amazing! I gave this place one less star because the portions were less than generous and the place is pretty divey.
