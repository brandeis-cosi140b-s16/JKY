Their fried rice sucks and is flavorless.
Their beans suck and are flavorless.
Their meats are hit and miss... the Jade Chicken is very good, but some of their meats are a bit flavorless.
I guess if you got the meats in a quesadilla, or burrito or whatever, it might be better.  Some people love this place, some people HATE IT.  Your mileage may vary.  It's worth trying, even if just for the uniqueness of the place.
