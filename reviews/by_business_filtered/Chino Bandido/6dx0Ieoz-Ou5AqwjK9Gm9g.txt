I am the Chino Bandido and I'm here to say.......

Good friends took me here for the first time. They are a Phoenix institution if you grew up in the area. I can understand how they aren't for everyone, but they are for me. I'm there at least a few times a year.

The menu is something you have to get used to. Best idea is grab it an go right to the counter. No written word can aptly explain how to navigate the order sheet. The employees however can get you in the right direction quickly.

LOVE THE COOKIES! Snickerdoodle for sure is the best IMHO.

Long story short....something different than you have ever had, or will ever have again.....unless you go back. :)
