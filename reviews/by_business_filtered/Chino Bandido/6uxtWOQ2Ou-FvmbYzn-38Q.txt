I happen to be typing this while my son is awaiting a new plate of food after finding a COCKROACH in his Red Chicken plate. While my plate, a machaca burrito, was delicious I could not help but think of the cockroach the whole time I was trying to eat my lunch. The guy at the counter did take it around to show every one in the kitchen, apologized and they prepared him a new fresh fish from a new batch. But there is a certain expectation when you go out to eat that you won't find bugs in your food. Not sure I will ever be back to eat here. Shame because it was highly recommended.
