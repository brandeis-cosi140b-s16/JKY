I was turned on to Chino Bandido through a friend who lives near the Chandler location. When he said it was Mexican/Chinese fusion, I was initially taken aback. The concept just didn't sound appealing at all. He assured me the food was great. He was right and Chinos is always on the list of places to eat when I am in the Phoenix area. I hadn't seen the Triple D episode so I had no idea what to expect. 

What amazes me is how diverse the menu is. So many meat, bean and rice choices, along with how you want the meat served. By itself, in a burrito or a quesadilla. The Pollo Diablo is my favorite, the only thing I would do to change it would be to make it spicier but I am probably the exception there. The Jerk Chicken is really good too. All the difference rice choices are excellent as are the beans. The snickerdoodle cookie is a nice touch. 

The ordering process is pretty easy once the counter people have explained it, and the offering of samples makes it easy to decide if you've never been there. The dining room is nothing fancy, just long communal benches, but it makes finding a seat easier during busy periods. Food comes out pretty quick too.
