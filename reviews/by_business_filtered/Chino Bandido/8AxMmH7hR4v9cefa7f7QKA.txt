I feel like i'm the only person who didn't like this place.

My sister is a huge fan and went with me to order.  I had the Jade Chicken.

Bleh.   I tasted her food too but I don't recall what it was--still bleh.

I'll stick with the 'berto brothers for my bad mexican food.  

Maybe I just don't like asian food?
