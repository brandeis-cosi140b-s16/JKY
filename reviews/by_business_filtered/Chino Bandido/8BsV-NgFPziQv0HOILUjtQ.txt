The only reason I give this place a 4 instead of a 5, is they're portions. They pile the rice and beans, which are delicious and especially the Jerk Fried Rice but the actual entree items are quite small. I have been going here for years and it has always been great never a bad meal. For the price I just think there should be better portions
