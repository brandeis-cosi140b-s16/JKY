I know you can't stay away from this place, but don't go to Chino's for lunch. Seriously.  It's packed.  You have to wait in line forever.  Go for dinner..... 

I'm convinced that the food here is truly addictive.  I have tried to stay away, but i can't.  The carnitas and egg foo yung keep calling my name.  I have been known to bring their volcano cookies and a pound of just about any entree to potluck dinners.

I like to take "Chino Virgins" there so that they can taste from the sample selection.  Then I watch them get all confused when they have to choose just 1 or 2 things.  (I'm easily entertained.)

Try this.  Emerald chicken Quesedilla with sour cream and lettuce. mmmm foodgasms.
