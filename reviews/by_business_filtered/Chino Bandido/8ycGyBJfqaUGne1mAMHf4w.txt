"Fusion" cuisine, well conceived and artfully produced, is usually an expensive endeavor.  Chino is a blessed exception.

In some sense, it is not fusion, per se.  They have traditional Chinese dishes (Teriyaki chicken, jen red pork) and traditional Mexican dishes (machaca, chile relleno).  But carnitas in a rice bowl, jerk chicken in a burrito, and jade chicken in a quesadilla are not your everyday street fare either.

The payoff is in the attention to detail.  I don't love all of their recipes, but I love a lot of them.  Everything is spiced well (pollo diablo!) and the ownership takes a lot of pride in the quality of the food.

All this and it's called a "Takee-Outee".  Needless to say, pretty low-brow.

My favorite new development: the Chandler location has FREE WIRELESS.  I love you, Chino.
