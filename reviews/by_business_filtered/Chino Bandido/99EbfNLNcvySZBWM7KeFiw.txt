I have been eating at this location for over sixteen years, and I still love Chino Bandidos. The Jade Red Chicken and the Jen Red Pork are my favorite sweeter items while the Jerk Chicken and the El Pollo Diablo are my favorite spicy items.

Their black beans are unlike any other black beans. I think they all them Cuban Black Beans or Caribbean Black Beans, but that is not important. Even if you prefer pinto beans over black beans, you have to try their black beans at least once.

Note that if you are trying to do a low-carb diet, you can strikeout (put a line through) the rice and bean options and write "veggies" instead on the combination. That way you get a combo bowl with broccoli, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and cheese instead of the rice and beans. 

Another ordering tip. If you want black beans in your burrito you put two 'B's instead of one. For example if you I wanted a jerk chicken burrito with black beans in it with my combo, you would write 9BB instead of 9B.
