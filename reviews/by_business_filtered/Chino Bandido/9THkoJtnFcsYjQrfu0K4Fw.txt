This was our first time here and we will definitely be back. 
The food was amazing and affordable and the kids even loved it.
The only reason it's not getting 5 stars from me is because it was pretty dirty in the seating area. I guess you should expect that to be the case at a restaurant in a strip mall but since it was so hyped up I had higher expectations in that area.
