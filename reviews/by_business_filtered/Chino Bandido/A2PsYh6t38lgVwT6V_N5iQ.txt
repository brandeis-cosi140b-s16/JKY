I've been there twice.  Both times I was totally underwhelmed.  Other people I know, love this place, but it isn't for me.  The food is not terrible, but it is neither great Chinese food (like your typical, average quality mom and pop Chinese food), nor great Mexican food (not even as good as Filiberto's). Oddly, and confusing to me, this place is often busy, but I chalk that up to the novelty of restaurant, more than the quality of the food.  The ordering process is confusing and convoluted, adding to the wait times.  Also, the dining area has zero atmosphere and is like a typical generic cafeteria.  If you do go there, get your food to go.
