Back in Arizona for some Sun and Chino Bandido. My wife and I found this place all thanks to Yelp. Our first time in we not only had lunch, but we ordered more Ginger chicken Burritos to go. We are back in Arizona and tonight we will be taking the folks to Chino Bandido for a fusion feast. I'm glad we live in Seattle as Chino gives us something to look forward to.
