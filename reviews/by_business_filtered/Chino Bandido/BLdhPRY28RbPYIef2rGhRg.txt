When I first heard about Chino Bandido I was very skeptical. Asian and Mexican fusion? Sounds a bit weird. To add to my skepticism the place looks a little sketchy. But once we entered all my doubts were gone. We were welcomed by the friendliest staff who offered us all types of delicious samples. I ordered the Jade red chicken and the emerald chicken in a quesadilla. It was really delicious - but my favorite thing by far is there black beans. I don't know what they add to them but I dream about them they are so good. My husband had a chile relleno and the jen red pork with fried rice. The chile relleno was super cheesy and rolled in saltine crackers and then deep fried. 
Chino Bandido is definitely not a place for you if you are counting calories but if you are craving a delicious hearty meal it's for you!
