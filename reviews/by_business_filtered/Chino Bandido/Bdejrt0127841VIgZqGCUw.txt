Another spot we stopped at during our road trip.  From our DDD list of restaurants to choose from we stopped here before returning home.  They were very helpful by offering samples and explaining the menu.  The black bean, jade chicken were great.  I had the white rice to cook things down.  You get two entrees one of which you can have as a quesadilla or in a burrito or not.
