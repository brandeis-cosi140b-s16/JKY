I visited this place twice over a brief period. Guy Fieri of the Food Network visited this place and it's won awards as the spot to go in Phoenix.

It's got this unique Chinese and Mexican blend to its food, I would say the blend is balanced and complementary. To me, that would mean they are both tasty and promote waistline widening. I'm very adverse to spicy or saucy food so I stick to the clean, healthy and boring food. I usually go for the 2 items saucy Egg Foo and the dry gingered Emerald Chicken with rice, pinto beans and vegetables to make it a well balance sampler of health and grease. It's possible to make it all healthy by going for all Chicken and vegetables and white rice. Having this meal makes me full and the various flavors are awesome and refreshing contrasts to fast food. This can possible be the only meal I eat all day. 

I paid about $9 for my meal. They gladly allow you to sample any of the menu items prior to ordering your customizable meal. You would go to a big communal room with plain table seatings with everyone else, wait about 5-10 minutes for the servers to bring your fresh dish for you while you watch the flatscreen TV set featuring sports. 

The food is its main strength, second by good service and decor is not considerable. I stumbled at this place when I dropped of household wares to get repaired.   It is located in an interesting strip mall that also features a Byzantine restaurant, juice store, smoke shop, shoe repair shop and theme bars. Parking is plenty. I would definitely come here with a group again. This is on my recommended list.
