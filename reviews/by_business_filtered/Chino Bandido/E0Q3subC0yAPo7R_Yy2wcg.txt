This place is hillarious. From the panda with the mustache to the plastic tables and fold up chairs. I hope you're not looking for high end dining in terms of ambiance! But the food is worth walking inside the small hole in the wall restaurant. The jade red chicken is amazing. I recommend it plain (as in not in a burrito/quesadilla). My other favorite is the jerk chicken (which is a little spicy) in a quesadilla. Oh and the black beans are good too. 

Don't forget you get a cookie with the combo! I love snickerdoodles.

YUM!
