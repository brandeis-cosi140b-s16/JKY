Found this place doing my research on Yelp for a cool place to grab a meal.  

If you're in the area - GO to this place!  The person helping us was exceptionally helpful.  I walked in, went up to the counter and said I had never been there and what do they recommend.  Jerk chicken and Red chicken were the choices, so I ordered both.  

The chicken was cooked perfectly and spicy (Jerk chicken anyway).  

The rice, beans, every thing was really good.  I will be back.
