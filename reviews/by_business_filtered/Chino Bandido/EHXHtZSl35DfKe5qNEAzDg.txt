We have heard about this place for a long time from friends and family. Everybody loves it!
My questions is WHY? Why the hype? Is it because of Guy Fieri?
My husband and I are very adventurous foodies. We are also very creative cooks. 
This was not good Mexican food. This was not good Chinese food. Get the two together and it was horrible food. Truly the worst food we have ever had in the valley! I think people are going for it cuz its trendy! Pleeeease!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
