Whoever came up with the idea of Chinese-Mexican fusion food - you are a genius! I repeat, a genius. 

I love this place, it is as close to comfort food as it can get outside of your home. There are a couple of favorites that I end up ordering every time I come here - the Jade Red Chicken = sweet & sour & crunchy & all the goodness packed into every single bite. The jerk fried rice = I'm never going to eat normal fried rice again. 

This place is super unpretentious. The wait staff are always cheerful and the best thing is you can sample the food before you order it and I make it a point to do that every single time! And last but not the least, the cookies they give free with every meal are awesome too :D

If you are in the area, hop over for a quick bite, you won't regret it!
