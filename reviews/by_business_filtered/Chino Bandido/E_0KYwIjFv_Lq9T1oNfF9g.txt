OK so I am on vacation in AZ and my mom told me she saw this place on the food network and said we had to try it, we are staying in Chandler so I figured hey why not.  The place is pretty cool it fuses Mexican/asian food ( they do have jerk chicken which is considered Jamaican I suppose) anyhow the food was alright it was all pretty basic to me the Jerk chicken was really spicy it definitely needed something... the Terryaki (sp?) chicken was really good but i have tasted it before nothing special ... my sister and mom had the chili reyano over steamed rice they said it was pretty good... I gave it 3 stars because the staff there is freaking awesome the girl who took my order was really helpful because they have you fill out a card and put numbers and letters...it's really weird... but anyways the staff is great and friendly the food is OK nothing special but the price is AMAZING if you are looking for good food for cheap this would be for you because for 5 adults and two children it only came up to $40 and that is really good!!  I probably won't ever go there again but there you have it... 1 1/2 stars for the food .... i wanted to love it but eehh I've definitely had better.
