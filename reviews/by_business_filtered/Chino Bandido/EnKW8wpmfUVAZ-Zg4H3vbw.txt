I've been to Chino Bandido several times, but it's been close to 3 years since my last trip... The last few times I had been there were rather unremarkable, but Chino got hur groove back it seems. The portions were huge, the flavors were super intense, and the cheese was served by the pound. Having gone with my mom, dad, and neighbors, it seems that junk food loving guys, like myself, prefer Chino Bandido... it's fried, cheesy, gooey, and greasy... which I adore, but that's not for everyone. The Pork Fried Rice could be the best fried rice I've ever had,... 
All sorts of yum for less than $10 per person, and it's served with a snickerdoodle after! woooo!
