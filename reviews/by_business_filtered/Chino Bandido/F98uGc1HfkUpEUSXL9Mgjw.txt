Mexican and Chinese Fusion? Strange, but awesomely delicious! I wouldn't consider this joint a "cheap eats" though. It's about $8.50 a plate.

I ordered 7Q + 10 with JFR
Translation:
Jade Red Chicken in a Quesadilla + Emerald Chicken with Jerk Fried Rice.

Super delicious! I especially enjoyed the quesadilla. The emerald chicken is a mock off a traditional Chinese dish (Tzong Yoh Jee: Green Onion and Oil Chicken). I've definitely had better chicken, but for an American joint, I give it 4 stars for trying. The jerk fried rice is a must try, I absolutely loved it! It has a spicy punch that really hits the spot (the perfect amount of spiciness!)

I didn't sample their items because I was in a rush, but I think it is super awesome that the staff are super friendly and offer samples to their patrons.

I will definitely come again! :)
