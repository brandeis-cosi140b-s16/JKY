We both love Mexican food just as much as Chinese food, so this spot has been on our radar for a long time.  We drove 30+ minutes to get there, and we were heartbroken it did not live up to the expectation :(  We really wanted to love this local favorite.  For a first-timer, the ordering sheet was pretty confusing, and most of the people were helpful in exception of one guy who was annoyed we were taking so long trying to figure out the rice bowl combination.

I ordered the Emerald Chicken + Carnitas Rice Bowl with Jerk Fried Rice + Black Beansl.  The Emerald Chicken reminded me of a twist in Hainan Chicken: refreshingly light.  The Carnita was so dry, I had to put extra salsa to moisten the pork. Jerk Fried Chicken was sadly average with the highlight being the black beans with its sweet and creamy flavor blew my mind!  The food was served room temperature borderline cold with the exception of the black beans.  

My friend ordered the Emerald Chicken + Jerk Chicken with Plain Fried Rice + Black Beans.  We both agreed on the identical protein + side dish. The Jerk Chicken had no kick or "Island flavor"!

We hope our visit was just a anomaly.  Because of our love for both cuisines, we would give it another attemp but probably only if we are in the area.
