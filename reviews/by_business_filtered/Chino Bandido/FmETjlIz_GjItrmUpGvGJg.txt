Reading some of the reviews here....nodding my head and going "AWWW YEAHHH!" when I see 4 and 5 star reviews....just shaking my head, confused, and kinda angry at some of of the 1-3 star ones....like, what's wrong with your taste buds, people? 

Best place in Phoenix to eat casually. Hands down.

My current order I'm obsessed with: Jade Red Chicken (which is like the Orange Chicken at Panda, as in you need to have this in EVERY combo plate you eat here, it's a prerequisite), a Jerk Chicken burrito with cheese and sour cream added, Pork fried rice, and black beans. (Always- ALWAYS get the black beans....like protein chocolate pudding).

Also- their snickerdoodle, when fresh, is the BEST COOKIE IN THE WORLD.

Haven't been to the one in Chandler, reading the Yelp reviews, I get the vibe it's not as good as the Phoenix one...but even if it's only HALF as good, it'll still be amazing.

If you're not making at least a monthly voyage here, no matter where you may live in the valley, what are you doing with your life?
