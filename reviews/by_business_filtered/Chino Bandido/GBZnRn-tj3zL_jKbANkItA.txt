Just because you say fusion doesn't mean you have good food, in fact Chino Bandido took cheap Mexican food and cheap Chinese food and serves it in the same establishment. It is a complete dive, which is the only reason that I can image Guy Fieri would like it. It isn't even worth going once for the experience, and if you must bring the Pepto Bismol with you, you will be sick afterwards. The service is excellent, top notch for a place where you order at the counter (and they use white mean chicken, which is a plus for me), but the food is so terrible, that I can't give it more than 1 star.
