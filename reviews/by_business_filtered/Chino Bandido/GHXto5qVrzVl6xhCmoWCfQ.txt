Been eating here for 9 years now. The food is great. It is kind of a dive, and the ordering is a little weird, but the food totally makes up for it.

They blend Mexican and Chinese food. The machaca rice bowl with plain fried rice is my fav!

Good place to eat. Try to stay clear on Sunday afternoons though. Once the huge church up the street lets out, that place is packed. There is usually at least a 30 minute line when that happens.
