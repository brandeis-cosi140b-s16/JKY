Ever wonder what would happen if a nice Mexican girl and a nice Chinese boy got married and opened a restaurant? Chino Bandido is a place that is a great idea and pretty darn good!

So here is the rub:  it is Mexican food with Chinese influences.  The one that got me in the door "General Tso's Chicken Burrito".  Think about it.  Think about it... gotcha.  Something you definitely want to try.

As a newbie, the super nice woman behind the counter let me taste a bunch of different meats before I had to decide.  The emerald chicken, which everyone seems to like, is quite good.  Probably the most Chinese style meat there.  It is like chimichurra or a salty, green onion sliced chicken.  I can't decide which.

However, I am delighted to say I stayed for the General Tso's Chicken burrito.  They call it Jade Red Chicken.  Get it in a burrito.  Get it in a quesadilla.  Get it over rice.  Get it in a large pile.  Just get it.  Great stuff.  (see menu:  http://www.chinobandido.com/ordermenu.html)

Now, this is NOT authentic anything.  This is a perfectly nice family pushing a cool, original fusion style of cooking.  If for no other reason, that is worth checking out.  But even better - the food is good.  Enjoy it!

...and just one second.  I almost forgot to mention the 2nd tastiest, most random thing you would expect from a place like this:  Snickerdoodles.  Yes, the sugary, Cinnamon swirled cookies.  Not sure why they do it, but this place has EXCELLENT snickerdoodles.  Go for those too.
