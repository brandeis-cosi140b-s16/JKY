I am SO excited that we finally got to try this place! Since this was our first time the guy at the front explained everything to us & let us try some different items off the menu.  We got combo meals, mine was chicken fried rice, refried beans, teriyaki quesadilla & jade red chicken. Crazy amount of food. It was all SOOOOO good. My only complaint would be to ask for my fried rice without green onions as I don't really care for them & it had tons. Yes the place is divey but hey, the food rocks! $18 for 2 combo meals & a drink. They even brought us 2 yummy cookies!
