Chino Bandido...   Hmmm.
I went to C.B. first because it had a quirky name.  I was expecting chinese food.  When I got to Chino Bandido, I encountered an anomaly.  What I thought was a hole in the wall chinese take out joint was something way weirder.  Firstly, this location (Chandler) sits WAY back from whatever road the address is, and its behind a day care center and a Walgreens (or tire shop???, something...)  Secondly it is a cavernous restraunt with plastic patio furniture to dine upon. (I don't need a silver spoon but...  Wha???) Thirdly, they have this weird ass schematic to order from, like, we had to have the nice gal at the counter explain the combos/options/sides over and over. 
Then theres the food, asian fusion (or puerto rican styled mexican food over fried rice).  Nothing terrible, nothing exciting either.  I had the relleno and a pork dish that were okay, the whole time I sat an ate I was so perplexed at the above mentioned stuff that all I did was chew and look at my weird surroundings.  I did notice that they've won a bunch of best of Phx awards fron the New Times, that's cool.  I guess thats cool if all you know is "regular" mexican food or "regular" chinese food.

Then, I noticed a poster of Guy Fieri, signed by the douche himself.  This place was on DDD!  I never caught the episode featuring C.B. but I'm sure I didn't miss anything special.   Chino Bandido...  Silly name, weird place, okay food.  Oh, and nice people.
