I love this place!  It is in an old strip mall and doesn't look like much from the outside, and isn't really much on the inside either, and I love it that way!  Such a dive!  There is a reason it was featured on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives!  Here is a link if you haven't seen the clip: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86kjMk63PLY.  The food is a fusion of Chinese, Mexican, and Caribbean.  When you walk in there is a tasting counter where you can sample the food and they can help you fill out your order.  You have your choice of many different items including quesadillas, teriyaki chicken, Jamaican jerk chicken, beans, and rice.  My favorite is the Jade Red chicken, a Chinese side similar to orange chicken, but so much better!  You also get a cookie with your order, usually a snicker doodle, but certain days they serve other types of cookies.  There is a location in Chandler as well.  We come often, delicious and unique concept!
