Have you ever heard of Chinese food mixed with Mexican? I never did nor had I ever thought of such thing. 

However, Chino Bandido beat me to it. 
Gosh darn; I wish I thought of it first! 

There are several options to choose from; from just your choice of entree by itself to putting it in your quesadilla or burrito or BOTH! What if you don't know how these entrees taste like? No problem, ask for a sample. That's how I made my choice. Did I hear with a side of refried or black beans and rice on the side? Yes you did!  For the rice, you get some more options; fried, plain, jerk, and chicken. To wrap it all up you get to choose either a chocolate volcano (chocolate cookie with powder sugar) or snicker doodle cookie. At the end of it all, you will definitely be really full. I had to take a power nap; haha. 

I had the Jade Chicken (which is the most popular entree on the menu) entree with Jade Chicken quesadilla with a side of black beans and jerk fried rice. Finishing it all up with a volcano chocolate cookie. I liked the snicker doodler more though (my boyfriend had it) . 

I really like the Jade Chicken. It was freshly made crispy; but there was a little too much sauce. I find the quesadilla very unique. I never had Chinese food with cheese with tortilla before. 
It's all really interesting; got to go try. 

By the way, good luck finding it.
