My 1200th review.... how far I have come..... 

SBCers I have found my paradise and I want to take this place home with me. 

First off...they give you a flavor profile mini taste tour when you come and its your first time. They walk you through mild all the way to their jerk chicken. The guy working the counter last night was super helpful. 

You can tell where the good food is because pork is not the only thing on the menu... as we were finishing our taste testing a dozen cops came in for lunch/ early dinner. It looked like 10 out of the 12 come here frequently and it shows.

I went with the emerald chicken (which was AMAZING), a jade chicken QUESADILLA and the pork fried rice....wait.. I ALSO GET A COOKIE! 

The jade chicken was that perfect sweet and I know it sounds weird but tasted really good in a cheese quesadilla (just that right amount of crispy outside). the emerald chicken was amazingly well balanced.. it was light and fresh... just what I needed after being up since 5 AM and travelling. The pork fried rice was perfect.....my beans took me for a brief moment to my happy place...the snickerdoodle was like the Santa Cruz Pacific Cookie Company was here in Arizona... i waited five minutes and then ate it in the car while going to our time share

The boyfriend got the emerald chicken, the jerk fried rice and the carnitas.. it was gone in 5 minutes (shoved all into his mouth). 

I am a big fan of triple D and when I saw this place I put it on the places I want to go before I die... yep... lived up to the hype....
