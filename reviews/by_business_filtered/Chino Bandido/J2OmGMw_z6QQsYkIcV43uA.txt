So I have been many times and haven't wrote a review so here it goes.

Chino Bandido is ultimate Mexican-Asian fusion with a twist of Caribbean in it.  They have many amazing dishes there I can't say which one I like best.  Plus you get a snickerdoodle cookie with every meal.  

Today I had the machaca and pork fried rice.  The machaca was great not too dry and full of flavor.  The fried rice was very good as well and with the hot sauce they have is nice and spicy.  

If you haven't been to Chino you are missing out.
