Visited Chino again a couple of nights ago. Hadn't been there for a couple of years and pretty much nothing has changed. Same great food. I went for Jade Red Chicken Burrito, Jerk Chicken Quesadilla, black beans and plain rice. I love the fact that they make everything from scratch in this place. The food is simply terrific, if a bit greasy, but that's to be expected from the type of food they serve.

Remember, if it is your first time visiting be sure to let the staff know so they can give you samples of several items and show you how to order.
