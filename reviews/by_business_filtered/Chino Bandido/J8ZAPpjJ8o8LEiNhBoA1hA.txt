Three words: Jade. Red. Chicken.  

That stuff has been on my mind constantly since my first reluctant trip to Chino Bandidos.  

My wife and I were on our way to try this place when we both chickened out because the menu and ordering was so weird and different.  Big mistake.  They have a guy there who literally walks you through the menu, ordering and gives you samples of their main dishes, rices and beans.  I was excited to place my order by the time I finished tasting everything.

I ordered the Jade Red Chicken and BBQ Pork burrito with Chicken Fried Rice and black beans.  

I should have ordered a bucket of jade red chicken because that stuff is amazing!!  It pissed me off that the BBQ Pork had to share the plate with it.  

The BBQ Pork didn't have a chance, plus it was bland and boring anyways.  I should have ordered the jerk chicken rice instead of the chicken fried rice.  It had some weird spices in there that turned me off.  The black beans were excellent!  Spicy and very different!

Don't be scared to try this place.
