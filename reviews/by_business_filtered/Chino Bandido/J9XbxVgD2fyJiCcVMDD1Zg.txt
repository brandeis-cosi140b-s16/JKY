Chino is one of those places that does not have amazing mexican or asian food but they have manged to make the fusion of the two work. The jade red chicken and jerk chicken are two of my favorites and the chili rellano is serviceable.  I think i will stay away though because about an hour after eating my wife got really sick, not blaming the food but i would rather not take any chances.
