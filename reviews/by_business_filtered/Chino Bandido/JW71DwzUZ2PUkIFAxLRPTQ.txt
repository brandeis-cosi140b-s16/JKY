Worst.... Diarrhea.... Ever....

I ate at Chino Bandido's for the first and last time ever. I got the jade chicken, diablo chicken, black beans and rice. Was not impressed at all. The jade chicken was alright. The diablo chicken had an overpowering garlic flavor, and the chicken was super dry and hard. 

I don't understand the hype about this place. I'd rather have regular Chinese food, or authentic Mexican-- good concept of combining the two, but just doesn't work. 

I know that Chino Bandido is what upset my stomach, because it was the only thing I had to eat that day. 

If you want good Chinese food go to Shangri-La on 28th Ave and Cactus. 
And if you want mind blowing Mexican go to Valle Luna at 35th and Bell Rd.
