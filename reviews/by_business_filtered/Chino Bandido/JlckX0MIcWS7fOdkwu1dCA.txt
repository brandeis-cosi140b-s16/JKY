It's a crazy place that takes a PhD in hypergeometry to understand how to order. Inventive food, if you're up for that sort of thing. with the unique choices and variations they gave me a sampler of everthing so I could make up my mind.

What you've heard about the snookerdoodle is correct. My theory is it's laced with nicotine -  it's addictive.

I marked yes on wait service because it was slow and the owner brought our food over, he probably doens't always do this.
