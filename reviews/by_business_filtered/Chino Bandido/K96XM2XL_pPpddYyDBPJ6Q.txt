Food is always consistent sometimes too much so. Someone needs to tell the cooks under done chicken is at least as hazardous as under done pork. Tired of chicken but the jen red chicken is always cooked properly the Jen red pork on the other hand is always overcooked to the point of the coating being hard crunchy and burnt tasting.  Been like this for years I am tired of talking to staff.  

Could someone please teach the cooks to properly cook pork ot take it off the menu.
