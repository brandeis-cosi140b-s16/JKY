A friend recommended this place to my family immediately when they found out that we were traveling to Phoenix. Of course we went- and I'm glad we did! Chino Bandido is so unique.. Mexican and Asian food aren't a common combination but the food was soo delicious! The snickerdoodles were also scrumptious- my fave!
