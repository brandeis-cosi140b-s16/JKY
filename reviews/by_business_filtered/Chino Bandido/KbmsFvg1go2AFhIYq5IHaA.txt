I was finally able to satisfy my drought for decent Mexican food when some friends took me here for dinner! Let me tell you there are Rey few Mexican food options in Honolulu and I was quite happy with this place. A bit chaotic up front, no one seems to know how to place an order. Way too many options and permutations on items to order! However, when the food finally comes (and it comes quick), its really awesome! I tried the combination dish with carne asana along with the pork fried rice. Awesome!
