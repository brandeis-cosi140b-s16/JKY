Chino Bandido was kind of an off-the-wall suggestion I received when I was inquiring to some locals on where to eat in the general Phoenix area.  But when I went to the website and saw the horribly ironic image of a giant panda wearing a bullet belt and sombrero, I knew that this was a place that I had to go to.

GPS led me on a path that would require traversing over a giant wall to get to Chino Bandido, but I eventually found the actual entrance in an actual parking lot nearby.  Upon arriving, my first thought was "wow, this place has A LOT of space."  Seriously, very open restaurant.

Anyway, the cashiers were helpful to a tourist like me fill out my order, and I guess I ordered jerk chicken with rice, because that's what I ended up getting.  Now I consider myself to have a very high threshold for spicy foods, but Chino Bandido's jerk chicken was ridiculous.  After the first few bites, my mouth was literally burning up.  It was good, but man, was the heat it made unexpected.

Not to go unnoticed, but the sugar cookie that came with the meal was really, really good too.

Conclusively, friendly young staff, quick service, and amusing albeit a little on the tasteless side of decor, and I'm glad I made a trip down to Chandler to try this place out.  I made sure to get a shirt too, because I'm into tasteless t-shirts like that.
