Boy! I miss this place.  The Emerald Chicken (Quesadilla style) with the jerk fried rice is great!  When I go back to Chandler, I do make a trip back to this place.

If you are a novice, it will be different in ordering.  You'll feel like you are taking an exam.  Once you know how to order, it becomes second nature.  Happy Eating!!!!
