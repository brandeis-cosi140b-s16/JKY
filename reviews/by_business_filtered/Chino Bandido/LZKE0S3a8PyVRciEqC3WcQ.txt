Proving you don't need fancy digs to pull off fusion cuisine, Chino Bandido combines Mexican and Chinese in a way that's not only good-tasting, but with a great sense of humor and an overwhelming eagerness to please.

My interaction didn't last long - just enough to order Pollo Diablo and some jerk chicken. Regardless of how incompatible those two items sound, it worked well, if only because both were crazy flavorful, and I sat there eating them out of a little tin with chopsticks. Cheap, good, and unique - it's all you need.

Apparently, you also need a snickerdoodle, because they gave me one for free. You win this round, Chino Bandido.
