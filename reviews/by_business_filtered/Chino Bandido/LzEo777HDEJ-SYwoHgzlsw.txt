I though Triple D and I had a good relationship, but this time he lied to me!  I was not pleased with this place, food was mediocre, bland and overall lacking.  Maybe it is not a good choice for herbivores (carnivores definitely have more options).

I had the chile relleno. It was heavily breaded, greasy and I'm sure made with kraft cheese shreds. They were out of the egg fu yung and I didn't want a quesadillas so I went with salad, rice and black beans.   The black beans at Chipotle has more flavor.
