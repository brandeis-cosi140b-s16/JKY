Not exactly the nicest place in town, but its cheap, interesting, really good food.  The atmosphere is very casual and low key, and they let you sample all their meats & rice up front which I thought that was way cool. The beans are delicious, and so are those big snicker-doodle cookies that come withe the meals.  Thank you Triple D for introducing me to yet another local grub spot.
