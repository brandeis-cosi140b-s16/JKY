I came to Phoenix on business and yelp'ed some places around my hotel to see what I could get for a quick bite to eat. Chino Bandido did not disappoint! I had the pork fried rice, Cuban black beans, carnitas quesadilla and the red jade chicken. It's really odd how well pork fried rice and Cuban black beans go together! The black beans are excellent! The salsa is yummy and the complimentary cookie is icing on the cake. I just wish there was a refrigerator in my room so I could save this for tomorrow....I couldn't even eat half of it! Cheap, good eats!
