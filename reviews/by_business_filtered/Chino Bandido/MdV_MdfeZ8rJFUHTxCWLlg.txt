I hadn't visited this place in about five years. Once again, I really enjoyed everything tasted at this restaurant.  The fare is a fusion of Chinese, Mexican and Jamaican flavors. First, I was offered samples of all the major items to try.  I selected  the Jade Red chicken, the black beens with cumin, and the Jerk Chicken (been to Jamaica, ate their jerk chicken while there, Chino Bandidio's was pretty darn good) - all were packed with flavor and delicious.The staffing was helpful, friendly and attentive - I couldn't as for more. 

I'll be back to try some of the other menu items. I'll definitely refer this establishment to others.
