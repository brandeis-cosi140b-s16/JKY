I'm now very conflicted with this establishment. 

The original location is SO MUCH BETTER. The employees there take the time out to explain their fusion menu, they give you tastings of entrees, and made me fall in love with Chino Bandido. 

I do, however, work much closer to this location, and I was so excited to make the trek here to emulate that first experience. 

Sadly, every time I come here, I feel like I'm collecting a debt when I'm placing an order with this location's employees. I guess nobody likes working here...
I love their food, as you can see I've checked in here a few times. 

But enough's enough: 
-Finding the place still takes quite a bit of effort at night
-The ambience is awful, the storefront is having an identity crisis while trying to be a hip sports bar with the TVs and San Tan brews, but fails to deliver good food instead
-They're always out of Egg Foo Yung...the one time they had it, it tasted completely bland and nothing like the one I ordered from the original location
-They've gotten my order wrong. When I'm only placing two bowl orders and the place is not remotely busy, there's no excuse

Maybe I need to find the manager/owners and have a heart to heart talk. Either these are two different franchisees or they need to shape up this location
