So I finally went to Chino's. Though it didn't start off all that good, me being overly hungry didn't help this, but still, it ending well, with a cookie and a smile.

We walked into the open and airy joint and where we found a huge front counter and the two owners (I know what they look like because I saw them on the food network show they were in) were assisting new customer by allowing them to sample some of their fairs,  this is all good, but we had 5 VERY finicky people in front of us...One was pregnant, one was a vegetarian, one had to return to work (didn't want stinky breath, whatever happend to gum) so every other thing that was brought out for them to taste was conversely turned away. FINALLY, after waiting at the counter for a good ten minutes, I just grabbed our order form and went to the check out. I was than first asked, is this your first time here, so I replied "yes" and one of the owners (the lady) said "so, do you like spicy or mild foods" and by now I am mildly starving, and replied shortly "I don't know, I just want some food." Now, I know there is much appeal about the "experience" of having the two owners hand feed you some of their most delicious creations, but there is no order or direction at this large counter, and this can be frustrating. Spending 10 minutes with three people and letting a line build up (on a Saturday afternoon at 1pm) with no one else directed to help isn't really a great idea...Hey but that's just me...

Anyhow, I ordered the Jade Red Chicken and Jerk fried Rice, my other half ordered Jerk chicken with chicken fried rice. Just FYI the Jerk is really spicy I mean, 1000 little men in your mouth lighting torches spicy. My other half couldn't tell the difference between the peanut butter and snicker doodle cookies spicy (this was comedic however). But the flavor was very good in all the choices we made, I will be returning to Chino's for my personal tasting "experience"!
