So Mexican-Asian fusion sounds disgusting. 
The first time I ever tried it, in fact, I hated it, yet a week later, I couldn't stop craving it. A fair warning was given by my friend, Sean M. that I wouldn't be able to resist it.

Teriyaki Chicken Quesadilla... YOU SHOULD NOT WORK.. but somehow, you are one of the best tasting creations known to man. Chino Bandido, you are so good.... you are so good that I am WILLING to eat there even though I know 45 minute to an hour later my stomach will be growling as loud as a mountain lion. 

The service is speedy, I like that you write your order on an order sheet and hand it to the cashier where you immediately pay for your food and then you take your seat. They come out a few minutes later calling your name so that you can receive your aluminum tray full of deliciousness. 

I really dislike your snickerdoodles. Blech. 
However, I can definitely see why Guy Fieri loves you so much, Chino Bandido.
