This was the second time that I've eaten their food but the first time I've been to their establishment. The first time, someone ordered from there and I just so happen to be there to pick off their leftovers.
The boyfriend and I decided to try something new for lunch and we were in the area so we stopped by. It was around 2:45pm on a Saturday so it was crowded! Since it was my bf's first time we decided to wait to try the samples. 
Very nice guy let us try pretty much whatever we wanted. So we tried the Carnitas (a little dry but had great flavor) Jade chicken (which I'm told is very popular; equivilant to a spicy version of sweet and sour chicken) Emerald chicken (fresh tasting, not spicy at all) and finally the Jerk fried rice (right about of spice and tasty)
We both decided to try different things so we can try them all! I ordered the combo plate with black beans, jerk fried rice, carnitas quesadilla and jade chicken. I believe he ordered the pollo diablo in a burrito, emerald chicken and refried beans with steamed rice. Everything was delicious and it was such a variety of food!
I know this place has been around for quite sometime and the concept of the cuisine fusions works so well! My only complaint is that this place looks very dirty and dingy. I understand the term "hole in the wall" but at least move locations or clean up the place a bit. Other than that, great food!

PS you get a cookie with each meal so try the Volcano cookie (brownie) and the Snickerdoodles (cinnamon sugar)
