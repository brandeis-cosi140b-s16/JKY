I would have given this place one star, but the free cookie deserved an extra star.  The snickerdoodles are chewy and delicious.  As for the rest of the food, it was not worth the money or the calories.  We saw this place on an old episode of DDD and decided it was time we try it.  They make it look A LOT better on tv than it is in real life.  Two couples walked in after us and they both received food ten minutes before we received ours.  I guess a quesadilla takes ten minutes to cook??  Try other DDD places, NOT this one.
