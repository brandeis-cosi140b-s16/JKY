Look... If you go to a hole in the wall dive then expect dive style food. This place is the bomb for dive flavors and what a concept it has. The mixing of Mexican and Chinese foods form a great fusion meal. The punch of chilies that hit your throat with every Mexican dish entree accompanied with the sweet taste of Chinese cuisine is just plain delicious. 
This place was featured on The Food Networks "Diners, Driven-Ins, and Dives" and it deserved to be. Like Guy from Tripple D, I too would suggest this dive for those looking to try something not of the norm.
