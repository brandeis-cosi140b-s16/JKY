Totally awesome! Seriously, you gotta try this place. You don't HAVE to mix things, but it is definitely encouraged: Jade and red chicken with jerk fried rice is like sticking your toes in the water. Don't forget your cookie for dessert (or later!).

Once you fall in love with this place and want to try something different, order an egg foo yung quesadilla.
