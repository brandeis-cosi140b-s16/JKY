I first heard about Chino Bandido on a Food Network show, and the fare sounded interesting. Mexican food with an Asian flare? Either horrible or awesome, right? 

Top Dog: Emerald Chicken - Brimming with the the flavors of green onions and ginger, this chicken was my favorite. I had it in a burrito, and immediately made me regret the other things I'd ordered.

Contendor: Jade Chicken - Interesting, but ultimately unsuccessful. It just tasted like someone put sriracha sauce on my tacos. Nah. Nothing special.

Surprising: Confusing order system - The system makes sense, but it takes a few minutes to figure out. They should just have newbies order at the counter with no paper. There's a whole matrix, and abbreviations, and about 30 options times four... It was surprising that it was so difficult to order.

Disappointing: Chile relleno - this was a bummer; chile rellenos are one of my faves, but this was a monstrosity; poor choice of cheeses, the batter was waaay too crunchy, not many seasonings. No thanks.

Overall, some good tastes, but room for improvement. Biggest improvement would be less grease. EVERYTHING was super greasy!  The fried rice was greasy, the beans were lardy, the food was oily, and the grease settled at the bottom of the foil container, getting the tortillas greasy and the rice greasier too!

I'd return, but I'd stick to the Emerald chicken.
