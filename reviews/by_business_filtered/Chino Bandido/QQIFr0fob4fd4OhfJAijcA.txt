Though you may need a PhD to figure out how to order using one of their slips, the service is outwardly cordial and they hand out samples as if it was National Tapas Day. The place itself is surreal as if in an Almodovar film. Opting for the sweet and sour chicken burrito, Chinese BBQ pork quesadilla, black beans and chicken fried rice, I was able to make an entire days meal out of this one order. The end results are remarkably melding and might I say a breath of fresh, greasy air. It works. It somehow works.
