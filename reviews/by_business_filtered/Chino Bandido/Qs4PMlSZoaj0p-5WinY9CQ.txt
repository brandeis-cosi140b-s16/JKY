I absolutely love this place! 
I've been there twice this week! 
The jerk chicken is absolutely yummy! But honestly everything on the menu that I've tried so far is great! 
Ordering for first timers is a little confusing, but if you go up to the guy at the counter on the left he will help u out and give u some samples :)
By my second visit I knew the deal and was able to get in and out a lot faster.
The snickerdoodle cookie was the bomb, and I tried a special cookie yesterday that was chocolatey and soooo gooooood! 
I can't wait to be back in AZ so I can go back to this place!
