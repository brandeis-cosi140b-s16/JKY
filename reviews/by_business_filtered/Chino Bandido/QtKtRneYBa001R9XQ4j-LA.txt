Sweet fancy Moses, this place is a dump.  I bought my last wardrobe at a thrift store that had a better aesthetic.  Dumpy tables, dirty walls, and Sweet Lord that bathroom.

$5000 bucks of the Diner Drive-inns and Dives money would completely change the vibe here.

BUT we go to Chino for the grub, and it's crazy tasty.  Emerald chicken, jade chicken, egg foo yummy.

Big bowls of tasty foods with unique flavor profiles, that's the Chino experience.

Just watch the sewage in the parking lot....
