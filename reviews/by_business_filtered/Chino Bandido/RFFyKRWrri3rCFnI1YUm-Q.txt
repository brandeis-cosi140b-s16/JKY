my buddy introduced  my fiancee and me to two combination dishes. I had  the Caribbean beans w  cheese,  Diablo chicken rice(med spice), & jade chicken burrito. my  girl got the same but w  jerk  chicken instead of Diablo chicken.  we also tried the fresh snicker doodle cookies. 
keep  in mind,  my girl is picky in everything she eats.  never wants to try new things but she enjoyed eating this place  for our first time.  everything we ate  we enjoyed.  we will eat this again.
