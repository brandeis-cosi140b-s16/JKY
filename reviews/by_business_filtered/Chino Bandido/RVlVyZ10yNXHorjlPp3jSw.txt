Chino has lost one star in my book, don't get me wrong it's still the best Phoenix has to offer, and my favorite place...but the portion sizes are becoming less and less satisfying for the price. 

I'm not sure why they've gone this route, but surely a divey place can't risk their patrons feeling slighted on quality or quantity. 

Come on chino! Start filling those tins of deliciousness to the brim again!
