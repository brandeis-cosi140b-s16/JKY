You would think chinese+mexican fusion is gross, but in reality it's like a fiesta on the great wall of china in your mouth.

My personal favorite is the jade red chicken, gringo chicken on jerk fried rice w/ black beans combo. The portions are huge, the food is probably extremely fattening, and you *WILL* have a food coma by the end of lunch.

To top things off, they give you a cookie. All for $8. 

Hands down my favorite place to eat.
