I still love Chino Bandido, even as a vegan.

My normal purchases are:
A combo meal with veggie "quesadilla" (no cheese) + black bean burrito (no cheese), refried beans (no cheese) and white rice. 
The veggie no cheese quesadilla still has a crisped up tortilla piled in with lettuce, broccoli & tomato bits. I drench it in their fantastic hot sauce & dab in some refried beans. The no cheese burrito still has the best texture as you bite through the just right chewy tortilla into the soft beans, drenched with hot sauce of course.

On the weekends, I like to get a tostada no cheese too.

The staff is always friendly and willing to highlight and accentuate the no-cheese requests on my order form.
