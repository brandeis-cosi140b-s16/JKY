I've been hearing about this place for years and finally tried it. Chinese and Mexican food together is oddly awesome. Who would have thought refried beans was exactly what fried rice was missing. A little Jamaican flair thrown in too with the jerk chicken. It's one of my favorite hole in the walls now. The snickerdoodles are yummy too.
