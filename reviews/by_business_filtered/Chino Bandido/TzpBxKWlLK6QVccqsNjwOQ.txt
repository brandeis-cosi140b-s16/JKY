So far I've had their red jade chicken, emerald ginger chicken, pollo diablo, and egg foo yung. I enjoyed all the chicken dishes, but for me the emerald ginger chicken really stands out - very flavorful and the most Asian-tasting of what I've tried here. The egg foo yung is OK but I think I will skip that in my future visits. All the entrees go pretty well with the rice and beans that came the meals. Not spectacular fare but inexpensive, fast, flavorful, and filling - all that will draw me back for future visits, definitely.
