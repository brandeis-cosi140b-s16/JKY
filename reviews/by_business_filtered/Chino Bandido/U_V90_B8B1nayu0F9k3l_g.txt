Took a trip to AZ for spring training and made a stop at Chino Bandido due to all the reviews and excitement from Diners Drive-ins & Dives. Not more to say than this will be a place we eat at every time we are in the Phoenix area!

My husband and I shared a white rice bowl with black beans, a emerald chicken quesadilla & a jade chicken quesadilla. It may sound odd but it was so yummy! The white rice mixed with the mexican black beans was great! And the flavors of the chinese style chicken inside the mexican cheese quesadilla were perfect.

Since I live in CA, I will be trying this at home to satisfy the odd craving and prove to friends I am not crazy.
