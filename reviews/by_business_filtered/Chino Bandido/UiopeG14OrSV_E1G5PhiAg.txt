Whoever thought a fusion Chinese-Mexican restaurant could be this good? The selections are creative and the result is a flavor explosion you'll appreciate. I had the chicken with jade sauce and loved it. It's a very casual place where you place your order at the counter. There is plenty of room to find a table usually.
