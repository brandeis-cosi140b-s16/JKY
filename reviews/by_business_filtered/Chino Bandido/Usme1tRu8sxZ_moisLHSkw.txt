The concept of Chino Bandido sounds just plain wrong with it's mash-up of Chinese, Mexican, and Caribbean fare, but everything just seems to go well together...surprisingly.  I visited CB for lunch on a short weekend trip to Phoenix and ordered up a combination that would please my spice addiction - jerk fried rice, jade red chicken, and jerk chicken quesadilla.  They even give you a cookie for dessert.  Score!  Bold flavor.  Surprisingly not greasy.  I was craving more all weekend.  I can't wait to make another visit to Phoenix and go to Chino Bandido again.
