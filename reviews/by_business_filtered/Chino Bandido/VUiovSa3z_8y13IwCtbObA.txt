Asian-Mexican fusion??? We HAD to check it out.
You pick your style, meat, rice and extras.  The actual food was pretty good, it just takes a while to get used to the ordering concept and the menu.
The restaurant itself resembles a large, cold conference building. It was pretty stark and really open. Perhaps they need all the space for lunch rush, but definitely not on a typical Friday night.
