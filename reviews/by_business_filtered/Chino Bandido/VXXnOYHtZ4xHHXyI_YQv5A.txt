I came here with my sister. The restaurant itself was kept at a cool 77 degrees. The employees were patient with me as I sampled the variety of meats and that was super appreciated. The food was great, and the restaurant was filled within a half hour of them opening! That's crazy. What's more crazy is the pictures of the scary children that appear as though they are watching you eat. Jokes aside, it was a great place to go for lunch!
