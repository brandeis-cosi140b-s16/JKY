Friendly service and great bang for the buck, though not really legit fusion food.

Food:
-Decent jade red chicken, but basically tasted like good version of your typical sweet and sour chicken
-Four kinds of fried rice that also tasted straight from a Chinese restaurant everywhere

Decor:
-Dirty cafeteria style with a giant mexican panda statue, which I didn't really find that endearing or understand with its thick belt of bullets

Other than the snickerdoodle cookie (which I thoroughly and guiltily enjoyed) rather than a fortune cookie, Chino Bandido is basically Panda Express with more samples.
