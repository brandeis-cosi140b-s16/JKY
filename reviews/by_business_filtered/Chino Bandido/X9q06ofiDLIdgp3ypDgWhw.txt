I don't even remember who introduced me to Chino Bandido, but I owe them a debt of gratitude. For years it was like this secret club that if you were in the know, you were among a small group. I'm super happy that they have been getting a lot of press and TV coverage the last few years, but their popularity has become a double edged sword since even when I call 20 minutes ahead I wait 20 minutes after arriving. Worth the wait!

The best advice I can give someone who has never been is to go with an open mind and don't be afraid to try everything at least once!
