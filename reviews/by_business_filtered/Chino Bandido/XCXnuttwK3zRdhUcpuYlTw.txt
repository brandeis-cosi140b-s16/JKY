I followed other yelper's advice and drove out of my way today to visit this dive.  My husband and I shared a combo that included the diablo chicken and jade chicken (burrito and quesadilla respectively) with black beans and the pork fried rice.  Everything was very good...the diablo was spicy, so make sure that that is your thing.  All the fried rice likely is cooked in lard, so that's good to know if you're vegetarian.  I really enjoyed the true fusion nature of this restaurant.  Where I come from, you just can't find this.  We will definitely return.
