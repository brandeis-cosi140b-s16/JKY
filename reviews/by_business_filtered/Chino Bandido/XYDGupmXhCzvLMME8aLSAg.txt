Let me just say, Jade Red Trifecta! That includes Jade red chicken, jade red quisadilla, jade red burrito. To answer your question, No I do not  eat all of this. I do know of a few people that do. If you haven't tried this place you have to. It definitely has some character. Put aside the bad decor and you have got a  one of a kind restaurant. Hopefully you will be there on a volcano cookie day. Happy Eating!
