Its hard to ignore the greatness of Mexican food and Asian food exploding in your mouth!  Chino definitely hits my TOP 5 lunch spots in all of Arizona!  
Jade Red, BBQ Pork, Emerald Chicken, Jerk Chicken.....to go along with the best Black Beans and Pork Fried Rice ever...get out of here!  Its amazing. 
And the Snickerdoodle at the end might just be the best part.
