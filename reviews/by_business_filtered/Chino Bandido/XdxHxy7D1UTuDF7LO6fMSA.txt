I went here as the first stop of my cross country road trip with my sister.  I saw it as part of Diners Drive ins and Dives, the show on the food network, and I was determined to eat at some on our way across country.  The concept is Chinese and Mexican food together.  As we walked in the woman at the counter greeted us and asked if we had been in before.  When we said no, she offered us samples of their top 6 or so dishes.  That was AWESOME! We got to try the black beans, which I LOVED. so much so that I had to get a combo.. We also tried the jade chicken, emerald chicken, jerk chicken, jerk fried rice.  I was interested in the Pollo Diablo, and when I said that the lady brought me a sample of that.  It was crispy a little spicy and delicious.  My sister and I ordered a combo with jerk fried rice and the awesome black beans, she opted for the Jade Red Chicken, their most popular,  and I got the Pollo Diablo Quesadilla.  One would think a fried chicken quesadilla might be a little odd, but it was amazing.  The refried cuban black beans are so flavorful I could eat those alone!   I will have to go back when I visit my grandma in Glendale again.  

Oh and the cookies.. yum yum!
