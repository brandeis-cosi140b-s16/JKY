My favorite place is Arizona! Such an amazing combination of Chinese and Mexican food.  The jade red chicken is to die for.  Their teriyaki chicken is so unique, very delicious.  Any time a friend or family member visits, we have to take them here.  They let you sample a lot on your first visit, sometimes I still say it's my first time lol
