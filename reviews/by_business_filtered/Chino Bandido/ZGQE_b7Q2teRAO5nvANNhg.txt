how can you not love a place who's logo is a panda bear dressed in a sombrero? its completely impossible. the hilarity alone sold me but the mere fact that this place serves two cuisines that i could eat every day for the rest of my life doesn't really hurt either.

just to warn you, if you're not prepared you may be overwhelmed by the menu at first. there are a lot of check boxes, a lot of acronyms, a lot of "what the hell did i just tell the woman i wanted to eat?". have no fear, they have pictures for some recommended combinations.  i suggest going with those for first timers. it just makes your life easier and the only question you really have to answer is what kind of rice you want. not so bad. they also give you a goodly sized snickerdoodle cookie to munch on after you've gorged yourself on chinamex food. seriously, is this place trying to make me fat? i know, they didn't hold a gun to my head but i felt obligated to eat the whole thing + cookie. it was my duty =p.
