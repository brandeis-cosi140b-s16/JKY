First impression: Are we in a cafeteria?  There were lines of table and chairs that reminded me of elementary school.  My coworker told me to go up and try the samples for new comers.  The girl behind the counter was very nice and offered me a large number of small samples.  I decided on a combo so I could try a bunch of things.  I had the spicy black beans, pork fried rice, sweet pork and emerald chicken.  I sat down with my coworkers and we were presented with foil to go containers filled with food.  All my coworkers preferred the red jade chicken (sweet n sour).  I thought their Americanized Chinese food was pretty good and very interesting when combined with Mexican food.
