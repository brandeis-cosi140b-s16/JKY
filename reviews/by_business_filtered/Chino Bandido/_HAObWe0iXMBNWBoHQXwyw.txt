I had heard so much about this place so I was excited to try it and see what they hype was about.  Needless to say that I was not impressed at all with what I had.

This place was really situated confusing for a first timer.  I ended up making my mind and having the machaca and white rice.  This meal was nothing to write home about.  Actually, my grandmother and mom made meals similar to this for years with better ingredients and better flavor.  The rice was cold and dry and the meat was cold and flavorless.  I probably wont be taking the drive back out there again unless it is for the snickerdoodle cookies they give which was the best part of the meal!
