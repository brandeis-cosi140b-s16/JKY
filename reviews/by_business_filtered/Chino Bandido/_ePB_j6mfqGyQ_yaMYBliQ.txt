Ordered some delicious jerk chicken and emerald green chicken something.  The flavor on the jerk chicken was hot like I like it, enough to make me sweat a little but just right.  The emerald chicken was a ginger delight-  something you could never make at home and so memorable.  This place is amazing!!  If you are new, tell them--  I did and got a free taste test/sample session.  We were able to taste 3 kinds of meats, the delicious beans, and a mixed up rice.  I will come back here!!  This food is the BOMB!!!  I can't say enough about the high quality and flavorful experience.   Yes it's a dive location but if you want to taste something -- even my taste-dead boyfriend smiled-- you will appreciate the flavors.  wowza.
