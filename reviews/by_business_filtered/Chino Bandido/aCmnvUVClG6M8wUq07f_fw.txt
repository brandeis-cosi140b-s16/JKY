Listen, you have to suspend a little bit of disbelief to enjoy Chino, OK? 

It's not the most stylish or the cleanest looking restaurant you've ever seen. The tables are the same portable kind that you'd register to vote on or lay out your wares at a yard sale and the chairs are like a school cafeteria. You pour your own drinks at the fountain and the napkins are in a wall-mounted dispenser and you pick up your plastic utensils from a bin next to the drink lids and condiment packets. All of the above fits the neighborhood at 19th Ave & Greenway perfectly. There's a trailer park across the street, just south of a horse racing track, know what I'm sayin? 

Enjoy the taste of your food despite your surroundings, right?

Imagine combining the greatest hits of what most Americans know of Chinese, Mexican and Jamaican cuisines, make it affordable along with totally customizable and that's the essence of the concept at Chino. 

I really, really, really like it. I think it is perfectly unpretentious and works great as:

+a lunch stop with co-workers
+a takeout joint at the end of a busy day
+a family restaurant
+a place where you know there'll be something for everyone
+a hangover cure

They make one of the greatest snickerdoodles in the world, too.

You will be overwhelmed your first visit, so take your time (seriously, ten or 15 minutes) and ask for a sample of whatever you're considering.
