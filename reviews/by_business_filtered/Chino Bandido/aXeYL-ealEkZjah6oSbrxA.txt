Still a 5! Ever since my parents found you on Diners, Drive In's and Dives, I have been in love. I literally crave Chino whenever I get a little under the weather now. How did I live in the valley and not know you were here and yet my parents live in California and knew of you? Oh well. I know you now and I drive the distance to fetch your Red Jade.What can I say.. . I love the ChinoB!
