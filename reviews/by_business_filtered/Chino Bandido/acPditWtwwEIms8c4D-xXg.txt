The food at Chino is wonderful...for a fast food-fusion restaurant.  The ordering procedure (you write out orders and hand them to the cashier) is quaint.  But lately, the ambiance has become sub-par.

Sure, there were always tons of little kids (and sometimes adults) running around everywhere, making a mess.  But lately, those messes are not cleaned up promptly enough.  I would be fine with that, if the food was coming out as quickly as it used to.  

Perhaps I'm nostalgic for what Chino's used to be.  Or maybe I'm just getting too old.

The food is still good, but I'm not always willing to overlook everything else.
