The most unique place in Phoenix (land of the chain restaurant). A friend tipped me off to this place about a year after I moved here and it is far and away my favorite place in the valley. I can't come up with a single complaint, delicious food, friendly and helpful staff (free samples of items if you're a first timer trying to decide), a huge plate of food for the price and they even sell beer! This is the first place I take anyone who comes to visit and they usually wind up wanting to eat here again before leaving!
