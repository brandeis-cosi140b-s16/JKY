definitely love the food here. I've only been here twice, but each time the food has been wonderful and the service fast and friendly. 
I would recommend the machaca, carnitas and jen red quesadilla (sweet and sour).

I do like how the food comes in a tinfoil container, so if I want to get my food to go all I need is a lid and it's ready for carry out. 

My one complaint is there is no ice tea. They do have Lipton tea from the fountain, but that's not tea, I don't know what that swill is. If only they would get some fresh brewed tea, this place would get five stars.
