I want to give this place more stars but I just can't....maybe it was an off night, maybe not. I would go back but I wouldn't go out of my way to go there.

The area itself where they are located is not so great, the strip mall is a dump overall and it appeared that someone threw up right outside the entrance which is not a great sign. The inside is brightly lit but dirty. It is in dire need of of a deep cleaning which they then need to maintain.

The ordering process is tricky made even more of a pain by having to dig through my purse to find a pen since there were no pencils and no one who seemed willing to go get more. Once we figured out how to order we headed for the line where one lady double checked that we did it right and then off to another to pay. $28 for 3 meals and 3 sodas. We filled up our drinks and sat down to wait. The food came out in less than 10 minutes but my sons teriyaki chicken was Luke warm at best. I had the red jade chicken which was fairly decent and reminded me of general tso's but more tomato based. My husband had a chili relleno, some sort of chicken and jerk rice....he was very happy with his meal and cleaned his little aluminum bowl out.

Maybe I will give them another shot....maybe not.
