This is one of my favorite places of all time. The food there is amazing. In my opinion you have to try the Jade Red chicken, Black Beans, and chile rellanos. It does look like kinda a dive from the outside but it's very clean inside and the staff is very nice and helpful. The main reason to go is the food though the combination of Chinese and Mexican is great and they give you plenty of food for your money. The other great thing is the snicker doodle cookies there they are the best ones I have ever had and better yet you get a free one with every meal. But take my advice just order a dozen yep they are that good.
