THIS PLACE IS AMAZING! We drove down from Northern California and had to try this place after seeing all the reviews on Yelp.

We were obviously not familiar with the menu but the staff were helpful and nice. We were given a shmorgasboard of items to try.. All of their most popular items. WE loved it.. 

We ate in the dining room and had jerk chicken fried rice, pulled pork, some kind of chicken i cant remember the name of and a black beans. 

I have never had anything like this before and I am completely amazed by the flavor and spice... wow
