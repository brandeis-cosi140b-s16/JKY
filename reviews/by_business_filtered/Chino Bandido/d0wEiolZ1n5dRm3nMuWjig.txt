Saw the Guy Fieri's show. went to chandler location. worst food I ever had. barely warm greasy fried chicken, jerk chicken tough and greasy. shredded beef was so over salted I gagged! presentation looked like a plate of garbage. We sent back the teriyaki chicken as it was undercooked! rice was under-seasoned ,cold and oily. nothing tasted fresh..shame on them.
