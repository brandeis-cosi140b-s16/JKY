Turned onto this place when they catered to our Startup Weekend event.

Tons of options, bunch of different food, confusing but they have like a whole taste-testing deal where they'll let you taste like everything so you know what you're getting into.

Jerk chicken will take your breath away at first, pretty hot but good and all the bowl options with rice and all that stuff is kinda cool.

HUUUGE room to have big groups in.

Food is good... nothing spectacular honestly
