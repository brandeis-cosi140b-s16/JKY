Though I like the concept and the funny panda mascot, I'm not sure what to think of this place.  The customer service was outstanding... we got a detailed menu explanation and samples when we arrived (because we'd never been there before and they weren't too busy) but the space itself lacked any appeal.  The food was... good enough.  My Jerk Chicken Quesadilla was goodish and the Carnitas tastes like Hawaiian kalua pork, which was ok, just not what I was expecting, I guess.

It was all just ok.  Maybe it's just because we went on a rainy, dreary day and there were only 2 other tables there.  The empty atmosphere and 'good enough' food drained me, I think.  I felt like I was in an abandoned mess hall that served things I wasn't in the mood for.  My friend really liked it but, I probably wouldn't go back unless other friends really wanted me to meet them there.  Because of our difference of opinions, I'll bump my 2.5 stars up to 3.

Prolly won't see ya there.
