Took the family and all ate great meals. I love eating something different and this was different but very good.  

I told the guy taking the order that this was a first time and he spent time giving everyone in the family multiple samples so we could decide what to get.  Good service, marketing and sales. 

I would recommend Chino Bandido to anyone wanting a variation on mexican food.
