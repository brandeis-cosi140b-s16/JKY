This place is wonderful. My first time in, they insisted I try ALL of the meats. How awesome is that? I know what im getting, and, (being a little picky) I know I will like it! The jade red chicken is delicious.  A spicy-sweet sauce. I also love the fact that they give you a free cookie for dessert! I must always have dessert. It seemed like the staff cares here. Great way to keep business!
