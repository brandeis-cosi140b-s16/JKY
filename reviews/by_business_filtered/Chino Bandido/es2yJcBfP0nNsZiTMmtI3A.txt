Is this place a world wonder? Or was it created by an act of god? Was it an offspring of a Latina and an Asian? Maybe it was a miracle of science? It most likely happened when they put a panda in a fusing machine with a burrito and thus the restaurant Chino Bandido was created. However the restaurant was created, it has some of the most unique food I ever had. The restaurant is a fuse of Mexican cuisines and Asian flavors and a lot of creativity to make a unique menu.

If it is your first time at the place or you want to try something new on the menu, I would suggest asking for a sample of some of their dishes. Once you figure out which ones are your favorites, you have the next hard task of figuring out whether you want it on a dish, in a burrito, or a quesadilla. All of these choices give you reason to come back several times over to try out something new each time and you can't do it in one sitting because the amount they give you is quite filling.

Also makes sure to take a picture of the panda in sombrero with the awesome mustache or selfie with it.
