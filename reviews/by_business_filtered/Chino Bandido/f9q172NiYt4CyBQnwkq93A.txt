The regular location for #techlunchnorth, I was there again today.

I have been a fan of Chino Bandido for many years, and was pleased to be able to return, after moving back to AZ.

Today I ordered the jerk chicken, and carnitas.

The jerk chicken is always one of my choices; it's moist and tender, and the seasonings have enough of a kick to make it "jerk", but not enough for you to want to call the cook that.

The carnitas seemed a bit dry today. I've had it in the past, but today something seemed off.

Chicken-fried rice, and black beans, to round out the meal.

And the cookie is always a delicious treat after the meal.

Easy and fast, and good flavor. A perfect combination.
