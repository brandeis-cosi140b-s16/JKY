I took my friend from Mexico here and she just laughed at me. "This is such an American thing to do," she said, "taking the most unhealthy things from different cultures, then smothering them with cheese." I didn't hear any complaints in that sentence, really. Chino Bandido is an all-American idea. It's like a bacon and peanut butter sandwich, a deep fried oreo, a Coney Island hot dog eating contest. 

It's just genius. The jade red chicken on it's own is wonderful, but pairing it with black beans or putting it in a gooey cheese quesadilla just enhances the whole experience. And, though my foreign friend laughed, she was happy to box up the leftovers for the next day!

I think the icing on top of this patriotic cake was really the warm snickerdoodle that comes with every meal. My friends have this crazy rule that you smash the cookie with your fist, because it's really fluffy and it makes it bigger if you squish it down a little. There's really no science behind it, but maybe we can start a trend?

This is a true Phoenix essential, and a silly and fun place to take out-of-towners, or just yourself when the mood strikes!
