When we lived in the boonies, we used to eat at the original Chinos in North Phx. Now we live in Chandler so naturally we gravitated toward the location closest to us. The food has always been good, but the counter service...well...that's the reason my rating is only a 2 out of 5.

The rocket scientists they hire to take a simple order need to be administered IQ tests. I ask you, how hard is it to hand a piece of paper to the person who cooks the food? Somehow, this task is far more difficult then I realized. 

Instead of handing the order to the cooks, our order was placed in the "DONE" pile. So naturally, after nearly 30 minutes of waiting, we inquired about our meal. No apology, no remorse - just an "oh". Wow, and you want my repeat business? I think not.

Eat at Chino, just make the long journey to the location in North Phx. They have their act together at that store.
