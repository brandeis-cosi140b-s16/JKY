In Short :
A SUPER HIT fusion of Mexican n Asian.
Quick preparation, Flexible Item selection and humble service.

Details :
Been here so many times during my stay in '12-'13.
Can't resist their Jade-Red Chicken Combo.!! I've tried all other Chicken varieties. Diablo is the spiciest (It hits you a few minutes after you finish eating).
The beans will be topped with Cheese unless if you say no. ;) The fried rice is not the best but sure is tasty. 
THE BEST PART OF THE MEAL IS THEIR FREEEE SNICKER DOODLE COOKIE. (Sometimes they run out of the cookies...Just Stay CALM, leave and comeback the next day.)
They sell them on Weekends if you want more.

Cons:
Zero points for Ambiance. It's like a FF joint. Pay, wait and eat. So be sure who you go with. :)
Not so clean and not so well maintained tables etc. But heyyy who cares when the food is so crazy awesome.!!!
