There isn't a Moon Valley child who's knees don't go weak at the mention of "Jade Red" or "Snickerdoodle."

Chino Bandido Takee-Outee is the taste of my youth, the one redeeming restaurant in the entire Moon Valley area and surrounding. Family favorites are the Jade Red Chicken, Emerald Chicken, and Pollo Diablo. A buddy of mine who worked here in high school turned me on to the Jade Red Chicken and black bean burrito. Wow. It is an ethnic flavor explosion. 

Don't be afraid of the ordering process, they are there to help you through it the first time (and they let you try the most popular dishes!). After that, it's a cinch. The price is right, too, but it really is a hole in the wall. Don't fight it, embrace the dive-y nature.

My only complaint: When I stopped eating meat, I stopped coming to Chino; if you're not carnivorous, the options are pretty limited (the chile relleno is much too greasy for me, the veggie enchilada is a bit al dente). I ache, literally, for that jade red sauce. O, Great Panda, can't you please put it on some vegetables? Tofu? Anything? I was with you long before Guy Fieri.
