I was first turned onto Chino's when I worked at Honeywell 5 years ago and I've been hooked ever since. Their amazing infusion of Chinese and Mexican amongst other types of food is what keeps me coming back. The number of possible combinations is limitless.

Some people may comment on the cleanliness of the place.  All I have to say is in the 5 years I've been a customer I haven't had one complaint.

Take it from me, this place is perfect for the out of towner or first timer.
