....well, I'm part of that group that Brian worked with and religiously make our way to Chino Bandino from Tempe to Phoenix, way before the Chandler location.

I was in Phoenix for Christmas and somehow Chino came up.  My brother's ear perked up and a smile came across his face at the prospect of Mexican and Chinese together.

We went on the day after Christmas and it was the quietest I've ever seen the place.  Fine with me...more for me!  As usual, everything was tasty.  

Oh, how I love you Jade Red Chicken Quesadilla and black beans.  I just can't quit you!

And the snickerdoodles, of coure, I love you too!
