Being new to Phoenix and new to trying Mexican-chinese food. I give this place two thumbs up. If your new, they right a way welcome you with samples of their most popular entrees. This gives you an idea of what they offer and choose from there. Black beans are very tasty and spicy which I like. I had the Jade Red Chicken, which is similar to Orange Chicken but a bit sweeter. My son had chicken teriyaki with rice, they provide perfect portions for my 4 year old, he finished his whole meal which normally doesn't do. Instead of fortune cookies they give you a snicker doodle. Which is pretty darn good. Crispy on the outside, soft and chewy in the middle. We will definitely be returning.
