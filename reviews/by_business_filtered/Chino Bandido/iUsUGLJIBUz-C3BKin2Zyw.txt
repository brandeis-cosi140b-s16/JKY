Tonight was my first time at Chino Bandido.  I did some research and ordered the Jade Red chicken, Emerald chicken, jerk fried rice, and black beans.  The Jade Red was great - crispy, spicy, and a little sweet.  I wouldn't get the emerald chicken again - the only thing giving it flavor were the green onions.  The jerk fried rice was great!  And so were the black beans.  The combo of chinese entrees with latino sides didn't feel weird to me at all.  I'll be coming here again :)
