This is food that you will never know you wanted before you try it, but you will crave it forever after. The black beans and the jerk fried rice are great compliments to the entrees, all of which that I have tried have been delicious. This is no fancy place, and the decor leaves much to be desired, but there's a reason it's always packed at lunch time. Try the pollo diablo, or the jade red chicken, or even the chile relleno.
