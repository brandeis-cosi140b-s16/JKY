Who would have thought this mixture of foods would be so absolutely awesome and tasty? I went here because it was featured on DDD one night...and boy, it was gooooooood as it looked! The food had a little kick to it. Oh, and it's awesome also because they give you a snickerdoodle cookie for dessert. I will be back. Thanks, Guy!
