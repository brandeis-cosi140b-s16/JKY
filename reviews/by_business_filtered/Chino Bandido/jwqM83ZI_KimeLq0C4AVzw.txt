My arteries hate this place, but fortunately they don't get to make decisions.

So many things to love:
1) you can sample their signature dishes
2) combo options- 2 item + side or 1 item + side
3) Carnitas and jade red chicken
4) COOKIES- the volcano, a chocolate fudge snickerdoodle
5) kitschy interior with blatantly racist decor (a giant panda with a sombrero)
6) no frills, hole-in-the-wall vibe

If the most delicious hole-in-the-wall taqueria and your favorite Chinese take-out spot had a baby, it would be a fat sombrero-wearing Panda named Chino Bandido.
