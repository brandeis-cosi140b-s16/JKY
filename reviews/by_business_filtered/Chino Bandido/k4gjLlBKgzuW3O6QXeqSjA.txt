I LOVE the food concept, their portions and have had great food almost every time I've been there. 

The only drawback is their ordering system. If you don't come often, it's hard to remember all the abbreviations and details needed for their ordering form. Their staff hasn't always been eager to make the ordering process easier either. 

Worth figuring out their system for the food though!
