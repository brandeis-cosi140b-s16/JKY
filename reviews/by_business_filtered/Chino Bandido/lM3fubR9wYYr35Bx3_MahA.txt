This is one of my all time favorite "hole in the wall" restaurants.  Been going to Chino's since the only one was way up on the west side - and I was coming from Ahwatukee.

I have turned many people on to Chino's and all have become lifetime fans (except one person who is a bit "picky").

The food is like nothing you can find anywhere else.  It is fantastic.  All served in aluminum to-go containers.  You sit at folding tables on conference chairs, floor is stained concrete, drinks are from styrofoam cups.  This is not 5 star dining, but is AMAZING feel good, happy food.  I have tried everything over the years and my favorites are Jade Red Chicken either plain, in a burrito or in a quesadilla, Emerald Chicken, Chilli Rellano (this is like none you have ever had, crunchy, pick it up and eat it), always-always Caribbean Black Beans and Jerk Fried Rice.

Great place for kids, families, friends.  Casual, easy, feels great.  Literally enough food for 2 full meals.  All meals served with a homemade, warm SnickerDoodle cookie (as if you could possibly eat that after the 2-3 pounds in your order).

I love this place and would highly recommend it.
