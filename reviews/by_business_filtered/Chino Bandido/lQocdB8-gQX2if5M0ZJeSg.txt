I have been there twice and the second was a lot better than the first.  If its your first visit don't try to decipher the confusing looking order slip and just go straight to the counter.  Portions are pretty good but the chile relleno has waaaay too much breading.  Dont bother with the burritos and the cheese quesadillas since they are tiny and totally not worth the price.  The emerald, jerk chicken and fried are excellent though.  I would still have to explore all of their menu to find what i like best.
