As you may have noticed in my profile, I live in Utah.  The night before I was to take a short business trip to Phoenix a few years ago, I happened to catch a then-new episode of _Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives_ on the television.  In it, Guy featured Chino Bandido.  Right away, I knew I would have to find a way to get there on my trip.  As luck would have it, my hotel was located in Mesa--just north of Chandler.  After bribing a hotel employee to break company rules and drive me outside their ridiculously small "approved" shuttle van travel range, I made it to the restaurant.

I know what everybody says: "Chinese Mexican mixed together?  With a little Jamaican added in?  That can't work."  But it does work, quite nicely in fact.  The owners were present and they were just as friendly and helpful as had been portrayed on TV.  When I said it was my first visit, they instantly began offering samples of various menu items to help me make my selection.  They really helped make it a great experience.

These were food types I never would have dreamed of combining.  When my meal was finished, I wondered why I hadn't thought of it before.  It seemed like such a natural combination and I absolutely loved it.  I was so happy, I even bought some t-shirts for myself and my wife (who was jealous that she couldn't be here with me).

This was great food at a reasonable price in a nice location with plenty of parking.  Whenever I hear of a friend going to Phoenix, I always recommend they stop at Chino Bandido.
