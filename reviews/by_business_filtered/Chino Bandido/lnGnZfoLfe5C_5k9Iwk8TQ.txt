Chino Bandito is a very cool idea.  They have a restaurant environment like no other and everyone I know raves about how awesome their food is.  To be honest, I thought their food was very mediocre.  Creativity does not count more than food quality.  Immediately after leaving the restaurant I had a horrible stomach ache.  Then I farted for a good 12 hours in response to the food.  No bueno.  I got the jerk and jade red chicken it wasn't all that people are saying.  Mediocre.  

If you want mexican food, go to a mexican restaurant.  if you want chinese food go to a chinese restaurant.  not worth checking out the fusion.
