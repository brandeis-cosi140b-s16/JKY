Being Chinese and from San Francisco, where there is a loooot of good Chinese food, I was pretty wary of trying Chinese fusion food, especially with Mexican. Came here with my parents during our trip to Arizona and it was surprisingly really good and cheap! 

Service was good and so was the food. I got the jade red chicken with jerk fried rice and black beans. The black beans were too mushy for my taste. The jerk fried rice had kick but good and I absolutely loved the free snickerdoodle that came with it!
