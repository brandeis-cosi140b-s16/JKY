Guilty pleasure, you are calling my name.  

Every now and then I will drive out of my way to eat at Chino Bandido. It's kind of sad actually.  On a night when I'm alone and taking a much needed break from going out with friends, I will order up a ridiculous meal of fried rice, Cuban black beans, and jade red chicken in a quesidilla. Then, I will sit down with my friend the DVR and watch bad TV. Basically, I do two things that are embarrassing to do with others: watch horrible TV and eat horribly unhealthy food. Sometimes, I actually let a friend join me and after the taste explosion in our mouths has worn off we are left grabbing our stomachs and moaning in pain, "I am never eating this again." 

When you eat a meal at Chino's, just know that you are done. You will not be doing anything else for the rest of the day/night, you will not go dancing, you will not go on a bike ride, and you will not be having any sex. You will just sit there until your stomach digests all the contents of that round metal container they cram everything into. Enjoy.
