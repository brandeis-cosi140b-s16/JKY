Saw this places on Food Network's Diners, Drive-in's, and Dives.  Man, this place was WAY WAY better than it was on TV.  

Chino Bandido is a fusion of Mexican, Chinese, and Jamaican food.  I had the Emerald & Jade Red Chicken with Jamaican jerk fried rice.  Also a order of chicken quesadillas. I can not say the last time I was so satisfied with a meal.  The Emerald Chicken is by one of the best things I ever had.  And the Jerk fried rice was different, but very good.

The service was great.  We told the cashier that it was our first time here and that we saw it from Triple D.  He was more then helpful with suggestions, giving us samples to try.  We came in for lunch and the place was pretty busy, so when the server brought out our order, she threw in a couple of snicker-doodle cookies for our wait.  We was so impressed because our order only took 10-12 mins to come out.  I like that they make costumer service. 

Another thing this place has going for it is the price.  Very low, which made this place a huge value for what your getting.  

The Staff are all very friendly and everyone seem to get along great together.  All eager to make you feel welcomed.  The restaurant doesn't look very big outside but on the inside its very spacious.  It has the cashier on the right and a huge cafeteria area on the right.  Very clean.  

Its located in a shopping center next to other eatery, so parking is not a issue.

I love this place.  It has amazing value!  The food taste great.  Thank you Triple D, I will be back!
