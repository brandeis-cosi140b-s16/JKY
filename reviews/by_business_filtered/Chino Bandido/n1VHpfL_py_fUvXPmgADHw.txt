Visited 7/31/13. 

I have been to the original in Phoenix and was much more impressed with the food. 

On this visit, we were there about 5:00 p.m. on a Wednesday night.  There were only a few other people present. 

The food was not very fresh.  It seemed like it may have been sitting in warmers for a while. The fried rice was dry.  The black beans not very fresh. The meat was dry. I also had a relleno.  It was more crust and cheese then chili.

I am still a fan. And will try this location again when it is busy. Maybe during lunch or weekend time to see if the food is fresher.

Three stars this time only because of the memory I have of the my first visit to the original in Phoenix.
