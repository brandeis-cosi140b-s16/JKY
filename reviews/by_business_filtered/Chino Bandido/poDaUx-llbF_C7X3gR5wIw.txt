I had heard of this place before it was featured on the Food Network's show, I just never realized that it was only a few miles away from my place. Had the opportunity to try last night. We walked in and the staff was very friendly. They seemed to realize our confusion over where to sit and how to order. An employee gave us samples of about six different menu items. All were tasty. The refried black beans were not spicy at all. I ordered the jerk chicken in a quesadilla, the jade red chicken and jerk fried rice. Each was delicious! Along w/ a drink and volcano cookie (which is more like a brownie/cookie), the dinner cost about $10 per person. Very reasonable for the amount of food you get.  I can't believe it took me this long to come to this place. I will definitely be back!
