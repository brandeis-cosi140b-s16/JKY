I just can't help but love a place so unique.  And what is unique, if not a place you can get jerk chicken, refried beans, and pork fried rice all sharing the same humble pie tin?

This has become the spot I need to return to every time I visit my family out West (my family is more than happy to oblige).  The jerk chicken is my absolute favorite, mainly because where am I gonna go in Michigan to get Caribbean food?  (Answer: Nowhere) Apart from that, I had things here I've never even heard of!  Special mention for the emerald chicken, which is one of the few dishes involving meat that I can honestly describe as tasting "fresh".

Only about nine more months and I'll be back in line, order sheet in hand.
