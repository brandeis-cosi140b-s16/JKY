We found this place through Food Networks Diners, Drive-In and Dives. We really enjoyed it. The service was fast and friendly during a lunch time crowd. We had Jade Chicken and the Jerk Chicken. The Jerk Chicken was ok but better suited for someone who really likes a strong Jerk seasoning. The Jade Chicken was listed as the Favorite and we agree. The Jade chicken had a great combination of spicy and sweet flavors. The portions were excellent. This place could make a 5 star rating if they could keep the tables clean a little better, fresh coat of paint on the walls and nicer tables. However all of this stuff added to the "dive" feeling. Overall I would recommend this place to anyone!
