Good stuff!  My fiancee is a huge fan of this place and will be back for sure.  So it's like a Mexican and Asian fusion with some Jamaican flare.  They have a lot of dishes and you can combine the different flavors.  The only complaint is the ordering can get a little confusing.  I remember ordering a dish on the card and what came out was something different from what I was expecting.  Regardless it was good and delicious.  My lady loves the Emerald Chicken and Polo Diablo, which were good, but I really enjoy the jade chicken and chinese bbq pork.

Overall they have a good variety of different flavors.  You can get bowls, burritos, and quesdillas.  I would recommend this place.
