Just ate there for the first time and absolutely loved it. We were allowed to sample a few items before we purchased, something I wish more restaurants would do. I ended up getting the jerk fried rice, red chicken chicken and pulled pork. The rice was very flavorful with a little kick. The chicken was great too ( I can see why it's their best seller). I also had refried black beans for the first time too. The only thing I dont like about this place is that it's too far of a drive for me to become a regular.
