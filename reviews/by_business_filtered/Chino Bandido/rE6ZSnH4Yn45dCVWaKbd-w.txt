Great food. Really liked having the system explained and samples provided when we walked in. This place has character. The dining area could use a little updating. Prices are reasonable. Food is served in aluminum pie pans, which is kind of cool but vaguely makes me worry about recycling. Everyone was super friendly. We were out of state and stopped by on the way to the airport  because of the reviews and the Guy Fieri reference.
