Chino Bandido is a mishmash of complete awesomeness!  This dive serves up some of the best mexican and asian fast food in the valley, and it's all on one dish.  The ordering process is confusing, and the decor (or lack there of) leaves a ton to be desired, and the place has a dirty feeling and is located in a pretty sketchy strip mall, but that's what creates its charm.

For those who do not know.  Chino offers up mexican and asian foods.  You can have it in a rice bowl, a combo bowl (two items plus beans and rice), grilled up in quesadilla, or wrapped in a burrito.  To order, you get a little form that can be odd to fill out, but they'll help you get it right (I don't get why they don't just ask you what you want and fill it out themselves, but it did feel like an accomplishment to get it right).  The best part about Chino (besides the food) is how friendly the staff is.  When we walked in, I informed the guy who greeted us that my parents had never been to either of their locations, so right away he told them to step on over, and he gave them some generous samples of their more popular dishes, and a pretty good description how the foods were cooked.

The food is high quality fast food.  Very unique and flavorful.  Plus every order comes with a snicker doodle, where can you go wrong?  The dining area is made of plastic costco tables and chairs and a big tv playing espn.  Very odd, but that's what makes Chino the wonderful dive that it is.
