So I have heard of this place from co-workers and friends and finally today I decided to go for it. I was not disappointed. I can eat.. A lot in one sitting and I enjoy tasty food. The amount of food you get for your money is awesome and the dishes are amazing.   Jerk rice, refried beans, and jade chicken in a quesadilla, with Diablo chicken was outstanding. Will definitely be coming back here and for sure going to tell everyone I know how great this place is.
