We were visiting from LA, and tried to do a few restaurants featured on DDD.  Since we were close to Chandler, we hit this location rather than the original Phoenix location, but the food and concept was the same so it's all good.

I was actually surprised how much we ended up liking this place.  My wife had the Emerald (Ginger) chicken and egg foo young combo bowl, and I had the Jade chicken and Emerald combo bowl.

It's been written many times before how this place works, so there's not much to add other than the food is actually really really good.  All white meat chicken, the flavors were good, and the Jade chicken was the shizzle.

DDD joints are sometimes hit or miss, but this was a hit.  Nice people, good food.  It was really empty on a Friday evening, though, so I hope it sticks around.
