I ate there with a friend, it was just OK. I order the jade chicken and jerk chicken. My friend ordered same thing. The jade chicken was so tough like leather me and him both returned it. The jerk chicken was good but would set your mouth on fire. The watermelon Ice Tea they had was pretty good. I will go back but for my first time I wasn't really impressed but all business have there bad days.
