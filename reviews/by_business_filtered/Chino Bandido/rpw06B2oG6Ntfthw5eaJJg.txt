Chino is always an experience.   It's always fun to watch new people try to figure out how to order at Chino.  If you are going for lunch on a weekday...get there early. 

I personally think there is too much hype over Chino.  The food is just "ok".  It's nothing to rave over in my opinion.   The complimentary cookie is a nice touch though.

The machaca quesadilla is my favorite.  Jade Red Chicken is good too.  

They raised their prices not too long ago and now I don't go there so often.
