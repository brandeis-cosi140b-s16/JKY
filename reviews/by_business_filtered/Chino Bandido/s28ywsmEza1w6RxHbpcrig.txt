OK this place has been on diners drive-ins and dives and I have been here a handful of times. It is the one place where when you are talking about going out and grabbing food that everyone forgets, however when you remember it everyone always says HECK YEAH!!

Chino Bandido is Chinese Mexican fusion (yeah I know at first it sounds NASTY) but they really make it work.

When you go in immediately to your right you will see order forms. Now I will be honest the first time, and the second time I went in I wondered how I was supposed to fill it out. It appeared that I would need to use college level algebra. However if you ask the staff they will explain it and it actually is really easy.

My favorite is the combination of Jade Red Chicken and Teriyaki Chicken, with Jerk Fried Rice and Refried Beans.

Warning the Jerk Chicken is HOT (now I can hear my friend Chris in the background calling me a weenie, however be warned.) With each dish they have cookies either a snickerdoodle which is awesome but their volcano cookies are DELICIOUS. You get a chocolate cookie you put a warm gooey center and top with powdered sugar.

All in all one of my favorite places in the Valley to eat in or bring home.
