Chino Bandido is maybe the oddest restaurant I've ever been to, with the strangest combinations of food, but I can't get enough of it! Mexican, Chinese, and Caribbean all together at one restaurant? Count me in. I live in California now and all my friends here know about Chino's because it always happens to come up in conversation (totally my fault). When they come to visit me in Arizona, Chino's is our first meal. I honestly could not recommend this place enough! 

Everything I've tried here has exceeded my expectations and I'm somehow okay with eating fried rice, refried beans, and teriyaki chicken all in the same bite now. All the entrees you order can be made in a burrito or quesadilla as well, but the burritos are essentially just whatever meat you order wrapped in a tortilla so I usually go for the quesadillas or leave the meat as is to eat with rice and beans. If it's your first time, they'll even give you samples of the most popular items when you walk in!

Not only is the food delicious (I usually get a combo with a jade red chicken quesadilla, emerald chicken, jerk fried rice, and refried beans) but the service is quick and easy. And on top of that, you get a free snickerdoodle with your order! It's the best. Go in with an empty stomach and get ready to be blown away, but if there's any takeaway from this review, it should be to get the jade red chicken quesadilla every single time you go. Seriously, you won't regret it.
