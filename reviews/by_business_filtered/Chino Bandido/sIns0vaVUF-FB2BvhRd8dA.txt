This is a very unique restaurant. When we walked in, they offered us a sample of anything on their menu to try before ordering. We ended up ordering the red jade chicken & fried rice, and a combo with the shredded pork & the jerk chicken burrito with beans & rice. The beans were really salty but the red jade chicken & fried rice were good. The location itself is hidden in a parking lot & is pretty hard to find. The food wasn't the greatest but not bad either ... Just okay.
