Chino Bandido is one of the first places that comes to mind when I want something quick and easy, yet unique. I like to introduce anybody that visits me out here to this place.  A great blend of flavors and plenty of choices.  

I always get the two item combo.  ALWAYS Jerk chicken fried rice (one of the more flavorful rices).  ALWAYS black beans (not your typical black beans!  the refried beans are just.... refried beans).  Jade chicken is a favorite for all you people who like your deep fried battered pieces of chicken in some citrusy-sweet sauce.... the kind of Chinese item that white people love to eat from Panda :-)   It's one of my favorites too... probably because I grew up eating fried chicken.  Emerald chicken is more what I think my parents would like.... onion-y and ginger-y flavors on non-fried chicken.  Whatever your tastes, it's all good.  

They're great about letting you sample the different items.  And the snickerdoodle they give with your meal is a perfect end to your meal!
