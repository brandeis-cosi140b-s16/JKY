Chino bandidos is probably not one of the best restaurants in the valley.....But it is one of the top 3 most delightfully INTERESTING dining combinations I have experienced anywhere on the planet so far. 

Mexican & Chinese with a twist of Jamaican is a crazy combo of taste variations to find in the desert. This uniquely American melting pot concept seems to pull it off really against all odds in my mind ....

I can still remember my bewilderment the first time I was exposed to this mexi-nees-ican (?) menu and absolutely friggin LOVE to bring people here to watch their reaction.

Also the 7,500 pound mascot in the dining room has to be mentioned at least once... and maybe photographed several times just be cheesy.  

Although I have had EVERYTHING on the menu at least once. My favorite is the Jerk Chicken. Served on a bed of rice and enjoyed with a Red Stripe, it's what I came all the way to the Sunny Slope area for.  Any time I possibly could. That, and the snikerdoodle that was carefully stowed away in the trunk safely for a midnight session.

These days they have 2 locations and the new one is just as far away as the original. I will faithfully drive where ever they are in the valley maybe once a year. The staff will let you try what ever you want.  And I have never taken anyone who didn't like it. Just know that you can combine EVERYTHING so maybe get creative ...on your second or third time...

 Don't be demure on asking what other ppl/staff like...Everything's good in my opinion... Neighborhood atmosphere ...Some of it's greasy as all hell but great food none the less.
