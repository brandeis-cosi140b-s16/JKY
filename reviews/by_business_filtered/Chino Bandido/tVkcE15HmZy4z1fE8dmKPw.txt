Yo, you like Chinese food right? And of course you love Mexican food, you're in Arizona. Then you will LOVE this place. The wonderful place combines two fantastic food genres and makes them fantasticer by combining them. You can get Jade Chicken in a burrito! Or in a quesadilla! Even if you don't want to combine Mexican food with Chinese food, eating them in a more traditional (?) way is still an amazing treat. 

You can take the food to go and sit down inside. The restaurant setting is a little bare bones but they bring your food to your table so it comes out even? You also get a free cookie so that's awesome!

Possibly the best thing about this place is the mascot. It's probably the most racist mascot ever. Panda wearing a sombrero with six shooter. Ridiculous and I love it
