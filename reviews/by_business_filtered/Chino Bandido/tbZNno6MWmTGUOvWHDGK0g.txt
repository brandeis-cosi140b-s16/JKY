We are a divided family on this one. Husband likes it. Wife--not so much. Wife is writing this review. Our favorite is their egg foo young and Snickerdoodle cookies. Sometimes it's good; sometimes is sucks--cookies included. Check take-out orders carefully. Not always correct. I usually recommend eating here when I'm not hungry.
