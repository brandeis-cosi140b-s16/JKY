Staff was very friendly. They walked us through the menu and let us sample a few items before ordering. Order came out with Cuban black beans instead of the refried beans we ordered. They were ok but did not like the sweetness of them. Food was ok. Not bad. But not amazing either. The green sauce on the emerald chicken was good on its own but overpowered everything else on the plate. All I could taste and smell was the ginger. And I love ginger. The concept of ordering everything individually for a combo is nice, but once everything is piled on top of itself it is overwhelming. The snickerdoodle at the end was yummy though. It was worth a try but not sure I will be back.
