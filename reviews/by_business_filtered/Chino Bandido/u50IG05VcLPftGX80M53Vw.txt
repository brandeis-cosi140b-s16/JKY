Seriously 4 stars?? I don't get the high rating for this place. Yes the staff is friendly but that's it. It's basically 1 step lower than Panda Express except with a Mexican flair. The different meat options border on tasteless and dry to overly spiced and not in a good way. And the price was way too high considering the quality. The place was crowded though with kids and stoners so that might explain the high ratings. This place was featured on the food network by that blond spiky haired dude so that should have been my first indication how this dining experience would be. Lesson learned..
