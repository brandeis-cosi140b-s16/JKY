Went here with a large group after a tech conference as my first time. The picture menu helps you decide what to eat, but the free taste test helps even more. I went with the Red Jade Chicken, which was like a sweet-and-sour chicken. It was pretty good... I wouldn't say that it's any better than Panda Express though. The meal came with a cookie (ftw). 

I'd go back if someone else was driving. It's not close to my house and it didn't have that "amazing"  feel that would make me drive to have it. 

They have beer though... bonus.
