Chino Bandido's Mexican, Chinese, and Jamaican mash-up is like Jeremy Lin and the Knicks, Kanye and Coldplay, hot Cheetos and cream cheese - where an unexpected combination creates a product more successful and satisfying than its individual parts. 

Before going any further, note that everything is better in quesadilla form - neither the burrito nor a la carte match up to what a crispy tortilla enveloping a layer of melted cheese can provide.  

The Red Jade Chicken and Jerk Chicken were among my favorites, but the Emerald Chicken blew my mind.  Having been raised in a Chinese household, the chicken breast with fresh ginger and green onion sauce was a staple at every major meal.  However, being crafted into a quesadilla raised this familiar dish's flavor ceiling by 298374908 levels.  Henceforth, whenever I encounter this chicken at a family meal, part of me will inevitably pine for it to be encased in a tortilla, oozing with cheese.

The jerk fried rice and pork fried rice are both flavorful and great complements to the quesadilla, with the pork fried rice coming out slightly ahead in terms of richness in taste.  The jerk chicken overwhelms the rice a bit, while the pork creates a more natural blend with the rest of the ingredients.
