This place was pretty awesome. They could really use a revamp on the inside, it feels like a cafeteria, which I didn't love. But the food was awesome! Wrapping the chicken in a burrito gives it a twist for sure. Otherwise you can order it like normal Chinese food with rice. Their jerk rice was really good and their version of sweet and sour chicken was amazing. I will be going back, but just for take out next time.
