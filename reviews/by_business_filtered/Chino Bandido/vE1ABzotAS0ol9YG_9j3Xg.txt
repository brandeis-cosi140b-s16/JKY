I have a pretty similar experience with Jenn H. in that the first time I came, I wasn't impressed at all (I'd probably say that I was disappointed), but the second time I came, I really enjoyed this funky fusion.

I came here on the recommendation of a friend that had came here a few years earlier on a road trip that passed through Phoenix. Not really knowing how the menu worked, I just ordered the "Jade Red Chicken" rice bowl because it was supposed to be the most popular item on the menu. I was pretty disappointed when I found out that I had gone all the way to Phoenix (for the Fiesta Bowl) for a bowl of General Tso's chicken with white rice. As I was eating I saw people order eating some pretty wild stuff (like chinese bbq pork "char siu" quesadillas, etc.) so I was pretty adamant about coming back and trying this place again. 

I got a chance to go back two days later and instead of getting a rice bowl, I got the combo where you can choose two items off the menu (and turn them into a burrito/quesadillas if you'd like) along with rice of your choice and beans. So I got the jade red chicken again (this time in a quesadillas) and then I got the emerald chicken, which a buddy of mine had last time and looked good, along with jerk fried rice and black beans. 

Being both a fan of chinese and mexican cuisine (in the traditional sense), I knew that this place was going to challenge my view of food marrying the two together. But I actually really enjoyed it. I should strongly stress the point that you need to "get" the menu before you should order. The staff is pretty nice about explaining the concept of the menu to you (it'd help if you ask, which I didn't the first time until AFTER I ordered). 

With the freedom in the menu, however, I should probably warn my fellow Yelp!ers that I can see how some of these combination can go wrong and come back and blow up on you (or maybe inside of you, hahaha). Good luck mixing!!
