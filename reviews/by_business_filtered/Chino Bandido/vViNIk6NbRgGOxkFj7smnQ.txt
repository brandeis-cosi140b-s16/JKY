Family was in town and they couldn't decide what to eat, so i asked them to name some foods they liked. They named Mexican and Chinese food so I hopped on trusty Yelp to search for something to eat. Chinese/Mexican fusion? Hmm, now this I had to try! When I pulled up to the place I was instantly hesitant as the exterior looked quite unimpressive. I walked in and it was even less impressive, but the place was packed! Were they giving away free food? The dining room looked like a school cafeteria...why would so many people be here. I then caught a whiff of the food...mmmm! Hopped in line and then started to decipher the menu posted on the wall. I was a little confused. Jade Red chicken Quesadilla? Jerk Chicken Burrito? Why had I not thought of Chinese food in a burrito before?! Mind blown! Ordered both of these in a combo form which were accompanied by pork fried rice. The Jerk chicken was quite spicy, but  full of flavor. The jade red chicken had good balance and was probably the one I enjoyed more of the 2. To top it all off, the place gives you a free snickerdoodle cookie. The prices were incredibly cheap and the amounts of food were really good. Definitely recommend the place.
