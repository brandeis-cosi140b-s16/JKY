The food was really good and the portions were nice for a $12 meal. This place is definitely a dive so I wouldn't suggest taking anyone that is a little "uppity" here. Chino's definitely has some history and wear to it's building, but I have no doubt that the way they handle and prepare their food is clean.

I'm not that adventurous of an eater so it was nice try some samples before deciding what I wanted. The lady was really patient with everyone requesting samples and took the time to show everyone how to "order the Chino way". I ended up getting the emerald chicken, steamed rice, machaca beef, and black beans. Overall, the meal was filling, service was great, and the free cookie certainly helped.
