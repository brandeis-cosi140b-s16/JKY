There are some problems with this place.  They don't include the service which is superb.  The menu is weird, but not too difficult.  The food is a different story.  It's good, but I don't get all the hype.  The chili relleno really sucks!  Super thick cracker crumbs, no sauce, thick yellow cheese, (not completely melted.....two times!!!) and non-roasted chili make for an atrocious relleno!! The Diablo Chicken...good...if you like butt loads of garlic. (Which I do) I haven't found the perfect combo yet.  I'll keep working on it, but don't expect to be blown away, and if you get the relleno after reading this...shame on you...bad foodie.  Don't do it... 
To end on a positive note....service is outstanding.  Very friendly staff.  You can sample stuff...do it!  I'm giving an extra star due to the service.  Lot's of potential here.
