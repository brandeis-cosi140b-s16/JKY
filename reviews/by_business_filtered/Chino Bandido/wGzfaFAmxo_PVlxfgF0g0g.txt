First came to this place awhile back prior to their entr√©es being similar to combos. I liked their Jerk chicken and fried rice and their red jade chicken. I went back here recently and still enjoyed their jade chicken with steamed rice- it's a bit of a rich dish as far as flavor and sauce goes, but it's quite good. 

I tried a little bit of my hubby's machaca quesadilla, and it was also quite good. I'd definitely come back to this place. The prices aren't too bad and there's a decent amount of things to choose from.
