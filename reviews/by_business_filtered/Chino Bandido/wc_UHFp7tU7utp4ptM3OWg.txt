This isn't fine dining by any stretch, but if you're looking for a really satisfying inexpensive meal, you can't go wrong with Chino Bandido. The menu can seem a bit daunting for first timers, let the cashier know if you haven't been there before. The people are always friendly and they'll give you lots of samples. 

My favorite menu items are the Jerk Fried Rice and the Jade Red Chicken.
