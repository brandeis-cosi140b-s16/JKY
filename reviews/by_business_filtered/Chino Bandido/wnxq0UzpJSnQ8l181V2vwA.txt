This is a great place.  The food is super yummy and the service is always great.  My only complaint is that there is an off smell in the building.  Clearly that doesn't keep me away though,  the food is too good. 
I do love that they have Legos to play with, but it would be great is they washed or bleached them every once in awhile, they are pretty dirty.  That and the smell are the only reason I docked a star.
