Amazing.

If you can't imagine what Mexican-Asian fusion would taste like, Chino's is a must-see. There is nothing like it and the food is outstanding. 
I never thought soy sauce would be good on refried beans either.

I recommend the Jen Red Chicken and the Chinese BBQ Pork.
Hengrenade Chicken is good too if you like the flavor of Jerk but not all the pepper.
