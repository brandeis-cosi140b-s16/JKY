This is Mexican Panda Express, and it is crazy. Crazy, and crazy delicious. Located in a strip mall, just look for the huge "Panda bandit" cartoons on the window.

Choose your "meat" -- the popular items like "Jade Chicken" is essentially a spicy version of orange chicken. Emerald chicken, a runner up, is boiled chicken with a minced ginger, scallions oil based sauce -- which is better with rice than in a tortilla since it's not as salty.

Then, throw that into a burrito, taco, or have it with rice and beans "remix." The beans have been flavored with hoisin or oyster sauce to give it a sweet, umami tang. There's also "jerk fried rice" which is... rich, spicy and a great contrast to the meat dish. 

Finishes with a large snickerdoodle cookie, which was a little out of place, but hey, cookies!

Cafeteria style seating, order and sit down and they'll bring the food to you. At 8-10 bucks per meal, it's quite a steal, and a must try if you find yourself in Arizona.
