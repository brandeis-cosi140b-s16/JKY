How have I never been here before? Looks can be deceiving with this strip mall dive-looking place that has a cafeteria feel.  When one of the staff noticed me staring at the menu, he offered me samples of the most popular dishes and I was grateful. I ended up ordering the jade chicken quesadilla style and the emerald chicken. The food was fresh and fantastic! The emerald chicken sauce had a great flavor that made me want to keep eating it and the quesadilla with the tangy, sweet and spicy jade chicken was mouth watering. The free volcano brownie topped with powdered sugar was a perfect ending! Everyone should try Chino Bandido!
