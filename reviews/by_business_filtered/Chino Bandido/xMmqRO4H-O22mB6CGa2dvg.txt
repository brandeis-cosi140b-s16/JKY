I got a combo to go and it was prepared quickly. I went at a less busy time when there wasn't a line. The cashier guy wasn't very friendly. But the girl who gave me my to go meal was nice and helpful in putting my sauces and such in the bag before she tied it closed. They should put the less friendly people in back where they don't need to talk to anyone. And put the friendly people at the registers since that's the first impression people get and it sets the mood for their experience on that particular visit.

It's good to see they are not charging the Visa/Mastercard fee. That may be because they had a really bad experience when they first tried charging 25 cents extra for charge many years ago. If they are charging the extra fee now, they MUST display in an obvious location near the register that they are adding the credit card use fee.  Otherwise that would be in violation of the Visa/Mastercard policy with merchants.

So, be sure to check your itemized receipt and ask for it.
