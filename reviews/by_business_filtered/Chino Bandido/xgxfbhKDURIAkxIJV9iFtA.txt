I am finally getting around to writing a review about thsi place even though i was there months ago.  This place is mind blowing!  

You dont come here for the atmosphere but rather the amazing food and the crazy blend of mexican and asian flavors.

I know mexican/asian flavor? Insane but it works.

They even give you a cookie for dessert.
