Another star gone, and how strange that this terrible thing occurs the day I become the Duke of chino. 

The food portions thing is bad enough, but the other deteriorating aspect of chino is the service. I remember for the past 8 years, coming to chino was a sure way to put a smile on your face...the people seemed happy to be here, and happy that you were here to experience their amazing food.

The past four or five times I've come it's not even mediocre service, it's downright depressing. The dude waits with little expression as you fill out your order form, as you approach you wait for some sort of greeting, smile, or...well anything. No luck. He grabs the form and says "$10.20 Jake". You pay, and that's that. Done. Over. 

Fortunately, as I was writing this they called my name and a woman was waiting with a smile and a few friendly quips...I'm afraid to say that's a rarity. 

This may well be my last visit to chino. I can't stand to see one of the most special places in Phoenix to me reduced to anything less than what it had always been.
