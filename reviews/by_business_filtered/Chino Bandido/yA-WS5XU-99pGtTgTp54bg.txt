Alright, I want to take the next few moments to get on a heart-to-heart connection level with you. I love to travel, and have been to many continents and establishments the world over, and still....Chino Bandito is like nothing I have ever experienced before.

**Disclaimer: This is not Mexican food; This is not Chinese food. 

Upon first entering the Chandler Chino Bandito (or China Bandit), one will be greeted by a (seated) giant stone Panda bear that is sporting a mustache and a giant sombrero. It weighs a little over a few tons, and had to be brought in on rollers. I know right?!

Chino Bandito offers a fusion of Chinese and Mexican food combinations that will intially make you scratch your head, but leave anticipating your next visit. For first time visitors they will allow you taste testers of their different rices, beans, and meats so that you can make your choice of burritos, quesadillas, or rice bowls. 

My personal favorite is a two item combo with their Jen Red Quesadilla, Jerk Fried Rice, and special spicy black beans.

The fun thing is that you can choose what type of meats (asian or mexican flavored..don't worry, they have many) you would like to have in your burrito/quesadilla. 

My suggestion would be to get something that doesn't look like it would work well together (i.e. A teriyaki burrito, or an orange {Jen Red} chicken quesadilla). You'll be glad you did.

I can't say this about many things, but I give Chino Bandito a 5/5 easy.

I am only sad I don' live closer.
