I went here months ago and forgot to Yelp about it--oops!  This place was just OK.  I had high expectations with the hundreds of great reviews on here plus it was on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives.  The staff is awesome!  They were very friendly and let us sample some of the best sellers to help us make up our mind.  We settled on the Jade Chicken and carnitas.  Both of the meats were very good.  We decided to have the carnitas in a quesadilla, which was delicious.  The Jade chicken was very good too.  My least favorite part of the meal was the rice.  It was very sweet and tasted like it had a lot of five spice in it.  The free snickerdoodle was really good though, so that kinda made up for it.  I don't know if I'd come back again.  The portion sizes are quite small (compared to most Mexican and Chinese restaurants where they really load you up) and the prices are a bit high for what you get.
