Chinese $ Mexican!!! 2 cuisines that are usually peoples favorite. I've been here once and let me tell you, great stuff. I went here with about 10 people and they all loved it. Especially the Red jade Chicken.....awesome. The Emerald chicken in a quesadilla was also a favorite. Make sure you order the black beans and the jerk fried rice. Seriously don't forget. I do have to say it is kinda weird being served in a aluminium foil bowl, but who gives a S%$t, the food in it is good. I will come here everytime I visit my bro in the big AZ. Peace.
