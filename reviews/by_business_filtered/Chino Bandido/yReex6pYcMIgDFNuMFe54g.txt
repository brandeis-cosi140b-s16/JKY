Feel good tasty comfort food served here.

Don't understand the menu?  Just ask for the first timers tasting tour.  From that point, it becomes pretty clear and order away...

Me?  A man who loves Chinese and Mexican food, and thinks the hybrid of two is a natural match when you consider that mix has been created many times from leftovers in my fridge?  Sold.

I had a 2 meat combo of Emerald Chicken (white chicken breast with a green ginger mix) and Carnitas.  Delicious and a fine mix between the two.

My sides were the Cuban black beans (smashed beans, not whole) and white rice.  God, I love that mix.  All I'm missing are plantains.

Throw in a soda and my entire meal was under $10.  

Straight up, a very good place to eat with king flavor. 

The only thing I'll say is, they need some music in that place.  It makes it a little dreary, being all quiet.  Then again, it is quiet because the people are busy stuffing their faces.
