I hated this.  I nearly got lynched for saying so.  This place came highly recommended (by not only Food Network's Guy Fieri of DDD but ALL our friends) and everyone swears we must've just hit it on an "off" night...but it was completely abysmal!  

I had the teriyaki chicken, carnitas pork, black beans, and jerk fried rice.  Hubby had egg foo young and some kind of burrito.  Honestly, it was like the bastard offspring of the crappiest TV dinner we've ever had.  ALL of the food had the exact same flavor and texture (uber-salty, flavorless, mush).  

The restaurant was packed and dirty; they didn't bother to wipe down tables as customers vacated.  Also, they got annoyed and curt with you if you showed up at the register and do not have an order card filled out, as though you're supposed to automatically know they have a special ordering system.  

Maybe they stopped making quality food when they learned they could ride on the notoriety the TV exposure got them...or maybe we did just hit it on a bad night.  Either way, we won't be back.
