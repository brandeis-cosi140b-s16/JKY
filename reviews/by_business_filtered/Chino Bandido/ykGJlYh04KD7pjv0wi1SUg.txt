My husband and I love this place and often bring out-of-towners here because, hey, where else can you get Chinese/Mexican/Jamaican food? It's completely unique.  The food is good, filling, an inexpensive.  As a vegetarian, I don't have tons of options, but I normally get the veggie salad as a quesadilla (which is terrific) and the egg foo yung (without meat - even mentioned on the menu as an option).  I LOVE their black beans - I'm not sure what they do to them, but they are tasty and slightly spicy.   I also like being able to get plain white rice with my order.  And the snickdoodle cookies are SO GOOD!
