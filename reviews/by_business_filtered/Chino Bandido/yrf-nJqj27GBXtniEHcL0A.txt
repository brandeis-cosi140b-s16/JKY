Saw this place on the DDD tv show and had to travel to Phoenix on business so we decide to try this unusual combo of  Mexican, Chinese and Jamaican cuisine. We totally loved Chino Bandito,! Jade red chicken, pork fried rice and egg fu young in my combo bowl. My husband had black beans, jerk chicken, jade red chicken quesadilla  and jerk fried rice. All yummy. The bonus is the bill came to $18 for the two of us with 2 sodas and two cookies! The cookies were delicious too, can't wait to go back
