A sort of mystery I've heard about but had never experienced, my boyfriend proposed that we go here with his parents a few nights ago. It's tucked in the pack of a shopping center, and we were surprised at how big it is inside. The ladies behind the counter were very nice, and after learning we had never been there before, we got to taste 6 of their most popular menu items. After tasting them, I decided on a combo with regular refried beans, plain fried rice, jade red chicken, and a jerk chicken quesadilla. We took a seat at one of the GIANT tables they have and patiently waited before our food was brought out to us. 

Once our food came out, we quickly dug in. I really liked the flavor of the jade red chicken, and I didn't want to taint it by putting it in a burrito or quesadilla, but it stands up just on its' own. Being Jamaican, I liked the jerk chicken, it could have been more flavorful but jerk chicken isn't Chinese or Mexican so I won't fault them there. It made a pretty tasty quesadilla though. Something about the rice and beans didn't rock my world, it has a sweet aftertaste which I'm not really a fan of. Maybe it was just the batch? 

Anyways, I could barely finish half of it, and saved the rest for later. The cookie was a nice treat. I'll definitely be back and will recommend this place to others.
