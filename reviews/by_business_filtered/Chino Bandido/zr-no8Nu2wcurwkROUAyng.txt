My comments go as follows:

1.  Say, WHAT?  Mexican food and Chinese?

2. It's not really Mexican, nor Chinese.  It's its own thing.  Don't expect anything in particular.  

3.  It's unique and good.  The black beans are DELISH.

4.  As a vegetarian, there aren't so many options - there is the veggie egg foo young (which is good) and the veggie salad (which is not).  I end up getting a cheese quessadilla and egg foo young -- all in all, very tasty.

5.  The snickerdoodle may be the best part.
