Yes, I'm reviewing Chipotle.  Yes, they're a franchise.  Yes, they're owned by McDonalds..You got a problem with that?  Suck it.

If you've been to Chipotle before, you pretty much know what you're gonna get here: a ginormous burrito bursting at the seams, which is why they wrap it in tin foil!

I've never had a bad meal at ANY Chipotle.  I've never left unsatisfied and this franchise is no exception.  Yeah, I'm a creature of habit and I've only ordered the Chicken Burrito, but hey - Why mess with perfection?  I go here at least twice a week for lunch unless I decide I'm going to stick to my stupid diet (once a blue moon).

This particular franchise is always clean and the staff is always friendly and I trust them with my health and my palate.

Dos pulgares up, esse!

Tip: For some reason, whenever you order the chips and salsa, they get stingy with the salsa.  Watch them pour it into the cup and yell at them if they don't fill it to the rim.
