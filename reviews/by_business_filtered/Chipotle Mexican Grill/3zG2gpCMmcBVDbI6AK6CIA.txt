I really like this Chipotle location over others. I ordered on-line for pick up and arrived early. The ordered wasn't ready (not their fault) and they offered me a complimentary drink while I wait. To me, thats over and above. The place was packed and they still had my order ready in about 5 minutes. I expected to wait at least 15 minutes.The cashier was very genuinely friendly and professional.
I ordered the steak burro with black beans, rice, sour cream, corn salsa, and lettuce. It was so fresh and satisfying with just the right amount of spice. So, so, good.
Glad to have you in the neighborhood Chipotle!
