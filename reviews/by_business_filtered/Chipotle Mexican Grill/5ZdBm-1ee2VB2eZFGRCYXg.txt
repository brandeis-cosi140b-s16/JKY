Horrible. I wouldn't recommend this place whatsoever. I've gone in a few times and every time I go the older lady cashier is giving a lot of attitude towards everyone and has a smug look on her face. The tables were dirty and when I informed the manager she laughed and said it was clean when there clearly was food everywhere. I ordered a chicken bowl and the cashier rung me up for a double chicken with extra guac. I didn't pay for it because it was wrong and refused until she fixed it. Everyone there has attitude and the manager always has a smug look with a clear attitude and she doesn't care about how her restaurant is. My friends and family and I have all experienced this.
