If you haven't had Chipotle before, seriously - STOP reading this and go now.

The first thing I must mention is that every time I come to this location -- -- the music is awesome. Whoever DJ Chipotle is, he\she is amazing and should do parties.

I used to not like Chipotle. I think it was because my first few times I really didn't know what to order and I felt intimidated to just hurry up and stop holding up the line. But now I'm a pro!.

Chipotle as a whole is just consistently a good meal. They make healthy Mexican food possible and... cool! They post the calories on the their board, their menu has no fads or frills, it's just great fresh food ready to be eaten.

I always try to get the highest caloric meal I can for lunch.... also the most unhealthy. So I'm a barbacoa hard taco gal (yes they have hard shell tacos, just ask). I really enjoy their guacamole so I always get some to go with an order of chips.

As most Chipotle's across town, this place gets busy busy busy at prime lunch time when I normally go. This location does get the line through quickly, so if you can spare a few minutes, it's worth the wait.
