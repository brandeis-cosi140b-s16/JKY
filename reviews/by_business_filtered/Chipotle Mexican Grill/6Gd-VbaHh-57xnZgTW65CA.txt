Just moved back to this area and as a regular at Chipotle I may just quit going to any Chipotle after coming to this location. I gave it 4 tries, the rice is always dry, the portions served are tiny, the employee attitudes are the WORST and it's the slowest service I've ever seen. All 4 times. Horrible.
