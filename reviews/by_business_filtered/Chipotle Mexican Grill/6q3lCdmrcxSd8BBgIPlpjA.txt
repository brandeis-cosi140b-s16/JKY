to be fair... I love the food...it was the service. Well, it was fast, but the girl was rude and kept rushing me ( THERE was nobody behind me) My hubby and I were ordering take out. I knew what my daughter and her boyfriend wanted and I was trying to place their order. "Miss Rude" evidently didn't want to take the order separately- she wanted to take  4 orders ALL AT ONCE and shovel the food in as quickly and as messy as she possible could. When I told her I wasn;t ready to order - that I wanted to look at the menu - she gave me an attitude, and said she wanted to do them all together. My hubby steps up and makes his order she rolls her eyes at me and after  the third time I told her I was still deciding she gave me more attitude. To be fair, I can see her being impatient IF there was a line behind me. There was not. And ----- the  other three orders together  took all of 45 seconds- yes that fast) About his time I had it with her bitchiness and said  (politely) that she's wasting time waiting on me when she can finish the other three orders ( more attitude from  worker with big spoon). The food was 'slopped' in the the  to go bowls. She needs, in my opinion, a refresher course in how to deal with customers. I was not rude, I could've been, but she was rude enough for both. I was hoping there was an email address to this particular Chipotle's here(on Yelp)  to send to the manager but I don;t see one. Chipotle is a great place to eat.. they just need to remember that whom they hire in the front line represents
their company. They don't need and shouldn't ever have someone so rude up front.
