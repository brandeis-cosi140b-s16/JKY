I love coming to this chipotle. It's so lively everytime I walk in. I love it. 
They have their food fresh and ready to go for you. I guess it's because they're always busy that their food is always freshly made. But I have been to other chipotle and their food is definitely not the same.  
The staffs here are very friendly and nice. They're actually happy to work and serve you unlike other places. I did see one guy ,with a tattoo of a letter A on his left arm, fixing his underwear right where they hand you the food... D: lol kinda grossed me out a bit but I guess it's just a one time thing. I hope. 
Anyway, their tables and bathrooms are very clean. They always have someone cleaning everywhere so it's pretty clean. 
The chefs are hilarious bc they actually talk to you and make jokes which I like because I'd always want to come back and eat. 
It has such a chill and fun environment to be in while eating. 
It was great. Thanks for reading and o hope this helps. :)
