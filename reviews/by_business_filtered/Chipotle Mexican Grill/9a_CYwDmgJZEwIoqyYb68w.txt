OK, I don't know what is up with the negative reviews for this location.  It makes me wonder if it's just straight sabotage of a good thing.  

When I have gone, the employees were (each and everyone) incredibly sweet, helpful, informative -- going above and beyond with sample offers, which were very useful in discovering all of the scrumptious options I had for assembling my meals.

I'm basically raising Gandhi's incarnate -- dude won't eat anything -- and he gobbled up all this healthy and truly deliciously flavorful Chipotle food like it was a slice of cake.  I'm talkin' brown rice that was so tasty, it didn't need anything paired with it, the best frickin' guacamole that I have ever tasted, and juicy steak, all at basically fast-food prices, only given to us with sincerely grateful smiles, and quite a bit faster than a fast-food joint.

I also found out they use pork that wasn't tortured (raised humanely), which is better for our bodies AND our moral fabric.

Not to gush (I already am, so why stop now), but this place practically helped to restore my faith in humanity. That's right... I said it.  And they reintroduced the joy of eating healthy food to my son, just by doing what they do, so darn well.  So I'm calling bull on these negative reviews.  I just straight-out don't believe them.
