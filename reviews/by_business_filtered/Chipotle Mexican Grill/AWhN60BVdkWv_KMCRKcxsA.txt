Normally I love chipotle and I would rate it 5 stars. The ingredients are scrumptious and the experience is sublime. However, at this restaurant not all of the staff was on their game. Specifically the beef I had was with the person rolling the burritos. She rolled them so poorly that the tortilla ripped in multiple, rendering the functionality of the burrito useless. It not only happened to me, but my friend as well. It was a sad day. Still, the burrito fillings were delicious - deserving of 4 stars.
