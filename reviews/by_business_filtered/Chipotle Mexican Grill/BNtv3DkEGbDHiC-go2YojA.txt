I've been eating chipotle for years and this location is one of the reasons!  I buy chipotle pretty much once a week, the bowl is very nice since its pretty much a salad that way haha!  this is a great lunch and its not super bad for you like say jack in the box is.  

If you have never tried this then I would suggest getting a bowl and then see how you like the items that they have.
