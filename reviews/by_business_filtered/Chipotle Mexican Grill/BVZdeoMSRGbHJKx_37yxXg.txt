Love Chipotle, but I ordered online thinking it would be faster. The order said it would be ready in 30 minutes. When I arrived on-time there were about 8 people in line. I went to the Pick-up area and it took awhile for anyone to help me and the other person waiting for their online order. By the time I received my order, it would have been faster to order my food from the regular line. And my food was cold. Better to just wait in line next time.
