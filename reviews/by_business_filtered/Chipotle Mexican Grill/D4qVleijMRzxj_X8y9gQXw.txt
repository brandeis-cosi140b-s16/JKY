The new Sofritas (tofu mixed with spicy peppers) tacos are pretty tasty. I added 2 kinds of salsa, pico & corn to mine to bulk them up. Fresh is the name of the game at Chipotle, and is also why this place is usually busy. 
Once you make it to place your order, the line moves quickly. They have the options of burrito, bowl or tacos with the meat & veggie choices, and then you customize your desired toppings.
