Chipotle is pretty much the same everywhere you go. This one is basically as good as a chipotle is expected. Everyone in a while it is good and usually easy thing to grab while working. Except for this particular chipotle. They always have too few employees working the line which causes a huge back up. I have come here many times as I work in the area and every time the line is ridiculous and there are employees standing around in the back. Easy to spot as you are looking right in their direction while you wait in a 25 minute line. 

Good quality food but horrible management.
