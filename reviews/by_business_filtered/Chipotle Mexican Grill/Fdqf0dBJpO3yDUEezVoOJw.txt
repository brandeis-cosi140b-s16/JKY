So yeah, I can eat here. A LOT. Fast, friendly and FRESH. Not a trio you find in Vegas very often. I like how all of the food they use is local, to minimize the impact on poor mother earth. I like how the meat is "hormone- and all the other bad crap you don't want in your belly" -free.
I like how it is pretty reasonably priced, given the huge size of the burritos. 
I like how the paper napkins have personalities and little quotes. I like how they keep the line moving, and pretty much call to attention the jack asses standing in front of you with their mouths open as they peer with squinty eyes with the "I just can't decide" face. There are like, 6 things on the menu. Come ON, people! I like how if you are a vegan or a veggie, you can still eat here and not want to slit your wrists. (I was meat and dairy free for 10 months last year. Trust me. It's hard.)
But mostly, I love how fast I scarf down the food and feel good about myself afterwards. Fast food that won't make you fat! All they need is Wi fi so I can ipad here while I stuff my face and I'd be SET. 
 Yum O!
