I walked in a few months ago to this location and found that service was HORRIBLE. The high schooler behind the counter was rude and very condescending when we asked if she could change gloves for a vegan. We had the employee then roll her eyes and then take a drive through order instead completely ignoring us. Don't come to this location if you are a vegan\vegetarian
