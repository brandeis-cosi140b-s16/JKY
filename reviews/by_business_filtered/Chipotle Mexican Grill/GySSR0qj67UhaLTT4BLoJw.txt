This has to be the friendliest Chipotle I've ever been to.  I was greeted, not once, not twice, but 3 times walking in the door!  Every employee had smiles on their faces as I placed my order.  

I typically get a burrito bowl to go with white rice, chicken, veggies, sour cream, corn, pico and guac.  Today was no different, and it was awesome.  I would highly recommend this Chipotle over another random one in the valley.

Bon Appetite!
