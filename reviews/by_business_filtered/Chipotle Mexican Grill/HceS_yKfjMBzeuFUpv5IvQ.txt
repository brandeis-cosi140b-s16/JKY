Two stars because the food is still good, but anyways I have been to this chipotle many times and it's a 50-50 thing but their customer service is the worst out of any chipotle I've been to in phoenix. I honestly waited 10 minutes from the time the lady started my burrito to the time I checked out. Total b.s. Then the lady who was on the register proceeded to charge me 9.75 for a chicken burrito where most chipotles only charge 7.00 for the same thing and she didn't even apologize or even look at me for making me and 10 other people wait for 10 minutes to be helped. Oh yeah, they were making food for themselves too and putting it in front of the customers food. Great job on employee training. Total joke.
