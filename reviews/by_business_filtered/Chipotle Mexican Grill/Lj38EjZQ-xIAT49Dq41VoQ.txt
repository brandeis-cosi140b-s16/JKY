I always order a kids meal: chicken quesadilla with two sides of brown rice. It comes with a kids drink of choco milk or apple juice and small bag of chips. How much total for this meal? $3.50 before tax! Best quick eat deal Cos it includes juice :)

But that's regarding the whole chain. This location in particular I hold my appetite for because my food is so consistent here. Servers were always nice to me and when I tell them my sides, they always fill up the tray divider with rice. Today I even got more chicken and cheese than I'm used to. 

Overall: I've always had someone smile at this location.  Consistent and friendly. I wouldn't go to any other chain location.

The worst Chipotle for me has to be Fashion Show...they looked miserable and my quesadilla was dry (very little cheese) and half full sides.
