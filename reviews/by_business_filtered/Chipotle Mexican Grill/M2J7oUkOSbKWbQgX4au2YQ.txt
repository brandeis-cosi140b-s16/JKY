I always order the same thing here. At all chipotles really. I love the consistency. As with most places like this, they have standards to adhere to and this location does a fine job of that. I always know what I'm getting here. This location seems to be popular by the amount of people I always see here.

Contrary to some reviews about this locations, I don't feel that they "skimp" on the portion sizes. I don't get beans, sour cream, sauces, or "extra" anything and it's still overflowing. It's enough for me and I'm 6'1"... Although it IS pretty addictive so I always want more. Lol. 

My recommendation would be to go at non-peak hours because the line is significantly shorter.
