My husband and I are avid Chipotle fans... usually the service at most locations is good, sometimes great. THIS location on the other hand is TERRIBLE. I could write a book on the many occasions we have experienced atrocious customer service. I hope the owner of this location wises up and reads the reviews. A change in staff is necessary!! Food is still good, but if you're looking for good service.. Spend your money elsewhere.
