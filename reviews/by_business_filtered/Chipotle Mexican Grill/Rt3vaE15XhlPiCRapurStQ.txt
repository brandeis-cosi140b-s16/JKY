Healthy, yummy, reasonable price. What's not to like. BTW, the margaritas are abfab too. Guacamole is not that watered down stuff, and all of the meats seem to be free of grizzle which requires labor to sort through the good, the bad, & the ugly.
We eat out frequently and this place gets a visit from us at least twice a month.
