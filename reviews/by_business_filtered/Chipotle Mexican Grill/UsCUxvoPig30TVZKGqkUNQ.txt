Straight garbage. I had gift certificates so searched the chipotle w the highest rating. As a chef i was sickened. Rude service. No pride in their food. I asked for the fresh steak i saw being chopped behind the lady and she said "NO ITS THE SAME THING" so i told her no, i want the fresh stuff. She proceeds to dump the old meat on top of the new, I NEARLY LOST IT. couldn't believe how gross and rude that was. I give up on chipotle COMPLETELY.
