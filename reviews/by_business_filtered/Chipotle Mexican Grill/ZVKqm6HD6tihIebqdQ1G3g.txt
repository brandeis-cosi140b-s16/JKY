I have probably been here more than 20 times & and I have zero complaints about this. Food taste like No other. I always get the chicken burrito or the steak burrito & and I get pretty much every topping you can possibly put inside the burrito. Haha hey why not. For $6.50...there's no any other place will fill you up like this. I always have leftovers to  take home.
