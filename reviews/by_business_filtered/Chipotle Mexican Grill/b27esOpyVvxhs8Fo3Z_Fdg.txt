What a disappoinment. I eat chipotle at least 5 days out of the week. Its healthy and delicious. I live in Old town Scottsdale so the location on Scottsdale road is where i always go. But, tonight i happened to be coming back from a friends house closer to this one. Since it was on the way i decided to stop here instead of waiting to be closer to home. MISTAKE. The woman who kept bouncing between the cashier and the food line was rude (btw, clearly the cashier girl didnt know what she was doing..but we'll get to that later). I asked her for a vegetarian salad with the rice on the side...she put it in a portion cup and i told her i was sorry and i prefer it to be placed in a bowl instead
 ( i hate the rice all smashed) she proceeded to tell me it was an extra charge. (So to have my rice on the side costs more?! I told her the chipotle by my home never charged me and she said theres nothing she can do. Wow, great customer service. Then i ordered chips and salsa and was charged again for an extra.salsa. it took  while for the cashier girl to even get my order rung up correctly. For someone who eats chipotle sooo much,  you will NEVER see me again at this location. Rude.rude.rude.
