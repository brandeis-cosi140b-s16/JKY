If for some reason you are just crawling out from under your rock and have never had Chipotle, you should. I was first turned on to burritos made to order like this at a place called Edrito's Burritos back in Buffalo. Being that they have no Chipotle or to many other decent Mexican / Tex-Mex food in Buffalo, I was in heaven at Edrito's.

Found Zaba's out here when i first moved to Las Vegas. Wasn't until after being out here for couple more years that I tried Chipotle who seemed to be the main known place for this burrito style. ( I tend to avoid franchises and chains)

Onto my order today. Grabbed a steak burrito from here on lunch. All in all it was good but seemed to lack the flavor one from Zaba's does. Chipotle is a tad cheaper and has way more locations. This one today was busy but I was still in and out in less than 5 minutes.

So to sum up, if you like made to order burritos, I prefer Zaba's but Chipotle is good place to get your fill.
