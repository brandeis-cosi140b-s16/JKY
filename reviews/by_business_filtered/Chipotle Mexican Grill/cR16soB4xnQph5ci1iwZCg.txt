Honestly, you can't go wrong. The quality is consistent across all the chains and reliable to whatever you may be used to.

I do have one tip to customers. I made an online order with the steak meat on the side. NEVER ORDER THE MEAT ON THE SIDE.

I'm pregnant so I can't have raw meat, but I love chipotle. I didn't want to be a pain so I figured I'd just order it on the side and cook it to well done at home.

I only got a TINY little plastic tub of meat...I asked the lady at the register,"this is the meat on the side??" She almost looked ashamed and said,"uhh, yea.."

*there's a photo reference.

Needless to say, I'm sure once I can eat undercooked meat again I'm sure I'll be back. Just sorta sucked because you pay so much for their food, you'd think they'd have larger containers nearby. Plus I know this is a special request.

Oh well...lesson learned.
