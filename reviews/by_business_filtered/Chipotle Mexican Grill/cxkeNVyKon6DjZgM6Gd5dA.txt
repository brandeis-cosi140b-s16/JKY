EXTRA MEAT PLEASE =]

Love this location. They are super friendly & they don't give me a weird look when I ask for my specifications on my order. 

Everything inside looked clean & tidy.

FAJITA STEAK BOWL is my choice always & they always make it good... can't really make it wrong when they are putting together my dish right there & then. I would have to say their serving portion for the meat has gotten smaller so i ordered extra but the extra up charge was only around $2.50 which is fine by me for a double scoop. 

I THINK this place is cheaper on the price for an extra scoop but don't quote me cuz i am not 100% 

I was running late for work but since it was down time for them they had me in & out as quick as possible.
