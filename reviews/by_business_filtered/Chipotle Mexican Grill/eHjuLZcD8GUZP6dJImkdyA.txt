Who doesn't love Chipotle?!?!

The quality of food is always good and hot! i love their burrito bowls, they fill me up and fill me up again during a second meal! I love food that has longevity. They may skimp out on rice, or whatever ingredient you love, but all you have to do is ask for extra and they will giveth, without charging!! (except for meat) The service is always fast and friendly. I love going here when I'm in the mood for something cheap, quick and yummy!
