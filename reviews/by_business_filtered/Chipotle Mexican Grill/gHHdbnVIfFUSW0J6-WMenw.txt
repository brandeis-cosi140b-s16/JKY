Brief Overview:
This Chipotle location is in a convenient shopping center and has a nice ambiance for a sit down or take out mexican grill food.

Pros:
- Awesome menu selection (I love their burrito bowls and sofritas options)
- Great food quality (I love how the guacamole comes free with the vegetarian salad bowl)
- Reasonable price (It costs me about $7.56 for a vegetarian salad bowl)
- Love the decor (a very urban and raw feel that add to the experience of dining in)
- Offers Non-GMO food now (yay, less toxic chemicals in our food!)

Cons:
- Lunch time rush can cause a longer wait time (as with anywhere)
- I wish they had more options than tap water and soda (offering alkaline water would be ideal)
- Menu ingredient list is not 100% organic (I would like to see this guarantee to take their quality to the next level)


Final Verdict:
I've been to this Chipotle countless times and love the consistency of their food quality and fairly fast lines. The food tastes great and is at a very reasonable price. This location and the others I've been to make Chipotle one of my favorite fast food locations to eat at.
