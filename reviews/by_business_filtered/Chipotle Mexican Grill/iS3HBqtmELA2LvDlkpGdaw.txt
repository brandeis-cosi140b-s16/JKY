I love chipotle! I usually get a burrito bowl - this specific location usually is busy and the employees are unfriendly. Sometimes they move quickly, sometimes they ignore you and sometimes they move slow as they talk amongst each other. Every single time I go, whether fast or slow, their customer service sucks. Last time I went I also got bottom of the pan burnt chicken, ew.

I went to a chipotle in Chandler that was fast, friendly, quality and gave me a free soda... C'mon management!! It's not so hard.
