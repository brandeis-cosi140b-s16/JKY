Showed up at 5:20 and it took 20 minutes to get through 8 people because there were only two girls working the line even though another two employees proceeded to wipe down counters at a snail's pace and change out ingredients. I understand that these things are necessary, but come on! Wipe that shit down quickly and then help your coworkers! By the time we ordered, the line had grown to 20+ people, poor suckers. Get to the front to pay and can hear the band system of a down BLARING from down the hall (assuming it lead to a manage's office). I don't have anything against SOD but there was a 5 year old girl standing next to me as the singer crooned about "self righteous suicide". Food was haphazardly thrown together and, in general, no one really seemed to take any pride in their job. 

Let's be honest, I love chipotle and will always come back but it's always a bummer not to truly enjoy a meal there.
