As soon as I walked into this chipotle I was greeted by a line that was almost out of the door. The staff was working very hard to take orders and cook the food and the line went much faster than I thought it would, no complaints there. 

The issue tonight was a matter of health. Simply put, the steak in my burrito bowl was  grossly undercooked. So undercooked that the meat was actually cold. I get it, it's busy so the food is being rushed but there is no excuse for this egregious error. 

Usually this type of transgression would get an automatic one star as my health was potentially compromised but I bumped them a star because the staff quickly made me another bowl and because they did such a good job handling the large crowd.

This better be an isolated occurrence because next time I'll have to report them to the state
