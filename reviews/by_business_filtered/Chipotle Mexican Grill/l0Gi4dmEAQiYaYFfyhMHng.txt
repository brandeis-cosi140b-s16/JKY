Went to this chipotle on a Saturday around 3pm took 17 min to reach the front of the line. I have been to this location in the past and have experienced faster service, however, this visit was very frustrating. There were obviously some issues going on this afternoon they seemed short staffed and having major pos cash register issues but the feeling I got from the staff was very unpleasant. The few people who were working had dead stares on their faces without an ounce of urgency that they have a line wrapping around to the front of the door. A manager of some sort came out from the back and was about to roll a trash can outside but when he saw the line he took the trash can to the back and proceeded to help out. I thought this would make the service faster but it didn't. He simply washed his hands and stirred some food around filled up one container with something and that's about it. He should have pushed the line through or noticed there were issues at the cash register as well. 

After we get our food and are almost done eating 3:40pm I see 6 employees walk through the front door about to start their shift and one just roaming around on his break, go figure. 

Lastly, while in line I was about to order chips and guacamole with my burrito bowl. Looked at the guacamole and was disgusted it was literally brown and looked like it had been sitting their since they opened or possibly from the night before. 

Definitely will not be visiting this location again. I will stick with the location on Sahara and fort Apache they are on top of everything.
