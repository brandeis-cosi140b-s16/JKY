I absolutely love this place, I've been going there for about 4 years. February 2013 I went on a Chipotle diet and lost 40 lbs eating nothing but there wonderful fresh foods. I've gotten to know all of the employee's and management along the way and they treat me like 100% family. 
Special shout out to Bree & David! I also love love love the biodegradable packaging used.

Another shout out for this location, I travel for business to AZ, CA & NV
So I eat at Chipotle in a lot of cities none live up to this location. 
I have NEVER been disappointed with the food or service at this amazing Chipotle. Keep me the great work my friends!
