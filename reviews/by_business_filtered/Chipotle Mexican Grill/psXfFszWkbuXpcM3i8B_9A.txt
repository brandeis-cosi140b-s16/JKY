Placed my order on the application got there it was not ready had to wait for them to make it. What was the point of using the application if I have to wait? The Arroyo crossing location had my food waiting and ready for me when I used the application before. After waiting at this location my food was horrible the chicken is burnt and crispy yuck!  The vinaigrette for the salad was extremely salty. This location is right near my house but after this experience I won't go back. The Arroyo crossing location is way better!
