Usual Chipotle.  However, this establishment has a bit of a smaller footprint than most.  Also interesting is that they actually use a not-so-spicy corn compared to some others that I've been.

The big thing here is that they pretty much use free-range everything.   I know it sounds silly, but there was an article in some business magazine a few months ago that basically wrote about how their meats taste better due to this shift.  And they do!  Also, if you've never been to this chain, they make pretty much everything from the meats to the guac fresh.  I've actually had to wait on guac to be made before at another chain.

I personally recommend the burrito bowls.  Less mess since you can eat it with a fork.  But, that's just me.
