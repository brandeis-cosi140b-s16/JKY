Worst chipotle experience I've ever had. It's 9:05 pm, they close at 10. All the chairs are upside down on the tables as though they're closed. The first thing the employee said to us was that it would be 20 min for the shredded cheese to be ready. . . Then we noticed they were out of guacamole, in fact everything looked low and old. I've never felt so unwelcome, as though I was a nuisance. I'm offended and won't be back.
