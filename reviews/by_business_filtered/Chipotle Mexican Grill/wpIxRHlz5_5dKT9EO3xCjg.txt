I only come here out of convenience. They usually don't have something, last week it was a 30 min wait for guac and this week it is 45min wait for rice. I ordered online and I stand here as people pass and get their food. Online ordering is an absolute joke. They have no idea what preparation means and I've seen three people turn around because they have now ran out of chicken and it'll be 10min for chicken. That literally just happened. Oh and someone just came back in because they forgot the cheese. Unreal
