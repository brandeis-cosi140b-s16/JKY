Love Chipotle so much, just NOT this location. Upon moving to this side of town from Tempe I realized that the service and taste was not the same as the Chipotle on Mill and the one at Tempe Market place.  First off the employees here were far less motivated and educated in the product as the students at ASU -_- Sadly I came in an hour before they closed, and to save time and effort they weren't cooking anymore meat.  I only asked for a steak burrito and received a crap-load of rice and beans and two lonely and terrified pieces of steak.  After chuckling  I asked for just a little more. I was told that I was given 4 ounces and that was all I could get without being charged. Sadly I ended up with a huge ass bean and rice burrito and jumped for joy when I reached those two steak chunks.  Each Chipotle has its taste..this location is not for me. If you usually go to this one and you like it...take a much needed trip to the chipotle on mill ave and you will be enlightened on how Chipotle on this side of town should taste!
