Chuy's is loud, crowded with less than mediocre food.  Not a good restaurant for the South Park area with its tacky decor.  It's like a McDonalds playground with kids running everywhere including on top of the walls around the restaurant and fountain.  You can find much better Mexican food anywhere in this area. It's cheap food and I guess that's the draw.  Zink the former upscale restaurant at that location allowed dogs on the patio.  This cheap, tacky restaurant doesn't allow dogs.
