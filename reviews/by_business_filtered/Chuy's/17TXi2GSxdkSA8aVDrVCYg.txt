It was happy hour and the chips with different toppings they offer for free was a nice surprise.  My table ordered tacos and fajitas and we were presently surprised with the quality of food and the subtle differences of other Mexican/TexMex restaurants. (Quality, Texture, and Taste of Shells being one.). The wait staff were very helpful and kept drinks refilled before they were gone.
