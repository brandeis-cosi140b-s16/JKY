I went within the first two weeks of their opening, so my experience may have been impacted by the new staff and such. Having lived in Texas for 10 years, I was super excited for Chuy's to come to town. It's impossible to find authentic Tex Mex in town, and our options for decent Mexican food are limited, too. So I had high hopes for Chuy's. But I was pretty disappointed by my experience and may not return to give it another try anytime soon. There were 4 of us in the party - 2 boys (10-12) and two moms. I ordered a margarita, and although it was $11, I found it to be VERY lacking. It was more like a watered down limeade. Pathetic. We each ordered a different entree, and nobody was very enthusiastic about their dishes. I had the enchiladas and was unimpressed. I think I've had better enchiladas at Chi Chis! Yikes. The service was slow and incomplete (requiring multiple requests before receiving things like salsa, fresh water, etc.)

The one positive to the experience is their house-made tortillas, which are yummy and fresh.
