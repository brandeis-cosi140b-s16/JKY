My favorite aspect of this South Park Mexican restaurant is the outdoor patio.  As the summer turns into fall, there's no better place to enjoy a Friday evening than on the patio while munching on a big pile of nachos from the "FREE" nacho bar.  It's nothing fancy - tortilla chips, refried beans, ground beef, queso, and salsa, yet appealing to a fan of casual Mexican fare.  It's quite a deal to order a drink or two and make dinner out of the nachos.  Make sure you try the white ranch-like sauce that is brought to the table with the salsa.  The creamy, yet spicy, sauce compliments the chips well.

For our entrees we split two selections.

1.  Appetizer Plate...Chile con queso, nachos, deluxe quesadillas, chicken flautas, guacamole & sour cream.

We subbed double guacamole for the sour cream and added a side of a chile relleno.  All of the components were equally tasty.  It's nothing unique or outstanding, but is tasty and well executed Mexican staples.

2.  Veggie... Spinach, onions, zucchini, yellow squash, red bell peppers, serranos, roasted green chiles, corn & cheese in homemade blue corn tortillas with Ranchero sauce.  Served with a side of beans and rice.

This generous portion of three enchiladas was served pipping hot and smothered in the tomato-based ranchero sauce.  It was good, but my only complaint would be that it was a bit too spicy.

If you're looking for an affordable meal and love traditional Mexican cuisine, be sure to check out Chuy's in South Park.  To avoid a potential seizure from the brightly colored and obnxiously decorated interior, opt for the the patio.
