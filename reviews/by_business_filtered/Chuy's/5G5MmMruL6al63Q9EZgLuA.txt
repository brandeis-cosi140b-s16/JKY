If you're not from Texas (Where the stars at night are big and bright *clap clap clap clap*), then I'm sure this will be a godsend of TexMex. Though I'm not a huge fan of the decor -- loud, loud, loud, cumbersome, kitschy, overtly awful, weird, funny, and loud, the prices are incredible for being located in SouthPark. 

If you're not into paying $15-20 every time you're in SouthPark for dinner, Chuy's might be your new spot. The most expensive menu item I saw on the menu, that wasn't a dinner platter, was between $8-$9. Now, I don't know if these prices will inflate after time, but for right now, it's super easy on the wallet. 

The food itself? I was surprised. You're not really going to get authentic here, but what they're plating from the kitchen is pretty damn good. I ordered the fried shrimp tacos. Wasn't a huge fan of the breading, but the tortillas, accoutrement within, and the sides were spot on. Paired with one of the house margaritas (I'm not a fan of any of the beers they have in-house) and you've got a pretty good meal. We shared a few apps, too. The queso that has beef and a few other confetti-type peppers/veg was awesome. The chips are thin, so double up to avoid breakage. 

The service was going bonkers, but very efficient. In my god-given grace, I decided it was a great idea to wail my arms about in telling a story and spilled an entire glass of water on and under the table. The bus team swooped in like freaking ninjas and cleaned everything up. 

So, though I feel like I may detach a retina from looking at the decor, I'm actually looking forward to revisiting Chuy's. Next time? The patio. 

Â¡Ole!
