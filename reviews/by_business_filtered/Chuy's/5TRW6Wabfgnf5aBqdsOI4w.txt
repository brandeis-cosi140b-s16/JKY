How can you go wrong with an Elvis themed Mexican restaurant??

I love the decor in this place.  It's wild, and off the wall - sometimes literally.  The entrance has cameras all over the ceiling, another room has hubcaps.  It's kind of a weird atmosphere at first, but the people are friendly and seem happy to be there.  The food is fresh, the chips and salsa are fantastic.  The salsa is just spicy enough to make you want more, even though your mouth is slowly setting fire.  The experience is fun, and the food is tasty and cheap.
