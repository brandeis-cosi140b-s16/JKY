Dinner with family, for some reason I couldn't convince them to go to our usual taco place. So we thought we'd give Chuy's a try.

The chips and salsa were quite good. Not a puree of tomatoes, there were actual pieces in there. A bit wet, so it's drippy. We also got an order of guacamole to go with it. It arrived in a medium sized bowl and it looked like a lot. Until we got near the bottom and discovered that it was sitting on a small nest of shredded lettuce. Oops. The chips were hot and fresh. Thinner than I'm used to, they had a habit of breaking off in the guac.

Deep menu of burritos and tacos and salads with Mexican beers, sangria and margaritas. When I cut into my "chicken" burrito, it turned out to be beef. The waitress was most apologetic and offered to replace it (she said the kitchen made it wrong even though she ordered it right) but it was good so I stuck with it. My daughter had the Elvis special which is a bucket load of food. Unless you are a serious eater, I'd recommend you move on to something else. My wife had the chicken taco salad which of course comes in a massive fried tortilla shell.

The music and noise in the restaurant is extremely loud. The pictures on the wall and the angles of the walls do nothing to absorb sound at all.

They say it's TexMex, but I dunno. It just seemed like fancy Mexican to me.

Parking isn't easy but it's doable. Try the parking deck for Southpark if it's legal.
