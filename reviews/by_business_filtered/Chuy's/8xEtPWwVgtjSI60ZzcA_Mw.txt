Who would have known there's a Mexican diner in South Park?  It's super casual and families bring all the kids to try some tacos, even the ones from Concord.  

I had the beef tacos and they were pleasantly spicy with a little cooked green pepper.  Not crazy hot but enough to make me take notice.  The beans and rice were good and so was the guacamole.  Our waiter took the time to listen to our quirky food restrictions and we enjoyed everything.  Even the tortilla chips are cooked in-house and came to our table hot and crispy.  Can't wait to go back!

If you ever pined for a place to take your screaming kids in your cargo shorts for a good hot meal with some kick to it, well you found a little slice of heaven right here.
