Happy Hour at Chuy's really made me feel good about myself. Of course, any restaurant offering freebies is making it easier to win me over. The free nacho car was a nice touch, especially right next to the bar where the drinks were flowing and the bartenders gave great service and face ;-)

My beau and I stopped in on our way to the movies. It's in a high-traffic area, right next door to the ever-popular Cowfish Sushi Burger Bar in The Village at SouthPark. So, I definitely recommend using the Valet. 

We got there right in the middle of Happy Hour Nacho Car which is offered from 4 to 7 p.m.  Monday through Friday. We quickly ordered drinks. Sangria was on special for $1 off the regular price. My beau also ordered the Perfect Margarita (Patron included). He loved it. We didn't get a chance to eat a full dinner but the bartender gave us a complimentary bowl of the Jalapeno Ranch Dip. Awesomeness! 

I can't wait to go back for dinner! Bueno!
