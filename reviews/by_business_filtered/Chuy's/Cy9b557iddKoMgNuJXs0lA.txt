I was very disappointed in this place.  Honestly, the only reason I gave it two stars is because the queso dip was very good. The chips were overly salted even for my wife who usually puts salt on EVERYTHING.  Also, the waiteress kept bringing more chips in this giant scoop and each time spilled about half of them onto the table.  I make a big enough mess without the waiteress helping.

My wife had the quesedilla.  It was served as what looked like 4 minature tacos.  Which would not be bad, except that the tortillas were oily and flavorless.  My wife said the chicken and cheese was just OK.

I had chile rellenos with shrimp and cheese.  The breading didn't stick to the chiles and the chiles were too crunchy.  The filling was just OK.  To be honest, I would have just preferred to have a plate with just the filling.
