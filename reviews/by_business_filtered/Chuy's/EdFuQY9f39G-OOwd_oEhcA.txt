Being from Texas, we had higher hopes for this Chuy's.  

The thing about Chuy's is that it's not gourmet food. It's decent enough Tex-Mex,  that when combined with a fun atmosphere and great service makes for a place that you want to come back to.  

Based upon one visit on a late Sunday afternoon, Chuy's won't be first on the list for our dining out dollars.  I don't know if our server was a first-time-ever-to-wait-tables newbie or just a painfully insecure guy, but I knew after one minute that we were in for it!  And we were!  He was slow to do everything (orders, drinks, chips, checking on us), the food was very, very slow coming out (did I mention we waited forever!!!!) and despite being a nice enough guy, he did a really lack luster job.  Other tables around us seemed to fare better with other severs, but only slightly so. Too bad.
