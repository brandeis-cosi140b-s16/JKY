It was OK... not rave-worthy. I tried their Baja taco and it wasn't that good, there was no sauce or maybe my waiter didn't offer it. Oh well... The decor just meh. It made me feel like I was in Monkey Joe's, and have kids crying and throwing stuffs didn't help my situation either. Overall I'm going to stick with my regular visit to Cabo, since I think it suits my taste (no pun intended lol).
