Was at Southpark mall and the wait for Cheesecake factory was too long to wait with our grandson. Spotted the sign for Chuy's and was so happy there is a new Mexican restaurant decided to give it a try. No wait at all despite looking as if they were full. Sat near the tortilla making station. Server was fast. We were in & out in less than 35 min. Loved the decor. I would definitely go back.
