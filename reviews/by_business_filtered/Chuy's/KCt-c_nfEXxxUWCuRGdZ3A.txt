Your average TexMex food place. Wonderful funky decor and service ain't bad, food selection is okay. 

Food -  Mediocre, could be better. The popular Baja Taco (battered shrimp) was flavorful, but dry. Had to add sour cream and guacamole to help give it some moisture.  My husband liked his steak fajitas, and the chips and salsa were addicting.  The portions are big, enough to take home leftovers.

Drinks - They are generious with their tequila drinks!  

Service - Good. For the past three times I have been here, the food did take a wee-little longer to get to us. Even when we came on a not so busy afternoon on a Wednesday, it was still a tad bit slow.

Price - Was reasonable. I would say it is not cheap, but not pricey either - just in between.  

I would go here on a day when you feel for a TexMex meal, and don't feel like going to PacoTacos.

I loved Chuy's, but that was back two years ago when I lived in Texas. I was soo excited to see Chuy's here, I felt right at home upon walking into the restaurant.  It still had that splash of color and neat Chuy's theme that I am all too familar with back in Houston.   It was and still is a popular restaurant in Houston. It's always packed, it's too bad it is not the same in Charlotte.
