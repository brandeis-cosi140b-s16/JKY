A couple of coworkers and I went for lunch last week. I had heard mixed reviews, but I wanted to try it for myself. Some people don't like the decor, but on a rainy day it was exactly what we needed...bright and fun!
We started with the queso that has ground beef and guac in it. It was super yummy!! Oh, and make sure to ask for the Green Sauce too for dipping....its a do not miss! And the chips were incredibly fresh. I ordered the Baja Tacos, I got one shrimp and one fish, both were excellent. I was so stuffed I couldn't finish my meal. I ordered the 'Green Rice' instead of the Spanish rice. It was a little dry...like it was an old batch, but it was ok. 
The other two ladies enjoyed their lunches as well. The only two things that bothered me were that you can't get an alternate side like veggies or a side salad instead of rice/beans. And they said they couldn't split the dip between the three of us. With the POS systems they use these days I can't see how that would be a problem. 
Overall I really enjoyed it. Our waitress was friendly and attentive and I would definitely go back.
