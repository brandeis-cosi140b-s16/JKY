So I finally made it over to Chuy's!

Right away I noticed the d√©cor. It was "interesting" but I guess that's what helps to make this place so unique in comparison to your typical Mexican joint? 

Our waiter was pleasant and quick; he gave us plenty of time to look over the menu and informed that we had arrived during their "happy hour" so there were chips, queso and beef available in the back! It's been discussed enough in all the previous reviews, so I'll just say I enjoyed it very much! But I'm a sucker for unlimited queso and chips! 

For my meal I went with Combination #1, which is a ridiculous amount of food! It comes with comes with enchiladas, chicken flautas, a taco, guacamole and chips dipped in chile con queso. It was all very tasty but my favorite parts hands down were the chicken flautas. They were crispy goodness. I could have had an entire plate of them! Yum! 

Overall, the prices weren't bad and the portion sizes are good so I can see myself coming back!
