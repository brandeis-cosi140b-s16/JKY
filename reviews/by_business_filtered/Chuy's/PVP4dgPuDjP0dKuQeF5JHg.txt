I've been here three times.  The food is good, but the service leaves much to be desired.  The second time I came here, our table of 6 waited over 30 minutes to order and then another hour and 20 minutes for the food to come out.  After that experience I vowed to never return.   Two years later, my husband dragged me back stating that they had improved. We came in on a Friday during the lunch hour, the restaurant was barely filled with people. Just like with our other visits, the food was good.  The service was much improved from my last visit, but still slow given how empty the restaurant was. At every point of the process, we were just hanging out waiting for the server to return. Side note, I would not recommend their sweet tea to anyone, it was weak and watered down.
