The only positive thing to say about our experience here was that we didn't have to wait for a table.... Now we know why.  The food was terrible and the service was worse. 

Sat in the bar area and as a special treat had the staff there eating with us complaining about the food right in front of us.  Management was no where to be found either. What a mess. Don't waste your money here there are too many great restaurants in the Southpark area
