Our intention was to go to the Cowfish but there was a ridonkulous wait so we went across the way to Chuys which, of course, didn't have any wait.  I've already written about the d√©cor, and the service was good last night which earned this place an extra star.

The food here is horrible.  It lacks flavor, imagination and is never like the description on the menu.  Sweetie is a vegetarian and they only offer one option which was a breaded and fried chile stuffed with squeeze cheese no flavor, a blue tortilla covered with squeeze cheese, no flavor and looked like something a dog threw up, and some beans undoubtedly from a can, no flavor.  She rated it the 2nd worse meal she has ever eaten in her life.  I had the combo fajitas for one.  The menu said something about being marinated for 24 hours in some juice or something.  Not possible.  I know, trust me.  The chicken was dry and was completely void of flavor, the steak only had a taste because there was so much fat on the beef, and who doesn't like fat?  The tortillas were made in house because I saw them making them but they were dry, and dusty.

Chuy's is in this area because they have "chain" money behind them, otherwise they wouldn't last very long.  It is extremely kid friendly but me thinks that once your kids figure out that you can go get a # 2 at El Cancun or something and spend less $$ and get a better meal that will go away.  You should know better once you go one time.
