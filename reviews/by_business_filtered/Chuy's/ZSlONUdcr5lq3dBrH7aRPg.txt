My brother and I came here one day unexpectedly. We were going to go to the Cowfish next door for lunch, but when we found out the line was too long, we decided to try out Chuy's instead and I'm SO glad we did!

First off, the decorations inside were eye-catching and fun! Felt like I was in paradise with the palm trees! We started off with the usual chips and salsa (which the salsa was amazing!). I had the chile relleno, and my goodness it was one of the yummiest cheesy goodness I've ever had! The crusted and fried chiles were stuffed with the perfect balance of cheese, meat (I think I asked for chicken?) and yummy brown sauce (I don't recall what it was...just how good it was!). Got two filling meals out of my one dish! Next time I'm in the Southpark area, I'm definitely going back!
