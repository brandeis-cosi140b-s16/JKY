Sorry, Kim T.  I'd have to rather disagree with you.  Lynn Thompson is such a sweet lady.  I'm usually and by usually I mean I HATE mexican, tex-mex, etc (exceptions for Chipotle.)  However, my experience here has always been great.  I've gone quite a few times and I've gotten to know Lynn on more "friendly" basis.  She has come to greet me and my friends quite a few times and talk to us even when she has been super busy. But, that doesn't excuse what you have to say about her. Does she cuss quite loud on the line, yes, but  I know for a fact that she doesn't call her staff "pieces of shit."  She loves all of her staff and treats them quite well.  If you've eaten there so many times as you stated you would realize this.  Also, why are YOU "supporting" a company that treats the staff so "badly"?  That doesn't make sense in the least.  

Anyways, Kim is a joke.  I'd definitely go check out the place and see for yourself.  It's so cheap (food wise) you aren't losing anything and the service and managers are just wonderful!!
