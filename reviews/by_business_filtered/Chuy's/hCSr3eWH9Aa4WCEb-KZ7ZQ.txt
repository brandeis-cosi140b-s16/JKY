Loved this place! Some may say that the decor is a bit overwhelming and a sensory overload but that's what I love about it! It's kitschy theme of everything Tex-Mex to Elvis is what makes Chuy's a dining experience unlike any other. 
Ohh yea, the food's not bad either! I ordered the Chica-Chica-Boom-Boom and it was delicious. It had just the right amount of spice and zing. All their entr√©es are the perfect balance of traditional Mexican with a Texan flair to it. 
I would without a doubt recommend this restaurant to everyone and go back in a heart beat!
