Chuy's is one of our favorite places in Southpark. The salsa is amazing. Get the creamy jalape√±o sauce along side it too. It's a cool, inexpensive, and satisfying place to grab dinner. It's one of the few places in Southpark that does not have an ounce of "snobbyness" about it. When the weather is nice, the patio is great. It's family friendly while also good for people just want a beer and a taco. The staff is great too. We've only had one waitress who was annoyingly pushing the "upsell" the whole meal through, but the other 99% have been excellent.
