I tend to err on the side of, "If you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all..." but my kids insisted that I write this place up. Five of us popped in for an early dinner on a weeknight. The colors are a little overwhelming at first but I'm ok with tacky if the food is good. Which it's not. At all. 

My kids sat down and were munching on the tortilla chips when I asked for the gluten-free menu. My waitress returned with a menu that says, "NOT GUARANTEED ... Gluten-free menu." What the heckity heck does that mean? As I scanned down the list, I could have one menu item, no sauce. Regardless of whether or not you are gluten-free, the fact that everything on their menu contains gluten in some form or other - rice, sauces, sides - is a pretty big indicator that you are getting absolutely nothing fresh. Except avocado. I could have a freshly pitted avocado for dinner. 

As my kids were about to munch into some tortilla chips the waitress casually mentioned ... "The chips aren't gluten-free either." Sooo... I think we're done here. 

I had heard such rave reviews from friends in other cities with Chuy's that I was really excited to give this a try. The price point is lower for a reason. I will stick with my slightly more expensive, but way better quality, local joints when I crave some TexMex.
