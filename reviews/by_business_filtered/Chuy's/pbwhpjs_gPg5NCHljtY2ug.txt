First timers at Chuys!! I was pleasantly surprised. The food was great and portion size was great. Our waiter was efficient and had a sense of humor. I am wheat free and I was able to eat safely. The reason for a four rating for me is because the GF menu is very limited. You basically can only eat the taco meat but the tacos are amazing and the ranch dressing as amazing. Also you can not eat the rice or chips they bring to the table. The reason I believe this is the case is cross contamination. It didn't bother me.
