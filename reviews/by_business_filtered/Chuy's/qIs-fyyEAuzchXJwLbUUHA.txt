Let me start off by saying, that I ate here as a third choice due to two local restaurants being completely packed at 9:30 PM. I was not disappointed or over the moon about the food.  The atmosphere was great and my friend from Mexico said that it was true "Mexican-style". The service was superb and this is definitely a Tex-Mex restaurant... I prefer Mexican food, but that was not an option at the time.

I had beef fajitas and my friend had the crunchy tacos. The beef fajitas were pretty good, but not the best I have had. My friend liked her tacos, and was in love with the salsa and guacamole.

I would suggest this restaurant if you are looking for a quick and casual dinning experience.
