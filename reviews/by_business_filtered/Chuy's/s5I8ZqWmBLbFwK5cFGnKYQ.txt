Yay! Best Tex Mex in town! We were really impressed with the atmosphere and the food at Chuy's especially considering that we were there for there practice run night.  This was the first meal served by the restaurant and we had nothing to complain about. If you don't know from my other Tex Mex reviews I deeply love Chili Rellenos and have not been able to find a decent meal of them here in Charlotte. Every restaurant that serves them here serves them soggy, not crispy like they should. Chuy's comes out with a nice fresh pepper that's coating is crispy and delicious the way it should be.

Not only do they have them but they also enjoy the Hatch chili at Chuy's and celebrate the Hatch Chili Festival in August. I will no longer have to order a box from Hatch, NM. I can now go celebrate my obsession locally at Chuy's with the rest of the Hatch Chili crazies.  Once you've had them you'll understand.  For the festival and the chilis alone I would give them 5 stars, but they also really pulled off a great experience for us on a practice run night and we just loved the feel and atmosphere of the restaurant in general.  There is a great bar area for fun with friends. But, try and get a seat outside if you can. The view is very relaxing. The fountain and play area for the kids is just awesome too. They have thought of everything.
