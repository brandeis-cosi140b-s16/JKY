Came here because the wait for CowFish was so incredibly long (1.5 hours!!).  Wasn't disappointed.  Tried several different margaritas which were all good and the Elvis fried chicken with green chiles was delicious.  I love how all the dog pictures cover the walls; it really adds a fun dynamic to the restaurant.   Parking is free which is a plus, and it's right next to a lot of high end shopping if you're into that.
