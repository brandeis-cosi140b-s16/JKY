Zip-A-Dee-Do-Da it's a wonderful day -- the day I stepped inside a Chuy's for the first time! It's colorful and inviting. Our waiter could not have been more upbeat and helpful. They even have a free mother-slapping NACHO BAR!!!! 

The colors and smells and sights, they combine for a delightful time. I went with friends so it was even more enjoyable.

I ordered the Elvis Presley combination and had no idea how giant it would actually be -- not to mention is was only $11 and change.

I almost forgot to mention the amazing ranch/jalape√±o dip -- I need an intravenous drip of the stuff because it's THAT good. So, yourself a flavor and find a Chuy's. They're even changing the way I think about chain restaurants -- maybe.
