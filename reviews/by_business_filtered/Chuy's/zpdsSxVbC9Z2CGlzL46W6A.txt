3 stars is generous for my experience at Chuy's.  We went for dinner last night with a group of 8.  The Southpark area, as you know is crowded.  They have a valet there which is worth the $5.00 IMO.

Kitschy is an understatement for the decor.  They had some cool t-shirts for sale.  Walking through to our seat we saw the lady making the tortillas which was nice, and the tortillas were wonderful and tasted fresh.

We ordered the fajitas which were consisted of dry strips of chicken and the seasoning was lacking.  For a basic staple you would think they could do better.  I did enjoy the assortment of sauces and really liked the Boom Boom and the Hatch Green Chile.

I have to say they need to do a better job with the hostesses.  They were condescending and rude.  I hate to walk into a restaurant and see the hostesses congregated around the podium without looking up or to welcome you into the restaurant.  The one hostess told, not asked, us to wait outside since we had a large group and they wanted to keep the lobby area clear.  It's hot and humid outside and with a party of eight that's going to spend a decent amount of money you could speak to people a bit more politely lady.

I didn't see much difference from Chuy's to somewhere like an On The Border.  It was "OK", but probably won't be seeing the likes of me again.
