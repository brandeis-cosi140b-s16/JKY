Don't come here if you have a big group, or are hoping for deep conversation. It's pretty small, pretty cramped, and the music is always blaring a few notches too loud.

That said, the food isn't bad for trendy Mexican, and is incredibly veggie friendly (NOT vegan friendly), which I appreciate. Both their red sauce and their tomato sauce, as well as both salsa, both beans and their rice, are all 100% vegetarian. That's incredibly hard to find here in Arizona.

I love the basics; the cheese enchiladas are what bring me back. I've deviated twice; once for the fajitas, and once for the chilie relleno.  Both were ok, but nothing to write home about. My partner devours the chimichanga, and says it's one of the best she's had. Oddly enough, neither of us have tried the tacos, which is what they're known for. Perhaps next time!
