I have been here twice and I am impressed. The salads here are amazing, and I love the atmosphere (especially the mango vinaigrette dressing), as it is very funky and bright. This looks like a great place for happy hour. I have eaten on the patio, and that is very nice too with lots of shade. I also had the chicken tortilla soup which was great with an avocado slice in there and a small drop of sour cream. It had a nice kick of spice! The prices are great and portions are hefty!
