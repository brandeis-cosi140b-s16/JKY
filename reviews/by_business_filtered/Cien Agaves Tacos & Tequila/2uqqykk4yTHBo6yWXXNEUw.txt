Stopped in for a drink on our first visit here. We live in Litchfield Park and are exploring the area. Old town is touristy but cool.

I'm a big tequila fan and Cien Agaves offers over 100 tequilas! I was tempted to try them all but only had the house margarita which they claim is the best in town. I'd like to say it was the best house margarita I've ever had. 

I also ordered the happy hour special tacos. They were well made and delicious. We were pleased with this pub and will return very soon.
