It's called 100 Tequilas, it's gotta be worth a shot, right? I've been here more than a few times and was pleased each time. This place is kind of tucked away on one of the many side streets in Old Town Scottsdale but it's worth the trip. 
I love that they have happy hour DAILY from 3p-7p. You can literally have a few margaritas ($3.50) and half price appetizers or ($1.50) tacos by yourself for about $25. I went there on a Sunday afternoon with 2 other ppl and we ordered about 7 appetizers, 9 margaritas, a dessert and coffee for a little over $60 and we were all full.
All in all, the food was pretty decent as were the drinks. I'd come here again to just hang out with a few ppl, watch sports on the many TV's and have a few drinks.
