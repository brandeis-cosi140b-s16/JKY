First off this place should have a way higher rating then 3 stars. Came here because my boyfriend bought a travelzoo deal and the food and margaritas were awesome. We both had seafood enchiladas and split a tostada appetizer. It was absolutely delicious. This restaurant also has a great taco Tuesday deal 1.50 shredded beef tacos and 2 dollar tecates. Will definitely be back again.
