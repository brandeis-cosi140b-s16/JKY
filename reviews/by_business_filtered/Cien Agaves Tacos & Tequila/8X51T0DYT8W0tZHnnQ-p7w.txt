Three words: creamy poblano soup. Even if this place did not have a liquor license I would still drive all the way to Old Town just for the soup. It's seriously one of the best things I have ever eaten. I don't just throw that around, either. It's perfectly balanced and I crave it like I do sushi.

But thank the Lord it DOES have a liquor license, otherwise it would just be called "Tacos." They hand-squeeze fresh limes for every single margarita. It makes for sore hands and more work for the bartender, but it is certainly worth it. It is honestly the best margarita I have ever had (aside from my own homemade ones, of course). The best thing about it is it's $3.50 during happy hour (3-7pm everyday), and happy hour lasts ALL DAY on Sunday during football season. Pretty awesome. I'm pretty in love with this place.

Also on Tuesdays, tinga tacos (chicken) are $1.50 and shredded beef tacos are $1.00 (if I remember correctly, don't quote me on that). Regardless, they're cheap. Also some cheap $2-3 beer deals, but beer is the same everywhere unless you're at a brewery, so whatever about that.

All in all, I love this place. OPEN A TEMPE LOCATION PLEASETHANKS!
