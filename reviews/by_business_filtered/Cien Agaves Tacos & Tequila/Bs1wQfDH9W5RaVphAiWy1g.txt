This was our first (and last time) going here. We wanted a taco Tuesday. A friend recommended it to us. We sat for at least 15 with nothing. Got our drink order filled. No chips or water for us. Food was just okay. Couldn't order desert cause nobody told our server the kitchen was closed. Too many other places to go than to go through that again...
