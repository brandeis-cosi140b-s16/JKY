Wow that is what i call a carne asada taco, plus i had my first $3 marg that you can actually taste the tequila in. Wow! Chips where nice and hot had to salt then of course so i can drink faster. Salsa was good, did not like the green one though, red one had plenty of flavor asked for the hot sauce to heat it up. The Carne Asada was actually real steak. Nice! will be back for sure, rumor has it the have taco specials tomorrow too.
