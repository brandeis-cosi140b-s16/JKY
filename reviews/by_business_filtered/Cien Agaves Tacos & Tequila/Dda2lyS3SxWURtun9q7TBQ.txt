The only reason I give this place a 2 star is because the food is fantastic but the service is absolutely horrible. We have come to this place very regularly for years and the staff changes almost monthly and never improves. It's almost a breeding ground for terrible servers. We sat down today and ordered food and a margarita. By the time we had finished our food the waitress had still not returned to check on us or ask if we wanted to order another drink. I finally got up and walked to the bar where she was just chatting with a friend and was shocked that I wanted something and actually caught her slacking off. I wish I could include a picture of the entire place. There is a total of 3 tables and 2 servers. Not a lot for either of these people to take care of. I don't ask for a lot. I just want someone to stop by once in a while to see if my drink needs refilled or maybe I want another taco. We will never know because they never gave it a chance.
