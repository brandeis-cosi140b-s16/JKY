I had really hoped this place would be better since the location was great (right in the middle of Old Scottsdale) and the inside looked nice, but that was about as far as it went. Although our waitress was nice, the service took FOREVER, and the place was not even full at lunch time. $10 for a regular margarita at lunch time seemed a little pricey to me too. We split the 3 taco plate and had a fish taco, lobster taco and carne asada taco. Both the fish and lobster tacos were fried, not lightly fried, but heavily battered and greasy. The carne asada did not have a lot of flavor. Probably OK to go here in a pinch, but there are probably hundreds of places better than this!
