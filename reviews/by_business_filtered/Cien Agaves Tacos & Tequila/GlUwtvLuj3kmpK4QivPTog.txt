I'm a Mexican food fanatic, and have been having issues finding a place that isn't so BLAH lately. Well, luckily I had the privilege to try out Cien Agave for a promo video we filmed and I was impressed! 

First I was able to try out the shrimp ceviche...a-ma-zing. It was so fresh and very light in the citrus. Too many times you get a ceviche that is over-powering in the lime juice, but Cien Agaves' is perfectly refreshing.

Then we were able to try out the shredded beef taco, lobster taco, and the Taco Al Pastor. I'm not usually a shredded beef taco fan, but let me just say that I've been craving it ever since. And what's even better is you can get them for $1 every Tuesday! And the Taco Al Pastor (marinated pork and grilled pineapple) was to die for. Yum yum yum. Can I go now please???

And of course the margaritas...they have reeeeeeeaaaaaaaaalllllllllllllyyyyyyyyyy good margaritas. I enjoyed the award winning house margarita...its a really great classic margarita, where they freshly squeeze the citrus, no pre-made crap in it at all. So good. And the cucumber margarita was amazing. 

Cien Agaves is just a really great little treasure in Old Town Scottsdale. They have a great atmosphere and a great staff. Go check them out.
