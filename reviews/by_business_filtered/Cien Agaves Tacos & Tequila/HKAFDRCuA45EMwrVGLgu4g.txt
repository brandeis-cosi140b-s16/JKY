We stumbled upon this place as we were looking for someplace to sit outside.  Being from NE, it seemed all the places in Scottsdale had on the heat--it was 70 degrees and too hot for heat for a NE girl.  

We planned on just having a drink but were surprised by the incredible selection of tacos.  We started with the ceviche appetizer which was good.   Chips and salsa was also good, with two salsa selections.  We then had the cheese dip appetizer, which was awesome.  It was definately "real" cheese as opposed to some of the other "cheese"dips I have had where they are 1% cheese and 99% something else like cheese food.

The taco selection included lobster, shrimp, chicken, pork, salmon.  Quite impressive.  They were all great.  

I'm no longer a tequila drinker but their selection is quite impressive and they make their margaritas all fresh with freshly squeezed lime juice.  I did take a sip of one, it was definately a winner!
