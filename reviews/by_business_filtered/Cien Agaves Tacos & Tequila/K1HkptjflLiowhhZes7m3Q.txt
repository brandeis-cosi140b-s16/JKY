This place was the setting for two of my "firsts". My first fish taco and my first cucumber margarita and I was far from let down! Holy goodness they were so great.
My husband and I had a weekend away from the kid so we decided to get some drinks and tacos. I've heard great things but it's always better to try it yourself!
The Mahi Mahi taco was FABULOUS and their cucumber margarita is my new favorite, and I'm not usually a margarita fan! 
We'll go back, for sure!
