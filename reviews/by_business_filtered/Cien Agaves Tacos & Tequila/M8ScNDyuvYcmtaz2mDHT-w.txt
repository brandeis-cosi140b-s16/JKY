My fianc√© and I went here for dinner. The place is very cute. 
The food was just ok, nothing special about It. But they did have some great food/drink specials till 7pm when we were there. Will I go back for the food? no. The food lacks flavor and that is what makes Mexican food so great. 
But I'll go back for margarita. 
Overall ok.
