Food was decent but not consistent. One lobster taco was cooked perfectly and the other was like rubber. I did enjoy the flavors, though, and the presentation was okay.

Still, two stars because neither my dinner-mate or I actually ordered a lobster taco at all. I knew we were in trouble when the server didn't write anything down and we both had a three taco combo. Talking to said waiter/bartender was impossible because he was in such a hurry and it was so loud anyway. I tried to catch his attention once as he ran by but that didn't work out...  So we ate what we got.

Why were we seated in the bar, you ask? We made a dinner reservation online at Cien Agaves' website but something was wrong with the system that day. Not sure if that was a technical or human fault but whatever. The only option was outside... At the end of June... Or in the bar. I actually saw another couple go spend some time outside and then leave, fanning themselves.

I'd like to try some of the other offerings but that's not likely to happen until it looks like they get their systems sorted out. That includes order taking, reservation taking, and uniform cooking.

Will check back in the future to see what other people have to say.
