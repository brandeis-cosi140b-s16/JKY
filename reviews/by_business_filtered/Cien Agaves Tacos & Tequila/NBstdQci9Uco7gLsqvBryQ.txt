To Owners, you should really consider covering the bright window so your first booth can be sat around 6!! We got the last booth avail and then saw 3 parties try to sit in the too much glare booth as they were warned by the hostess, and then upset that the only seating left was upstairs.  

The happy hour was good, I tried the house margarita, tinga taco, and an al pastor taco as well. I really didn't like how small the plate with the taco was, the tacos were almost falling off of the plate. I eat a lot of tacos at different restaurants and the entire experience was messed up because the 2 tacos were falling into each other on the really small plate. I liked the tinga taco but not the Al Pastor. 

Might come back for the atmosphere.
