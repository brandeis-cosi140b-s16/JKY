Cien Agaves is my "go to Mexican." The prices are great. I love their ahi salad, vegetable fajitas (ask for light oil on the veggies), and the tacos. There are so many choices of tacos. Another must have is a margarita. I have yet to try one that I don't like. The cucumber is amazing, especially on a summer day. I have always had quick and good service here.
