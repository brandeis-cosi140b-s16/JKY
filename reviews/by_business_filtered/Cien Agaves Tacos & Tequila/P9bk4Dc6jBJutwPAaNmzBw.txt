Friends from the area took us to Old Town to wander around and we stumbled upon Cien Agaves.  WOW! We're we impressed!  From the time we walked in until we left we were pleasantly surprised at every turn.  We just happened to have arrived on taco Tuesday to enjoy $2 shredded beef tacos and $2 Tecate but we also had tequila, margaritas and other dishes from the regular menu.  Our party shared the food and everyone was impressed.  When next we visit Arizona we WILL make this a mandatory stop.  Highly recommended!!!
