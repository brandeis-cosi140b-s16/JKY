Only okay.

On a visit to Old Scottsdale, I visited Cien Agaves based on Yelp reviews.
The waitress was friendly - if not particularly knowledgeable. I asked for an old-fashioned "not too sweet" margarita - made with lime juice and simple syrup rather than sour mix. She had no idea what I was talking about.  

I got the Two Taco plate  - a 'tinga' and a 'carne asada'. 
The 'tinga' tasted like the oil in the deep fryer hadn't been changed in a while.
kinda stale. The meat in the carne was both fatty and gristly. Maybe I just got a bad piece, but there were several inedible chunks in a fairly small taco.
The rice and beans were bland.

After I finished up my meal, the waitress asked if I'd like any more chips.
I mentioned that I hadn't  had any to start with, so I couldn't exactly have 'more'.
She gasped "didn't I bring you any chips?" Nope.

She got them, but needn't have bothered. They - like the tinga taco - were too oily and  stale tasting. The salsas were just not all that interesting.

Nothing here was bad, but nothing was all that good either.
I wouldn't go back.
