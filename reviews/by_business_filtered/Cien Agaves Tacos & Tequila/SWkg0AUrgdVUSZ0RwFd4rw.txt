Typical Mexican influenced bar with tacos. A little run down, but casual and down to earth. It has a rustic feel to it, and offered lots of seating. The ridiculous amount of tequila offered at the bar definitely draws in customers. Quite a sight to see! The food was mediocre, tacos and burrito were OK, nothing special. The rice tasted a little burnt and the black beans were the best part. Though the shrimp were cooked to perfection, they got it right!
