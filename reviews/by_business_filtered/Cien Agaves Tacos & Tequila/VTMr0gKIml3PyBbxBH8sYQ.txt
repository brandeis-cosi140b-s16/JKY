First time to Scottsdale and a friend took us to Cien Agaves. Loved the location!  Perfect for shopping and then dinner and drinks. We started with the margaritas and I have to say they were about the best I've ever had. Definitely enjoyed the cucumber one, very refreshing! For those who can tolerate spicy, I also loved the Habanero margarita. For an appetizer don't miss the cerviche. All the food was delicious and good size portions. Leave room for dessert because the flan was the best I've ever had.  Service was personable and attentive while laid back. This place is a definite thumbs up!
