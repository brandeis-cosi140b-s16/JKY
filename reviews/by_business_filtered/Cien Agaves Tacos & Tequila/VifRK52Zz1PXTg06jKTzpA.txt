HOLY HABENERO LIME MARGARITA.   

So I decided to man up and try this thing out after thinking about it many of times.  It was just as I expected hot and amazing.  After I was almost done though I was finishing my last sips when it happened.  I got a seed right into the back of my throat that was the painful moment that kept me away from ordering this thing before.  I managed to pull through though and finished it.  

I also got the 3 taco meal and the tacos were great I had tinga, lobster, and chorizo and papas.  The beans were horrible but the rice was ok so just order the tacos without sides and save yourself a bit of money.
