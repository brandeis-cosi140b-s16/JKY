Three-hundred-fifty pennies...during HH...for the best margaritas in town...equals four stars!

The chips and salsa were so-so (but gratis thankfully) and the carne asada tacos were very good.  Little Lady had the vegetarian tacos (zuchinni, yuck!) which she enjoyed (did I mention they were filled with zuchinni? yuck!).  We didn't have full dinner service as this was just an afternoon pit stop, but I would love to return.

The patio is nice and tucked away on the side, and we had a great afternoon snack and cocktail.  If I can find a couple solid go-to dishes, this place promises to be my go-to Mexican spot in the 'dale--and the 'dale needs some good Mexican food desperately!
