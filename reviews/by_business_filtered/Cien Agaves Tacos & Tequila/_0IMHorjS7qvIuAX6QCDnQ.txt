I ordered a bowl of soup to-go during my lunch break. The soup was recommended & I was excited to try it. The soup was nice. I have had better creamy poblano soup in San Diego. BUT this was wasn't bad. Only thing was I wish I had more of it. I ordered a 12oz bowl, and got 2 small, less than half filled containers of soup. I spoke with the Manager, Bob, he seemed distracted while speaking to me and almost like I was a bother. He said he would credit me a soup for next time. Thankfully the soup was good enough to go back and have again. Overall bad first impression, and mediocre customer service
