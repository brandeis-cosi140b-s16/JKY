We had a great experience here on cinco de mayo! Even though it was busy, our server was spot on! She checked on us frequently to make sure we had everything we needed. Excellent list of tacos...I got an ahi taco and grilled mahi mahi. Both delicious and a good size. They have a terrific margarita menu too-the good stuff, no bottled, sugary mix junk. Unfortunately we were too early for happy hour but they offer HH drink specials plus daily food specials like taco Tuesday! 
Cool artwork inside as well!
