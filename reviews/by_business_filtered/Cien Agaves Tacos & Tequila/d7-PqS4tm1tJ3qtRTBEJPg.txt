This is actually a 2 1/2 star review. Visited for lunch on  9/15/15 after looking at the menu and restaurant reviews on Yelp and Trip Advisor. We live in Payson and the Mexican restaurants up here are pretty bad. Unfortunately, Cien Agaves was disappointing. The restaurant is kind of a Mexican Steampunk decor but we liked it well enough. We found a high-top table & server arrived in a minute or two &  asked what we wanted to drink. I asked for a minute to look at the menu. She walked away without a word. We placed our drink order....a house Margarita for me. She never asked, or provided,  any Chips & Salsa...so I had to ask for them. They have a great selection of Margaritas and tequilas as well as types of tacos. I ordered the 3 taco platter....Shredded Beef, Shrimp Taco and a Fried Fish Taco on corn tortillas...the Fish in the taco was flavorless...needed salt. The cabbage in the tacos was plain old cabbage,, not dressed with anything, bland but I liked the sauce on the Fish Taco. I couldn't eat the Shrimp Taco...just too spicy and the shrimp were just small, frozen shrimp...nothing spectular. The Shredded Beef on the taco was hard, dry and stringy...inedible. I think the Kahlua flan was old. It was way too firm...not creamy and light but I liked the flavor of it. The Green Salsa was enjoyable but the Red Salsa was too watery and too spicy for me. The House Margarita was good but needed just a bit more sweetness.. Our server was unfriendly and spent more time in the kitchen than tending to her customers. Twice I  had to ask another server to find our server...she seemed totally disinterested in providing a good experience to customers. Unlikely to return or refer anyone to Cien Agaves...
