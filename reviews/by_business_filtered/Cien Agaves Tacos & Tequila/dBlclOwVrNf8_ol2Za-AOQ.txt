My husband and I tried Cien Agaves this past week with a groupon. The groupon does not cover happy hour food/drinks so I ordered a margarita from the regular menu. $12.00 and it was all juice. My husband ordered the fried chimichanga which he absolutely loved....I ordered the seared ahi salad ($15)which was utterly disgusting. It was a large plate of a bunch of salad leafs and about 6 strips of ahi. The ahi was not pink at all... and was mushy ewww!  Obviously it was previously frozen.  Lesson learned....order mexican food when eating at a mexican restaurant.
