My brother-in-law had a Groupon for a tequila tasting event Thursday, 9-27.  Great atmosphere with bright colors, Dia de los Muertes theme, luchadors, and sugar skulls.  The tequila event was upstairs and was run well.  Nice to see Roger selling his own wares (Mexican Moonshine)!  Decided to hang out after event and have cigars on the downstairs patio.  I was initially vary of the service from earlier reviews, but our waitress was attentive and made out taco selections for us.  Tacos were fantastic.  The breaded fish was cooked well and not oily.  The carne asada was tender and the guacamole was fresh.  Even on regular hours the price was right.  Definitely a place to go back for during happy hour.  Only giving four starts since I have not tried more on the menu, but that extra star is around the corner!
