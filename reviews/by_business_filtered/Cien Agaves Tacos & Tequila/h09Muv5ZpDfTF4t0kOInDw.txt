I eat here often. I usually get a variation of different tacos at different times and their burritos are pretty good too.  The only thing that bothers me is that the carne asada tacos only come with one tortilla and it always falls apart. I think it should come with two. I have also tried the margaritas and that too was pretty d-lish. Over all I would recommend you try it.
