My first response to parking in front of Cien Agaves was "what in the hell am I doing in tourist land?" Old Town is such a piece of shit. Unless you like fake western hokey crap stores and indian flute music, you'll want to barf. Of course, when you walk into Cien Agaves, you're transported to a different type of atmosphere instantaneously. 

They score with Moises' art on the walls, with the industrial looking staircase in the middle of the restaurant, and the generally good soundtrack. There are parts of the restaurant that feel like the divey little places you'd find in Guadalupe, and other parts feel like a Tempe college kid bar. None of it, however, feels like a nice restaurant. The diamond plating in the restrooms is oddly reminiscent of a shotty strip club. 

The food here was about what I would expect. Not as good as The Mission, Barrio Cafe, Los Sombreros, etc. But much more interesting than a place like Los Olivos. They offer about a dozen different tacos with all sorts of seafood, meat, and bird. Service on my visit was a little slow. We waited about 15 minutes for our check and finally asked for it. Who knows how long we would have waited otherwise. 

My main observation while here was the crowd. Even though the restaurant feels like the divey Tempe college kid restaurant, the crowd it draws is a little different. There were quite a few roided up douchebags with spider web tattoos, affliction shirts, and stupid gay shit eating grins with some fake tittied blonde with a nosejob hanging on them. It kind of seemed like a bar for Scottsdale douchebags when they want to "slum it" and have "mexican" food.

I'll probably go back eventually, but if you're looking for a place to have good Mexican food, skip Cien Agaves. If you want to sip a few Coronas and have some tacos and salsa, you'll be happy as a clam here.
