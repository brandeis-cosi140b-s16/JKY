If you're going to a Giants spring training game you must go here first! Their happy hour is second to none.  We were there on a Tuesday and they had $2 tecate, $1.50 shredded beef tacos and half price appetizers.  They bring you free chips with 2 different types of salsa.  We left there with full bellies and spending $30 (which included a very generous tip).
