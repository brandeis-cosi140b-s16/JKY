Had the tacos on special.  Yum... good stuff.  But they really felt like "cheap" tacos.  They arrived a bit wet and could not be picked up with your hand without ripping through the tortilla.

Guacamole was good.  

Dining area was okay.  A bit loud.

I will probably be back, but mostly because the price is right.
