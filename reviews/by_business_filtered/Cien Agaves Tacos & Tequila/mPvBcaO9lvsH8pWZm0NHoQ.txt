I love the atmosphere in this restaurant but I think the food is pretty bland.  I've been here twice, I tried the big ass burrito with chicken and the carne asada tacos, I've had better though.  I do like their margaritas though especially the happy hour $3.50 margarita, you get the bang for your buck with the drinks.
