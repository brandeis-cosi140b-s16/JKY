Last night was my third time to this fresh and well-spirited (both figuratively and literally) tequila bar. It has not disappointed...

Aside from the pretty but grumpy hostess, I have nothing but praise and accolades. The tacos have been amazing each time, the fajitas had that smell that just makes you inhale and savor, and the tequila collection is probably the best I've seen - over 100, mostly high end blancos, repos, anejos and even some of the best (still in production) XAs around. 100 tequilas in a year and you're considered royalty with a picture on the bar and happy hour pricing for life - if you're from Phoenix why aren't you already there? Heck, I only come into town now and then but I'm aiming high. Like I said, the best shelf around. 

The servers have been super friendly and attentive, the 'tenders each time have stopped mixing just long enough to say "hey" when we walked in. I'm giving the service 4.9 stars (just that hostess that one time...)

Parking is easy, the place is fun. If you haven't come for a tequila pour yet, you're missing out.  "DJ 1942 neat, please?"
