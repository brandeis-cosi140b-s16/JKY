I'm a fan of places that don't try to do too much. "Jack of all trades, master of none" is a system that works for the Cheesecake Factory or the Yardhouse, and that's fine. However, I'd usually prefer to dine at a place that does just a few items well. Cien Agaves is an example of this. They do tacos and tequila. Yes, they have a couple of other standard-fare mexican items, but they're all about the tacos and tequila.

I had been there once before, and last night I went there again for a birthday party. Off the top, their tequila selection is solid - plenty of sippers available, and the prices are reasonable.

I did the 3-taco platter. Based on a friend's suggestion, I tried the Tinga taco, and that was the only one I didn't love. It wasn't bad or anything, but just not my thing. The Camarones a la diabla taco was delicious and had the bite as advertised, and the Ahi tuna taco was fantastic.

I look forward to returning sometime to enjoy their happy hour.
