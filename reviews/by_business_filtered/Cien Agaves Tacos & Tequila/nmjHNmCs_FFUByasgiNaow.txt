My family and I ate here while we walked around old town one day they were visiting. I didn't know this existed, until we passed by and looked it up on Yelp mobile on my sister's phone. We saw it's reviews, and decided to give it a shot. 
It was busy downstairs, and but slow upstairs where we were. At first we had trouble getting water refills and chip refills, but I'll give it to the servers, it got packed quick upstairs (I think the Giant's spring training game got rained out). They eventually took a good chunk off of our bill, which was cool. 
As far as food goes, we all ordered the different taco assortments. Mine were fantastic! A shredded beef taco, carne asada, and a fish. It was the perfect amount of food. We were all happy with our food. 
Although this place is a tad on the divy side (no problem to me...dives are not necessarily bad), the food was great! I'd like to try some of their tequilas some day....I'll be back.
