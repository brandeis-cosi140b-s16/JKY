My wife and I chose Cien Agaves for lunch during our visit to Old Town Scottsdale.  We found it was a great spot for lunch.  I found the interior very bar-like and pretty loud but that's fine for lunch.  

I was really impressed by their tequila selection and we had two fabulous margaritas during lunch.  My wife absolutely loved the cucumber margarita.  I was a bit skeptical but I did enjoy it.  Especially considering it was 108 outside!   

The ceviche was really tasty but the shrimp could have been cut up smaller.  It kept falling off our chips and was much larger than the rest of the ceviche.  We had three different tacos and all were really good and not your typical fare.  I'd say the Taco al Pastor was my favorite but my wife really enjoyed the veggie tacos with the sauteed veggies for the filling.  The other thing to note about the tacos was that there were at least 10 different types.  I wanted to try them all out (just like the margaritas) but that'll have to wait for another time.

Don't know how this place would do for dinner.  I'd highly recommend it for the margaritas and the tacos were good but it's more of a casual place.  The price also seemed okay considering how good the margaritas were but it's not cheap.  We spent $50 for 2 margaritas, 3 tacos and the ceviche.  We had good tequila in the margs so there were in the $9-11 range.  We would definitely come again.
