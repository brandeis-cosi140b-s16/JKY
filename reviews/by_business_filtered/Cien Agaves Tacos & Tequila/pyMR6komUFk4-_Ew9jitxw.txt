This place is of the charts good. My bartender, Wyatt, was the most refined scholar and gentleman I have had the pleasure to be served tequila by.  The owner even stopped by to ask how I was doing. It was like I had known him for years.  I told him I was doing "f-ing great". I like to see an owner that gets out on the floor and gets his hands dirty.  All nice people serving very good food .

Get the cucumber margarita, but only if you want your life changed forever (in a good way).
