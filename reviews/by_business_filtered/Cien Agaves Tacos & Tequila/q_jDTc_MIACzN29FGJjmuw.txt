First stop for the bachelorette party!  We made reservations, but they weren't needed since the place was pretty dead at 8pm.  Our group of 7 started off with margaritas, and I always love when they aren't full of sweet and sour mix.  When we wanted a round of tequila shots, the waitress recommended one no one had heard of and it was gooood stuff!  Even the tequila shot virgin enjoyed it!  

I'm not sure what everyone else thought, but my bean and cheese burrito was good - complete with my favorite black beans!  Service was great for our large group, and even though I wanted a refill on the chips and salsa I certainly didn't NEED one so I can't complain.  

Next time, I definitely want to do a tequila flight!
