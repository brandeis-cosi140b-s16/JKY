This is my favorite Tequila/Mexican restaurant in Phoenix! The staff is super cool and very attentive. The food is highly addictive, and they have a TON of Tequila. Bob and Rocky are great guys, they always say hello to everyone and make people feel genuinely welcomed. When I walk into Cien Agaves, I feel relaxed and calm. A true beautiful oasis in the desert! MUST TRY!
