None of their staff seems very excited to be there ever!  I have been here at all different times and it is always the same humdrum.  

This last time I went with a friend of mine for a late dinner.  There was still 40 minutes till close, so it was not like we skipped in at the last second.  You could tell the bartender was not too happy about us showing up.  He offered us drinks and I had to request a menu, then he stood there staring at us while we decided what to order.  We ended up ordering 3 different kinds of tacos.  He failed to ask us if we wanted flour or corn tortillas, and they came out with flour tortillas; I am not a fan of flour tortillas.  It was just not a pleasant dining experience aside from my company.  

I can say they have a great taco Tuesday Happy Hour, but otherwise, I would never come here for anything else.
