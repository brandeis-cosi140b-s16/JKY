I have been eating here for about 3 years and there is one thing that keeps bringing me back. The Tinga Taco. 

The tinga is the single best taco I have ever had. Shredded marinated chicken thrown into a crispy shell then the whole thing deep fried. Throw in there fantastic chips and salsas and you got my favorite place to go in the valley for tacos.
