love this place.. ya they do tinga!  go with a group and order a bunch of tacos.. I order my tinga tacos in a non crisp shell / instead a basic corn tortilla... good cocktails, 4 stars only because I think they run a pretty lean labor and leads to, not offensive, yet dragged out service sequence.  I have never left unhappy... been there 5 times now.  Yes it is old town, and it is really good, just don't bookend yourself with an appointment after your meal and it will be perfect.
