We came here with a party of 9.  Our table wasn't quite ready when we arrived because a couple occupying our last table we needed had been sitting there for an hour with empty plates and glasses.  My pet peeve!  Please!  If you are a customer, don't just sit and take up space without ordering something - it's so rude!  Nevertheless, the manager was able to set us up outside and actually I preferred that - coming from Oregon we will take outside seating whenever we can get it!

The salsa was so good the chips were mainly just a disguise for me drinking it.  We got a pitcher of sangria and a bunch of margaritas, all very good.  I really liked the flavor of the margarita with the habanero in it.  It was VERY spicy, but the flavor was better than some I've had with a jalapeno.  

Our server was really nice and attentive and everyone enjoyed their meals.  The only thing I didn't care for was the pico on the tacos.  It was so onion-heavy it made the tacos a bit bitter.
