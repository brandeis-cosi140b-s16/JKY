I recently dined here with some friends on a Sunday, and it will definitely be my last time.  The food took FOREVER to got.  The drinks were mostly mixer...I saw one previous comment on here that said they were "virgin" drinks. That's a great description. Our waitress was a despondent little grouch who definitely had an expression on her face suggesting that she had somewhere better to be. Maybe she did. 

I also don't know why people keep saying "great" prices.  The Margaritas are $10 dollars! The fast food chain Chipotle is a better mexican food experience.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY AT CIEN AGAVES!!!!
