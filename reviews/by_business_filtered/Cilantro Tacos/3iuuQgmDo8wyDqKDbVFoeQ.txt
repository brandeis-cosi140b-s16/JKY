This is basically a take out place with 10 small tables crowded in.We came here because we saw their commercials on television, which makes the place look a lot large than it is.  They advertised 'happy hour,'  which consists of $2.95 bottled beers and $1.50 street tacos.   Menu has basic  Mexican staples.  While the restaurant wasn't obviously dirty our table was sticky.  Fast food restaurant Pollo Loco has better atmosphere (but no beer). I ordered a Chili relleno burrito, which consisted of a small chili relleno wrapped with a huge amount of rice inside a flour tortilla.  Ugh!  I have no idea what the cook was thinking.  Never, never, never.  And at $8.  My partner ordered enchiladas, which were not bad, but, not any better than we would have gotten from the grocery store and heated up ourselves.  We ordered four tacos, which were the best part of our meal.  For happy hour the tacos  cost $1.50 apiece; Outside of happy hour they're $2.  The food truck across the street sells the same thing for $1 apiece with no happy hour requirement.
