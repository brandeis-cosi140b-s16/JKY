The service was very good. He was very attentive and kind. It was a little hot but hey, we're in Vegas!

The carne Asada fries were yummy. They were the thick steak fries- my fave. 

Carne Asada is fresh and the salsa bar is small but pleasing. 

I give it four stars because my sister thought her carne Asada burrito tasted kinda fishy- maybe it was the rice? 

Definitely give it a try :)
