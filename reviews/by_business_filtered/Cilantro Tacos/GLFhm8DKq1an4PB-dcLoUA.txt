In Vegas for the weekend and I was craving some Mexican food. Since I wasn't staying on The Strip, I used Yelp to look and found a pretty decent place. I ordered their Cilantro Fries, their version of carne asada fries, and it was so good. When I usually order an item like this back home, the fries are shoestrings and there are so many of them, that eventually you leave the uncoated fries behind. 
That wasn't the case with this one. They used thick steak fries. I had to use a for AND knife in order to eat it. Also the portion was so generous, that I only ate half of it and doggie bagged the rest. The perfect morning hangover meal. I do wish there was more meat on the fries because it was so nice and tender. 
Also their salsa is so good, especially their green one. Most of the green salsa is very watery and hot, but with not enough flavor. But this one had a thick consistency and tasted really good with the added spices, such as pepper. 
The staff was also very attentive, coming by every so often to ask us how our food is. From now on when I'm in Vegas, I will go out of my way to try out the rest of their menu. :)
