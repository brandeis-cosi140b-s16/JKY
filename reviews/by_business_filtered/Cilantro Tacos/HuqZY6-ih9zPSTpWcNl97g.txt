The food and atmosphere at Cilantro Tacos is excellent. I ate here once before and was instantly hooked. It is nearby my house and is a great way to brag to my friends who have to eat regular fast food where they live. They are willing to travel because I have told them I always experience a warm and inviting feel from the staff and the food taste amazing. They bring you a menu to your table and offer chips and salsa. The music is good as well. I recommend this place to anyone who enjoys authentic tasting food and great deals. The 2 dollar street tacos are amazing! The salsas should be bottled they are fresh and thoughtful. We also tried a dessert the Tres Leches, it was absolutely amazingly delicious. I'm definitely coming back to try more items on their very affordable menu. They even deliver!!!
