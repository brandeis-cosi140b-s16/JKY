Great tasty soft tacos. I had chorizo,  carnitas, and lengua. My favorite has to be the carnita - but all were excellent. The house salsas are very good. Also,  the sweet tamales are mouth watering . So flavorful. The best sweet tamales EVER.

I passed by this place so many times on my way to other places - now Tacos Cilantro is definitely on the map.

Service is good,  decor nothing fancy but clean. Prices are very fair. Tacos are full of flavor.
