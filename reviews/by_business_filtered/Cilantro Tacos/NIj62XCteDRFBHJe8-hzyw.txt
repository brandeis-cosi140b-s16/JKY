Not sure how I missed this place as it is next door to my dry cleaners I've used for 3 years.  I wouldn't have even noticed it if it wasn't for my fat fingers hitting the wrong button on the app.  I was attempting to select Talk but hit Monocle (which I have NEVER used prior) and Cilantro Tacos was literally right in front of me.

The reviews have been right on for this place.  I immediately noticed how large the place is as it does not look like it from the outside. The facility is nice and bright, super clean and simply decorated.  The music is appropriate for the venue but not loud or obnoxious, just right to help compliment the atmosphere.

The menu is straight forward and diverse.  It was my impression I should order at the counter, but since they were a little slow at the time, they provided us with menu and stated to have a seat and they would take our order at the table.  The staff was very helpful, smiling and prompt.  Although the soft drink machine was available for us to refill our drinks a few feet away; the staff would refill our drinks when they passed by, as well as refresh the chips and salsa as needed.  

We ordered the street tacos and enchilada plate.  Both came out steaming hot and fresh and were very good.  I thought the red and green sauces were just right, but my date felt it was HOT!  They have a salsa bar with a decent range of salsa which helped her find the right heat for her tacos.  

All in all I was happy and will be returning to try more items on the menu.  Oh...don't forget to get your free soft drink when you check in the first time.
