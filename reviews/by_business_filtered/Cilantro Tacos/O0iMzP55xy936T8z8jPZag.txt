Very nice workers. Very clean. Salas are great . Some are spicy. Loved it. There rice and beans are good. I got 4 rolled taquitos. 2 chicken 1 beef 1 carnitas. Chicken was marinated in red Chipotle type of sauce.  Very good lots of flavor.  How ever they need to give more Lettuse and cheeses I used what they gave me on the side for just 1 taco lol.. So I had to ask for more hehe. The beef was good I like the chicken better but was good. Carnitas was also good. I will definitely come back. But will get all chicken. . VERY GOOD
