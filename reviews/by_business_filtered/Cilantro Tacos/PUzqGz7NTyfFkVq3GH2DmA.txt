I was excited to try this place because of all the great reviews by other Yelpers. I was so disappointed! Being that I'm Mexican, I have high expectations for Mexican food. The restaurant itself is nice and clean. The staff is nice and on top of making sure your visit is pleasant. The food? Not so much. I had two tacos, one al pastor and the other carne asada...they were just "eh." I also had a chicken sope and the chicken was very greasy. Basically the sope was bland. My son had a carne asada burrito, which he raved about. What I did love was the Aguas frescas. I had pineapple and my son had an horchata and they were both very tasty. Would I go back to this place? I'm going to say, no.
