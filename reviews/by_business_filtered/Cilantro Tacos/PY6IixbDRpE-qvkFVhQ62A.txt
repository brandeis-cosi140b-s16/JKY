Food was great, I HIGHLY recommend the fish tacos which one of the cooks recommended to me! But most of all the customer service this young lady (maybe 13ish) that works there provided blew my mind, she already knows what it takes to be in the hospitality field more than some grown women I work with at Aria. Food was yummy but it was this lil lady that just made me a regular. 9/18/13
