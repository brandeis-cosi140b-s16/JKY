The family kiddies and I were craving good Mexican food. It's hard to find corn dressed right & they knocked it out of the park. The guacamole is fresh, the beans perfect for picky tummies & their salsa selection is no joke. I had the fish taco & it was better than my current joint. This is authentic cooking with a super friendly staff & very clean establishment. We'll be eating here again very soon.
