High priced FROZEN food......
The only possitive part of our visit was the nice waiter. No AC only a floor fan by the salsa bar. 
The food quality was awful.  Home made fries, NOPE actually frozen (also not cooked correctly). 
Fish Frozen! Carne asada, no flavor. 
2 quesadillas, 5 tacos and an order of asada fries total bill $48. 
Best part, everyone in our party got sick.
DON'T WASTE YOU'RE TIME OR MONEY.....
