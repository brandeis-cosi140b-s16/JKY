I've driven past this place many times...finally went and was impressed.  It was clean, the people were friendly, and they had a good salsa bar. 

Highlights were the habanero salsa, the green salsa, al pastor tacos, and the street corn (elote).  The corn was very flavorful and huge...and they actually brought two ears of corn for one of my friends because they said that they didn't have enough large ears. I will be back for more elote and that salsa.  
Stay away from the fish tacos...not very good (but at least it wasn't fried!).
