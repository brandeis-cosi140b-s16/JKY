Just ate here for the first time with my husband and we will definitely be back! This place is super clean and the family that runs it are so welcoming. They go above and beyond for their customers. The cabeza tacos were super tasty and all the salsas are amazing and fresh. The green one was our favorite. If you go on the weekend, ask about their dessert specials. we just had the strawberry tamale and rice pudding and they were both really good. Great job cilantro tacos!
