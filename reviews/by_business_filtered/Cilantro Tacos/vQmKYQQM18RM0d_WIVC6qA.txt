This place is REALLY good! I stopped by because I was looking at places nearby online and I seen that this place had really good reviews. And of course, I love some tacos :). 

When I walked in the guy up front was very nice ( his name was Juan). He greeted me  right away and asked if we were going to dine in or take out.. when I said take out, he still handed me a menu which I liked. I ended up ordering a carne asada taco plate and it was SO GOOD! I've been trying to find some authentic tacos in my area for a while now and this place is it. Not only that, the Mexican rice was very tasty with good consistency. The beans were also good (which I rarely find now a days) and was not watery what's so ever. I was very impressed. .

It only took a few minutes to get my food and the place was VERY clean. I'm usually pretty scared of the salsa bars but this one was very well kept up. Nice and looked very sanitary.

Another thing that I noticed was it was all males working. I like that! They seem like they work really well together and they know how to make the customers happy and satisfied.

I will be coming back :)
