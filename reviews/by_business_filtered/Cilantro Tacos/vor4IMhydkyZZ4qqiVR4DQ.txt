The food was really good. We got the carnitas family platter among other things and it was so good. Even better was the service. We had a party of 10 show up 1/2 hour before they closed and stood there forever deciding but it didn't faze them. They kept bringing us tortillas and making sure we were happy. It's far from my house but I will be going back.
