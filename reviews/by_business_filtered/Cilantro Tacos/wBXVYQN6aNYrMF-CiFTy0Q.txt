I was underwhelmed by the chorizo and papas taco (I hold chorizo anything to a very high standard). But the carnitas taco was excellent. I plan to try this place again and get something different. My date got the shrimp something and he liked it a lot. I want to give it another shot to see if it has a place in my regular rotation.
