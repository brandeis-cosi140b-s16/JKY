Just had lunch with my wife here for the first time. Both of us were very happy we decided to give them a try. We needed a quick lunch before an appointment and they delivered. First impression the place was spotless and the menu very simple. She ordered 3 chicken tacos and I had 4 carne asada tacos. $2 a piece and very satisfying. We got exactly what was ordered and the 3 salsas were very tasty. We will be visiting again for sure.
