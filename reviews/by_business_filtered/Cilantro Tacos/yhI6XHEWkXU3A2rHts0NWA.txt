Sorry guys, am I eating the SAME food as the rest of ya?

I tried one of each taco.  Nothing really noteworthy IMO.

The Al Pastor was a chunky version, but it was also a little tough/chewy.  Not a ton of flavor compared to the better ones in Vegas.

The Asada was on the dry end...also a little CHEWY.  There were tougher bites in there...tendon/fat cuts.

The Carnitas and Pollo are the better bets here.  They were better than the others, but just "good" overall.

Also, all the tortilla were DRY and a little hard on the edges.  These tasted like the store bought ones and didn't feel fresh...To the point that they were distracting from the meat/salsa/etc.

Same could be said about the chips they dropped in front of me after I already had my tacos.  The salsa is great here, but the chips are also probably store bought and a little stale.

I hate to sound like a taco snob, but there are many other places with BETTER tacos for the same money or less.  To me, this place tasted like a cheaper/less quality Michoacan, and I don't really enjoy their food either.

However, their Horchata was GREAT!  One of the better versions out there! Lots of cinnamon and flavor inside.  There are some winners in the salsa bar as well, although I personally didn't find any "spicy" ones.

Can't say I will be back, but hope you enjoy the pics :
