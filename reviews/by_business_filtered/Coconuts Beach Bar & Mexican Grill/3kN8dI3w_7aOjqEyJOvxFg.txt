This place serves mediocre food at best at an expensive price.  Refried beans are watery looks like they basically too a can of pinto beans and poured them on the plate. Chips and salsa costs an additional $5 even with a meal.  Not sure how they are managing to stay open.  Waitresses look like they came from Hooters.  There are better places for Mexican and lots of better places to eat and drink at Town Square!  Skip this one!
