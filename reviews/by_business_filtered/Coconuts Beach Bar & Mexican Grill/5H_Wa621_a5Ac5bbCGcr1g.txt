This applies for Happy Hour only. Picked this place out to meet with my friends for Girls' Night Out. I was in town for for a few days, and apparently this place was renovated. Yelp reviews were mixed but decided to go anyway. Service was okay (server didn't hover, but it was tough to get her attention when we needed her), drinks were okay (strong red sangria) , but the food was great! We ordered multiples of the ceviche and chicken taquitos. Those things are yummy!
