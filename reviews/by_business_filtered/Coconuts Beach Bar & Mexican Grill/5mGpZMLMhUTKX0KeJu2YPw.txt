This was the worst meal I can ever remember having! The only positive part of the meal was the waitress's positive attitude.

We ordered a Escalante Margarita (their version of a Cadillac) and a Blood Orange Margarita. The Escalante went back because it was too sweet. The Blood Orange tasted like punch, but I decided to just deal with it.

We ordered a ceviche (Shrimp and Ahi) appetizer. It was really shrimp and avocado in a wine glass with V8 Juice! Sent it back!

We ordered Beef Fajitas to share. Asked for the meat to be Medium Rare, what arrived was medium dead! They included only three cold stale tortillas for the two of us to share. We asked for some more tortillas and they brought three more, only this time they were the way tortillas are supposed to be. The meat was way over cooked and drowned in oil (maybe the lifeguard chair in the entry way was for the guy responsible for preventing drownings, but he was off for the night). (BTW, they tried to charge $.75 for the extra 3 tortillas)

Because we checked in on Yelp, there was a free desert offer. We ordered the non-coconut Flan. We received a medicine tasting coconut Flan. The waitress took it back to get us the one without coconut, but came back saying that the kitchen does not know the difference between the ones with coconut and without. (Really, hope they know the difference between rat poison and pepper!) We were offered another desert choice but had already given up and free still  sounded too expensive!

With all the problems the waitress told us that the manager told her to only charge us for the drinks but did not bother to come and speak with us. (The comped food bought them no good will, as the manager did not feel the need to do better or hear from his customers! I give this place 3 months before they  close their doors.)
