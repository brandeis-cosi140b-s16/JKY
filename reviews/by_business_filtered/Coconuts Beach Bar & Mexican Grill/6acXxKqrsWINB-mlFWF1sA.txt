This restaurant is located in town square, upstairs across from the movie theaters and across from Ranch house restaurant.

Went in for lunch. Not very busy with only 5 tables occupied.
The hostess went to seat us at the lousiest  spot in the room with most of the room empty as its a pretty big place. So we asked to be seated at a booth. Wow this seemed to really piss her off and she brought us to a booth pinned against the rail next to a pillar. So sitting down I see holes in the booth seats like cigarette burn holes. Really?? You can't even smoke in there and the restaurant is like a month or 2 new.
The decor is kinda like beach and swap meet furnishings coming together in a bad way. The booth table top was Way too high where your plate would be like chest high. Very awkward. I'll post a couple of pics that give the flava.  
The menu looked and sounded good but I couldn't smell anything and the vibe was bad, so we left before eating.

Normally i give a second shot, but too many things wrong in a short time. Not worth my time nor do they deserve my money. I won't return
