Where can I start with this place? I don't even know where to begin...

First of all, it took us a while to get seated for lunch, and the restaurant was not full by any means.Where was the host to greet us when we walked in? I don't know, but after we stood at the front for a while, we finally got someone to seat us.

It took a while for our server to come over. Not sure if we were forgotten, but we sat there staring, again waiting to get someone's attention. We finally had someone come over, and we placed our drink order. When our drinks were brought back, I asked for a suggestion on what to get for lunch since it was my first time dining there. The answer was "everythings good." Seriously? Wow.

I settled on the bean and cheese burrito, which at any other mexican establishment I would have loved. This burrito was bland, no flavor, and the refried beans were hard and pasty, kind of like they had been sitting there for a while. The cheese was not even melted and it was lukewarm. Eww. When I told the server she didn't really have a reaction, no I'm sorry, nothing. No manager ever came to the table, but I'm not surprised since I've heard this place was run poorly, and it shows.

Food was disgusting, drinks over priced for the amount of alcohol they claim to put in them. Staff was unattentive and not friendly at all. They seemed to all hate their jobs, and man does it show. 

I don't care how much they may advertise on facebook or around town, this place is poorly run, and no one seems to care. Skip this place, go right across to Blue Martini. They take better care of you, and have much better attitudes.
