Went with 4 friends.  After we were done we bet how long this place would be open?   All our food came at once.  So the appetizer and our soup got pushed aside. The staff was very dumb and didn't care how long empty plates and bowls stacked up.  I give the food 4 out of 10....  Go home hungry or just hit Millers or the Yardhouse!!!!
