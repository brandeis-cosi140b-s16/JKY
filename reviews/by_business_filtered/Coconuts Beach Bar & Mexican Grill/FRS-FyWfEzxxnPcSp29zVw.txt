The food was great, but the service bad enough for me to say something, which I normally don't.  I work in the service industry, and customer service is everything. Coconuts doesn't understand that . I came in for dinner, there were maybe 15 patrons, and staff standing around. It took ten minutes for someone came over and take our drink order, then it took ten minutes to get the beers. Sadly, I was sitting close enough to the bar that I could see our drinks just waiting to be sent out. Then someone came and asked what would you like to drink, we explained we had already ordered and that they were sitting at the bar... then no one came back for ten more minutes.

After an hour waiting for our food, they brought it out. It looked great, but with in that one hour timeline, no one brought napkins or silverware. As an employee walked by I asked for the silverware and napkins.... nothing happened. Then I saw a manager walking around. We flagged her down and explained  the issue, she ran and got us the silverware and came back with one napkin...we had burgers and tacos. Mind you this was after our food had been on our table for almost five minutes.  She came back with a pile of napkins, then the guy I originally came back about fifteen minutes with them.   

Finally, the meal was over, the manager brought us our bill, which was all wrong. She felt pretty bad, gave us a few free rounds. Maybe they had an off day or something, but the service would make your grandparents roll over in their grave.  The food was good though, good luck trying this place out.
