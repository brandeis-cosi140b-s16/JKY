Visited 1/28/12 and 1/29/12

Tried to come in on a Saturday night, around 930pm.  Nope too late, kitchen closed at 9:30pm.   Seriously, on a weekend?  Went to Miller's Ale House instead.  Came in the next night earlier, around 6:30pm.. Was told  "slow night, kitchen closes at 7pm".  So we have to hurry and order.  Anyways, ordered the Nachos.. pretty good, lots of toppings.  Ordered the Chicken tacos.  Not very tasty, flour tortilla tasted like paper. For desert,  The churros were pretty good. caramel and chocolate dipping sauces were nice. The cook/manager came by a couple times to ask how we were doing.  Only reason I came was I paid $4 for a $20.00 cert thru http://www.restaurant.com.  Not sure If I'd come back.  Of course I'm not sure how long this place will be around at the rate they are going.  Id be willing to bet that the boarded windows will be coming here by the end of the month.
