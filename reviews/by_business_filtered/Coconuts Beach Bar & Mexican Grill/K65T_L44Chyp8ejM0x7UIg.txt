HAPPY HOUR!

My cousin and I were looking for a place to go in town square for happy hour and we wondered into Coconuts. We had so much fun! Our bartender Adam was awesome we was very attentive and had a great attitude. Everyone was friendly, It seemed like a lot of the people in the bar area were locals who frequent the place. 

Although we didn't really eat here, the drinks were good and cheap BOGO and the chips and salsa were great!

***Adam told us on Sat nights they have salsa dancing, we are planning on checking it out:)
