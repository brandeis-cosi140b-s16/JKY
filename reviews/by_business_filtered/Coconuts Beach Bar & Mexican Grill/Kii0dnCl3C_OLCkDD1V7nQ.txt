Awful restaurant! This place USED TO BE AWESOME when it was Lolita's. The new-age Mexican food they offered was flavorful and every dish was a culinary experience. Since this place became Coconuts the food has turned to crap. Everything we tried was overcooked, under seasoned and swimming in tasteless sauce.  Tables were sticky and dirty, not tablecloths, and poor service given.  

Do yourself a favor and do not come to eat here. It's a waste of time and money.
