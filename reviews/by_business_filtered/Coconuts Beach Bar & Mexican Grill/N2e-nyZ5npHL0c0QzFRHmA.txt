My boyfriend and I were shopping at Town Square, and decided to try this place. I have been to a Coconuts restaurant in Mexico, and thought maybe this was part of a chain, but I was wrong.  I think this is the 3rd or 4th restaurant in this location, so I'm not sure how long it will stay open.  

We were greeted and seated by the hostess, who was friendly, but this may have been her first job, as she was really young.  It took about 5 minutes or so for us to be acknowledged by a server, and I guess we weren't in her station because she took our drink orders, and another server brought them to us.  I ordered the bean and cheese burrito, and my boyfriend had the fish tacos.  My burrito was ok, but it was lukewarm at best, and the cheese inside was barely melted.  I didn't say anything because I figured they would just nuke it, and when I got it back it would be too hot to eat.  The chips and salsa were good, but it was a small serving, and they charge for them when most Mexican places just give them to you.  

The atmosphere of the restaurant is really targeting the younger crowd, maybe college students and 20-somethings.  I don't think I saw a male server, but there was a male bartender.  The girls were all in cutoffs, really, really short cutoffs, and bikini tops.  It was chilly in there too, so not sure what they will do when the weather is colder.  There was also a guy that was blowing alcohol onto a flame in a bottle, making a big fire ball.  Very entertaining.....NOT! 

 It is reasonably priced, and if I were still in college, it would probably be a great place to hang out on a Friday or Saturday night.  I will probably go again to try something else on the menu, but it won't be a regular place for dinner for me.
