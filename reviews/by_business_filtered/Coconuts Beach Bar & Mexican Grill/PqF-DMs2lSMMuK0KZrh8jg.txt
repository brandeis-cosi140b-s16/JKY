We were at Town Square looking for something different since Yardhouse was packed.

Walked by Coconuts and it reminded us a bit of Cabo, so we decided to give it a try.  We were a party of 3.

Service- We had a server who kept apologizing for the lack of service and making us wait so long.  He also never checked on our table after the food was served to see if we needed anything. We had to get the attention of a mgr to get refills on our drinks.  They tried to make up for it with a free desert and said it was because of a couple of large parties, but it looked more like lack of communication and mgmt didn't really care.

Food- burritos were actually pretty good and so was the desert.  That's the only reason for as many stars.

Cocktails- Drinks have too much ice for the price.  Moral of the story, drink beer not mojitos or margaritas, similar to Mexico.

Hopefully they figure it out.  This is the 3rd restaurant in that location.  Sink or succeed.  Service is the name of the game.
