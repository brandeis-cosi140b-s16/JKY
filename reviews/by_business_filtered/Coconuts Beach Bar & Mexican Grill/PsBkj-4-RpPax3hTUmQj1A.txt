Early New Years Dinner....BIG MISTAKE...The only thing that was good was the service..the margarita was a joke,the liquid looked clear? No taste,I had a taco salad ,it had almost no lettuce. I should have  complained but it would have ruined what would have been a nice New Years Eve....The only thing that was good,it gave me the first laugh of the New Year..IT WAS A JOKE ! ! ! Next time I will go to Dell Taco.
