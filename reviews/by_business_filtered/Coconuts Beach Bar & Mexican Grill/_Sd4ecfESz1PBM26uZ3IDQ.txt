Terrible service and terrible food! The only thing half-way decent were the drinks, and they were overpriced for what you received. We have never had to pay for chips and salsa at a Mexican restaurant before ~ here they charge you $5. The green sauce was okay, and the red tasted just like canned enchilada sauce. There were five of us dining, all ordering different items, and nothing tasted good. The food was very bland and tasteless. When we complained to the waitress, the manager wouldn't even come over to our table. All that was relayed to us was that we could order something else if we didn't like what we ordered. We were there for an early dinner, so there were maybe 3 other tables filled - no excuse for such poor service and long wait to receive our food.
