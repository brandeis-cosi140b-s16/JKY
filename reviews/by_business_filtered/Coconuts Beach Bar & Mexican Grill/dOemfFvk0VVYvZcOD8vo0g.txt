So after I went on and on about how nice Town Square was we stroll into this place for lunch. Wow. (That's not a good wow.... it's just a wow.)

If you like Mexican food, please don't go here. It's a waste of your valuable time... even if you have absolutely nothing to do! The food was awful and they CHARGED ME FOR CHIPS AND SALSA! THEY CHARGED ME FOR CHIPS AND SALSA! Really? That's ridiculous. Chips and salsa is the one appetizer that is ALWAYS free at any Mexican grill. We ordered drinks and one of our margaritas came in a broken glass. I guess this place turns into a nightclub at some point because there was a dance floor and a DJ booth inside of a Volkswagen van. They should just do away with the food and focus on the party because I was so not impressed.
