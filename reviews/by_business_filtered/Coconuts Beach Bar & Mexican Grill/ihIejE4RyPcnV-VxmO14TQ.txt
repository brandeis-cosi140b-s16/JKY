AWFUL!! Went for a wine n canvas event, never again will I return to coconuts or wine n canvas. The theme of the place is not really my thing since I don't wanna be on spring break when I go to a restaurant, but  whatever I won't knock them for that. I will talk about they're horrible drinks n food though. My $8 drink tasted like plain pineapple juice n my friends tasted like straight tequila, we ordered the same thing. I wasn't expecting the most amazing food going into this, but even for a place w flip flops nailed to the walls it was pretty bad. It had no flavor n the shrimp a friend ordered tasted spoiled. They advertise 1/2 off appetizers, but what they don't tell u ANYWHERE is that it only applies to ordering at the bar. Save ur time n money.
