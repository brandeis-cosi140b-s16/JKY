Shady acres at this place. The Happy Hour apppears to be a great deal with 2-1 beers. Who knew that Cocoloco would charge $6 for a PBR draft? Seriously, that is a record, but this place is so upscale (cough, cough) that it feels like its cool to do that to us. Bartender says it is a more casual place now, yeah casual (cause it has a lifeguard chair?) with $14 burrito's. Next issue was 1/2 price appetizers. The cheese quesadilla was $6 and chicken was $3 making it $9 right? Not here, only the cheese is considered half- price and the chicken is extra. I didn't agree and too there credit, they were nice and changed it, but the bartender was a bit lippy and didn't really look good in his tanktop (put a female back there). I agree, its bon voyage for this place eventually.
