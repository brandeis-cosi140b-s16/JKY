Very disappointed.. I am part of the VIP membership club I tried to plan a party and never heard anything back.. Our drinks took forever.. Food was decent.. the server said the VIP host would come talk to me about the issue with the party and she never did.. We were over charged for a drink and their specialty drinks sucked.. I never finished either one of mine.. I ordered 2 and the server never asked if anything was wrong.. It was a girls night and there were 6 of us and none of us will ever come back and will tell our friends about it.............
