Good food and great building. Had the Red Chili Beef Burrito. Red chili was not so flavorful, beef was tender and juicy. Great salsa and chips. The lack of great Mexican food in Phoenix is reflected in peoples reviews. Not a four star and no way a five star mexican joint. Growing up in Santa Barbara a place like Comedor is the norm. Would go again if in the area.
