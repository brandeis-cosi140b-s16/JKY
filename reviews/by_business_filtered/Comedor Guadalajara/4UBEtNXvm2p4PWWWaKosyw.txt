ok, so I've been back to this place oh 3 or 4 more times. I love this place! The food is excellent and you can tell by how busy they are that they are obviously doing something right.

I recommend the chicken nachos as an appaitizer. I don't know how they make their chicken so flavorful, but it's amazing. It's like charbroilled or grilled, so tasty. The nachos are basically 4 or 5 tostada's cut in half.  You get a layer of beans, topped with jalapeno's, cheese and chicken. A side of guacamole and sour cream come with this plate.

The chicken chimi enchilada style with the red sauce is beyond words. It's the same chicken used in the nachos. I basically lick the plate clean. 

I have also tried the shrimp enchiladas - too shrimp tasting for my taste, but my sister -in-law, who's big into seafood really enjoyed them. Comes with a lot of shrimp.

The carne asada tacos - were fantastic.

If you want really well done Mexican food don't waste your money anywhere else. Just come here. The wait staff is excellent and attentive.
