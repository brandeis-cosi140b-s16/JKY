i use to go by here every day of the week and never knew this place was open. the parking lot always empty. in fact i've had several people i trust tell me how great this place was..and i never realized..THIS was the place they were talking about. gasp. 

so i came her with my BFF's family for fathers day. it was pretty damn good. after a very long wait and eventual long walk to the rear dining room we got seated. chips pretty tasty, sales pretty spicy. food was delish..i got carnitas and they were big porky chunks of awesomeness. they gave me large tortillas..which was ok cause i just tore off pieces to pick up meat. my one complaint...it reminded me of my highschool cafeteria. Jaguar Pride What!! anyways..the vast openess and still confined spacing of the restaurant. if there was a fire breakout..i don't think anyone would make it out alive tho. :(

carnitas were bombdigity yaheard!! get on it. 

price is affordable, and the menu distinctly not, run of the mill "mexican food"
