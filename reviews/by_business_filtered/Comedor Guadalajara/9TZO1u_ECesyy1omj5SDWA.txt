While driving here, you may decide that rather than get shot, head to a different restaurant.  When you arrive, there is a valet who is there to make sure that the locals don't break into your car.  Once inside, the experience becomes wonderful.  I loved that 90% of the clientele are Mexican.  Everyone seemed to be having a good time and there were families as well as people dating or friends just having dinner together.  The quality of the food was very high.  I wouldn't say it was innovative but it was yummy.  Additionally all the waiters and staff at the restaurant were genuine and friendly.

If you don't mind the uneasiness of the area, give this one a try--it's authentic.
