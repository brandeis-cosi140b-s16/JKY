Ever since my wife and I first went here a couple of months ago, I've almost constantly craved the soups they serve. We've been back 5-6 times since then and can't get enough of anything they serve. Even the rice and beans are outstanding!.

The weekend only beef soup is probably my favorite but can only order on the weekends. The chicken soup is so rich and flavorful, I doubt I can ever truly enjoy anyone else's and the 7 mares seafood soup, well, that's in a class all it's own....hell, all of their soups are in a class all their own. One big downfall though, after eating here you're ready to collapse into a food coma....in a good way.

Everything we've tried has been outstanding except the carne asada. The carne was a bit thin and way over cooked. The pork carnitas were very good but a little overcooked also. However, all fish/seafood and chicken dishes have been amazing and have found Comedor Guadalajara definitely the most authentic Mexican restaurant in the Phoenix area. I've tried most of the Mexican Restaurants and this has been the best overall. The typical 30-60 minute average wait during dining high times should give you a clue but look at who's eating here, families. Groups of 8-15+ in a party let alone us couples and smaller parties. When large families gather at a restaurant, you know it's got to be good!

Overall, pricing is very reasonable, and definitely an excellent value for the portion sizes offered. ENJOY!
