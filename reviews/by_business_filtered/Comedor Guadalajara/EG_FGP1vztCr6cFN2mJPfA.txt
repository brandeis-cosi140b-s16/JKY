This restaurant holds a special place in my heart. Our abuelos intruduced us to the food here at a very young age. Even though the prices have gone up since then and they charge for certain things seems outrageous it is well worth it. I have never had a bad plate here. The one thing I don't like, is sometimes when you have a large party it seems like they try to rush you through your meal. 

But the food here really is delicious. The service is fast and friendly. It does help if you speak spanish as this is authentic Mexican spot. They do, however, have some American food on the kids menu. Haha. My kid....

We have had a lot of big brunches here for birthday's and such and they have a room in the back to accommodate. Sometimes they have a live Trio walking around singing classics. Always some Vicente playing over the speakers. 

This place is a warm and fuzzy for me. Love it.
