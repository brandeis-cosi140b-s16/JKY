The only reason why checked this place out was because it was features on that show "Man Vs Food" well, I wasn't disappointed. The place was nice and friendly staff. So much to choose from. You better have a appetite for this. Unlimited chips and salsa can't go wrong with that. 
Reasonable food and prices. Definetely coming back. Happy customer.
