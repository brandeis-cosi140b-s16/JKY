To the point- this place served me some of the best Mexican I have ever had. 

I actually want to go back and take away one star from every review I've given. It was that good.

Soup- best I have ever had
Carne asada- juicy perfectly cooked
Eggs- omg perfect
Beans-delicious, they're beans...
Salsa - really good

Enjoy!
