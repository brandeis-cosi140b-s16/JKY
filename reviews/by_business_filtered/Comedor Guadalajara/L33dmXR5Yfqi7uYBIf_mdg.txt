I want to be as fair as I can when I am writing this review. I am not a native of Arizona and I think this may make my review somewhat biased. I wasn't too impressed with the food here. I had a chili relleno and a chicken burrito, both smothered. The portions were large, as expected in a Mexican food restaurant, the service was good, the gentleman that was helping us was extremely courteous. The margarita that I ordered (strong) I needed an extra shot, it wasn't strong enough for me. When this happened the Manager came over to me to make sure everything was ok - which was awesome! Needless to say, I added the shot and the margarita got demolished!  My chili relleno was a little soggy and I asked for it extra crispy, not too important, but I just wanted it cooked a little longer than normal. One SUPER positive things I can say about Comedor Guadalajara is that they had some of the best rice and beans I have ever had! 
All in all, I think my overall experience has to do with the Mexican food here tasting distinctly different than the Mexican food in Denver, both of which are as authentic as you can get, not this Tex Mex B.S.
When I go back to Phoenix, would I come back here, probably not, I would want to try a different place to see if they have a different Phoenix, authentic Mexican food flare. If I was invited to go back and somebody was paying for me, I would definitely go, however; I would order something different.
