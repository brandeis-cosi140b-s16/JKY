The best Mexican food I've ever eaten. There was not 1 thing we ate that was not amazing.  If you are interested in an appetizer, get the Cheese Crisp. We got it with steak and jalape√±os. it is about the size of a medium pizza.  It is good enough to eat as a meal if you are not sharing. Also the salsa that comes with the free chips is really spicy. I love spicy food and it made me grab a drink. It taste great, but dont grab a big scoop. I got the chicken burrito and the chicken was NOT soaked in that greasy seasoning like most place do. It was flavorful,  but not greasy. There is no other way to describe it beside saying it was really really good. The mango margarita is very tasty,  you can actually taste the mango flavoring. The dessert we had was the flan. I've eaten my share or flan and this is hands down the best flan I've even. It was different than any flan I've had at other restaurants. I will make sure I go out of my way to come here every time I visit. Don't like the outside fool you.  If you are coming from its back side, it looks like an run down warehouse. Once you get to front of the building it's nicer and the inside was nice and clean. So don't let the outside scare you away.
