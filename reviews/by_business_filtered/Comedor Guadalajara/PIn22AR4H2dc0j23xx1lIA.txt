Still on the quest for good Mexican food, I tried this place with a coworker who swore that I would love it.  Not so.

We went at lunch and the waiting area was packed!  We put our names down and they called us 10 minutes later (not bad for how many people were waiting).  They have a large dining area and lots of parking.

When we sat down, they brought us chips and salsa and soup.  The soup was yummy.  The chips were disgusting -- you could taste the grease that they were fried in (YUCK!).  

I ordered the beef taco and cheese enchilada lunch special.  The taco was decent (very small) and the cheese enchilada had onions in it which were crunchy when you bit into them.  I thought I ordered a cheese enchilada but I guess they forgot to put cheese AND onion enchilada on the menu.  I still judge a place by it's beans and these were nasty.  You could taste the lard.  My coworker ordered the chile relleno and chicken enchilada lunch special.  She didn't like her food either.  

After we left, she apologized and admitted she would probably never go there again either.
