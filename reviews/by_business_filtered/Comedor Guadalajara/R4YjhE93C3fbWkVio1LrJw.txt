There's no better way to undo a 3 mile morning walk than to end up stuffing your face at the Comedor.  This place is muy grande and could be the perfect spot for a very very large dinner party. The parking lot is huge and is tended by courteous security guards who welcome you in at the door. The menu is extensive and offers some unusual items such as Chicharrone (pork rind) and Nopales (cactus) dishes along with an interesting   Caldo de Mariscos (Seafood Soup). Great if you're looking for some food adventure! Que suave~

I started my post walk lunch with a cold Pacifico that came with a large frosty mug. Man that beer went down good!  The chips were delivered warm with a side of chili tepin style salsa.  For starters, we ordered the Frijoles con Chorizo dip. I'm not huge fan of chorizo but really enjoyed this dip. The chorizo was mild (not greasy at all) and was served with oven toasted chips topped with melted cheese. We shared a plate of the Chili Verde con Papas which is a rich green chili sauce with chunks of beef, potatoes, and onions served with refried pinto beans and tortilla. For our other dish, we had the Chilaquiles Y Huevos. This dish was the main reason we went to Comedor and it didn't disappoint.  This was layered corn tortillas soaking in a red chili sauce and topped with two over medium eggs and served with a side of frijoles and warm tortilla. The only problem I ran into was eating way more then I should have. It must be a good sign if you waddle out of the place whining and holding your gut.

I'll be heading back very soon to try the Nopalito dish and the Pescado Entero Tilapia; Pan Freed "whole" Tilapia. Can't wait!
