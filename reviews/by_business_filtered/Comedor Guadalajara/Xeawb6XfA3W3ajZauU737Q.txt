I went here based on the Yelp reviews and from recommendations from my husband's co-workers. I won't be returning. I was already skeptical about coming here because of the multiple Yelp reviews mentioning the security guard in the parking lot and the shady part of town that it's located in.  My husband and I got the shredded beef tacos and enchiladas. The shredded beef was so dry and overcooked that I only ate half my taco and was over it.  The beef enchilada was filled with huge chunks of beef, which were tender but lacking in flavor.  The rice and beans were nothing special.

oh yeah....  the chips they bring out when you arrive come with tiny bowls of salsa that you can barely dip your chips in because of how small and shallow the bowls are.
