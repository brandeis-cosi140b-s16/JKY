Gracias Monica for bringing the International Supper Club here!

From the outside, like Monica said, youre not really sure what youre getting into. Until you get inside and smell the deliciousness.

This place is a bit smaller than I expected, but spacious at the same time. We were seated (smartly) towards the back of the restaurant. Oh the menu. Its a little overwhelming, not in the amount of options but the amount of things that sound delicious! I chose the Chimichanga de Pollo. I was totally prepared to enjoy it, as is but then our waitress suggested that I get it enchilada style. Best. Waitress. Ever. Holy god was that thing good. The chicken was tender, the sauce was so so good, and it had just the right amount of spice. Its a large dish, that was equally good the next day.

I would highly recommend this place for a sit down meal if youre looking for really good, authentic mexican food. And I wish I was still in AZ cuz writing this review has made me hungry for it!
