I'm not even a huge fan of Mexican food, but I love this place. for $8.50 I got the cheese enchilada and shredded taco plate that came with rice, beans, and a small cup of veggie soup. it was all extremely delicious! especially the beans. I have no idea what they put in there, but it tasted so good that I cleaned my plate (and I am a light-eater so I usually NEVER clean my plate and I usually don't even eat the side rice and beans).

I will definitely be back again. the only downsides to this place that I've seen so far are: long wait if you go at lunch rush, not located in a great neighborhood, chips and salsa are meh (would've given 5 stars if the salsa was better), and it closes at 8 PM.
