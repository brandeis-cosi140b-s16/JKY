I think that Phoenix is inundated with Mexican restaurants. Generally, when you've been to one, you're been to them all. Not the case with Comedor.  We arrived here at 3 p.m. on a Saturday. There was a 20 minute wait, which people standing on the inside and the outside.  It was a nice day outside, so the wait wasn't too bad. Once at a table, I realized that the place is quiet spacious.  And the atmosphere was quiet for the amount of people that were seated. The waitress was friendly.  She was prompt with our drink orders and the chips and salsa.  My friend and I shared a hearty pot of lengua. It was just right after a late night of dancing. The prices are very reasonable. Comedor is by far, not a four or five-star facility,  but the food and service are topnotch! Keep doing what you do Comedor Guadalajara!
