New to Phoenix and was pleasantly surprised when a wedding I attend said that they were having it catered by Comedor Guadalajara for mexican food. cool!

Had pretty much the basic selection of Cheese Enchiladas, Rice, Beans and a Chicken Breast in a red sauce that was awesome. They served the reception party of about 75 people (mostly cops) and everything including the chips and salsa was very tasty that now I have to go find their location for more.
