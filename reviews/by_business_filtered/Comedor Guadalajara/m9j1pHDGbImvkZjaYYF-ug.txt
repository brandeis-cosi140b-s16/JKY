I was extremely happy with my meal here.  The salsa with the chips was nicely spicy.  I had the shrimp and octopus a la Diavolo.  The Diavolo sauce was delicious and also spicy in a different way than the salsa for the chips.  I was given a large flour tortilla and couldn't resist dipping and redipping.  The sides of salad (standard shredded lettuce, etc., but very fresh and crunchy), rice and refried beans were substantial.  After the chips, main course, salad rice and tortilla I couldn't do more than scratch the surface of the refried beans.  

I was equally happy with the atmosphere and service.  I showed up near 1pm on Sunday as a single diner.  Most of the other people were family groups, many apparently regulars.  I was nonetheless given a decent table normally seating four after the promised 10-15 minute wait and no sense of being rushed or treated differently by any of the staff.  Next time I'm in Phoenix I will be eager to come back (bringing family and/or friends) and have the same thing again and/or explore the rest of the menu.
