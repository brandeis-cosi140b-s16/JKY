On the recommendation of a friend, my wife and I went to Comedor Guadalajara for supper.  I can't pronounce it but I found it.

It doesn't look like much on the outside, but it is quite comfortable and nicely done inside.  From the chips and salsa at the start to the blazing hot main course, the food was great.

I had a burrito, taco and cheese enchilada combo plate with rice and refried beans on the side.  The burrito was huge and tasty, the taco crisp and filled with fresh lettuce, and the rice and refried beans were tasty. The enchilada was so-so and it was the only disappointment.

The service was fair, a little disappointing given that it was not that busy.

The price is excellent for the food you get.  A real value!
