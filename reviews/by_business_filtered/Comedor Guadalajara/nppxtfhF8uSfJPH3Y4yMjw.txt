Outstanding family Mexican restaurant! I've tried several of the other well known Mexican restaurants in Phoenix and Comedor Guadalajara is hands down the best of them all. Very large open restaurant concept (2 large rooms) with no bar but serves alcohol. No TV' either except in the entrance so keeps everyone focused on the group your with and food.

Large platters served so bring your appetite but the flavors are truly authentic and expertly cooked. Service was excellent. Try the7 Mares soup, seafood platters were fresh and delicious. Ejoy!
