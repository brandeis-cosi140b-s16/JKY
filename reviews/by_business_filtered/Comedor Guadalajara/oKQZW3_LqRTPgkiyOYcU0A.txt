This is a great place to grab some food before a ball game. Just minutes from the stadiums in downtown. The old purple artistic wall that could be seen from the freeway as you passed by is gone now but he great food is still inside. 

Unlike many of the horrible Mexican places in south Phoenix this one is by far one of the best. There is a reason why they have a huge parking lot, great food brings a lot of people. For all of you who are afraid to venture into this part of town, have no fear there is security in the parking lot. 

Check this places out! The horchata is made fresh and is delish!
