I've long been searching for the best camarones diabla and have found that gem here in their camarones endiablados offering. This spicy seafood dish hit all the right notes!  

My husband also loved their cheese crisp and cheese enchiladas. 

I've not been to Mexico but I would bet this is real deal Mexican cuisine.
