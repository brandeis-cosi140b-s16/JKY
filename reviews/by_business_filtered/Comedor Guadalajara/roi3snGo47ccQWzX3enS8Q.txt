I'm Mexican so I am very particular about my Mexican food, it has to be better than I can cook it for me to pay for it- or I have to be hung over... Either way, this place is the best, I come here just for the tripas but everything is delicious and the salsa is hot! it gets packed so be prepared to wait on the weekends...
