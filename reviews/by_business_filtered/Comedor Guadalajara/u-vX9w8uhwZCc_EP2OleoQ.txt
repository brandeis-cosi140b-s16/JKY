I usually eat at fast/cheap Mexican places because I am not a fan of places like Garcias, macayos, Arriba etc but I have been looking for a good/authentic sit down Mexican food restaurant for a while. After I saw that this place had a 4 star rating and a name in Spanish I decided to give it a try. I was pretty excited to see actual Mexicans eating there! When the chips and salsa arrived my excitement died a bit but I try not to judge on chips and salsa alone. We ordered a plain cheese crisp as an appetizer and it was actually pretty good; it was crispy and not too oily. The main dishes arrived and they were a major disappointment! The tacos were oily and bland. The beans and rice were not much better. Overall this is typical Americanized Mexican food; overly fried, bland, and greasy like most Mexican places. Nothing special or authentic here. I shan't be returning. My search continues...
