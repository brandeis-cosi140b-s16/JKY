Our server did a phenomenal job with serving a group of twenty people! That I know of, there were no mistakes and nothing was forgotten. Unfortunately, I don't know his name! 

Now, for the food. I got horchata to drink. Yum. It's not free refills FYI! They start you off with chips and salsa. Cool. I ordered number nine which came with a chicken enchilada, a chicken taco, a bean tostada, rice, and beans. Mediocre. Nothing worth dying for. The beans needed flavor. The rice was okay. The chicken taco and enchilada were OK. My tostada was soggy. I've had better. 

The wait for our party was 1 hour and some minutes. To sum it up, service was great, food was decent, and the appearance was a bit run down. 

P.S. I have really bad heartburn from eating here. Like, I might throw up everything I ate. 

OK I'm done.
