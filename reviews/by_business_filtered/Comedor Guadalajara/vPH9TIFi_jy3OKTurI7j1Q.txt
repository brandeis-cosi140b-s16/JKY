Tasting the chicken enchiladas and Enchiladas de Camaron (green chile & tomatillo shrimp enchiladas) made us ask, after decades of tasting enchiladas at dozens of other good restaurants, so THIS is what they're supposed to taste like?! Don't miss the mango-lime margarita. It's all magnificent, and highly recommended.
