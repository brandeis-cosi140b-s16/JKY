I recently came here for lunch with my co worker. And overall, this is a very good restaurant.

The place is huge! And seems to be very popular. 
My co worker tried their steak salad. It has nice presentation, but she said it needed more seasonings. So on a scale of 10, she rated it 7. 
On the other hand, I had their Wednesday's Special : Grilled chicken with salsa on top. It's really delicious, I finished the whole thing at once. The saut√© onion was fragranced and the chicken was really tender. The beans in my opinion was good, it has a different taste...I can't really tell what it is, but together with the whole meal, it was good.

Prices are reasonable. Service was quick and friendly.

I strongly recommend it.
