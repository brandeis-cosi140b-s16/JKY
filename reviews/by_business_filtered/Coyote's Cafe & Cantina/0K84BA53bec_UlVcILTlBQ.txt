Food is good, nice ambience, full bar, and kids menu.  The chips, salsa, and bean dip keep coming. Pricing is a few dollars more than similar restaurants but the staff is very attentive and there was no waiting for a table to make up for it. Lunch specials include a Zarape that is a great first time choice.
