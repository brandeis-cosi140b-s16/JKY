Ok we've been going here for 12 years now. Best beef fajitas I have ever had anywhere in my life! No one ever has come close to how good theirs are period! Service is great they remember us every time we go in so we feel so welcomed.  we don't even need menus anymore! Margaritas are potent and so good! Chips, beans, and salsa are always fresh and great, they really keep them coming. Love love love this place! The owner and manager are just good guys all around. Go and order the beef fajitas, amazing!
