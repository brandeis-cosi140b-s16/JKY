They should change the name of Coyote's to Zarapes as that is easily the best thing on the menu!  We have been going to Coyotes for over 10 years and have always received excellent service and the food is always great.  The dinner Zarape portion is enough for me and my husband to split and walk out feeling over stuffed.    Very yummy!
