Service is alright. The prices are high for what you get. Plastic cups and serving dish foe chips. Booth seat is on concrete. Chips were stale salsa was good. 

The carne asada enchilada meat was dry over cooked and red sauce was dry. Wife had pork chile Verde which was moist and tender OK flavor. 

Drinks were overpriced and food was edible considering we were tired we should have left and went to taco bell.
