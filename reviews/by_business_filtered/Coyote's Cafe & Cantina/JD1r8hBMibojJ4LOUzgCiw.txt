This is a great local Mexican Restaurant next to Luxury+ Theaters and Barley's Casino.  They have great margaritas ($24 for a pitcher). I love the family atmosphere of the restaurant and they obey traditional rules of a successful Mexican restaurant: Chips/Bean Dip/Salsa, Water without asking, friendly staff.

Beef Chimichanga and Combination Fajitas were both ordered and were devoured!

Note to diners, Arrive by 8pm as the kitchen closes early if they are slow. This is the reason I am giving it a 4 star.  The Joe's Crab Shack is opened until 11pm next door. The bar does have video poker! Not sure if they comp drink though, if you play.
