This is one of my favorite Mexican food places in Vegas.  I like that the staff is so friendly and always remembers us when we go.  I'd much rather spend my money on a small, neighborhood restaurant than a big chain.  I really like their chips (which are always served warm) and salsa and usually order their fajitas.
