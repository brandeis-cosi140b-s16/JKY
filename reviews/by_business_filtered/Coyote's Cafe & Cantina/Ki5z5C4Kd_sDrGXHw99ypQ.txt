Come here for the delicious chips/salsa/bean dip and the excellent frozen margaritas, but that's all.  The prices are ridiculously high.  

$18 for a carne asada burrito???  

$14 for a bean burrito???  

The food is good, but just not worth the price.  And its such a shame, because I remember coming here years ago when the place was packed.  Now its a ghost town inside.  I came back because I got a coupon in the mail.  Instead of sending out coupons, they should just lower the prices.  

I'll be back for happy hour, but I'll never sit down for dinner again.
