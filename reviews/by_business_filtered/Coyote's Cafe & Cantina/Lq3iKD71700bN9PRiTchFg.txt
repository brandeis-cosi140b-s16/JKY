when I lived in Vegas I used to come here all the time...the service is great, the food, especially the pork tacos and cheese enchiladas are phenomenal and their ultimate margaritas give even a guy like me a decent buzz....One of the few things I miss about living in Vegas is going here...the one star reviewers are high on drugs to give such sad reviews of this place...since moving here to Oregon it's been quite the journey to find any place remotely comparable...
