Coyote's Cantina is a throwback restaurant to my first experiences of traveling with my friends in high school to eat lunch/dinner after class.  I reminds me of first getting my car and going to the old United Artist theatre to watch movies.  I haven't been back to Coyote's in years but returned today on a spur of the moment lunch with some buddies.

Upon entering, Coyote's had a few folks at the bar sipping their famous Margaritas.  We were seated promptly and brought drinks, chips, and bean and salsa dip.  The chips and dips were delicious and the lunch menu was reasonable and vast with selections.  I order the crab enchiladas and my buddies went with Carne.  

Overall, the food was all great, fast, and the service was on par with any good Mexican restaurant in Vegas.  I'm a huge fan of Lindo here in town, however, Coyote's was a nice trip down memory land and a place I plan to revisit very soon.
