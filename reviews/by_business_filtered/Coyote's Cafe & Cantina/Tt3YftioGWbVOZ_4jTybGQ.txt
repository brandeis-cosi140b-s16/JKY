Came here looking for a local Mexican restaurant with a bar.  The review on here for the margaritas sealed it.  I seated myself at the bar and was served drinks and chips immediately. They also serve a bean dip that is yummy.   I had the fajitas and they were yummy. Maybe too much meat and not enough veggies for my taste. But delicious. The grilled steak was delicious.  Got in an happy hour, and hard to beat $2.99 margaritas.  Watched the footy match during lunch. Nice experience. I will be back when my travels take me to Las Vegas again.
