I go back and forth with this restaurant. I've been coming here a long time. I do like the complimentary chips, salsa and bean dip. It's my favorite part about gong to a Mexican restaurant.... Instant snacks! 
The chips come out hot and are refilled as needed. 

Service is usually pretty good. Our waiter made an great effort and kept our drinks refilled. 

I just feel that the quality of the entrees don't equal the price. The food is ok, but not amazing. 

I ordered the taquitos dinner, but the rice was dry. Beans and taquitos were average. I had mine filled with beef which was ok. My friend ordered a burrito but she found it to be dry. She thought it should have had some cheese on it.  All in all $30+ for two mediocre entrees doesn't seem to be that good of a deal.
