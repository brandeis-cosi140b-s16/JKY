This mexican restaurant is one of me and my family's all time favorite.  We have been going there for many years now and the same people have worked there all this time.  It's nice to see familiar faces that also happen to remember our faces.  The food is excellent and their salsa is our absolute favorite from any restaurants we have been to.  The atmosphere is delightful, the food is served hot and tasty and the service is impeccable.  This will always be our number 1 choice for mexican food.
