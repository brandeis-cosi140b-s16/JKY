My first time back in quite a few years because I'm a former chef who loves cooking at home. But I'm glad I returned and introduced my BFF to this place. It was just as good as I remembered, and my bestie, who had steak fajitas, could not stop raving over how tender the steak was and delicious everything else was. I tried a piece of her steak and she was right about how it seemed to just melt in her mouth. My enchaladas were better then I expected and of course the chips, salsa, and bean dip were great and inspired me to go home to make my own version of their salsa. In addition to the food, the service was top notch from start to finish which is a huge deal to me since I will refuse to return to a place if the service is poor regardless of how great the food is or how hard to find a product is. Overall this former chef was impressed and will definitely be making an effort to return more often. This place almost feels like one of Green Valley's better kept secrets, especially since it may be a bit hard to find if you don't know what your looking for due to the signage outside being minimal and the colors don't necessarily stand out.
