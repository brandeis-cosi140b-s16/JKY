Best Local Mexican food Happy Hour specials in town!!  See my pictures for the HH menu and prices.  

We come here often around 5pm for the Happy Hour 2:30pm to 5:30pm.   Their house margaritas are AMAZING and super strong!   The Happy Hour food servings are the same as the menu servings, so they are not "cheating" the customer here.  

The HH chicken quesadilla and flautas are our favorites!  We have ordered off the regular menu many times and find it a bit expensive - so happy hour is the pefect balance!

They serve complimentary chips, salsa, and bean dip.  The service is always excellent.  

While this is my first check-in and review, I have eaten here about a dozen times.  And will eat here another dozen more in the next few months!   Coyote's is kid friendly and our 2-year old loves the chicken quesadilla and flautas as much as we do.  

I want to give Coyote's 5 stars, but their expensive menu discourages us from visiting during normal hours.  I wish they would consider a "locals" special or coupon card.
