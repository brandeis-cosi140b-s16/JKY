Recently visited here for my mom's birthday, and even though I am not a fan of Mexican food, I was impressed by my meal. My favorite part was the salsa and bean dip they give you for your chips at the beginning of the meal. The salsa was fresh, and mixing with bean dip was an interesting combination that ended up being super delicious. Our waiter was also very quick to refill our chips whenever we ran low. I ordered the chimichanga with shredded beef, and was surprised at how massive (and greasy) it was. I couldn't finish the entire thing, especially since I ate so many chips  before ;~) For dessert, I ordered the flan and was super satisfied with it. 
My only complaint was how pricey the meals were. While the food was good, I do not think it was worth the price they put it at. 
Overall, it was a decent meal and I look forward to coming back and trying something new.
