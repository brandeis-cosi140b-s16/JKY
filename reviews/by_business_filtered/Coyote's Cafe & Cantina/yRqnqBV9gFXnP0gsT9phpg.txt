Typically eat here about once or twice a month and they never let me down. :)
Always good service and always good food (seriously the food is the same every time which is AMAZING!)
Small town feel and service which is so hard to find in this every changing wasteland called Sin City.
If you want glitz and changing menu's and celebrity names.......stay on the Strip.  If you want a decent meal and a comforting environment to eat it in.....come here.
