OK, let me start by saying this is a food review, not a venue review.  Haven't been for a concert yet.

While I'm generally not a fan of grilled burritos (burritos that have been put into a panini press), the Veggie Burrito at Crescent really brought the flavor.   Good soy sauce saut√© on the veggies, good flavor on the beans and a good ratio of the two.  This is my first time there, but Crescent seems to pay attention to the details.  The tortilla was one of the best I've had in Phoenix (I want to know where they get them), and even the corn chips seemed a couple notches above ordinary.  The salsas are the same delicious salsas from El Gallo.

I'll definitely be back
