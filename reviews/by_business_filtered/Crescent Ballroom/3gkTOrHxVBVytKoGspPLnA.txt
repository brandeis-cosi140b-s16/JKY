This is a review for the lounge:
Saw flamenco dancing here on a Saturday evening. Great show. Happy hour!

Try the chips and salsa here--surprisingly good! (especially for 2 bucks!!!!) Chips were thickly cut tortilla, didn't break easily. Two kinds of salsa...verde (tomatillo) and red (I'm showing my white-ness here because I couldn't determine what kind of pepper made up the red salsa...it was nice and spicy though!).

Had the honey badger drink. Waaaaay to sweet for me. Waitress was kind enough to take it off our bill since I didn't drink it. They have some very interesting whiskey drinks on the menu that my friends ordered (and I got to taste).
