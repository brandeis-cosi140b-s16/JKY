All I can say is LOVE, LOVE, LOVE that Phoenix finally has something to be proud of in it's downtown. I don't have to yearn for Portland, OR to experience great music, food and drink at a local venue, one that has great character, and a great location. The list if upcoming shows and bands is impressive. Major props to Charlie Levy for opening this great venue!
