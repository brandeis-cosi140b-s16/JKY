The food is good ,drinks are good and seeing a show here is the best venue I have ever been to. Its small but not to small. The shows are always great and 90% of the time the artist will hang out at the mech booth and take photos/sign things. 

They give you free soda if your driving your friends that are drinking. Which I love! They support not drinking and driving. If its an all age show they rope all the under 21 in a small area. So you can sit in the stand (they have a area to sit! that doesn't ruin your view). I buy tickets to see any band that is just ok , because I know it will be a relaxing great time coming here.
