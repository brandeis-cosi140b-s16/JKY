we went to the cresent ballroom for a railroad earth show on my husband's birthday.

parking was relatively easy to find down the street, so that was a plus.

there was a bar/dining area in the front, and then the main ballroom where the show was. it fit a lot of people. i believe there are seats you could have paid for that are bench style if you're not for standing up at a concert.

the only thing i wasn't super stoked about was that the patio allowed smokers and it wafted into the bar area.
