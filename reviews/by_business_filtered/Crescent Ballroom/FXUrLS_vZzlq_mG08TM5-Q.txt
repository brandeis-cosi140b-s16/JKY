Nice, large new venue, & decently priced. Sorry Marquee, I dont care to pay $25.00 to see local bands play.

Lots of seating in the front bar and a pretty nice patio. Loved that there is seating in the actual venue AND that if you use it, you can still see the bands!

they have some pretty tasty cocktails on the menu here that are available at the bar inside the actual venue or the regular bar.

The staff seemed to be very courteous, even w/ it being SO busy while we were there.

Depending on who's playing, we'll likely be back!
