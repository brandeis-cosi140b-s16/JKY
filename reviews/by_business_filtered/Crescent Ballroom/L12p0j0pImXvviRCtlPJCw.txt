Finally, a music venue in Phoenix that encourages local bands as well as national acts. Intimate feel and "Smells like Team Spirit" bleachers and wait for it, AWESOME BATHROOMS, ladies don't wait in ridiculous lines any longer! Perfect to light rail too, so convenient. Can't say anything bad about Crescent! Now I hear they are doing FREE Sundays in Summer, super bad.
