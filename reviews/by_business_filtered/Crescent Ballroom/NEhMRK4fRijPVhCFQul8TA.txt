"Meh. I've experienced better."

A solid place to get a burrito, I suppose, if you're downtown and looking for somewhere to get a burrito besides Taco Bell.

I chose the barbacoa burrito. While the beef was good, it was nothing to write home about. I'll go ahead and say it wasn't seasoned enough.
Their chips are fresh and the salsa is delicious.

Food was edible. I wasn't impressed, per se, but I wouldn't put up a kicking and screaming fight to avoid returning.

I'll give it another shot some other time.
