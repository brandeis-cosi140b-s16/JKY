I went here for the first time just last Sunday to see Justin Nozuka and it was a very awesome experience! I went here alone and this place has such a welcoming atmosphere I felt zero awkwardness being there solo... They chips and salsa are pretty awesome salsa is actually spicy I had a few glasses of wine and some of their sangria. The sangria wasn't all that honestly but I can never find a place that serves sangria or wants to make me one (it isn't that hard!) so that was a plus and the venue has a really intimate feel to it I really enjoyed my show it was more than I expected and I wish more of my favorite performers would play here I am looking forward to coming back. The staff is friendly and attentive.
