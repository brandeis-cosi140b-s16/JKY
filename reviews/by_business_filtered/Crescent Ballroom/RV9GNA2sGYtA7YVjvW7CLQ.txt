5 stars on venue only.  Saw Anders Osborne and NMA on a weeknight.  Great drinks, fair prices.  Strange seating, so buy standing room only tickets.  The most impressive part is the sound system.  As a casual audiophile, I love when they get it right and it was probably one of the best sounding concerts I have ever been to.
