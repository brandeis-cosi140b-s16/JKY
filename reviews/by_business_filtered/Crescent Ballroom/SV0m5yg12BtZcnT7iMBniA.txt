came here for dinner and a free show last Sunday. we unknowingly arrived in the middle of their trivia night. as far as trivia questions go - these were hard! I play bar trivia occasionally and I usually know at least a few answers. I don't think I knew a single question they asked here! and I thought it was weird that they ask ALL the questions and don't even tell you the answers until the very end. if I had been playing I would've gone crazy with frustration wanting to know what the correct answer was! it seems like the people participating were enjoying themselves though. I believe the prizes for winning trivia are a $25 gift certificate or two tickets to a show.

the food: nothing to write home about, but nothing to complain about either. I ordered the quesadilla, to which I added steak. they shouldn't really call it "steak" because it was shredded beef. only other ingredient inside the quesadilla was a lot of cheese. it came with a side of chips and salsa and a huge scoop of sour cream. I might come here for food again, but it's nothing notably delicious.

the show: their stage/venue is really awesome with the seated bleachers in the back and standing room in the front. I love how intimate and small the stage is. we saw three local bands perform for free; they were all very different musically but I enjoyed them all. if a band I liked was playing I would definitely come back to catch them play!
