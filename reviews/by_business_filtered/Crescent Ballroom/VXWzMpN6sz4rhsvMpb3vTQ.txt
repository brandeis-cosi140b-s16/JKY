Great venue, there is seating for those who don't like to stand and a whole lot of standing areas.  We came here early and our friend suggested we eat at the bar in front turned out they have amazing burritos! We have had the chicken, carne asada, and al pastor.. one as good as the next.  Their salsas they serve with it is out of this world.  Their drinks are also well mixed and very tasty.  My personal favorite is the Honey Badger.  We will likely be looking out for more shows for this venue from now on.
