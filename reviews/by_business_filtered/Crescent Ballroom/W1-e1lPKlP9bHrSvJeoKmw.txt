This is a food and customer service review. 

The food is good but the customer service is whack, probably one of the worst especially when busy. A colleague recommended the place for lunch, so we called in for a to-go order and went to pick up the food (11am-12pm). Service was non-existent, seriously. Have you ever walked into a place confused where to go and eventually ask around for help? Yeah, this is one of those places.

Same thing happens if you eat-in, it's really unorganized. I had 3 separate people ask me, "Hey, are you also waiting to be seated?" or "Do you know how we can order food?". The last person who asked me got so tired of waiting for someone to help them, they eventually left.

Hire one lady to stay up front, seat people and take care of people with to go orders. It's not rocket science.
