Crescent Ballroom is an iconic establishment in downtown Phoenix!  I have been visiting Crescent for over 1 1/2 years and I have had only great experiences.  It is one of the more authentic, laid back venues in the area and it's a great addition to the downtown scene.  I only go to Crescent for a specific concert or show.  I have never gone "just to hang out" but I know it would be a great spot for that as well.  I love a good concert, especially new independent music.  Crescent brings some wonderful bands to Phoenix who you wouldn't be able to see otherwise.  There are so many bands that are uber successful now but I first got to see them at a small, intimate concert at Crescent.  

The food and bar are above average for a concert venue.  The food is somewhat mexican themed with some salads and breakfast sandwiches mixed in.  It's inexpensive and good quality.  I recommend the bean dip and tacos.  Always a good choice! 

The drink selection is good if you're into beer and hipster cocktails.  My only complaint is that they only have 4 beers on draft and I love draft beer.  But they have a large selection of cans.  The mixed drinks are interesting - especially the Honey Badger which is a bourbon version of a moscow mule.  

I think Crescent does a great job of cultivating a friendly, artistic scene in Phoenix and I am looking forward to many more visits in the future!
