A coworker and I came here for lunch today. The weather was nice so we took a seat outside on the patio. They could use more umbrellas on their tables, but we were able to grab some shade.  
The service was a bit slow, but the food was fantastic.  I especially enjoyed the guacamole.  It was a huge portion, unlike some places.  My coworker got the carne asada tacos and I got the chicken tinga torta.  Both of us really enjoyed the food. 

I will definitely come back here for lunch when I'm working downtown.
