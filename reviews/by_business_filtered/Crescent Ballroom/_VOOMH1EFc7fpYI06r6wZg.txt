I went to the Destroyer concert on September 21st (forgot to finish my review that night =P) and the entire place smelled of paint thinner (or something else similarly awful). They didn't have fans or open doors or anything else to try to neutralize the odor. After feeling sick from an hour of being there I had to step out to get some fresh air but then came back in as the headliner was starting their set. After an hour and a half long set my head was KILLING me. The performance was great but I don't know if it was worth the migraine and upset stomach.
