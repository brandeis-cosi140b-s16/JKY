I have always enjoyed coming but was very disappointed last time I came in which was last night. Went in at midnight and was immediately told at the door that it was last call soon. We got our drinks went outside and the security guy kept harassing us to drink up fast cause they're closing early due to it being slow. We only stayed there for 20 min and in that duration he told us 3 times to leave. The last time he told us he said we have to drink fast now and leave basically chug and go.  Told him to give us 5 min as our drinks were almost done and we were speeding it up anyhow. 5 min later he came back again. Absolutely inappropriate and rude, never coming back and spreading the word.
