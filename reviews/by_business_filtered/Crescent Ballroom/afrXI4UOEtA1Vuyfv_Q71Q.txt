I love it when i find a great venue with class and style! The Drinks are good the food is great, and there is always some new group that is playing some great music. I have seen some great EDM artist's rock this stage, rocked out with the dry river yacht club at a free concert! They do a lot of free shows all the time, and you can catch some live music just about anytime you find your way into this place. Love it!
