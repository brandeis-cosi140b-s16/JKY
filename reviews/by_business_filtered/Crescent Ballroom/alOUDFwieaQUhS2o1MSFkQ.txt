I came to Crescent Ballroom to see a live performance on a Tuesday night. For some reason by the sounds of the name, I thought it was going to be a large ballroom. To my delight, it was a small and intimate venue. There was plenty of parking right in front which made me very excited. The doorman was very nice and told me about the metered parking. Wow thanks! Friendly bouncers, totally not what I'm used to coming from NYC. 

Inside, the venue was split into two different rooms. The front half looked like a cocktail/sports bar where I got to catch the ending of a Warriors game. The back half was the music venue which also had bleacher type seating in the back of the room. I had a great time not feeling squashed or trampled and just enjoying a weekday out immersed in music.
