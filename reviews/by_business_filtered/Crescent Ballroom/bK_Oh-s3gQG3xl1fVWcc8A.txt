First time here and I will be back.  The layout of this place has a Oregon feel to it.  It just reminds me of the bars in downtown Portland.  I saw Nortec Collective here and the main stage layout has an intimate feel to it.  Anywhere you stand or sit you'll have a great view of the performers.  The sound system sounded great too.  I will definitly be coming back here in the near future.
