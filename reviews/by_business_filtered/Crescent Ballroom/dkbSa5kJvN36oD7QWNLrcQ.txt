The closest thing to L.A. in Phoenix!

I went here with my hubby for Jen Deveroux Animal Royale fashion show.
(Jen is this super cute little pink haired chica that I just wanted to invite over for tea!)

Hubby & I arrived a bit early so we ordered a drink and sat in a small table.

 I was THRILLED that they had a Vanilla Bean rice pudding on the menu, so I ordered it!

The waitress was polite and brought me this big plastic bowl with a plastic spoon and it was FILLED with rice pudding!!! And it was only $3!!

It was DELISH!! My tastebuds soared!! I was sooo happy consuming this delight!

Anyway....
The 3 people at the table next to us were super friendly and we all chatted.

In fact, everyone at this place seemed super friendly and uber fun! The crowd was this beautiful eclectic mix of gay/lesbian, punk/rock/biker/techno peop's with lots of fun and cool hairstyles, make up and fashion.

We had a great time and I would highly recommend!
