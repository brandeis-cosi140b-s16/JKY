The wife and I were staying in Phoenix for the Vikings/Cardinals game this week and were looking for something to do after a disappointing Viking's loss.  How lucky was I that the Roadway Inn was two blocks away from this little secret gem?

We got a little appetizer type sampling of food with some amazing guacamole and a super good bean and cheese burrito.  I was also a huge fan of the Coronado Water (tequila, agave nectar, grapefruit bitters, and soda water).  It was very refreshing and tasty.  

The relaxed vibe at this place was also just what we were looking for.  Good music being played, friendly staff, and some old skate videos on the tv's. They also have live music many nights a week.  I was surprised to see Finch was playing there soon.  It would be a cool place to see bands because it is pretty small and intimate.

A must visit if in the Phoenix area.
