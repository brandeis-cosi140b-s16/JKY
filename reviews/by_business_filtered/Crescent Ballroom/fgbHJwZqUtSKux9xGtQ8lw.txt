Crescent Ballroom is completely the best venue in all of Arizona! I have seen a bunch of bands here and always had an amazing time. No matter where you're standing in the concert area you will have a good view and it is easy to get by the stage which is always awesome! The best part is that you can hang out during or after any show at the front bar and there are always cool people to meet and talk to. Love this place!
