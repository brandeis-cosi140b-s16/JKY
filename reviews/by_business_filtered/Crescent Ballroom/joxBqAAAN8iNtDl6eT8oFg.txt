This is the perfect venue for seeing bands perform in an intimate setting. I have seen many of my favorite artists perform here, and it is crazy how close I can get to the stage without feeling claustrophobic. It is also great to enjoy food and drinks in the first room before a show. I recommend their burger - delicious! Parking is easy to find in the area, some meters as well as residential parking a block away.
