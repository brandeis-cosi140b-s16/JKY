How did it take me so long to get here?
Great place to see a show, or just stop in for a bite to eat and a drink.

I came for a show - we got a table near the front. Acoustics were good, drinks were fairly priced (I can't gripe about $5/pint anywhere - at a show, it's great!), and the staff were friendly.

Tip - one block west of the venue has no parking meters!

It was a fantastic night out with a great group of women - and I will definitely be back - this is a great little venue!
