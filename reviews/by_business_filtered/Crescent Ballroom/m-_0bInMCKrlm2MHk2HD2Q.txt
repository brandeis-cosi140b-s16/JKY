Crescent is one of my favorite venues in the Phoenix area.  They host a large variety of shows and the staff is all very friendly.  They've recently expanded out the patio areas and it's helped a great deal in alleviating the cramped feeling you could get.  

The only negative thing I can really say about this place is the bathroom situation.  Make sure to stand in line for a bathroom before you need to go.
