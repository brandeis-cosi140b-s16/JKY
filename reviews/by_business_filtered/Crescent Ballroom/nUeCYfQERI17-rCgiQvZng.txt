Fantastic venue!  Clean.  Nice restrooms.  Not a bad place to sit or stand in the whole place.  I was here checking out some Lucha Libre wrestling recently and it was fantastic fun.  Yeah,  nobody really got hurt, but we sure had fun pretending that they did.

I didn't get to try the food, so I can't comment on that, but I would definitely be back for another performance.
