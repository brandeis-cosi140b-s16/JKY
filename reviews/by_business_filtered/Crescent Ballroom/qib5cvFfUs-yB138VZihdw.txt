My first experience with the Crescent Ballroom was pretty sweet. A small group of us visited on a Saturday night on the restaurant side. From 6-8pm there is an amazing flamenco group. I highly recommend it.

Indoor seating is tight so come early. Food and drink are reasonably priced. The tacos are street style sized portions for $3 or $4 a piece. The carne asada can be enjoyed without adding any further spice. The blackened tilapia tasted like ... tilapia. (The non-flavored fish of the world.)

Beer runs anywhere from $3 to $5 on a normal day.
Happy Hour is Monday 11AM-6PM and Tuesday-Friday from 3PM-6PM. Draft beers are a buck off.

I dinged a star for two reasons. Service was hard to come by for some reason. Perhaps they slow down service during a show to avoid distracting the performers? Or they would like folks to drink two beverages only? The other terrible situation is the number of bathrooms. On the restaurant side there is only a single occupant woman's bathroom. Unfortunately for us that night, there was barely any water running in the sink. (Which made for a long line.)
