The tacos were small, but they were pretty cheap. And they tasted real good!! I wouldn't say they were the best tacos that I have ever had...but I enjoyed eating them so that counts for something. It is right on the strip.. so that could be good or bad. It was a cheaper option than a lot of the other places. Overall it was decent.
