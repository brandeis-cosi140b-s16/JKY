Very friendly staff. They made fresh corn tortillas when we walked in and doubled them up so they wouldn't break under the weight of all the fillings! 
Many meat options, barbocoa and marinated pork were delicious! Lots of options for toppings including pico, cheese, hot sauces, and more. Great deal at taco platter was $9.95 for 3 tacos with beans and rice.
