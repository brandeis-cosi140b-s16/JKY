Looking through places that I checked in and wondering if I should review. Stumbled on this one,  funny because I was probably stumbling while I checked in! I'm so glad I did because DAMN. 

This place was amazing! Open late, quick, cheap, and effing heaven. I mean, it's late night tacos and stuff, but everything tasted so fresh, and was pretty much cooked right in front of you. 

I fell in love with DJ's and I will definitely stumble my way over here at the end of the night next time I'm in Vegas.
