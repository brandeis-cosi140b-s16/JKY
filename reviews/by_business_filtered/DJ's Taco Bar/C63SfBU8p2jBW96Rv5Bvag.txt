Best price value for awesome tasting food- you can't really beat $2 tacos! I like my tacos simple with just cilantro and onions and all three meats that I tried were amazing. The al pastor has a strong flavor, the chicken and steak are good as well. I would certainly come back on my next trip to Vegas.
