The people are nice, and it's cheap. But the food is not worth the price at all. I ordered a 3 taco plate with rice and beans. There was little flavor with everything and the tacos were so tiny. I am visiting here from San Francisco so I guess I have higher expectations for tacos. This place was a solid 3 stars for the service, food, and convenience together, which isn't bad at all - just don't come in with any expectations.
