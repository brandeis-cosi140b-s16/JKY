Yummmmmmm!

DJ's Taco Bar popped up on my Yelp when we were looking for a good place to check out in Vegas and I'm glad we stopped here.  We were obviously newbies and the guy behind the counter was a huge help.  He recommended two meats (so we could try more than one) on our nachos and they were both delish.  We went with the chicken and barbacoa and they were both perfectly cooked.  We let the guy dress our nachos how the regulars do it and everything was fresh and went great together.  I don't think there's a wrong choice coming here.   

While we were pigging out on our nachos, a guy asked us how the tacos were... We laughed and said, "Well, it's our first time here but these nachos are legit! Let us know how the tacos are!" He walked out after eating and said, "Tacos were the bomb.  Get them next time!" 

I think that speaks for itself.  Yum! :)
