The food was DELICIOUS!  I ordered a carnitas burrito with spicy beans, rice, cheese, guacamole and sour cream.  Omg!  The meat was of excellent quality, not overly greasy and gelatinous like other Mexican food places' carnitas are.  They were flavored to perfection and in heaping servings.  Definitely worth the $10!  I would no doubt recommend DJ's to anyone visiting the LV Strip.  You WONT be disappointed.
