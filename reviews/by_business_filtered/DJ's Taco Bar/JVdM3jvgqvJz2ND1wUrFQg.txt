Pretty disappointed with this place to be honest. First of all the price. I payed 14 bucks for a taco plate with chips and salsa. That doesn't even include a drink! As for the food... The tacos. The carne asada tasted closer to ground up McDonald's burgers than quality carne asada. The rice was dry and undercooked, and the beans tasted as if they were straight out of a can. They were also doing some sort of construction inside and at times I couldn't even here the person sitting next to me. I wouldn't recommend this place unless you had very low standards for a taco shop.
