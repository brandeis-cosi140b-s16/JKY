OMG!!!  We were talking along the strip, and got hungry.  Someone had spotted this place, so we went back.  I pulled up on YELP while waiting and was blown away by the ratings. 

Looking around the shop, they had a vertical pork broiler and had just brought out a new slab.  Too, they were working hard on grilling up more steak, cutting, etc.  So it took a minute to get waited on.  But Marisol was quite apologetic and pleasant when things calmed down. 

We had $2 tacos, and I got a burrito (huge).  They build it in front of you, and you can request what you want.  The hot sauce has a great kick and not TOO spicy. The guacamole was home made (not processed crap). The marinade on the steak was amazing!!

Once we found this, we went back a number of times - and one night for dinner!!
