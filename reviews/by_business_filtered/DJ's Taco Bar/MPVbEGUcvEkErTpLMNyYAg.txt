Omg. I am in taco heaven! This place is kind of hidden so don't miss it! I wish we would've walked the south end of the strip sooner in our trip and discovered this taco joint earlier...cause guess what I would've eaten all four days in vegas?! It wasn't until the last night of our trip that we finally stumbled upon DJs Taco Bar. The family sitting next to us told us they have been eating there at least once a day for a week now! Anyway, I ordered two of their steak tacos, gulped those down, and went back to order more! Their habanero extra extra spicy sauce is to friggin die for. I asked if I could buy some of this special homemade sauce. She handed me a a small plastic condiment container for 50 cents. No, what I meant was, is this sauce available for purchase in 12 oz bottles?  Lol. They laughed at me. Seriously, they should consider selling their sauce. Omg, my mouth if on fiya thinking about DJs. Again, biggest regret is not discovering this place sooner.
