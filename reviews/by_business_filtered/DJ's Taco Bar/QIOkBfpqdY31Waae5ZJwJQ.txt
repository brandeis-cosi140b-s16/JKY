3 tacos for less than $5!! (including the 10% check in discount). Awesome! YOu really can't beat the price, especially in Las Vegas. I had carne asada, grilled fish (freshly made), and pork. All delicious! Yes, the location might not be like the Wynn or Bellagio, but when I am craving Mexican tacos, this is where I'm going! Definitely recommend to anyone on a tight budget.
