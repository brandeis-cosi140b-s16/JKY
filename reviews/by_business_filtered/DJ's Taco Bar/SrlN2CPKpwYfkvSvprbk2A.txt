By far the best taco place on the strip. It's tiny, but there were multiple reviews for its taste and value, so my friend and I decided to go.

The burrito was humongous. The meat was tender and delicious. There was a lot to choose from for my burrito, so I piled it up. I highly recommend it.

The chips were okay since they tasted like they came from a bag. I was kind of hoping they made their own, but it's not taking away from their quality.

The hot sauce wasn't too alarming, but it's probably to cater to the average person. It was delicious though.

The reason I gave it a 4 and not a 5 is because while I was eating, there were flies constantly landing on me, which disturbed my lunch. That's why I took half of my burrito to my hotel room and devoured it.
