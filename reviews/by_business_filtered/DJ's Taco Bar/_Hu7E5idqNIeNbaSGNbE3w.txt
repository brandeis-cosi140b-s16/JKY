I am baffled to why this place has 4 stars. We came here after the iHeartRadio festival. We were looking for some good cheap eats that was close enough to the hotel that wouldn't break the bank. Four star taco place, sign me up. But, it wasn't good.

I got the nachos, they use cheese wiz. Yup, melted cheese wiz, it was gross. The guac wasn't bad. The "steak" was so chewy it was like eating gum. I couldn't finish it (and yeah I had been drinking, so everything tastes good when you're drinking).

My wife got tacos, she barely finished them, the chicken was good everything else was meh. And this wasn't necessarily cheap.

I would put this place one step above Taco Bell and 3 steps below Chipotle. I would avoid it at all costs, so many better options. And it wasn't cheap at all, it was almost 30 bucks with a couple tall boy cheapo beers.
