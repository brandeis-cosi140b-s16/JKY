Perfect late night dining option. I came strolling in close to midnight after working up an appetite walking the strip and this perfectly hit the spot. Even though they were close to closing staff was still friendly and welcoming as I made up my mind.

Even though tacos are there go to I went with a pork burrito with all the toppings. Pork was moist and well seasoned, lettuce and tomato were fresh and crisp. re-fried beans were a tasty and flavorful add on. The portion size and price were also perfect especially compared to other places on the strip.

Great little spot for some late night eating or at any time during the day.
