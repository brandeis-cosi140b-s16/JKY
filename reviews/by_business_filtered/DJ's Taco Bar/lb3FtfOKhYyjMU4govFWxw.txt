Very friendly staff.  The grilled fish tacos hit the spot.  Nothing super amazing but solid, quality food.  The rice had corn in it and was a little sweet.  With all of the fast food options around, I felt like this was the best food for the value in that area of the strip.

I got a 10% discount when I checked in with Yelp!
