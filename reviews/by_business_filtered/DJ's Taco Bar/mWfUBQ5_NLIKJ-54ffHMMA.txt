Decent food, disorganized staff. The ordering line could be comparable to Chipotle in size, variety and method; however, the staff preparing the food seemed overwhelmed and confused, customers had to yell over others or some standing in others way while waiting on whatever they ordered. The food line workers also yelled quite a bit, which is a personal pet peeve. The prices are great though, $8 per dish and it was quite flavorful. No air conditioning inside, seating with those misting fans outside, closest restrooms are in the creepy, rundown foodcourt building near that area.
