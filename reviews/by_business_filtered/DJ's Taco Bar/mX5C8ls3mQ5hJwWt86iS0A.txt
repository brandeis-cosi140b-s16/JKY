I was very pleased with my meal at DJ's. The $15 for $10 was totally worth it, I got a bowl and an order of chips. It was really good, much better than most of the surrounding places to eat. I will totally stop there again. I recommend it to anyone looking for an affordable bite to eat that is actually decent food.
