We stumbled across the Hawaiian Marketplace while walking down the strip.  Very happy to have discovered DJ's bc they have legit authentic Mexican food.  Not only is the food delicious, the portions are plenty and you can get away with a hearty meal for less than $10.  For Vegas, this is a steal.  While most other cheap eats in the area only include chain fast food joints, DJ's is a good alternative if you want something outside of the casino.  The staff at DJ's is also super friendly so you can't go wrong.  They even have a 10% off check in deal on yelp! 

The other half and I both decided on getting taco plates.  This includes 3 street tacos with your choice of meat and toppings and beans and rice.  I was very happy to see lengua on the menu as you only find this is authentic Mexican eateries.  I chose lengua (beef tongue), carnitas and pollo al pastor for my three tacos.  My only regret was not getting all lengua because it was so good!  Lengua was tender and flavorful.  The other half got carne asada on his tacos.  Everything else was what you would expect in street tacos.  What we loved about the black beans is that they were unseasoned.  Plain, simple food is what we like and it works!  We saw someone order the sopes and vowed to return the next day to give it a try but ended up on the other side of the strip, so didn't get to try that out (darn).  Overall, great taqueria on the strip.  Food is solid and it's a great place to eat if you want a hearty meal without having to spend much.
