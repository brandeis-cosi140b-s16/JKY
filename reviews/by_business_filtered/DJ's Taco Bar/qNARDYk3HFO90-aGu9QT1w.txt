I went here my first visit to Las Vegas and omg there are no words for how delicious and full of flavor their food is. The meat is very tender and juicy. I had tacos barbacoa and pastor. Also their chorizo was wonderful. You have to try this authentic Mexican food while you are in the area. The tortillas are hand made fresh. You definitely won't regret it. Also try their orchata (rice water)
