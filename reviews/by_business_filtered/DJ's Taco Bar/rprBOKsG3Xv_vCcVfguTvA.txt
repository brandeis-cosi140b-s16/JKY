Need a quick and cheap snack without going off the strip? Definitely check this place out! Located in the shopping center where the new Chili's is being built, DJ's is on the corner. 

Cheap $2 tacos that you can customize with the traditional cilantro/onion/hot sauce, you can choose to add other fixin's, cheese, lettuce, etc.

Note: the habanero hot sauce is indeed hot, they had a habanero pepper just marinating in there and the sauce is normally served on the side. 

At $2 a taco, this was a great deal for food on the strip
