Man I miss street tacos in Vegas, they are the best! I wanted to go to El Gordo but it was just too far, so I stumbled upon here instead. It was delicious, not as good as El Gordo but it's much more centrally located and convenient, so next time I will opt for this place. The Al Pastor tacos are pork off of a spit fire, which I wish they had these back in NoVA but surprisingly they don't. This will be my street taco spot next time I'm in Vegas!
