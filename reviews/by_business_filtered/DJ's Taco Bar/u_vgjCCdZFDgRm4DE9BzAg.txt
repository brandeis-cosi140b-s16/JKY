The food is awesome and the price is on point! We got 4 tacos rice and beans plus a large drink for $14. They gave us really good portions of meat and everything from the pico to the tortilla was delicious. I would have given 5 stars easily if only the young girl working there had been more pleasant. She would speak really low when we asked about something and had to ask her to repeat herself multiple times. She didn't seem to want to help anyone. But other than that this is a hidden gem in Vegas! Highly recommended!
