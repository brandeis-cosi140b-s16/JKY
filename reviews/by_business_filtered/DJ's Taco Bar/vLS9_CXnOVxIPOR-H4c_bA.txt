We were in Vegas a few weeks ago and tried out this little place. It's a small place that packs a big punch. We ordered the chicken and fish tacos with the onion and cilantro. Let me just say, the fish tacos were the best I have ever had. I asked the server to put the hot salsa for the first order that I placed for my group, assuming how hot could it really be!?! Mind you, we are all spice junkies and I can handle a lot of heat. These tacos set our mouths on fire... But it was too good to stop. We ordered a couple more rounds of tacos and ate till we were all satisfied. Even the woman at the cash register was really friendly!

The only reason I gave this place four stars was because on the last day of our trip we came here for lunch as I was craving that fish taco. The lunch line was a little long and I patiently waited. As soon as I got to the server, I asked for fish tacos...and I was denied. I informed the guy that I didn't mind waiting but he wouldn't budge :(. I had to settle for the chicken tacos instead. 

We were in Vegas for three days and ate at this joint three times. That tells you how much we loved this place. DJ's tacos are out of this world!! For two dollars, you can't beat this place. Do you dare to try the hot salsa?
