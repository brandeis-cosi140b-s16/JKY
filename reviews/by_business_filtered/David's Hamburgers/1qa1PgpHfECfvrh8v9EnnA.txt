David's seems kind of hit or miss. I've been several times and the first time was definitely the best that got me hooked. I always get the burger (plain) with fries and a milkshake. I love the food, cooked well, nice seasoning and great shakes!

I think the price is right for what you get, the decorations are really cute, like diner and pinup-ish, however the staff seems really annoyed by idk questions about the food or asking for a side of sauce or whatever. They looked at me like I was crazy when I asked to get my menu back to see what kind of flavors they have for ice cream, "Well, you can just go look..." OKAY, but I'm asking you now, then I explained I wanted shake flavors and she told me a couple. I got up and looked at the menu later and would have ordered different ones if I had gotten my menu back. Shake my head. I definitely don't let that get me down though with how cozy the place is and yummy the food is!

Usually it's not that busy with plenty of seating and occasionally they have obscure performers, first time I was there they had a duel piano player, haven't seen him since though.
