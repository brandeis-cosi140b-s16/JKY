I placed an order for delivery, and received in about 30 minutes. Not bad. Plus this food is delicious. I ordered the guacamole burger, fries, chocolate peanut butter shake, and a house salad. The salad is the typical lettuce, tomatoes and cheese, and the fries - well they're fries, nothing special. But the chocolate peanut shake and the burger are super tasty! The burger was loaded with guac, bacon - YUM! I'd definitely order again!
