3.5

While I'm almost a fan, I should have paid better attention to the name of the restaurant when ordering.  Had it been Julio's Mexican Food & Other Stuff, my order would have been a wise choice.  But instead I ordered a carne asada quesadilla made by David who specializes in hamburgers.

In all fairness to David, it was not bad.  I'm not a big quesadilla person, but the Mexican plates seemed to large for me to consume and expect to walk around the arts festival afterward.  And if I can't take it home, I'm inclined to stuff it down.  I didn't care for the meat in the quesadilla (not the seasoning, but the actual flavor of the meat itself was odd), but it was perfectly buttery and toasty and full of cheese and veggies as well.  My husband's hamburger, however, looked great and I was full of envy as I watched him finish it in record time.  That envy quickly turned to resentment as he sampled my quesadilla and remarked "yep, mine's better."  He would pay for his insensitivity later that afternoon.  I like that they will add flavorings to your soft drink, but my Cherry Coke needed more cherry flavoring and the addition of a cherry would be nice.

I do love that this restaurant has not be redesigned to fit into the trend of turning "Old Town" into North Scottsdale, from the big counter on one side to the vinyl booths on the other.  I just think I'll still with burgers and shakes.  Well, who am I kidding?  I'll order David's Mexican food again.  I can't turn down anything in a tortilla.
