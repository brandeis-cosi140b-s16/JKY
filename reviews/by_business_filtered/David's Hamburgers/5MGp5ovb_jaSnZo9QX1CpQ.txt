Horrible food and service! Myself, my mother & my daughter went to this restaurant a couple of days ago & we were very disappointed in the service. Although the waitress was nice enough she made several mistakes on our final bill. She verbally gave us the wrong prices for the special & then when our bill came she had charged us for 3 drinks which we did not have. She over priced me on the special but she blamed it on the computer & when she went to change the bill to the correct price she came & it had not taken off the extra money on the special which she specifically said it had. Even though she apologized, she did not try to make it right at all.  We told her to make sure to NOT charge card for the first wrong price & she assured us she did not. Today my mother checked & she DID charge us both times! The food sucked! The service was worse and now she will not let us talk to the manager! She said she can not reverse the charges & all she can do is ask the manager on MONDAY to send us a check! Bull s*#@ !! I was a server for years & I know it's possible & I also know that she had to charge mom's card twice at the end of her shift! This is just unacceptable. Don't waste your time or money at this dive!
