I absolutely love this place !

It's one of my favorite lunch places . The green chili burger is to die for ! Come in here very hungry and you will not be disappointed in their burgers !  

So other items are pretty good , but burgers and shakes is where it's at ! But not at same time - too much ! :) 

Hope they are here to stay and never go away !
