The biggest problem preventing this establishment from success is CURB APPEAL. It just looks REALLY cheap. The exterior window displays look absolutely wretched. Whoever created the visual elements that are supposed to lure in customers just has no imagination and seems unwilling to spend any money on improvements. Too bad, since the food is quite good. I took my son and we both were impressed. I'd actually passed this place hundreds of times before finally dropping in. And I think that revelation speaks for itself. It just lacks appeal.
Once inside, the staff appeared somber, which always unnerves me. Were they surprised to see customers in the middle of the afternoon? I think they were! 
Again, I must comment on design elements; this time, inside. The interior is as uninspired as the front window displays. The restaurant is long and desperately needs mirrors. It tries to look 50's, but just comes off like cheap plastic masquerading as chrome. Here's a tip: Drop the hideous yellow wall paint and draw your inspiration from authentic 50's dinners. Frame some original movie posters; get an old motorcycle in there. Do something! 
Its sad really, this is the only diner in the area, so they're just hurting themselves. People want this place to succeed. They also do NOT have a liquor license, so that's gonna be an automatic deal-breaker for some patrons.
