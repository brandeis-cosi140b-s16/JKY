David's has the best shakes, at least i think they do.  They are served in old fashioned milkshake glasses and youngest the container they are blended in.  You can get flavored sodas like an old fashioned soda fountain.  I usually get vanilla coke, sometimes cherry coke.
I have always eaten in.  The breakfasts are decent.  My only objection was with the fried potatoes.  It looked like they had taken french fries and diced them up and fried them.  Kind of disappointing as i am a big fan oh home fries with real potatoes.
Definitely worth a visit in my book.
