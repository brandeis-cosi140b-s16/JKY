It was the only place in town open at the hour and the food was really good. And it had burgers AND Mexican!

It was greasy, but that's the way I like it. Some of my friends claimed to have gotten sick afterwards, but based off what we were doing earlier in the day, and throughout the night, I think there were other circumstances. (I was the DD and didn't get sick.) Our server was really attentive, bringing refills quickly and whatnot. And I thoroughly enjoyed my burger and fries. The place was really clean, too!
