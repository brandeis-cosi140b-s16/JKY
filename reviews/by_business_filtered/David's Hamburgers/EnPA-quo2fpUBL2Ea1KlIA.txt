Walked past this place the other day looking for a quick bite to eat that was nothing fancy.  The place was nearly empty on a Friday afternoon around lunch time.  There was really no theme from a decor perspective other than an under funded diner in the "middle of no-where" in the middle of America struggling to make ends meet.  Bare walls with no even any art up and the back wall had some exposed electrical wiring.  Well, this is not in the "middle of no-where" but rather the middle of Scottsdale and I expected a bit more.  Nevertheless, I decided to give it a true.

The server was very attentive and kind.  I asked her what was good here and the suggestion was the Davids Burgers and anything Mexican on the menu.  I choose the David's Burger, thinking the signature item with the owners name on it would be at least good.  I was wrong, the burger bland, too much lettuce and onions and there was a thick slice of cheese the was dry and completely clashed with the rest of the burger.  Furthermore, the bun was not even warm.  Come'on guys at least put the bun on the grill and warm it up a bit.  

As much as I tried to fairly have this place a second star, I just could not.
