Was going to Sugar Bowl (around the corner) for banana splits but wanted some real food also.  The food menu at Sugar Bowl is to simple/strange for me.

We decided to try this place since there is a B1G1 coupon in the entertainment book.  It seems like a family run business and the decor is a kinda cute fifties soda bar theme.

The bonus is that they offer breakfast all day (apple waffles, chocolate chip pancakes, ect.), Mexican (my husband loved his carnitas tacos. they were huge and looked tasty) as well as Hamburgers.  I had a veggie burger with cheese fries.  A little bit of everything for anyone.  :)
