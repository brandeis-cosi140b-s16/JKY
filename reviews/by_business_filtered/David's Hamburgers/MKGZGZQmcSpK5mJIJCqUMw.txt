Just off the main drag but well worth the little walk to get there. GREAT FOOD,  SERVICE AND PRICES. Much better food quality and larger portions than higher priced fancy places. Down home atmosphere, good music and friendly, courteous staff ( not over bearing or inattentive). Would go back in a minute if I was closer. Great ending to my vacation.
