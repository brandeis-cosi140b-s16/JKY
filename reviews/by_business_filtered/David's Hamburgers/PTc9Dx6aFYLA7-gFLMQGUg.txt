Bland burgers. Fast food is better than this place. Kinda akward little kid running in and out of the kitchen? Fries were soggy, buns dry not fresh at all, Stay away from chili cheese fries, chili tasted horrible like a cheap Canned brand. Didn't seem to be a manager on duty place was empty. Let server know our group didn't care for our food. Server didn't offer to fix anything with our food. Really disappointed don't understand how this place is even able to operate and stay open. Go to any of the other 4 or more burger places in the area.
