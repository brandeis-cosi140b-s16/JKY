3.5 stars.. if you are looking for super cheap eats along Old Town after checking out all the shops etc this is a place to come. We got enough buy one get one free of lesser or equal value cards from the Farmer's Market and got an incredibly good deal. 

Our grill cheese sammiches with onion rings/ french fries were decent. The Texas burger was well liked despite the name (someone in our yelper group who shall remain anonymous said it was more of a Western Burger than a Texas Burger) and our little mini yelper in training liked her hot dog. Service is average and the food quantity is worth the price.  

A cheap find (if you have the mini coupon card) or a decent value without the coupon...
