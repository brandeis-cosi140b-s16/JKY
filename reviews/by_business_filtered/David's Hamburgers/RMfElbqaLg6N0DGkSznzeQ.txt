Wow-I'm really surprised that this place got as many good ratings as it has.  I had a single cheese burger which was really bad.  The patty was thin, over cooked, and the cheese was not melted.  The fries were fair but I think they were frozen prior.  There were not many people in the place at lunch time as well.  I would be surprised if this place is still around in 6 months.
