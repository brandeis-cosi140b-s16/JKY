When i looked at this place I wanted to run the other way. There was absolutely no magnetism there. I was with a group of family members and was out voted so in we go. We were greeted by a friendly staff that was eager to assist us (the place was dead). The waitress came by to take our order and I was going to go the Mexican food route. I figured heck i traveled over 900 miles I might as well as I am not going to get any closer to the border. I asked if they had horchata, and she had to go check. I took this as a bad sign either waitress on training wheels or has no clue what it is. Well they don't have any. So i decide to go with the enchiladas. Never again.... sorry guys the others in the party had burgers. They said they were good. 
Would I go back? 
i think I will go check out more of the local establishments before returning.
