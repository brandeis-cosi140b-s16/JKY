This restaurant is a hidden gem! The service is great and EVERY item on the menu is amazing! I first found this place searching for online deliveries on grub hub and had to see what the restaurant is all about. Although it's not aesthetically appealing, the environment still makes it a great place to dine and the employees are more dedicated to making their customers happy than most.
