I'm sitting here emitting small, burgery burps of pure delight as I write this...no, sorry, there are just some things that you can't unread:)
I walked over to David's for lunch today and found a Texas Burger, fries and a vanilla malt sitting on the counter in front of me...what was I supposed to do...ignore them?
No...you can't ignore destiny and destiny was calling to me, in the form a 1/3 lb's burger, with an onion ring, crispy applewood smoked bacon, Tillamook sharp cheddar cheese and barbecue/ranch dressing/sauce (you read that right...they mix them together for the burger and damned if it doesn't work!) with a platter-full of fries:)
This thing was everything you want from a diner burger, wrapped in wax paper and served still popping and sizzling from the grill.
I was tempted to hoover that thing down in about 3 bites, but reason took over and I sat there at the counter and savored the burger and the experience of finding a new burger joint, sipping my malt (pretty decent malt, BTW), having a few fries and just letting a feeling of well being wash over me, like grease from a great burger down the front of the white dress shirt of my lunch hour (it's a metaphor:)
This place is right off Scottsdale Rd., and in an era of flash and dazzle, this place won't win any interior decoration awards, but it's clean and relatively modern, they do have a big HDTV (doesn't everybody these days?), and a fireplace at one end of the place...the fireplace wasn't getting much of a workout today.
David's menu aligns almost perfectly with the name of the joint...there are burgers and mexican food, and not much else. It's family owned and operated and nowhere near as busy as it should be!
I haven't seen the pairing of burritos and malts anywhere else recently and that will be an interesting combo to try out one of these days.
I'm gonna need to stock up on Pepcid AC:)
