I enjoyed this place for a quick informal lunch at a good price. And the service ws outstanding - very friendly. Maybe that was David :-)  However, it is first and foremost a burger joint that appears to have branched out to mexican food as an after thought. The ambiance, decor, music (and the fact they have an old fashioned  "fountain" with stellar milkshakes) all remind me of a 50's style diner. No hint of Mexican there. But nothing wrong with that as the food is good. I'd return if I was downtown but would not drive out of my way for a meal.
