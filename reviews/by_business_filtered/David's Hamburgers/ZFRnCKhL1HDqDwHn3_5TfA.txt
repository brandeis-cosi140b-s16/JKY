I have become a regular at this place. GREAT Burgers and Friendly Staff. A step back in time as you sit in Boothe's listening to 50's and 60's music. Simple Mom & Pop place which makes it great, they care about the quality of the food and service. Occasionally they have Live entertainment. Paula Williamson has been there a few times singing, great show. Great location in Old Town Scottsdale.
