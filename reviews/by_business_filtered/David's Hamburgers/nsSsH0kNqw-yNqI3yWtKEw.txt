I was very hungry the other night, and decided to give Davids Original Hamburgers a try for delivery.  Now, I live in Scottsdale which, last time I checked, was in the United States where English is spoken, but maybe I'm wrong.  The person answering the phone spoke some kind of English, because I only had to ask him to repeat himself twice per question to understand him.  After repeating the name of my street 4 times, and spelling it for him twice, we finally got around to ordering.  I asked three times for a Philly Cheese Steak with fries, only because he didn't seem to understand a word I was saying.  I should have become suspicious when he asked me if I wanted steak on my fries...?????  Anyway, after hanging up, he calls back 5 minutes later and asks me to once again repeat my street name.  35 minutes later, a very nice young man showed up with my food.....and order of chili cheese fries.  I refused the order, as hungry as I was, but the delivery guy gave them to me anyway, no charge.  The only reason I ate about a quarter of them was that I was so hungry, but I'll tell you what, I wouldn't feed them to a starving dog.  They were pasty, soggy, and quite probably the worst thing I've ever eaten.  No thanks Dave, but here's a tip.....put someone on the phone that speaks English.
