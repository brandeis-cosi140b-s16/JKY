It is hard to believe that we ate at the same place as some of these other reviewers.  We stopped in to get breakfast before going to a Giants game and had one of the worst dining experiences that we have ever had. 

My daughter ordered a cheese omelet--what she got was a folded pile of greenish looking eggs with a bit of cheese melted on top.  My son ordered plain pancakes with nothing on them (he is very picky about his food) and got four pancakes smothered with powdered sugar.  The waitress (who was wearing a sloppy grease stained shirt) seemed oblivious to his distress.

I ordered huevos rancheros and got a plate with a slice of ham, two eggs, and some type of apple concoction all smothered with beans with a cup of covered canned salsa on the side.  Yuck

The four gentlemen at the table next to us were so exasperated by the poor service and their mixed up orders that after trying to communicate with the staff ended up just leaving (they paid of course).

Maybe breakfast isn't their strong suit, but if that is the case, they shouldn't serve it.
