I was visiting Old Town one evening, and my family and I decided to have some dinner before returning to the hotel. After walking around a few blocks, we decided on David's; it looked family friendly and seemed like a non-national chain dining facility, something I was gunning for on my cross-country road trip.

We ordered 2 of their pulled pork taco specials and a salad. While none of these dishes were particularly special, they all tasted great. The pulled pork tacos came with 3 tacos, beans, rice, and a lovely dollop of guacamole and sour cream. The salad was huge, a wonderful portion for its price.

Service was good, too; food came out in a timely fashion. All together, no complaints! Good for families!
