Long story how we ended up there, but after ordering lunch for a homeless man, the smell of charbroiled burgers got the best of me. The burger was fine, the fries were less than desirable, but the malted milk shake made it all better! I'm sure David thinks he's on to something here - cooking fresh burgers at a very reasonable price (and friendly service), but I have had better burgers and fries!
