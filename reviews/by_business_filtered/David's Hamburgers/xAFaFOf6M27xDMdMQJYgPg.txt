I'm so disappointed by my recent order. I have ordered from them multiple times. this time, they forgot my onion rings and the sandwich was soggy and gross. I called to inform them that they forgot my onion rings and they told me they would send them back out.....an hour and a half later nothing. I then called back up and this time i spoke to a guy a he said that he didn't know they were supposed to send anything back out. it was just completely bad customer service. if you screw something up, you don't promise to fix it and then don't deliver. I will never order from them again.
