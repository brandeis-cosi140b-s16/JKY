This place was really good...Me and my friend only split a quesadilla, and a steak burrito so I can't speak for everything. But we thought the food was good. The service was good too until our server towards the end  brought over another server and told us he would be taking over 'cause he "had to get outta there" but then hung around doing stuff. While we were still there. Which we thought was a little funny. But overall good experience and would probably go again next time I'm in Vegas.
