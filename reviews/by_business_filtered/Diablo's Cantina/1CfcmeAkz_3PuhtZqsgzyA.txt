1.5 stars; The food was seriously pathetic. So, why any stars at all? Good service and some blended drinks that kicked some ass.

The order:
Mexican Pizza: 2.5 stars (not crispy at all, and unoriginal)
Empanadas: 1 star (the all-spice seasoned meat was disgusting when coupled with its blended dog food texture)
Taquitos: 2 stars (no flavor whatsoever...bad meat texture...thank god it was topped with some decent guacamole)
Steak Fajitas: 2 stars. (Alright flavor, but, again: the meat was horrible. very chewy and tenuous)
Chips and Salsa: 3.5 stars (chips were crisp and there was a variety of salsas. none stand out as notable)

This food was so horribly lame that it almost ruined my trip to LV. Thank god they make a mean Barcardi 151 Daquiri, or  i'd have been real pissed.

i do not recommend this place to any yelper for any reason whatsoever.

i'll post photos soon.
