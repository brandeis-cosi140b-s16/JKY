This place isn't bad by any means....it's just nothing to write home about. If you want Tex Mex in Vegas, this place might do it for you but I'm from Texas and the food wouldn't stand a chance in the Lone Star State.  We ordered the chips and salsa ($4) and they were pretty good.  We also had the chicken fajitas and they came with all the right things (pico de gallo, sour cream, cheese, and guacomole) and everything was cooked well but it just wasn't awesome -- it was definitely a good attempt though.
