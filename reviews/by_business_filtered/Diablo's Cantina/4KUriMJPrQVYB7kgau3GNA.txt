Visited on a Thursday night in November.  We got a table in the bar.  Tacos and margaritas were very good.   They charge for chips and salsa, which is pretty weak.  Only complaint is that service was a little slow given that the place was not that crowded.  

Diablo's was just OK for our dinner.  I'm sure it would be more fun on a busy summer weekend.
