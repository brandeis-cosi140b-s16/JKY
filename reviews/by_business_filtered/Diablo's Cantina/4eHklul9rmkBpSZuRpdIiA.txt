They lure you in with girls in bikinis offering you 2 for 1 deals, but I think it's only for wells. This place was close to our hotel so we were just gonna get some drinks since there was nothing appealing on the menu, but ordered some food too since it was convenient that way. I shared the carne asada fajita sandwich with my friend. It came with fries and the portion was pretty huge. $18 for a sammy, but it's Vegas! ;) They also have the bikini girls stand on top of the bar and have them spin a wheel..not sure for what or why, but hey- more eye candy lol. I saw someone order nachos and it was humongous! Is EVERYTHING big in Vegas?? lol
