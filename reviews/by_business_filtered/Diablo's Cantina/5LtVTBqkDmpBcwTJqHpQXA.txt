2 Stars for "meh, I've experienced better". Located right on the Vegas Strip in Monte Carlo! A+ for location, but thats about it. The marinated steak came with a small portion of mexican rice, black beans and flour tortillas. I was expecting a soft, juicy steak but instead I received a tough, chewy piece of steak. I wasn't impressed by this dish, but the Diablo Wings were much better. They were definitely on the spicy side. I am not a stranger to spicy food, but these were definitely on the hot, firey side hence the name of the restaurant "diablo". 

On the bright side of things, a highlight for me was the Mexican corn ($5). My boyfriend and I ordered an extra one to-go. Would I come back? Unfortunately, no. Price point is pretty high as well for mediocre, chain Mexican food.

In short, if you are a big fan of Mexican corn (elote) then this is the place for you :) Skip the steak. Order the diablo wings if your'e up for a challenge. If you can finish 20 diablo wings you'll go up on the Wall of Fame, if not then you will go to the Wall of Shame.
