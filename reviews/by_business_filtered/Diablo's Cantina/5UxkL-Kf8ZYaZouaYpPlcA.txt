I thought this place was ok. I was expecting more "real" Mexican food than what the menu offered. I felt like the menu was somewhat limited and small. They just used large font to make you think otherwise. I ordered the veggie burrito and my fianc√© ordered the fried pepper which he absoloutley loved. My dish was just ok. I like that this place is big with two floors and had a live band performing upstairs. They broadcasted what was going on upstairs on a tv downstairs. This place is cool for a late night bite or just to come drink and dance. Decent for the price, and they have decent drink specials. So it's safe to say I'll return next time I'm in vegas.
