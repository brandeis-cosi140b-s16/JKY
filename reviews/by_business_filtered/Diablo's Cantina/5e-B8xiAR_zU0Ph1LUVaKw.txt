Went there for my boss's birthday.  We had fun, but purely for the company. We started off at the bar. Bartender was great and attentive even though it was pretty busy. Went downhill from there. Our waitress was flat out rude and not friendly at all. She never came by to see how we were. I ordered the fish tacos. Fish was dried out and almost leathery. My friend  felt bad my dinner sucked and offered me some of her quesadilla so I asked if it was good and she said it was meh so I passed.  Although I will say I had a bite of someone's green pork enchilada and it rocked. Chocolate cake came for the birthday boy and it was flavorless. I have a bit of a sweet tooth and I didn't bother to go for a second bite. This place is busy just because of its location on the strip. However, as a local I will not be going back. Too many great places both on and off the strip to deal with crappy overpriced food with even worse service.
