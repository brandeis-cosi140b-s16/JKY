Words cannot express how horrible this was!  We made reservations for 5 because we were going to see the Blue man group. They seated us at a booth that was far to small for our party and when I asked the waiter if we could move and was told to go back to the hostess stand to be reseated!?!?!? Customer service, not!!  Guacamole came, and it looked amazing, till you discover the large amount of chips crushed underneath to make the bowl appear full.  Fail.  The queso chorizo appetizer was nothing more than a smear of beans with some cheese melted on top and microwaved till it was almost inedible.  Kids selections, nothing!!!  Mexican is by far the easiest to do a kids version of, so we had to order the 8yo a 14$ plate of cheese nachos because what kid wants a grilled cheese at a Mexican joint!?!?  Other daughter ordered fajitas.  I wish I could post a pic of the rock hard and crumbly tortillas that were served with it. Waiter knew immediately what was wrong, clearly an ongoing problem.  And the sound....  Wear ear plugs and expect to SHOUT all night.  Horrible food, service ect. Surprised the Monte Carlo would have such an awful place.
