Drinks were ok.  Over priced but good. The chicken soup is horrible.  The worse part is the server told me he knows how terrible the soup is yet they still have it on the menu.  I had to wait for the mgr to finally show up to remove it off our bill.  The mgr wouldn't even attempt to Taste the soup he KNOWS how bad it tastes & said they're not removing it off their menu
