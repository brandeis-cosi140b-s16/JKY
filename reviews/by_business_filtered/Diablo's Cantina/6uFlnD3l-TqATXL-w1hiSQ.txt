My co-worker and I went into Diablo's by the recommendation of his friend. My co-worker indicated that the place might be recommended simply because they had lots of beer, but I wasn't disappointed.

The service was good. We were served by a waiter that reminded me of Charlie from It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, but it was no laughing matter. He kept us taken care of.

We had some hot wings, which were indeed hot. For those who think they can handle spice, you might try their extreme spicy wing challenge. Both my co-worker and I enjoy some spice, but the "hot" wings were pushing the limits. They were tasty, though. Decent meat quality.

I had the chicken fajitas, and although it wasn't anything different than I expected, it was a decent portion size and was good.

We settled on this place as the Seattle/Green Bay game was shown on the televisions in the restaurant, but I was pleased with the overall quality of the food and service. I would recommend it if you aren't looking for anything that breaks out of the mold. Overall, a good place to catch a game and get some beer and/or food.
