A diablo's..a hangovers best friend.

Is it gourmet Mexican? No, is it classy or even quaint, no? It's a Mexican bar people, get over it1

Decent tequila selection. Went here for my birthday and hit the tequila menu up at noon promptly (hey when in vegas) and had some chicken quesadillas, which were large enough to share between two and really surprisingly good. 

Next day with a vicious hangover I crawled back. With the help of a lovely bartender who recognized my symptoms (or my face from that pricey party the day before) ordered a chicken burrito wet with chipotle sauce. My god that thing was good. I can't blame it on the hangover either because for me, hungover means no food, not In this case . Burrito down and three coronoas later, back to life for more fun in vegas.

Of course HAD to pick up some shirts for me and my friends (GOOD GIRLS SWALLOW...the worm) logo...ha! Loved it!

Thank you staff at El Diablo for making my time there a memorable one (and a blurry one!)
