First of all,  buy one get one drink just for checking in on Yelp... yes please! 

 My husband and I stopped here two times on our visit to Las Vegas.  Both times my husband had the fajitas.  The first had steak (a little bit chewy) and then chicken.  His favorite was the chicken.  Both were very filling and tasted fantastic.  

The first time we went, I had the chicken nachos.  I was not a fan.  They were rubbery and had way too many chips with nothing on them.  They are served with pico, guac, and sour cream.  I left full and with lots of left overs, but I must admit, I didn't even eat my left overs.  They just weren't what I was looking for.

The second time I had a steak burrito and chips/salsa.  This meal was much better than the meal prior.  The steak burrito is served with sour cream, pico, guac, beans, and rice.  It was filling and delicious.  The salsa had a nice kick to it and the chips were served warm.  What more could you ask for?
