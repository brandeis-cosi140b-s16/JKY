They have THE worst frozen margharitas out of a machine at the whole strip.
Mind you, Vegas cheap spots in general serve tourists the crappiest crap out of a machine with tons of cheap $1 general store booze in it, but this beats them all. Plus with $12!!!!!!!! for a tiny glass of liquid pink half frozen oversugared crap, its really not worth it. 
My stomach was super upset afterwards, and I do hold my liquer very well.

On the other note, the food is pretty decent, as long as its not deep fried, you are ok. The bartenders are usually attentive. Its the strip afterall though, so give them some slack.
