A friend recommended this place. 

After landing it was our first stop and can't really complain too much. One star for the food (nothing too special or out of the ordinary) and two starts the the location. In fact, the best part of Diablo's is the location. We sat on the patio looking over the strip and had the best people watching. SIT ON THE PATIO!
