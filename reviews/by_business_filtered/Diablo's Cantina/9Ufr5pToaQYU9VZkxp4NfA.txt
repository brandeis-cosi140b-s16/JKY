I was invited to an open bar for my friend's work function and I was surprised with how much I enjoyed Diablo's.  We had a booth upstairs in the outdoor patio and the weather was perfect.  Their touch of California/Spanish decor and outdoor Christmas lights gives off a chill vibe.  As for their food: nachos and pizza were super yummy, mojitos were good and the service was awesome.  They were bringing us drinks left and right!
