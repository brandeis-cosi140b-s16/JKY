The service at first was kinda crappy.  I guess they don't open til noon.  We got there at around 11:45 and they made us stand by the door until noon.  Our waitress was nice but not overly friendly.  We had the potato skins for appetizers and they were very good, but the main course lacked flavor in every aspect.  Me and my bf both had the steak burrito and even he said taco bell was better.   For a $54 bill you would think it would be a little better.  I just thank god I had a free meal voucher from playing myvegas.  I will most likely never go back.
