came here twice now. took some scandalous pics with the shot girls, etc.

this place is chill. i bet i can come in here wearing my day clothes and it'd be fine. my bf's friend works here so we got special treatment. doesn't hurt my reviews!!

the bartenders are super nice, the music is good, and there's enough dance space to shake your bon bon though it's not technically a "club". one of their margaritas sucked. i forget which flavor. you're better off ordering your "usual".
