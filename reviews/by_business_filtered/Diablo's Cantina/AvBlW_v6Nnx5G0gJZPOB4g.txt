Best chicken nachos! Make sure you share because the portion is HUGE!

So I returned for a 2nd time on our trip since we loved the nachos so much, but the would not let us take our Starbucks in. As you know Starbucks is expensive in Vegas so it was frustrating that we had to toss our drinks. The 2 star is for the no outside drink policy! 4/5 star on the nachos! That's a 3 star now. 

Bummer! Update ur policy!
