Food was good, service at the time we went was okay and we had strong drinks.  All pluses when on our last day in vegas.  Perfect seat in the front to people watch.  Salsa's were tasty.  I had shrimp tacos and loved them.  The BF had the salmon, tasty, nicely cooked.  Portions were a little small, but it hit the spot.  I wish the chips and salsa didn't cost extra, kinda seems like something that would be free but it's vegas, what can you do.  nothing's free.
