Pretty decent Mexican food on the strip.  I like the fact that it has an entrance from the street - you don't have to trek through the Monte Carlo to access it.  That was definitely a bonus for me.
The margaritas came out of a slushie machine, so that was sort of disappointing - sure, I drank it, but I prefer places where they make each drink individually.
It was super loud in there.  The atmosphere was cool and it was definitely more of a bar vibe, which I enjoy, but they really could stand to turn the volume down just a notch or two.  Conversation with difficulty.
The food though was outstanding.  We started with chips and three different kinds of salsa - all of which were good.  And spicy.  Not too spicy, just enough.  My dining companion had the taco salad and is still raving about it.  I had the chicken burrito and it melted in my mouth.  So all in all the food was excellent.
I would say the service may have needed some help - despite the margarita coming out of a slushie machine we still didn't get our drinks until after the food arrived.  That was a negative for me.  No liquid and spicy salsa don't mix very well.
All in all, yes, I recommend.
