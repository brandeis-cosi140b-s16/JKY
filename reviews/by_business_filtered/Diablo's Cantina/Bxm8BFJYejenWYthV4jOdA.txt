This place was pretty cool.  I went there three times during the two days I spent in Vegas a week ago.  They spin a wheel every half hour to determine the drink specials.  Three dollar Jager shots and three dollar rum and cokes were some of the possibilities.  The bartender did some tricks with the whiskey bottle.  Probably not the coolest place on the strip, but I had fun.  And the bartender recognized me the second time I came in, and I can appreciate that.  I didn't try the food.
