I hated this place from the moment we arrived at the hostess station, but I didn't pick the place and my friends were seemingly committed to it. We waited for 20 minutes for a table for 7, but they lost our name and then told us to go upstairs to the open air bar where there are no tables at all. What?! 

We went upstairs and sat at a couch/lounge area. The misters were SO strong that we were getting practically showered and thus wet. I asked the server if we could turn them off/down. She said, "I can't survive without them!" Well, I was certainly more concerned about her comfort than mine, or so she assumed. SERVER 1, ME 0  Then she tells me that she can't do separate checks. I argued, this is a bar, do we have to figure out how to split the bill among those people who are not in our party right next to us? Completely unlogical, and irritating. We weren't all eating, and we weren't all drinking. I lost this dispute. SERVER 2, ME 0. Next, you could see her counting how many were in our party. 7. The menu said, parties of 8 or more will be charged gratuity. We had 7. We saw her count. She charged us gratuity. SERVER 3, ME 0. At this point, I was so angry, I almost threw money at her and ran out.

Food was also terrible. 

Only positive might be the patio/view if I weren't being showered by misters. 

Hated this place. Wish I could rate in the negatives.
