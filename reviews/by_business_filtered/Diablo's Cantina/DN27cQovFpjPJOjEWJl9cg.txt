DISCLAIMER: Review is for a post 10PM visit on a Saturday night.  A good spot to come to after a few drinks elsewhere or stumbling by on your way back to your room.

I knew this was going to be a questionable call after being given bracelets outside by the little old lady whole barely spoke english, poor lady should have been at home cuddled in her warm bed!  After our group of 10 (9F and 1M) walked in, we were not guided anywhere except the back where the stairs to the deck were blocked off.  We were than told by the blonde girl up front that we could by a bottle and get good service for the same price or cheaper than if we all bought our drinks.  We passed on that given that not everyone wanted to drink.

We sat down at a table along the window just along the strip, which provided a great people watching spot.   Everyone felt awkward as we were not given any service (despite there being plenty of servers/promoters near by who were clearly not busy and able to help.  I witnessed smaller groups walk in, PAY COVER, and then leve after like 30 minutes because of the awkwardness.

Like I said, I only saw this place from 10pm - Midnight on the Saturday of NYE 2015 weekend and I was very disappointed.  Unless you're already hammered, or its after midnight, or both, I would just stay away.  When I left at midnight I will say the dance floor looked like it was having a good time, but by that time I had already spent two hours there and was over it.

I wont be going back.
