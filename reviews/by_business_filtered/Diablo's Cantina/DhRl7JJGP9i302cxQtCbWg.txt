Pros: for the most part the food is good. 
nachos are really good and they are huge so 3 people could share them. 

Cons: expensive for what it is. I ordered my 3 year old a cheese quesadilla and it was $16.00 with no rice or beans on the side. If you want that with any of your entrees it's extra. Same goes with chips and salsa for the table...wtf? Quesadillas was ok but it was small especially for the price.
