You wouldn't expect it, but the food here is actually really good.  That said, the reason for walking in off the streets is the huge bar with beautiful bartenders.  The ambiance is great, and the bar upstairs is awesome when the live band is playing.

As I recall the drinks were reasonably priced and the place was popular.  They weren't open very late (at least on the weeknights) but it's proximity to my hotel and the rest of the strip made it the perfect place to have a relaxing and enjoyable pre-game prior to stepping off towards a late-night Vegas adventure.
