Diablo's is located on the strip in front of the Monte Carlo Resort & Casino.  They have a pretty extensive menu for a Cantina and definitely rival La Salsa, and TNT over at the Luxor.  Had the Calamari App and the Jalapeno side sauce was an awesome combination.  They offer Carne sandwiches which were pretty good and the Nachos were also quite good.  I have to say that even though the food was good I would prefer Lindo or Firefly if I was able to get off the strip.
