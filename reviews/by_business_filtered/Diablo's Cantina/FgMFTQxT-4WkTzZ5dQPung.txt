When I think of Vegas, I do not think of Diablo's.

The first time I came to Diablo's was a year ago. Had I written this review a year ago I might have given it three stars... alcohol clouded my judgment at that time. I was drunk, gettin crunk, and the music was GOOD the night I was there.

Fast forward one year, and Diablo's has lost a star. We came here because it was my friend's birthday and he loves this place. The crowd was, umm, unattractive. Sorry, but when I'm in Vegas, I want to be surrounded by people who want to live it up as much as I do, and when I say live it up, I mean, live it up in a classy way, and look cute. Anyway, this time, the music sucked, the drinks were lousy and the overall vibe was meh. Had I been drunk, I think I would have not only still given Diablo's two stars, but I might have left. Sorry Diablo's. Oh and your go-go dancers were BAD DANCERS. Needless to say, Diablo's made me feel like the hottest girl there, which is cool I guess. I don't ever want to go back though.
