Wow, really bad service. Ordered food to go but the bar was so busy that I could not stand at the bar and was told that I needed too wait somewhere else. REALLY WHERE? so I sat at empty table across from the bar and was YELLED at. I asked were to wait and was told to go to the bar...

No one there was happy with their food from what I saw (just my opinion ). 

Will definitely not recommended this place to friends.
