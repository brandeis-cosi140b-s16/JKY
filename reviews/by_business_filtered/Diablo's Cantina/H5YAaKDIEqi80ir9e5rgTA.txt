Whilst walking along the strip we were handed some flyers for $3 margaritas from Diablo's... well it would be rude to say no to that wouldn't it?

We ordered from their takeaway bar and were presented with two margaritas that both had a nice strong kick to them... we sat at one of the outside tables and the music was pumping in the place which gave it a great atnosphere and certainly pulled people in. I just wish we had spent more time there, i think it will be on my list for my next visit.
