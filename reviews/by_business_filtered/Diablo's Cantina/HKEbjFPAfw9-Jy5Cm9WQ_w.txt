Low-quality, overpriced Mexican food - some of the worst guacamole I've ever had.  Go for the fun atmosphere, NOT the food!  

Our waitress was really, really nice though, so they get an extra star!

They had a good bar atmosphere and a super slutty, girl who looked like a prostitute dancing on the front table, pouring shots into people's mouths - a couple of my friends partook, it was fun to watch!
