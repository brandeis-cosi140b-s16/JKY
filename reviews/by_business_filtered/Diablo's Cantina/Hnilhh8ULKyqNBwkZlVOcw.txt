The restaurant is only a couple months old, but it seems to draw huge crowds outside the back-end of Monte Carlo (which, for the place itself, is their front side.)  The theme (staffing & atmosphere) was cool, a little on edge but was different from others on the Strip.  It's harder to rate service when you're seated at the bar rather than usual table dining.  Our bartender was excellent, very nice and approachable, and even kept my credit card on her when I went to retrieve it after forgetting it 4hrs prior!

The cocktails are a bit far-fetched and somewhat pricey, and they don't even serve pitchers... what kinda bar does that?  Still, they have pretty decent imports on tap, which is nice because a pint is still relatively cheap for the area (6.50 anyone?)  The food was outstanding, at least from what we ordered (carnitas burrito and carnitas tacos[3]) came out hot and fresh.  From other reviews they charged for chips/salsa but ours was free... so I'm not sure if that's a table vs. bar thing or what.  We didn't know about the upstairs until when it became much later at night and saw a girls silhouette dancing around the top left corner of the 2nd floor.  We almost went back in there haha

Overall I'd say it was a good experience.  I'm sure they could improve the bar selection a little bit, but I'd definately go back again.
