Waited at the front for ten minutes and no one greeted us. We sat ourselves and no one came to wait on us. Husband went to the bar to get us a drink. Happy hour said 5 dollar margaritas and draft beers. We had a buy one get one coupon and paid $12 for our margarita and beer??? Flagged down a waitress who said we would need to go to the front and get seated. Food looked good but I didn't try any because we left. Didn't feel like waiting another who knows how long to get seated when there was no line and plenty of open tables on a Thursday at 3pm. I don't know why we couldn't have just stayed where we sat ourselves.
