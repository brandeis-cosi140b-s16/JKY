My husband did the hot wing challenge but wasnt able to complete it.  He loves spicy food and said the wings were really hot but not TOO hot.  He just wasnt able to eat all 20 wings that you have to finish to win.  

I ate a cheese quesadilla and it was pretty good.  Also if you get the coupons from the guy outside you can get pretty good beer or margaritas!
