This place is a good reason to get off your feet and have some beers/mexican food.

There really is nothing to write home about here, plenty of TV's a decent beer selection and mexican food.  I doubt anyone will go out of their way to go here, but when you need to sit down for a bit and that dude hands you the 2 for 1 coupon, well....you could do worse.
