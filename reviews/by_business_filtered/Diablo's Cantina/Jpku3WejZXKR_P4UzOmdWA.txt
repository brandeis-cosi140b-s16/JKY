Well I don't know about everyone else but I love this place.  My friends and I came here twice during our weekend getaway in Vegas for MDW and we had a blast both times.  The staff is super friendly and the food was good.  We didn't have big meals but the appetizers that we had were great and the food came out relatively quick.  We had a pitcher of the Sinful Vixen which is made out stoli raspberry, cassis, muddled fresh raspberries and lemon sour, well it was just to die for.  We came back the next day and they had all you can drink draft beer and a live rock band.  It was awesome and will definitely stop by next time I'm in Sin City! :)  DIABLO... lol
