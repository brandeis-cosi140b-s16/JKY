Holy Jesus!  The nacho plate is gigantic!  It could feed a family of 4. 
If you happen to be on the strip walking around, just out front of the Monte Carlo, check out Chuy's taco cart, a really nice value when food is so expensive on the strip.  Its a great buy when you are on the move from ummmm...bar to bar. Yeah Chuy!
