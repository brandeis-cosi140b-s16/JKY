Let me be brutally honest. I walked in here under the impression this was kinda the Mexican version of Olive Garden. I was not expecting much. As you can see from some of my other Yelp reviews, I LOVE Mexican food. Living in LA, I eat the real deal all the time.

The atmosphere is what you would expect for a Strip joint. Loud crappy music. Somewhat attractive employees. The usual.

We ordered chip and salsa to hold us over before our main food came. They tasted like Tostidos and Pace Picante. And they charge like $4! No free chips and salsa? Lame. Actually their bottled hot sauce wasnt too bad at all. It had a good kick and flavor.

For my main dish I ordered the "street tacos". Certainly these were nowhere in the same hemisphere as "street tacos" you get from Mexico. But they were actually tasty. Much better than what I was expecting. I think you could go to any random taco truck in LA and get better than theses for like 1/8th the price. But these tacos were not bad what so ever. $17 for tacos is a but nuts. Its Vegas though so what do you expect.

So yeah. Better than expected. I guess that does not say much when you expect everything to be horrible. lol
