We were gambling in Paris and we suddenly realized it was already past 1am. It was our last night and we wanted to go out so we rounded up the troops and started walking down the strip. The first place we see is Diablos, cover is $10 on Sat night, (cheap cover in Vegas) and the music sounded good so we decided to go in.
Got a table in there were go go girls on the bars giving free shots and all you have to do is tip them, it's a nice size shot too. Of course the guys were looking at the girls because they were gorgeous but so was I because they had zero fat on them.

They had a nice size bar and the margaritas were pretty damn good. 
The music was awesome, they played hip hop and rap all night. The dance floor wasn't too crowded, maybe because it was already past 2am and many are passed out somewhere.

I didn't eat here but it's a pretty cool spot if you're looking for something not so expensive.
