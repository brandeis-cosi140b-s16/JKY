STAY AWAY!! This place has shit service...and from reading other reviews..it seems to be a theme. We walked in off the strip and first thing I noticed was their neon sign "Waitress available sometimes" I guess made as a "joke" but it is the TRUTH! We waited over 20 minutes for a waitress and they walked back and forth past us..cleaning up other tables and bringing drinks..but NEVER Stopped at our table. We tried to catch their attention several times..but I guess they didn't want our business. We finally got up and left..just as good seeing the other reviews...this place has expensive drinks and food which doesn't sound too good either.
