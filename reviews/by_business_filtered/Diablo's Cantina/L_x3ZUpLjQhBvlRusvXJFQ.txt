Went with a group.  We all had the lunch "special."  This consisted of a chicken taco, cheese enchilada, and rice.

Girlfriends bite of chicken taco was a big bite of gristle.  Chicken was off looking in all the tacos and tasted poor.  Cheese enchilada was also of low quality.  Cheese in the center not even fully melted.  

Had the guacamole appetizer and it was ok.  Nothing special, but not outright bad.

Service was so so.

Bumped up to two stars since restaurant recognized the food was awful and did not charge for the barely eaten lunch specials.  

Advice:  Avoid this place if looking to eat.
