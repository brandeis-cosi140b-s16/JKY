This place is awesome, Dave the Bartender is amazing!!! If you see Seth the Bartender ask him for the Grandi Margarita he'll appreciate it!!!  

* Grilled Salmon is amazing
* Steak was amazing
* Bloody Marry is amazing. 

All around this is a great place to stop in. 
Pro Tip - take care of your bartenders and they will take care of you. 

Cheers
