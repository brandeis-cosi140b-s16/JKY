To be honest I didn't like this place.
First we walked in and asked if we could sit and order drinks and appetizers the hostess told us no only at the bar.
After asking for the manager she finally said yes but she must have told the server because he was very RUDE and didn't take care of us at all!

No drink refills, didn't pop in to see if we enjoyed the food he didn't even give us silverware till I asked!

I received the bill tipped the proper amount 20% and left him a note stating he would have been tipped a lot more had he just done his job! 

Thanks for the poor service we will never return!!!
