This place is fun and chill, doesn't feel like you are in a casino and has a good view of the strip.  We came at like 7 pm on a saturday and nobody was there, it was so hot though.   we just got some food and it was good, not worth how much it cost, but still good.  It's chill and nice nothing too special but if you want to eat somewhere on the strip without having to dress up or sit by noisy slot machines it works
