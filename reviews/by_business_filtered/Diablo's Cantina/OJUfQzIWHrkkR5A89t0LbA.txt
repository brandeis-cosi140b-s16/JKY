Not real Mexican food, more pub grub like. Poor service, waited ten plus minutes after ordering drinks to get water while our waitress socialized at the podium (in vegas during the summer, get a frickin clue). 
Food was good, although not true mexican. Service was bad though, main reason for the poor rating
