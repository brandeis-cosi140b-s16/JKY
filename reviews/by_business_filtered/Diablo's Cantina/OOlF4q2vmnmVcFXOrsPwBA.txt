Best Mexican food on The Strip. Maybe all of Vegas. A bit pricey by SoCal standards, but, hey, this is Vegas, Baby!

The stand-out meal is the jalapeno chicken tacos. The best I have ever had. We got a hint of the recipe and are going to try to make them at home. 

No margarita's this trip, but by the pitcher they are quite the value.
