We arrived in Vegas and were stating at a nearby Hotel. We wanted some Mexican food and stopped by here. They were playing the football games on every tv. It was loud but the games were good. We don't drink so we ate the food. It was good for America style Mexican food. The tacos were tasty but defiantly not authentic. My wife had the taquitos they were not the best but eatable. Had a good time the service was good and staff was friendly. Probably will try agin if ordering something other than Mexican.
