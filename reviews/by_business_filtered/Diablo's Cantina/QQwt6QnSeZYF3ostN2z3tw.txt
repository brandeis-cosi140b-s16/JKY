I've wanted to go here for years, so 2013 I finally did it.  It is a great, wide open atmosphere that is very energetic.  The drink prices were very steep, $39 for a pitcher of Margaritias.........OUCH!  However, all of Vegas is expensive considering the hotel lobby bars charge $9 for a Corona.  We got the Nachos and 3 grown men could not finish them, so the bang for the buck was good.
