Went especially for the Nachos and margaritas. There were two of us, and there was no way we could have, nor should have finished the Nachos. A huge helping, with no shortage of cheese and steak. 

Staff was very pleasant and efficient.  Music was mostly 70's era, which suited us fine. Loud enough, but not too loud. In general, however, the room was fairly noisy, making conversation across the table a bit of a challenge. 

Overall, a good experience, and we'd go back, especially with a larger group.
