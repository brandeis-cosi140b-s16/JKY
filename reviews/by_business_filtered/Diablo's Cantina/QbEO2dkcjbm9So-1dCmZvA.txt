I dislike most of the place on the strip. As someone who lived in Summerlin I rarely ever visited the strip, except for when visitors came in. Like most places along Las Vegas Boulevard, it caters to tourists, doesn't have discounts for locals and is overpriced. While the one redeeming quality is the unusual $10 Chupacabra spicy drink it's not worth making the trip too if you're a local.
