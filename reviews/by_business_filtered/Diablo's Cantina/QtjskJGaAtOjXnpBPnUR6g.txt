This place is deceiving! You think you'll have one hell of a time because of the large sexy devil woman statue on the top of building and the red hot neon spelling out the name. Well, as cool as this place looks on the outside it doesn't deliver on food or atmosphere inside. It's basically a sports bar covered in a gimmicky sin theme serving bland mexican food. The margaritas were weak and served in cheap plastic. If I'm gonna pay $36 bucks for a pitcher, I kind of think it should be served in a glass.

There was also a slight sickly sulfur smell throughout the evening. I don't know if it was from the construction on the strip or the exhaust from the numerous cars that sit at the streetlight in front of this  place. Hopefully that's not a common occurrence. Do yourself a favor and find another options for mexican food.
