This place is pretty cool. Their drinks are (for Vegas) reasonably priced, they have good food and it's a loud and rowdy atmosphere. 

The place is well decorated-they've got cool multicolored string lights that change colors around the bar area and good lighting/ decorations throughout the restaurant. 

Their guacamole is tasty--although a bit deceiving because it's served in this goblet that makes it look like there's a ton in there. Then, when you innocently try to dig to the bottom of the bowl, BAM you hit another layer of chips. Lies. 

They're expensive (it's Vegas, duh), but if you go and just order a few drinks and appetizers, it's pretty rad cuz you can just post up and people watch. Kinda great.
