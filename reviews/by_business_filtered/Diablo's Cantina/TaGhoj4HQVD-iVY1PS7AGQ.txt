We got free wrist bands and went 6/14/14. We started upstairs, which over looks the strip, directly across is Hard Rock Cafe. A friend bought "bottomless draft" for $25 - good until midnight. I asked the bar tender if there was a signature drink - looking for some fun recommendations but he pretty much just gave me their drink menu. (lost a star and a half - maybe 2 right there) Another friend ordered a bloody mary but didn't care for it so much as it was on the spicy side for her. I ordered "splash of sunshine" (or something sunshine) which pretty much just tasted like a screwdriver - although, I have had better tasting screwdrivers. The live band was good. We were going to head out after the live bands sesh at 12am, but as we were downstairs the music and dance floor was thriving so we stayed and danced another hour. Didn't order any food while there. Nothing at all to write home about - wouldn't make it a destination. If there had been a cover charge I would have taken away the second star.
