My husband and I is in Vegas celebrating my birthday and since he wanted to catch a little of the football game we decided to go to Diablo's Cantina. What a disappointment!  First off, the waitress was not very attentive as she was more worried about the larger group at the next table. Secondly, and maybe more important...the food and drinks were only so-so. We paid $13 dollars for a drink that was comparable to the free drinks you get at the casinos. Lastly, the waitress never came back with our change. Although my husband was giving that as a tip, I hate when they take it upon themselves to just take what's not theirs!  Additionally, our waitress sent another waitress to ask if we will be staying for the "whole game" as if spending $60 dollars wasn't enough to occupy chairs for an entire football game. Terrible service!
