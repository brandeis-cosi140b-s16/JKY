Okay WTF happened to this place, the last times I've been here it was great crowd, varation of music and no douche bags. This time around we had to wait in line and pay, there was numerous fights, the music was 100% hip-hop the entire 2 hours we decided to stay here and we only stayed here that long since I figured, chet we paid to get in, where staying for a few drinks. I don't think I'm coming back here again.
