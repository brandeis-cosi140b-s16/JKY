I wish there were more places like Diablo's on the strip.  You can walk right up to the bar from the sidewalk and grab a beer.  But like just about anywhere on Las Vegas Boulevard, it cost me $8 for a domestic draught.  That sucks.  The bar area is huge and there's plenty of seats.  Like a previous review says, the layout and atmosphere is fun and comfortable.  Music is going but it's not deafening.  I would recommend Diablo's for a rendezvous point to grab a drink, do some people watching and decide what to do next.  I can't speak for the food.
