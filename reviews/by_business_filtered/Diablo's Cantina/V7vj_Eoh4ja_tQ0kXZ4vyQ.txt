I'm torn between giving this place two or three stars.

I visited Diablos after swearing never to patronize the place (due to the way the horrible monstrosity now hides the front of Monte Carlo) because some friends were in town and had comps from their stay at that hotel. I had wanted to take them to one of the thousand better Mexican options in town, but that had to wait.

We were seated upstairs on the balcony overlooking the strip. It was the height of summer and a little hot, but the inside of the place was insanely noisy and crowded and it was quite atmospheric watching the strip traffic cruise past and letting my friends get a good look around the strip while we ate.

The food was OK and I would give the place 3 stars if not for the utterly obscene prices. You get more food for a third of the price just about anywhere else you go. You even have to pay for chips and salsa. Diablo's is - in short - a tourist trap.

Edible food and an Ok atmosphere outside, but even if they paid me to visit they couldn't coax me to eat in the chaos that is the interior of the place.

The outrageous prices tip this one down to two stars.
