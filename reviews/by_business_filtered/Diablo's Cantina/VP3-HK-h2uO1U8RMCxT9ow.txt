We were looking for a Mexican restaurant on the strip and since this place was next to the Monte Carlo Casino we decided to try it. We had a 10 minute wait which is ok since Vegas is always full of tourists..we get seated to our table....given menus....and we wait......and wait..no water..no acknowledgment..workers just passing by. While we are waiting, we take a look at the menu...and I'm amazed at how over priced it was. Now, don't get me wrong, I don't mind spending good $$ on good food but after seeing other patrons food and getting that odd feeling I get when I know the food is going to be sub par..I realized the only authentic thing in this place is the business name "Diablo"... So..all of this culminated in me and my partner walking out and looking for another Mexican resturant...which we found in Gonzales & Gonzales at New York New York.
