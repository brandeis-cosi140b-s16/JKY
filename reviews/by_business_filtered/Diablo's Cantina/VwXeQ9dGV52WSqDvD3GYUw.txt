Best place for Mexican food on the strip. The prices are high but that's what you get for eating on the strip. I had the steak burrito and my husband the steak tacos, both were amazing. I would skip the chips and salsa next time, it reminded me of salsa from the grocery store you get out of a jar. Avoid sitting upstairs in the bar area, your server will forget about you and you will be sitting there all night!
