This review is not on my first time here***

I work for a nightclub that is the owned by same the company that owns this restaurant, so I go here every month or so. 

I always order chips and salsa. Salsa is not hot, but come with hot sauce on a tray, so you can make it your own spice level.

For my entree I had the ultimate quesadilla. This thing is huge! It's Filled with cheese, carnitas, grilled chicken, and steak. Served with guac, pico, and sour cream (one spoon full of each, not enough for this beast). The quesadilla is so big you hold each piece like a small slice of pizza top with extra cheese and tons of meat.


Food comes out quick even when the restaurant is full. Everything tastes fresh as well.
