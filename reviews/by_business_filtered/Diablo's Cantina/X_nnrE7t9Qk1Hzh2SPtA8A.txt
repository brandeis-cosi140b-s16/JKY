I got the queso fundido (melted cheese with chorizo, beans, and topped with guacamole) as an appetizer and it was DELICIOUS!!!!! I got the chicken and steak fajitas and they were just a good! The waiter was very polite and attentive to anything we needed.. Great customer service! Definitely would recommend this place to everyone visiting Vegas :)
