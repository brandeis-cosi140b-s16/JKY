This has been one if the worst experiences of my life.
Met friends there 3 hours before Love show; waited 1.5 hours to be seated.
After another 1/2 hour we got our orders.
I had chicken casedia, $17, when I bit into second piece A LATEX GLOVE CAME OUT AND WAS HANGING FROM MY MOUTH.
After throwing up and cleaning up in the bathroom I came back, had some words for the 'manager'; his way of dealing with it was kicking me out, and threatening me with arrest!!!!!!
No apology, nothing. 
STAY AWAY!!!!
