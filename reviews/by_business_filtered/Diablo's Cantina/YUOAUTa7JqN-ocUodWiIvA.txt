Out roaming the strip showing some of the sights to a friend tha had never visited Vegas before. Decided we had a taste for Mexican and were a block away from Diablo's. Got seated in less than 5 minutes. Great rooftop type dining patio overlooking the strip, good people watching. Typical Mexican place, chips and salsa etc.. We ordered some margaritas and lunch. Everything was par for the course, nothing that stood out as superb but nothing that stood out as bad either. I would go back for lunch but there are a couple other mexican places on the strip with much better food if I wanted top quality Mexican for dinner(Javier's at Aria is one of them)
