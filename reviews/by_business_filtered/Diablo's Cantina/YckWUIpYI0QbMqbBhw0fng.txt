While out and about for my friends bday, we stopped in this place for dinner. 

I had the enormous nachos which was great! Others had burritos, quesdillas, etc. The food was pretty good, always pricey on the strip. The reason why I gave this place a 2 star was the service! 

Horrible customer service. Not to be mean but the server was trashy. Why does one need her breast in my face while I'm eating mexican food. I did not know we were at a strip club. I don't think she even smiled once. We waited forever for our check and although my friends stated clearly they did not want their quesdilla they order previously, she still brought it was made a big fuss. 

Oh well-
