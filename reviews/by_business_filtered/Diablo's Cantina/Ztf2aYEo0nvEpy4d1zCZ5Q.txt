Right on the strip! Lot of TVs and tables. Unfortunately the food is a bust. I usually like to know what I'm eating. The tacos I ordered had chicken, pork and cheese blended and fried. The sides were rancid (onions)! Bar area not bad. The frozen drinks not bad. I'm sure there are better places around.
