I'm being generous with the 3 stars here. This place looked pretty fun and interesting from the few times we walked by it, so we decided on our last day to have lunch here. The menu was pretty limited and nothing sounded overly fantastic. I had the cheese enchiladas and they were fine. I also ordered one of their specialty drinks which was fine. 

It was very loud and service was somewhat slow. It is probably a better destination if you're already a little intoxicated.  It was also kind of expensive for what we got. I feel very "meh" about this place, but it gets an extra star for location and atmosphere.
