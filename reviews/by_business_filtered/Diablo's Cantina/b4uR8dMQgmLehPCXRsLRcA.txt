They need to seriously think about hiring some new security guards. Some of them are just searching for stupid reasons to kick people out. They take their job way too serious and rely on the ridiculous amount of cops posted there to do the dirty work because they're some bitch made dudes. Rent-a-cop types. Im sure im not the first person to have a negative run in with the security there.
