On Mon/22 Apr about 6:30 pm we arrived here for happy hour, which ends at 7 pm.

PROS: 
- Great location adjacent to the Strip sidewalk (but that meant no a/c as it was an open-air bar).
- Doing a Yelp or foursquare check-in and you get a 2 drinks-for the price-of 1 offer (but you can't use the offer in conjunction with the happy hour drink specials).
- Veronica (our server) was quick and professional.  
- Their $18 combo nachos (beef, chicken, cheese) is good & huge and since me and my 2 buddies didn't want to overpay for anything else on the menu (eg $16 Diablo's jumbo burger), we ordered one combo nachos to share 3-ways.  Surprisingly, that + my drinks was enough to fill me up for dinner.
- In the "Vegas Seven April 18-24, 2013" free magazine on page 48 there's a full-page ad stating "Diablo's Cantina"
   - "$20 all you can drink draft beer 9 pm - midnight, live music, Thursday - Saturdays, No cover before midnight"
   - and "happy hour daily 3pm - 7pm, 3 buck drafts, well drinks, tacos"

CONS:
- Veronica had no idea what we were talking about when we asked for the happy hour "3 buck drafts, well drinks, tacos" but she said that there were $5 drafts and some other sub-par happy hour specials going on currently, and there would be additional specials for Cinco de Mayo the following weekend.
- So my buddies and I didn't get any tacos, well drinks or drafts as it wouldn't be $3/ea.
- Each guy ended up ordering a couple of the the regular-priced $9 Jack+Cokes and used the 2 drinks-for the price-of 1 voucher (so it came out to $4.50 per Jack+Coke) and of course the $18 combo nachos we split.
- Next time I go to Diablo's for their $3 Happy Hour or $20 AYCD draft beer, I'm bringing the magazine/ad to show the server if s/he isn't aware of the current promotional ad.
