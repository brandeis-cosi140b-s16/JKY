Sunday afternoon the place was packed and completely understaffed. The bartender was alone and had fml all over her face. She was yelling at patrons that she was the only one there and that they needed to wait for their $3 Jagger shots.  Terrible service from our waiter who completely disappeared after he took our order. The guac was great and big enough for 4 to share. The queso was probably some of the best I've ever had. Fajitas were also big enough to share. Good food, bad service!
