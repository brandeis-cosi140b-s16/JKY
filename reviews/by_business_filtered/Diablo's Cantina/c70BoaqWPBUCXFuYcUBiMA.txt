Very disappointing.  My friend and I had lunch at this place, and I wish we went somewhere else.  We decided to order the special appetizer of the day which was "chips and dip" but the dip was disgusting.  It was layered, the bottom being a layer of refried beans, then three cheeses, and a spoon of guacamole on top.  The guacamole was good, the beans were ok, but the cheese tasted like government cheese that you would find on an elementary school lunch tray.  Yuck.  For our main meal, we both ordered the fish tacos.  The fish was far from fresh, and I believe it was the cause for my tummy ache a few hours later.  The only good thing I had was the frozen margarita...and the only good thing about it was that it was frozen.  With it being hot as hell outside, that drink was a godsend.  Never again will I visit you Diablo Cantina...never again.
