My personal opinion:
This place has the trifecta. Bad food, bad service and overpriced. Expensive for what seems like cheap ingredients and poorly flavored food. For the cost I thought we were going to get big portions of great food...that didn't happen. We ordered the triple salsa appetizer... to which I would like to place a standing offer... Diablos, if you would like for me to come and show you how to make salsa properly feel free to message me.
