Food was decent enough, but Diego at the MGM is much better.  The service here was horrible both times I sat down to eat a meal.  It was impossible to get the waiters attention.

I ordered a Sol (Mexican Beer) the waiter bought a 7 oz bottle.  Not that I mind the smaller size but it would have been nice to have been told up front that they didn't have the normal size.

We waited a solid 15 minutes after the food was brought out for one of our party to get silverware. 

We saw the waiter 3 times total in a one and a half hour meal.
