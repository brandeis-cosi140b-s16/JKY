Don't waste your time or money here. 30 dollars for a Chupacabra and margarita on the rocks. Both were highly disappointing. We expected more from the Chupacabra, especially since it was featured on the tv in our upstairs hotel room. We took my margarita back and they upgraded to a Cadillac. Better, but still not great. Another member of the group ordered a blended margarita and was equally disappointed. Food was so so, and disappointing you had to pay for chips and salsa. Employees were nice, but try elsewhere for your money.
