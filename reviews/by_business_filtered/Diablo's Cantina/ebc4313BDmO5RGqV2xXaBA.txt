Cool place the jalape√±o margarita has a bite if you don't do spicy stay away from it had a Long Island ice tea a bit week for me but I do drink them most of the time. All of the nachos are all the same size BIG lol could feed 4 real easy. They make there own hot sauce told me a little goes a long was well I used allot the waiter was like that was not hot enough I said it was good. Thanks to Sean for a good experience
