So maybe its because I live in Texas, but this place just doesn't work for me. The mixed drinks are pathetically weak - if you're going to make a margarita, do it right. And the queso with chorizo is almost unbearably salty. Chorizo is already salty people, don't add extra! And the spinning happy hour wheel is a good idea, but the prices are too high. Happy hour should be cheaper than the norm, not exactly the same ($3 XX are nothing new, maybe in Vegas thats a bargain)

The bathroom has attendants?! Why? In this place? They have a whole damn pharmacy laid out on the counter. 

Anyway, I was not impressed, and it was crazy expensive for what you got - weak drinks and a small salty queso ($9 a piece for a margarita, $12 for queso), but the atmosphere was decent, so I'll let it slide with 2 stars
