Great place if you have a large group! It was super crowded on a Fri night, but our Bachelorette party managed to score 6 seats at the bar.  The bartender was really responsive and very funny! Drinks were stiff and good.

Food was okay! Don't expect authentic but it was good! Nachos were the best...Bummer part was that the guys (we didn't know them) seated next to my friends at the end of the bar actually puked at the bar (it's Vegas).  But the staff handled it well!
