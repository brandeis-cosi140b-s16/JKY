We came here to watch the playoffs. I made a reservation since I knew it was going to be busy. I knew everyone will be looking for a table to watch the games. The host told me not to worry and that my table will be ready. When I got there, I didn't get my table and we had to wait for the upstairs to open. This bar was not ready to host any big games. The bartender that served my margarita didn't make it right. So easy to mess up a margarita..  Food was ok. Regular bar food. They were not very accommodating especially when you have reservations. The hostess just sat everyone that walked in. She had no clue about playoffs Sunday. I should've just watched the games at the sports book in a casino. Atleast they give out free drinks!
