My girl & I came here from a recommendation from a friend. We didn't know what to expect. We thought it be fake Mexican food. I got the fajitas & she got the chicken nachos. We also got the guacamole & chips. The guacamole was freaken good. You can tell it is fresh avocado & it had such flavor. When the fajitas came out, the smell was really good & the carne asada was  so tender & flavorful. My girls nachos were HUGE like no other. 5 people can share them. The sauce they put on them was very good & tasty. What was good about her nachos was that they layered them so the whole platter had something, not just the top like every other place. The margaritas they squeeze real lemon in theres, nothing fake here. I will definitely come here again
