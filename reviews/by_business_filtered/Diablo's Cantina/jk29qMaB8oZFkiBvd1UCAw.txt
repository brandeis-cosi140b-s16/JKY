Diabloooooo my second favorite place to eat in Las Vegas. I love this place. Highly recommend sitting at the bar you'll receive wonderful service. Just this year I have visit Vegas three times during these visit eaten at Diablo about 3-5 times. Diablo is not a cheap place it's pretty expensive however drinks, and food don't disappoint and well most importantly service always excellent. I see people here complaining about the pricing, yes I agree with you guys I'm by no way rich but when the hangover kicks in I don't care where I go to eat. Haha. Well anyways visit Diablo try their Fajitas Steak Torta $18 along with michelada it won't disappoint. I don't agree with those 3 stars reviews!!
