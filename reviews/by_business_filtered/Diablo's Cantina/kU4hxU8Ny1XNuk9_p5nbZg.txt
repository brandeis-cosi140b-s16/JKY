I love the vibe in this restaurant, but the food & service is terrible! U have to pay for chips and salsa, plus I ordered extra salsa & they charged me for it. I asked waitress if there are any beer specials, she said the buckets of beer are either $28 or $35, I'm not sure? The food is blah... Portions are small.. Lame
