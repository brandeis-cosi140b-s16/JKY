Average restaurant. I drive by time to time and it always seems busy so I decided to give it a try. I came here on a Tuesday to try their happy our specials. $5 draft beers and well drinks. Plus discounted appetizers. Restaurant seemed clean and service was ok. The food wasn't anything spectacular and reminded me of Chili's menu. Main thing I didn't like was the room tempture beer mugs. I wished they kept the glasses chilled.
