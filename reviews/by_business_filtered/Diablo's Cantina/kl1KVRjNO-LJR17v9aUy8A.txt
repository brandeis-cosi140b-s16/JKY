$3 margaritas? $3 for 2 beers? I'll take it. People say it's watered down? margaritas aren't really my forte, so I'm pretty weak when it comes to it. We were suppose to pregame before going to the Minus 5 ice bar on the inside of the Monte Carlo, and we ended up eating. 

The appetizer platter is a meal in and of itself!!! Wings, calamari, potato skins, and something else can't remember. The bf bought me a yard of strawberry margarita...and I was drunk by the time we walked to MGM to play blackjack.

Friendly service, I'd come back, food was pretty good!
