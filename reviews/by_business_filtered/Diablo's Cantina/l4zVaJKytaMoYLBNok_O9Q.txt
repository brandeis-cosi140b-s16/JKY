Decent service, food slightly above average and satisfying.   everything is basically $17 + so for lunch maybe a little crazy 60 bucks for lunch for two, and 2 $8 draft beers before the tip.  I guess par for course for an on strip place. 

Be sure to check in on yelp and ask the hostess for the 2 for 1 coupon. At $8 per drink you need it.
