This place has a nice stage, Excellent food but expensive food. Drinks are very good here also. The club is of medium size and the sound guy is not the best. I like that it has no roof and overlooks The Strip. The Bartenders and Wait Staff are pretty good and look good which is a plus. I have always had fun and enjoy this place every time I go there. That is why I always help with judging every year for Diablos Rock The Roof! "PAN"
