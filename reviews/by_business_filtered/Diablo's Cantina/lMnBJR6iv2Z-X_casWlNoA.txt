Happy Hour Daily 4-7pm

Came in for happy hour and they were packed.  Good sign right?  Not really.  Their happy hour specials are $4 street tacos and $5 draft beers, margaritas and well drinks.  They also have a wheel of sin that they spin every 30 min with different specials on it.  It is mostly beer and shots.  Not really my thing.  We decided to just get a couple HH margaritas to go since there was no where to sit.  I ordered and paid at the bar.  The margaritas were horrible.  Super salty and gross.  Then a few days later I noticed my card was overcharged.  2 HH margaritas + tip was only about $15.  My card was charged double that.  Kinda crazy that could happen.  We just bought the 2 drinks and left.  Never had an open tab.  Eventually the charge fell off and the correct amount posted.  Seemed kinda shady though.
