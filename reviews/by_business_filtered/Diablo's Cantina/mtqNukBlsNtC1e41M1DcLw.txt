Great location for people watching.

On Tuesday night a group of 5 decided to dine here for dinner.  The Mexican food is unmemorable and very overpriced.  No one finished their entire meal.

There were only male servers on the floor that night.

The place was pretty empty.

There are better restaurants on the Strip to patronize.
