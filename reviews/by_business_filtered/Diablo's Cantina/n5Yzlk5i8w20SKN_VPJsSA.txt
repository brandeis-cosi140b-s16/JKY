Just happened to walk into this place and had an amazing Saturday night. The DJ was awesome and the drinks were well poured. Came back on a Sunday night and even though it was a more chill environment, we had a great time. Tony and Seth were our bartenders and they were awesome company. Would definitely visit this place again when I come back to Vegas.
