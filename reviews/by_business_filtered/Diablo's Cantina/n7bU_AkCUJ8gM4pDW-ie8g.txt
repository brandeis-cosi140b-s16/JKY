Diablo's is definitely a place you want to go to during your next trip to Vegas. After sitting there for a minute, I realized that I had already fallen in love with this place without even tasting the food. The atmosphere was cool and upbeat and the place was packed! Thank God for reservations. I wasn't that hungry when I got there and noticed the HUGE portions. Mounds of nachos, the hugest pyramid of guacamole, cocktails by the pitcher. I opted for an appetizer - chicken and pork taquitos. I also added a side of rice and beans. Deeeelicious! My friend and I ordered a pitcher of Sinful Vixen and yes, as others have noted it is AMAZING! Sweet but you can definitely taste the alcohol. Our other two friends weren't going to drink as they were saving up for one of those guitars full of liquor at the Rock House. Buuut once they had a sip of Sinful Vixen we had to order another pitcher for them! :) The only reason why this place is not getting a 5 star rating is because the service was a bit slow partly because of the flock of diners. I will definitely come back to Diablo's again and again though. I'll post some pictures later.
