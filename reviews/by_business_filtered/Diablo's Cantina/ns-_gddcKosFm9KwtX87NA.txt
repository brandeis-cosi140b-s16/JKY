I must say that for the location and atmosphere the food was a let down.I ordered the bbq pork sandwich and my friend ordered the tacos.  My sandwich had so much salt on it I was drinking water more then eating.  The tacos where cold, we had to send them back and I guess they were much better the second time around.  Great bar, poor food
