Sadly we came here to watch Mexico lose to Argentina (gotta support my people!). We sat at the bar as there was no more table seating available with a good view of the TVs. The bartender was really nice and did not give us attitude about not ordering any alcohol! We ordered what seemed to be very over priced chicken nachos. But these nachos turned out to possibly be the best ones i have ever had!! The plate was so big that 3 of us could not finish it all! At first we didn't think there was enough chicken but there was more hidden under layers of chips and cheese! 
So besides Mexico losing....it was great!
