We came here with our roomate since he loves it and we had never been. The food was surprisingly good, and the atmosphere was great. I had some tacos that were much better than I was epxecting, My boyfriend got the garbage salad, which he cleaned his plate for. Both also came in fun presentations--not something I expected either. We got the trio of salsas to start, which was pretty typical, and also had a lot of delicious VERY STRONG drinks. I'd go back, but I'd rather try other mexican places in Vegas before going back. I did like how the place was open to the strip, and the service was very, very good even though it was super-crowded.
