WORST place in Vegas to party.  I have lived in this city for 18 years.  All I can figure is that they have way too much business due to tourists and could care less about customer service.  Cuz there's no way they would make it in the real world.   Don't waste your time or money.  There's a million other places in Vegas that deserve it.
