The food here is amazing, BUT they're just way too many people here for the amount of servers they have. First off the receptionist told us our wait was going to be 20 minutes and we waited an hour... AND when we walked in there were about 15 tables completely empty. First she sat us at a bar stool table that had been empty the entire time we waited, when there was booths open. Then it took another 20 minutes for our server to get our drinks ordered. If you're VERY patient then come for the food, but if customer service is your top priority then don't come here.
