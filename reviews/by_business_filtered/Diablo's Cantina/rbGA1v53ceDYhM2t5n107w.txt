I dislike having to bash a place, but this place just... is lacking.   Lacking in so many departments.   We were enjoying a great day, and we were looking for a good place to go get some grub.   Mexican sounded phenominal.  

We walked in... weren't really greeted... just stood there and waited for someone to acknowledge us.  

A few minutes later... heyyyy... we were greeted and escorted to our seats.  We were sitting there for a while, gave us some time to look over the menu... and a bunch of things sounded pretty tasty.   

Our waitress finally came around, and took our drink order.   

And.. 20 minutes later... we were served glasses of water!  

We finally got our drinks, and placed our order for food.  

The highlight of my night was simply this.  Chicken Tortilla Soup.  A bowl of soup.  It was fantastic, the flavor was delightful, and really had me thinking that I was in for a great treat with my dinner.  

Until I got my dinner.  

A stuffed steak burrito.   Steak had little flavor, barely any sides of rice and beans... and well... I had finished maybe half of the burrito... and then just stopped.  

I was done with this place.   My drink was empty, my water was empty, and the food was sub par.. 

We got the bill threw some money on the table to make sure we were covered, and just walked out.   It was dismal.
