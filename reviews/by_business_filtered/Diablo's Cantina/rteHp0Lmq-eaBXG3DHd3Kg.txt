Pretty standard cantina/bar on the Strip.  Would probably give it 3-3.25

Pros:
1) Location - on the Strip in the Monte Carlo
2) Decent Margaritas & Nachos
3) Drink Specials (pitchers of Margaritas) at least they had specials when we were there on the Friday of March Madness
4) Great people watching - since the Strip is right there...so you see: bums, escort service ads on those mobile trucks literally do laps up and down the strip, hot girls, ugly girls, fat dudes who think they are awesome, old guys pervin' on chicks, street performers, families who think that it is great to bring their young kids to Vegas and watch their expressions, 

Cons: 
1) This place gets packed...but then again...it's a bar...on the strip....in Vegas
2) Bathrooms are not close....if I recall...we sat at a table literally overlooking the strip...and the bathroom was in the way back....which is typical in Vegas (reminds me of the movie Labyrinth with David Bowie [1986])
3) Because this place gets busy....service can be hit or miss.  We had a good waitress, but the table next to us...not as good....at least it appeared that way.
