The bartender at the walk up bar that faces the Strip was extremely unpleasant.

When your co-workers are handing out coupons 10 feet from where you're standing trying to get people to buy a drink, don't give customers attitude when they try to use the coupons!

Also, on Cinco de Mayo, don't say "Are you sure you want a margarita because I'm out of mix right now...do you want to order something else?".  Just get the damn margarita mix (since it would be too much to ask to actually make one with real ingredients).

The place looks cool but with a sourpuss like that working there, I'd keep walking.
