Weakest house margaritas I've ever had! They were way too sweet and not tasty at all. If you're going to call yourself a cantina, have decent drinks! The food is average, nothing special but it's ok. Basically people come here because it's right on the strip in front of the Monte Carlo. Not a must visit but a solid option I guess.
