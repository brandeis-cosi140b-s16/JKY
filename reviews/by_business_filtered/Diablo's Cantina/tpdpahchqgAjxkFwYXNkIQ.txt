Man was I disappointed in Diablo's Cantina. We went on a Thursday afternoon and it was so LOUD you could not even hear the person sitting next to you speak. They had televisions and music blaring at the same time. If you are not into that kind of noise for your dinner experience I would not recommend this place. Our server John was AWFUL. He would only speak to the male in the party and we got as far as order an appetizer. Never really ordered our dinner. The male in our party order a dessert and John asked us nothing just walked away and took our menus. At that point I was fuming. I don't deal well with men who seem to think women should be seen and not heard. We are in 2013 after all right? Our male excused himself from the table to use the restroom and we actually had to yell to get Johns attention as he was walking by us because he was bored in order to get our check. NOT A happy camper about this one and needless to say I will not be back to Diablo's cantina and I will make sure everyone knows of the experience I had there. We did speak to the manager and she gave us a round of drinks on the house (as I told her it was not needed but she felt like she had to do something after Johns obvious display of male chauvinist actions.
