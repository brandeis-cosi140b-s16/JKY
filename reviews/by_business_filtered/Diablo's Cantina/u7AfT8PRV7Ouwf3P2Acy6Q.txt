This place looked cool but the service was not.  We were a group of 6 and we were shuffled from one place to another becuse we were just getting drinks, but no one acutally showed us where to go, they just pointed and said "over there". Finally, we were given the option to sit out side but waited for several min and no one took our order. We went straight to the bar, ordered, drank our drinks and left to never to return. Oh we were staying at the Monte Carlo too.
