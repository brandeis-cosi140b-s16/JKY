Don't waste your time or money on this place!  With so many good restaurants and bars to choose from in Vegas, do yourself a favor and go anywhere else but here.  Steak burrito arrived pretty much cold; small $8 beer started semi-cold but was warm in a few minutes since it was served in a cheap plastic cup.  $55 for a cold burrito, warm beer, salad and an iced tea - give me a break!
