Friendly staff, great nachos and interesting drinks make this place a winner. Went on a weekday afternoon and it was almost empty. Tried to go back on Saturday night and I couldn't even get inside it was so packed, that's why it gets 4 stars. I walked to the next place and no problem getting a seat. Watch the people trying the hot wing challenge, hilarious!
