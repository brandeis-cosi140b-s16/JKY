Where do I start customer service here sucks!!!   I would give it zero stars but I cant. I came here with a group of friends on December 13 2014 we came in a  couple of hours on a Saturday night we all sat at the bar and therefore had to leave a card with an open tab.  We ordered a couple beers and an appetizer.  Our bar tender was a guy but later it got s little more busy do we were being taken care of by a girl as well. When it was time to pay I asked for out tab and said I would pay cash. So they gave me my card I never signed anything on my receipt because I payed cash, but the next day I saw they had charged my debit card I called and spoke to the manager and he said it would go away in a couple days ut was just company policy to charge the cards that were open tab. A week went by and no refund do I called back and was told they had to investigate the situation that would take a couple days and still nothing I called back and was told the same.  Long story short it is now January 9 2015 last time I spoke to John the manager he said he had authorized a refund and still I haven't seen my refund.   THIS CUSTOMER SERVICE HERE IS JUST CRAP AND IS BULLSHIT ALL I WANT IS MY REFUND I DON'T SEE WHY I HAD TO PAY MY TAB TWICE FOR YOUR MISTAKE!!!! I will never return here
