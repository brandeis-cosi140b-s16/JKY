Eh. It was just okay. The margaritas were not freshly made - they tasted like box margaritas from the grocery store. I was expecting so much more for $13 a drink. Not worth it at all.
Staff was nice - the waiter took a long time to come back after we asked to check out. 
Nachos were decent at best. Bigger does not mean better. Don't think we will be back.
