Went with some friends of mine from out of town for dinner here one night. Now I've walked passed this place a million different times and have always said i've wanted to go...well here's my shot. so we check out the menu outside while we're waiting for a table (took about 20 mins) and it's mostly a tex-mex style menu with plenty of good choices! We get sat at a table and our waiter was super friendly and nice, he took great care of us the whole time. I had the chicken fajitas with a "sancho" sized Sinful Vixen. OMG most delightful alcohol drink i've ever tasted, even had crushed fresh raspberries at the bottom. Overall a good experience, the food was good as was the drink. Prices are a tad high I think i paid about $40 just for my food and drink not including a tip. Definitely worth going to once and i'll probably go again.
