Nachos are absolutely ridiculously large. 5 people could share them for lunch. They are very good. Get the chicken and beef then add jalepenos. Mmmm mmm good. My mouth is watering just writing this review. 

Get the 2 foe 1 drink special too. Cause lets face it who has just one drink, especially in vegas?!?! They will also sell u a drink to go. Gotta love vegas.
