I've eaten here... well... I was going to say I've eaten here a dozen times but that would be lying to you. I don't want to start off our relationship with lies. I've drank here a dozen plus times. It's pitchers of margarita! How could I not spend time here?! I personally dig the one with the chilies along the rim of the glass. If you start every day of your Vegas trip here with your own personal pitcher then you know you're in for a good time. 
I have also devoured some of the food here. I've done burritos, tamales, nachos and probably a few other things as well. Ever feel like Shaggy or Scooby? This is the place to get your noms on. They have cool servers and bartenders... everyone is tatted up and pierced. They have patio seating and a huge opening on the front of the building so you can people watch the strip. It's Vegas! What's not to love about booze and people watching... and there is some great people watching to be had. It has a pretty central location and the entrance is right off the strip so you can stumble right in. 
Two of my fave things about this place are the snarky comments hanging on placards around the bar and the wall of fame/shame for those that tried the ghost pepper chicken wing challenge.
I can't wait to come back here!
I'm a fan!
