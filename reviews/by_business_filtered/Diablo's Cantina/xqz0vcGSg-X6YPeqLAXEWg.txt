Service here sucked asshole.  Admittedly, we were a party of 25 and completely befuddled the waitress by requesting the check be split into 12.  Seriously though, if it's that big of a party, why oh why would you only have one person attending that table?  We waited for about 30 minutes to even put in a drink order.  Then we waited another 15 to get drinks.  Then we waited another 10 to get chips.  After we finally ordered, we waited another 30 minutes to get our food.  Come on, people, get it together.

If service is going to be so consistently slow (as clearly it is from reading other reviews), give people chips and salsa for free instead of ripping them off for $4 basket.  Oh, and the three salsas that come with the chips sucked.  Two of them tasted like barbecue sauce and one just tasted like cilantro.  None were spicy.

The steak burrito with chili sauce was shockingly good.  The steak was flavorful and tender, and the chili sauce was spicy.  However, at that point, I was so ravenous that a steaming pile of shit probably would have tasted good.
