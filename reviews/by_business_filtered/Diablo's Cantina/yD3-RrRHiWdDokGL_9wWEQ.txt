I have been to Vegas quite a few times and always saw this place but never went in. This last time i went i decided to check the menu prior to going and everything sounded amazing. I convinced my group of friends to check it out as we were starving. It was quite a long walk from our hotel The mirage. However, was it worth the walk YESSSSS. hands down everything was delicious from their chips and salsa + guacamole to the entrees. I had the Carne asada plate my gosh was that delicious. We all tried a bit from each others plate and i must say nothing disappointed. Wish i lived in Vegas to go here more often will definitely come by every time i'm in town. The serviced was also great our waiter was so sweet and definitely recommended some good stuff.!!!!!!!!!
