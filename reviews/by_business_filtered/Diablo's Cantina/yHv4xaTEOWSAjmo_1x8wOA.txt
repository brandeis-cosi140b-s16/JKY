My own fault for coming in specifically to try the cuisine instead of realizing what this whole place was set up and meant to be...a loud watering hole on the strip with overpriced drinks and complete rip off prices on insanely small portions of food (somehow their margins have to cover that rent).

Paid $18 for the smallest steak burrito I ever had in my life. It was smaller than a $3 burrito you'd get at Taco Bell...almost embarrassing to put on a plate...and charge $18 for.

Walked out hungry because it also had to be a Mexican joint that won't offer complimentary chips + salsa.

Didn't get food poisoning so I added a star.

Total tourist trap and I share the blame.
