We happened to be on the strip to try a different place of dining.  Every time we walked by it smells so good so why not try it.  

We were greeted and seated immediately.  We had great service here with a friendly waitress and quick food delivery.  The dining area has much seating for the Vegas visitors with the bar located near the front.  There are plenty of tv screens around the entire place for a big game you just can't miss.  

We decided to split the Combo Nachos which had steak, chicken and cheese.  We were actually going to order something else when we were informed how large the nachos were.  She was right.  This could be easily split between two or three people.  Just because it was a huge portion doesn't mean it's great.  They were very bland to me.  I tried adding hot sauce but their only hot sauce available was burn your stomach hot.  Pretty disappointed. 

If you need a drink you'll be safe ordering here but if it's food you are looking for, I'd keep searching.
