On my second day in Vegas I already felt like a vampire. Having never left the casino since everything I wanted (food, alcohol, gambling) was right there in that compact space, the sun hit me like a Mack Truck on the freeway. We decided to find a nice bar with some sunlight in order to enjoy the near perfect weather Nevada had to offer in the middle of winter.

Diablo's Cantina provided that and more. Homie love Mexican food. They offer you chips and salsa but they don't tell you it isn't free but who cares you're already up a few hundred and you might as well spend it before you hit that hole and lose all your money and the deed to your kids. 

If you harass some of the non-mexicans out front that have cards for clubs and drink specials you can usually find a 2-for-1 offer for the place. The mexican card slappers all have cards for whores.
