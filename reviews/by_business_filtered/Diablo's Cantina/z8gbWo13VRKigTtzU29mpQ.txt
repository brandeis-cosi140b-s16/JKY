Went here to watch a world cup game during my stay in Vegas.  Through friends, I was told this is a fun place and that I had to go at least once. ..well yeah my one visit will be the only time I go.

Walked in with my boyfriend,  hostess takes us to a table near the back in a corner, with an obstructed view of the soccer game on tv...so we ask if we can sit at one of the other empty tables closer to the tv.  Waitress ignores our request so I went to the other hostess who said would have a table cleaned up so we could sit....10 mins later the table is clear.

We ordered a pitcher of the mangorita...it tasted like watered down mango juice!! I was so grossed out with it.  Had to switch over to beer since I didn't want to risk getting another watered down overpriced drink.  Didn't order any food, but if it's anything like their drinks then I sure didn't miss out on anything..
