This is a good spot to watch sporting events.  The ESPN Zone and other famous bars on the strip are too busy, but I found this place to watch my Chargers play before I left for home on a Sunday morning.  There's TVs downstairs and upstairs, so it's a fairly big place.

The food is pretty average and comparable to any other Mexican food chain like El Torito's.  Just come here for the sporty atmosphere.
