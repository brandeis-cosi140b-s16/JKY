I really enjoyed my brunch here this morning. My party of 2 was seated immediately at noon on a Sunday, but at the bar between two people (not a problem for us). Definitely a dive bar feel, with a friendly vibe. The $5 mimosa was poured strong and with pulp, just how I like it. The only reason it's not a 5 star is because I wasn't overly impressed with their food. Nothing wrong with it, but I wasn't tempted to lick the plate or anything...
