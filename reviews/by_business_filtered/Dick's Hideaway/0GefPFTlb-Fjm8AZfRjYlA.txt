This place was recommended to us, and it took a bit to find it (had to ask at the hardware store - they must get that a lot!).  But it was worth the hunt.  The breakfast dishes just blew me away.  We were in town for a week and went back twice, and try to hit it every time we hit town.  The carne adovada is probably my favorite, although I've had most of the breakfast plates and haven't had a bad one yet.  The best part is the bottom tortilla that soaks up all the flavors from the plate, and is a nice finish to the meal.  The black beans were great, not drowning in sauce like too many places do these days.  The benedict dishes were also great.  

Last time in town, we went there for dinner (first time).  Also great!  Spicy but not over powering, terrific selection of meats and sides to choose from.  The appetizers were excellent, good selection of spicy and non-spicy (not everyone likes it as hot as I do).  Definitely worth a return to sample more of the dinner menu  This is quickly becoming one of my "must visit" places in the Phoenix area.

Easy to to get to, but finding parking can be a challenge at times.
