We've been going to Dick's for years now.  Such a cool little secret.  Love: the small and intimate setting, the chickens being roasted on the open flames, the smell of pecan wood, fresh squeezed citrus juices, generous pours for drinks, friendly, patient, helpful staff, and the food!  Been there all times of day and the food is amazing.  Brunch is outstanding!  Love everything on the menu.  Do not agree with one writer here that it's too spicy, but I am a native having grown up on hot food.  Don't tell just anyone.  Let's keep it the wonderful secret it is.
