Heard from a friend that they had great new Mexican food so being a native of NM I had to go even tho it was a 45 MIN drive for us. The decor was eclectic and kind of cozy but right off the bat asked the waiter where the owners were from Wisconsin but they had spent some time in NM which had me a little puzzled but I was optomistic,. Asked for chips and salsa and they brought pico, and mediocre tomatillo. The green chili potatoes were supposedly their specialty so had to try that with our relleno plate even tho none of the Mexican dishes cane with it. The rellenos s had no spice at all very bland and disappointing. My son in law ordered the 45.00 steak which was the size of a silver dollar and not cooked to order. I could go on and on but all in all, won't be back.
