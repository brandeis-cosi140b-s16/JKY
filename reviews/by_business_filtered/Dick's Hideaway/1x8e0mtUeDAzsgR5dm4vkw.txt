The place is small. The door in unmarked but you can find it by the wonderful aroma of pork cooking. 

My favorite dish there is the Carne Adovada. Im drool ing as I wrtie this. 

It's my favorite breakfast whenever I come to Phoenix. 

Start with a plate of beans, potatoes. Top that with a heaping mound of tender pork. Top it with a fried egg and you wont leave hungry!
