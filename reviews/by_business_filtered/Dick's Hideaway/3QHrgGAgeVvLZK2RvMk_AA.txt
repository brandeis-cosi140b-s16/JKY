One of my favorite places to eat. Great ambiance-cozy but friendly and laid back. Food is incredible! I've been coming here for over 6 yrs and never left dissatisfied. If you want quality New Mexican cuisine, or just looking for a small, cool place to eat, find Dick's. It's the brown door without a sign.
