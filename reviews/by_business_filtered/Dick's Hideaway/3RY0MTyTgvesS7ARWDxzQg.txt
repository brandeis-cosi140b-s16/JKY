This is such a quaint place. It is tiny, but makes up for the lack of space with excellent food, drinks, and service. It just means you can be closer with the peeps you came in with. 
The New Mexico enchiladas are the most delicious and tastiest items on the menu. As a former New Mexican, it is nice to be able to come to a place that tastes like home. 
Stop in with a friend or two...it's worth it!
