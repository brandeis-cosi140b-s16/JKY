I have been wanting to try this place out with all the good reviews and the great pictures!  It is not easy to find, like some yelpers warned.  We drove by it at first, even with the help of the navigation!  I never even saw a sign.  I finally found it by the sign on the door about the unattended children that I saw on one of the pics!  

It is a pretty small place.  They have basically 2 rooms,  one a bar and a dining room so it is not that big.  It was pretty darkly lit but not too dark.  We sat at the bar which is also where they prepare the food.  It was fun watching them do their thing.  I was impressed that they grill over pecan wood!  When I saw that they had 2 skewers of rotisserie chicken I decided that was what I wanted.  I figured they had the chicken as an entree.  Unfortunately, the chicken was only for their chicken enchiladas!  What a tease!  They really should think about putting this on the menu.  I'm not sure if they cook the chicken every day, however.  Before we left they took the 8 chickens and put in a large plastic bin and, I assume, they would go into the cooler to save for the next day's chicken enchiladas.  I wonder how long they keep the chicken?

They have a pretty good selection on the menu plus quite a few specials on the chalkboard.  I had the grilled fish.  I think it was swordfish.  It was grilled over the pecan.  They also take half a pepper, put seasoned mashed potatoes on it and put that on the grill too.  Most of the orders that I saw had this on it as a side.  The fish was grilled to perfection, not overcooked which will ruin most fish.  Dry fish is no fun!   The salad was also very good.  

I was close to giving them a 5 star review but had to take away one for the chicken issue,  but 4 is still a high review! I'll be back!
