Best breakfast in Phoenix? Maybe. Regardless, the food was excellent! It wasn't cheap but what I would expect from a joint like this. The ambiance was incredible. The wait isn't as bad as it may seem but there is a wait. It is HIDDEN so it's not easy to find but it was a lot of fun once we found it. The service was good too. I'm definitely coming back here for a special occassion with my family or friends.
