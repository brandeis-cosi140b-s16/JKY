Dicks is a really cool place. We flew into Phoenix that morning for my sister's bachelorette weekend and wanted to start off with a good brunch with great mimosas. Dicks delivered both!  After finding it (the door isn't marked, it's a hideaway after all), we walked into a dark and busy-looking atmosphere that made you feel like you were a world away.  Our waiter was really awesome (I accidentally left his name on my menu but it started with a 'Th' and was quite different) and he gave us several good recommendations and top-notch customer service.  Food was really good and the mimosas were fizzy and perfect!  It really was a great find!
