i have been here a few times for breakfast and i always have the spicy eggs bene which i like this last week i took my brother and sister in law for lunch i was takin back by the prices (not that breakfast is cheap but lunch is a little over the top price wise) if i remember the lunch menu is in the 15.95 and up range .dont get me wrong i dont mind paying if the value is there i guess maybe the lunch menu basically mexican seems pricey service was good unfortunatley the beer was not very cold
