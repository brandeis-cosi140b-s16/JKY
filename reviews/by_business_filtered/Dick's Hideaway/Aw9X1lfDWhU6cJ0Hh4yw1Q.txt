This place is hard to find, hence hideaway!  It's inbetween Luci's and the hardware store. It's dark inside, but has a cool vibe. The service was awesome!  So friendly and welcoming. We ordered the carne adovada burrito and the enchiladas. All very good!  It's not a heavy greasy consistency like you experience in some other Mexican restaurants. Love this place and would return!!
