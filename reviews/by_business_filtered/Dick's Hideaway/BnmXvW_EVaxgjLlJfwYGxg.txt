Dick's Hideaway is the smaller and cooler version of Richardson's.  This place will forever have a spot in my heart because they serve brunch until 4pm every day.  Yes, you read this correctly, Every Day.  

When I lived in AZ, I stopped in a few times for drinks, but it took moving away and coming back to visit to finally come to my senses and order food.  Duh.

Happily settled in with my mimosa (scandalously on a Monday!) my friend and I enjoyed:

Carne Adovada Benedict  with hash browns - I cannot say enough good things about this.  The generous portion of delicious pork topped with two perfectly poached eggs completely hid the English muffins beneath.  I ordered this without the beans that usually accompany it, and there was still more food than I could possibly finish.

Carne Adovada & Eggs - more glorious pork, served with eggs (any style) and beans.

Roasted Garlic Plate - not quite sure what we were thinking when we added this to our (already large) order.  I was happy we did, though.  An enormous head of roasted garlic served with toasted bread, roasted chilies and cheese.  I was absolutely safe from vampires for the rest of the day.  

Our bartender/waiter was fantastic.  Handing me another mimosa before I can even think of asking for it will make me love you forever.  For-Ev-Er!

A word of advice.  Don't touch the plates.  No matter how badly you may want to. They are HOT.  Trust me on this one, OK?
