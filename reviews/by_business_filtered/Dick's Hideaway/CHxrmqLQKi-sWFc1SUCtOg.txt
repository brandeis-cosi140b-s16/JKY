So a group of us decided to get brunch here this am and boy am I glad I did. I started with a super killer spicy bloody Mary that came with a little beer chaser...awesome. I got the green Chile meat loaf with fried eggs. I can easily say this was among  the best meat loaf I've ever had .the texture was perfect, flavor deep and rich and it worked sooooo well with my over easy eggs. I can't wait to gio back and try some of the other stuff on the menu....awesome!!!!
