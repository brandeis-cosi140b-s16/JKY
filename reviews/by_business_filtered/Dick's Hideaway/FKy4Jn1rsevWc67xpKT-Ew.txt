Seeing previous yelpers having trouble finding this place, we were concerned. 

However, the address number is above the door. We stepped in, and we were immediately in a bar. The bar was packed with patrons along the left side. There were about three small tables along the right wall. There is NO place to stand and wait. It was rather uncomfortable for a moment while someone noticed us. 

There is a small, very dark dining room to the right as you first walk in. We were informed to sit wherever we like. This room had one very large table (room for 10 I believe), and two 4 tops. They had extra chairs, so they may be able to squeeze in more. NO high chairs. 

They do not split the dish, but they will bring out an extra plate to allow you to split it yourself. We split the tenderloin benedict. Omg. This was a dish with two 3 oz filet mignon, eggs, hollandaise, and a side of pinto beans and potatoes. The tenderloins were so amazing, we could cut them with a butter knife. The beans were so flavorful, I did not realize pinto beans could taste so good. The service was incredible. The wait staff definitely knows what they are doing. 

The food and service is 5 stars. The awkwardness that we felt when we first walked in brings our scoring to 4.
