The food is 4 star, maybe 4.5.  Really good food.  Quality and tasty.  I am not a fan of the "schtick": purposely hard to find (no signage, so you just have to find it using the address), and kind of a "f-off" vibe in the restaurant.  I can see how some would find that really cool, but it's just not my thing.
