Well, I guess the name was a hint to its location because it is indeed hidden. There is no signage on the street or even on the door and parking is limited (additional spots behind the building). It's located between Luci's and TEXAZ Grill. Look for the address "6008" over the black vertical-barred doors. You enter to the bar and a few tables and there is additional seating on the right through a short hall. You seat yourselves.

Our server arrived quickly and along with the bartender made a wonderful and friendly team. Service was consistently great throughout our visit and our water glasses were always full. I also loved the laidback and mellow atmosphere of the restaurant. Great spot for a date!

We came for brunch (served daily until 4pm) --

Spicy Chicken Tostadas ($9): Three tostadas topped with salsa fresca. The menu deceptively says mini, but the tostadas are as large as an appetizer plate and piled high with lettuce and marinated chicken. The chicken, although slightly dry, were flavorful and the tostadas were delightfully crispy. I could eat a few of these.

Carne Adovada Benedict ($14): Two poached eggs, English muffin, Carne Adovada, jalapeño hollandaise, beans, and potatoes. I was really excited about this dish because I have a thing for unique eggs benedicts, however, it was just okay. I didn't really enjoy the adovada as I could only taste the chilies. I liked the addition of jalapeño in the hollandaise. Beware: it's spicy!

Pasta Heidi ($16): Green chile linguine, grilled chicken, and chipotle cream sauce. This is a wonderful dish! The pasta was cooked perfectly and the sauce was delicious. It had the right amount of spice without being overpowering. A little on the heavier side, so it doesn't hurt to share the plate with someone else. Highly recommended!
