Would have liked to have 4-1/2 stars available!  The New Mexican Platter was great - one on our party exclaimed, best "Mexican food ever!" The New Mexico EnChiladas were disappointing - closer to a 3 maybe a 4.
Service was friendly, helpful, and interested in our experience.  No refills on the Coke, kind of a bummer - just 1 10oz bottle that goes quickly with spicy food.
