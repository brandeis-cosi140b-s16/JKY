Oh. Mah. Gah. So delicious!

Sure, it's unmarked, and therefore difficult for an out-of-towner like myself,  but it's well worth the effort. The green chile and eggs was amazing! The pork was amazingly tender, the chile spicy and full of roasted flavor, and the eggs were perfectly poached. Come hungry, you'll need the space and want to eat every last bite. I've also had the Fish Trio. The wood-fired grill adds significant flavor to three large portions of fresh fish (mine were Mahi-Mahi, Swordfish, and Salmon), but the flavor pack was in the salsas - a Mango, a Pineapple, and a Red Roasted one. The fruit ones had a nice balance of hot and sweet. The red roasted one was smoky, savory, and spicy without overwhelming. My Bloody Mary was solid, not particularly boozy, and the mix was more on the good spicy, homemade side of life than on the straight outta a bottle grossness. The accompanied shot of beer was much appreciated - Is this an Arizona thing, cause if so, I want to move here.

The atmosphere is quirky - think "No Kardashians" and "Unattended children will be given an espresso and kitten." It's cozy and intimate for lunch, and I can imagine it'd be super crowded at dinner. Service was excellent without any issues.
