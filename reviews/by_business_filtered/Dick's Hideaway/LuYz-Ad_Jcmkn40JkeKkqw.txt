I'm sure that the lunch or dinner entrees are better to spend the money on, but I have only eaten there for brunch. I personally believe that spending $15 on eggs, a short stack, ham and a glass of diet coke (and the refills are not free) is pushing it. The food is ok, but unfortunately, the food is better at somewhere like the good egg or similar.
This place is not worth the cash for breakfast.
