Searching yelp late one weeknight after work because I was burnt out, slightly hormonal and didn't feel like cooking, there didn't seem to be much open at 11pm that was "open now", but Dick's Hideaway popped up and the reviews were intriguing.  I had to go.

So we went, knowing there was no sign and we'd have to look closely to find it, and sure enough we almost walked right by.  But once inside we were delighted.  A crackling fire with real wood burning, thick wood top tables and bartop - it was quaint but very small and the thought of it being shoulder to shoulder people at happy hour made me twitch - it just wouldn't be my scene.  I like peace and quiet and elbow room too much. It was perfect that we had just missed the busy time of night and had the server's full attention.  We asked some questions and got the history of the tiny hole-in-the-wall place as a former overflow outlet from Richardson's restaurant which burned down in July of 2009. 

Their menu was a bit overwhelming for me, with all of its New Mexico style food (because I wanted one of everything!), so the server brought us out an appetizer plate that wasn't even on the menu. 3 large bacon wrapped scallops, seasoned and blackened without being rubbery or overdone with rice, beans and 4 different sauces.  The flavors were distinct and each one was very different from the others.  Layers of flavor!  I fell in love. I didn't even need to order anything else (eyes always bigger than stomach).  I need to go back soon and try some of the stuff that actually ~is~ on the menu, but I'd like to catch it at another "off" time, when it isn't so crowded or noisy.
