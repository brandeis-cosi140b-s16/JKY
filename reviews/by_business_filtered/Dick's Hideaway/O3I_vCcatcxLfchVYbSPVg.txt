We love eating breakfast out with our group of friends, so we chose this place becuase of its' wonderful review in the Arizona Republic.  

It may be wonderful for lunch or dinner, but we had by far the worst breakfast and the worst service ever experienced in the Valley.  I might note that we arrived at 7:30AM and were by ourselves in the dining room.  You would think that because we were early the service would be wonderful.  Not so!!  We had to go and find out waitress to refill our coffee.   She served toast but forgot to bring jelly to the table.  Everything we ordered was either wrong or undercooked.  One person in our party sent her food back to be cooked; the other was so disgusted with the appearance of the raw eggs (in her omelet) that she chose just to eat the toast and forget the eggs.  

The "special" that day was a crab omelet.  Unfortunately the omelets that we ordered tasted like fish, whether we wanted it or not.  (We didn't)  

We had a very hard time locating the restaurant, and would have been much better off  if we had never found it and went somewhere else.

Terrible experience!!
