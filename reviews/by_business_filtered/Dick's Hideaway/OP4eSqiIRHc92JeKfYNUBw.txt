I am shocked and amazed to find that I did not write a review for Dick's Hideaway.  This place is so good I had three meals in a row here, and I would gladly do it again.  Not only are they open for my odd hours with incredible food, but if memory serves, they have actual draft rootbeer.  

When in town, highly recommend ya drop by... if you can find the door... :)
