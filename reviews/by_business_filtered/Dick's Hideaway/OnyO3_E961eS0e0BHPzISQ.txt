Thanks to the tips from other Yelpers, we rolled right up to the unmarked double doors. Hidden next to a coffee bar is little gem of a restaurant...and I mean little. My boyfriend and I got there around 7 on a Saturday night and shared a large table with another group. 
We loved the ambiance, and their no nonsense attitude, and the food does not disappoint! We started with a bowl of posole, then I got the sea bass special, and he got the gumbo. It would seem that everything on the menu is ridiculously fabulous! We will definitely make this a regular spot for us.
