The place is hidden, and has arguably the best breakfest food in the area

What to get:  The Tenderloin Eggs Benedict (you can skip the pork and tenderloin and go straight for all tenderloin), and I would recommend subbing out the potato's for fries (usually they will do that if the fryer has time to get to temp, aka not at 7am but probably at 8) - That is the best item hands down on the menu, not cheap but if you order that you will have zero question why everyone rates this place so highly

Other excellent items:  Chille Relleno's - add one on if you arent 100% sure you want them as an entire order, they are fantastic

The Meatloaf if very good, it does sound a bit strange to get, doesnt beat filet at 8am, but is quite good

Adovada is also fantastic, very good heat and is worth a go if you want something on the spicer side

Mimosa's are $5 in the morning as with Blood Mary's - and their orange juice is always fresh squeezed
