It is hard to find. That's the only negative thing I can say about this little gem. Food was excellent, as was the service. Clean and cozy atmosphere. We were traveling on business and tried this place on the suggestion of a local. Needless to say I ate here every day I was in town, and again the following year when we traveled to the Phoenix area for a convention.  Well worth a long drive to get to. That is all.
