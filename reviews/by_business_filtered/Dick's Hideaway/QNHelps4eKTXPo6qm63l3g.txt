Brought a foodie friend here for brunch. I had the Benedict Combo and my friend had (upon recommendation from a brand new waitress - apparently it was her first day - I'll forgive her mispronouncing adovada as avadova as she was very sweet, but please get to know the menu!) Vic's Green Chile Meatloaf and Eggs. The meatloaf was ok, but she said she wished she had ordered Rellenos or the Carne Adovada instead, and she raved about the jalapeno hollandaise and the tenderness of the beef tenderloin that the perfect eggs Benedict sat upon (I always share). Still loved the ambiance and the service was lovely.
