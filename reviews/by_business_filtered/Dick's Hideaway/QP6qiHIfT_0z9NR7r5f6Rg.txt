Dick's Hideaway is definitely hidden, but once you find it, you will enjoy it.  Stopped in for breakfast and had the combo Benedict (pork and beef) with jalapeno Hollandiase it was excellent- just the right amount of kick.  If you want something spicier they have plenty of items on the menu with red and green chili.

The waitress was helpful, friendly and attentive.  Breakfast with a kick and a smile.
