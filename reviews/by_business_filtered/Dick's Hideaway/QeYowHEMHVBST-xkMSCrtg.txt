OMG I LOVE DICK'S! Wow that sounds bad, but it's so true! On New Year's day, we went for brunch and it was utterly delicious. I had the Dick's combo: two chicken enchilada's, a jalepeno egg benedict and asparagus with hollandaise sauce ($15). It was all so flipping good! My man swears by the breakfast burrito with chorizo, and his ma got Huevos Ranchero's. Everything looked amazing and smelled so good! I wish I could eat Dick's every day~!! Dick's Hideway of course!
