This is probably my favorite place in Phoenix. When me and my husband need a quiet night out we go here and find a quiet place at the bar. We love being able to watch them cook and they have a great wine list. If you go, you will smell like smoke when you leave, but i love that woodfired smell and don't mind it at all. It's a seat yourself place, so if you see a seat grab it and don't be picky. You can't go wrong with the carne adovada but you can go wrong with the salads. Stick with the good stuff, this isn't the place to eat healthy.
