Walking into the joint, I thought I was going to love it. The small space (3-4 tables and 7-8 bar seats) and aesthetic of the room screamed "my kind of place!" We grabbed seats at the bar (the only open seats at the room) and immediately ordered a couple beers. Bueno.

The food, however, was no bueno. The chips and guac were disappointing (never a good sign). Chips need to be thick to stand up to guacamole's weight. These were thin and brittle. The guac had a pretty middle of the road flavor - nothing to write home about. My entree was the pork enchiladas and they were just a goopy, greasy mess. The meat tasted pretty fatty and didn't have any real flavor to offer besides oily. The 1:1 ratio with the super oily cheese wasn't helping any. My dad had some kind of fish dish which inspired the dreaded "This tastes weird. Here, taste this. Does it taste weird to you?" exchange. My brother reports that his skewers were also pretty blah.

Maybe we caught them on an off night?
