Consider finding this review the equivalent of finding the front door to Dick's Hideaway. This restaurant definitely lives up to its name. Everything about it is hidden! The front door? Don't look for a sign. The true regulars know what door leads them to Dick's. The back entrance? Don't expect direction. Those who need to know where the back entrance do, and those who don't will walk around aimlessly until they find the front door. How about the bathroom lock? Don't worry, you won't have to go with an unlocked door, but it will take you time to find it...hint: it looks like a metal rod that's a part of the door. 

One thing Dick's doesn't hide from you is the quality of their food. Completely delicious. I don't think you can go wrong with anything you order here. The enchiladas melt in your mouth, the chips and guac are good (ask for the flour chips-- thanks Aileen!) I went for the New Mexico Platter and all I can say is how! I was given a rellenao, chicken burro and tamale to try. Yes, it all kind of blended together but only because every bite was just as delicious as the next. It's spicy, it's cheesy, it's creamy, it's sassy (yes, I said sassy!)...it's just delicious. I tried my hardest to finish the meal but I only got maybe half way through (maybe less). It's a LOT of food and you could easily share. 

Now be warned before you visit, this is a hideaway and that means, it's not big. Originally, there used to be maybe room for 15 people total. But now they have a room that fits about 30 more and it's perfect for a large group, but be sure to make a reservation!
