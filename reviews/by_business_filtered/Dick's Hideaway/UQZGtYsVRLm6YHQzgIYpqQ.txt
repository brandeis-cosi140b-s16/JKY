People what are you thinking with the high ratings here? This hole in the wall has very limited space on the bar side and we waited at least 45 minutes for a table. Once seated at a table I felt I was going to fall on my ass BC of the wobbly stool.
The place is super dark so you can barely read the menus or see what your eating. 

I ordered the New Mexican platter at $16.00 - tamale, chicken burro enchilada, chili relleno, rice and beans. The chile relleno was so tough I couldn't even cut it with a knife. I had the waitress take it back and the cook said that's the way they are! 
My tamale was mostly corn and I've had better at Costco's free samples on weekends and the chicken burro was dry. For the money they charge here i thought my dish was overpriced and lacked taste & quality. With all the authentic Mexican Restaurants in Phoenix I would suggest going elsewhere for comfort and taste. The best thing here was the Stella on tap - ice cold! The service here was good but I felt sorry for the waiters and waitresses BC I saw at least 3 party's leave BC they didn't want to wait. 

I would not return here again - overpriced and overrated!
