Wow! This place is fucking amazing! I didn't expect to eat some bomb ass  green chile verde stew w eggs and home made ass tortillas like I did here! They never left my 30 glass of ice tea drinkn ass empty and the food tastes like your eating at ur MexicAn grandmas house in the 80s.

Outside of the amazing ass food, the vibe is wonderful, the decor and feel is clean and welcoming. This shit should be a chain. As many shitty spots I've been to in my life, this week has been good to me. 
  Do yourself a favor and go eat brunch here. Seriously, or
Go fuck yourself!
