My first time getting to the hideaway and it's marvelous and dark and mysterious inside! It's actually kept dark all the time including breakfast. They have an awesome happy hour time - majority of the day. The food is quite fantastic hitting taste buds you never knew you had. The seating area is small and you might actually feel claustrophobic so keep that in mind. The bathroom is a co-Ed single person option. Please also note you walk through part of the kitchen to get to the bathroom, kind of makes it unique ! Portions are hearty and full of flavor and well worth the penny. It's a must try for your southwestern taste buds and cravings! Enjoy the specials as they are fresh and fun. Please also spot the humorous signs throughout hidden gem! It's a must try with fun cocktails and great staff!
