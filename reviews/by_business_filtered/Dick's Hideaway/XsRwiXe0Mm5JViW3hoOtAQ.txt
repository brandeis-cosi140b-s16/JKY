What can I say that hasn't been said.  We tried this place based on Yelp reviews.  It was so good we came back the next day for happy hour.  First breakfast:  I had the chile rellenos platter.  You have a choice of fillings.  I chose cheese and the a choice of red or green chile sauce.  I chose both.  Loved them both for different flavors.  Hubby had huevos rancheros.  Also excellent.  I ordered a Bloody Mary which was seasoned perfectly and it came with a beer back which I've never had before but they fit together perfectly.  We came back the next day for happy hour (7 days a week) and had the small plates.  Very tasty and easy on the wallet.  The bartenders are very nice, make you feel welcome and take care of your every need.  This 
place is not for everyone.  It really is hidden away ( no exterior sign).  Inside is dark and kinda seedy looking but I think it adds to its charm.  On second thought, don't go here.  I want to make sure there's room for me on the bar stool.
