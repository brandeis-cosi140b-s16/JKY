I definitely had a hard time finding this place, hence the name. I actually drove around twice thinking I missed it since I didnt see a sign. 
We sat at the bar since all tables taken. I had the garlic plate, which is always my favorite at richardsons. We also tried the scallops which we'd recommend. Friendly staff and overall inviting atmosphere. Try out the bathrooms- located thru the kitchen... kind of interesting and unique.
Will come back!
