Absolutely amazing. Dick's Hideaway is one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix. It's very hard to find if you don't know where it is, however. It is a very small place, as there are only a total of 4 tables other than the private party room.

The blackened swordfish is DELICIOUS. Along with the fish, you get jumbo shrimp, vegetables, and the best part. The best part I refer to is the twice baked potato over a VERY spicy green chile. I like spicy food, and it was very hard to handle this pepper. And then after you finish your plate, you discover that it was all on top of a tortilla which has soaked in all sorts of flavor from your entree.

I strongly urge everyone to try this restaurant.
