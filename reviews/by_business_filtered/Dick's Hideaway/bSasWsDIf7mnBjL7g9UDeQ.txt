Pretty much the best breakfast/brunch I have ever had.  Chile rellano was unbelievable and who doesn't love one for breakfast.  Wife had the breakfast burrito.  It was great.  It had broccoli and asparagus in it.  That doesn't sound great but it is.  Also, beans were tasty.  They did have an extra vegetable charge and didn't put tomatoes in the burrito, but it was so good we didn't care.
