Totally hidden!  We almost couldn't find the place if not for fellow Yelpers!  Thanks to the tip that it's next door to Luci's.  The restaurant is pretty much unmarked from the outside and didn't even look open when we came in for brunch on a Sunday.  

Adorable place with lots of cute nooks to sit in.  One booth back by the bathrooms has it's own TV set into the wall.  

Lots of unique things on the menu for brunch.  Southwest twist on your usual breakfast/brunch items including meatloaf and eggs and eggs benedict with jalape√±os.   My friend, who is not an adventurous eater, got the pancakes, which were a bit rubbery.  Otherwise, the food was good!

Since we were coming for brunch, there was parking right out front.  May be an issue with parking if it got busy in the evening, not sure.

Bottom line: cute place with yummy food... if you can find it!
