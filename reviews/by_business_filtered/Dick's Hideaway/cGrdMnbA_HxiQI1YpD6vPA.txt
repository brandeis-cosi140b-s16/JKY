Hidden away it is!  I forgot where it was located (some friends drove me here and I was not paying attention as to how we arrived).

The interior is funky, dark, and small (cool copper counter tops) but that just adds to the character.  I ordered pork enchiladas(?) and shared the sauteed garlic dish (i think that's what it was)?  It was very yummy and left me wanting more.  The only downfall was that the garlic must have gotten into my pores b/c I felt like I smelled of garlic for days!  It was well worth it though and a spot you should certainly check out.
