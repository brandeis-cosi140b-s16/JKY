This truly is a "hidden gem".  We went there with friends not knowing what to expect because my husband is a Phoenix native and had never heard of it.  It was hard to find because it does not have a sign which I guess is part of the ambiance.  It turned out to be s great find.  I had the Chimayo Chicken which was absolutely amazing.  Everyone else loved their meals.  We will definitely go back.
