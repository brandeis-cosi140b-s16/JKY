Either you get it or you don't...if you don't get it don't Yelp about it.  Dick's is a Central Phoenix staple. Great southwestern food..great quick service with a little bit of an attitude which is good..if you don't like tight dark spaces, spicy food and service with a little bit of attitude Dick's isn't for you.
