It's been about a year since I've been here but it still stays very fresh in my mind. 

The food is what stands out the most. It was unbelievably delicious. All the food i had was amazing but the Carne adovada was truly the best I've ever had. I will come back every time I'm near phoenix for this alone. 

The service was friendly and quick. 

The atmosphere is comfortable but only seats a small amount of people. the bar is where both drinks and food are made so there is always something to see.  just don't let the lack of a sign outside fool you.
