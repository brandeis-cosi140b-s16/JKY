Let me start off by saying my husband and I absolutely love this place. In fact it is one of our most favorite spots in phoenix. The happy hour here is phenomenal. Love the cheese dip, shrimp scampi and the chile rellenos. Definitely authentic mouth watering New Mexican cuisine. So why am I giving this four stars? Only because it is such a small restaurant and most of the time the back room is being rented out by private parties. Also definitely not a kid friendly place which is a total bummer for us because we have a newborn and no babysitter to leave our little one behind with which means no more dicks hideaway :(...however this will be our first stop when we get a night out.
