We were looking for Richardson's, and parked where it used to be.  I know they reopened after burning down a few years ago, and I've been looking forward to the garlic plate for a long time.  Turns out Richardson's was about 3-4 blocks up on 16th street, not at the corner in the strip where it used to be.  We ended up just going into Dick's, since it's all owned by the same family.  And parking is tough there, we didn't want to move from the parking spot we were lucky enough to score!  I've never been inside before but it was perfect for us, very cozy and intimate.  We were just stopping in for a light lunch on our way to our staycation.  We got the half garlic plate and the skewers.  It's not a lot of food but oh my God, how delicious it is.  I wish we got the full garlic plate.  The elephant cloves were smooth and creamy and the perfect base to the peppers and cheese that we piled on to our baguette bread slices.  The skewers were delish--they came with a shrimp, a sausage, a beef and a chicken (I think?) and the salsas and sauces all complemented them very well.  Not a cheap place but very much worth it for a special occasion.
