Not as good as the high reviews. Pleasant enough service, great hours, pretty nice inside. No complaints at all just thought the food was average.

Carne adovada - most popular dish here. Well smoked with good sauce. Sauce however doesn't put the whole dish together. Rice, beans and tortilla come with it, just really heavy and you really just get one flavor with this meal. Not overly impressed. 
Pretty pricy for the area as well.
