While waiting to be seated we peaked at the menu on the door to Rokerij (their sister restaurant) and almost wanted to eat there! Then we checked out the specials for Dick's and wanted to eat those NOW! The smell and the descriptions of the dishes got us really excited especially considering the number of people waiting to be seated at this tiny signless joint.

I ordered the salmon special with shrimp chipotle sauce. It was garlicky and buttery and spicy and somehow incredibly light. The carrots and broccolini were cooked perfectly and chef's chipotle twice baked potato was genius! Instead of a potato shell they used a roasted poblano chile. I am totally stealing that for my next dinner party.

My boyfriend ordered the New Mexican plate which was an extraordinary amount of food. I tried a bite of the masa and for me it was too dry, but the spices were excellent.

Next time we will hit up Rokerij for their small plates.
