I really dig this place.  Though I've only been here once, it has a cozy atmosphere, dim lighting, and good music.  The bartenders were attentive & what's more .... they have CHIMAY on tap!  I haven't tried the food yet, so can't comment on that.  Bonus points for being close to where I live.  I think I will be making return trips to this neat little hideaway.
