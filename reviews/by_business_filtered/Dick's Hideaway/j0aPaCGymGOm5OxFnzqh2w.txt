Dick's Hideaway... it was an adventure here!

So technically we made two stops in here on Friday night.  When we first walked in, it was crowded!  So we made our way across the street for a drink before popping back in because after having a great Bloody Mary with dinner and seeing how this place boasts about having a "top rated Bloody Mary in the valley," I couldn't stop thinking about Dick's!  Plus the Persian with us wanted a crème brûlée so we came back.  The bartender even recognized us!

While we awkwardly stood around waiting for some chairs or a table to free up, the bartender came by and asked us what we wanted.  A Bloody Mary and a crème brûlée was ordered and I was soon handed my lovely drink along with a small glass of Hair of the Dog beer on the house.  Sweet!  After being bullied into chugging this tasty and smooth brew, I was buzzed.  Even though I might have been a little intoxicated, I still found myself underwhelmed by this "top rated" Bloody Mary.  Whaaat!?  I had a much better Bloody Mary like one review ago.  Get on their level!

Kazi H. and I were soon to be escorted to two stools at the bar while the gentlemen we were with still stood awkwardly by the door.  What were they talking about?  My love and I cracked into a nicely caramelized shell and dug into a creamy custard.  While not the best crème brûlée ever, I still found myself stealing more and more bites of her abandoned brûlée.  More for me, yay!  And then some more stools freed up and our crew came to sit with us.

So the adventure?  Kazi and I stumbled into the private, dark, adjoining dining room to use the restroom.  Let's just say that two girls entered a bathroom with a shower included.  Much shenanigans.  As we made our way back to the bar with her iPhone lighting thew way, we were told that there was another bathroom.  Oops.  Thinking about Dick's makes me smile.  :)
