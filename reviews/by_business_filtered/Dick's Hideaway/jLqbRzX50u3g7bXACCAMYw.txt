Had a delightful brunch here today! 

Service  = Excellent

Food = Tasty!  My husband and I love the New Mexican influences found in each dish on the menu.   Today I got the Carne Adovada Benedict.  It was awesome!  Only complaint (minor) is that my hash browns were slightly undercooked.   I'd requested extra crispy, but it was definitely not the end of the world as I still loved my meal.   My husband had the Chicken Burrito which was also good but I could tell it wasn't his favorite item from Dick's.  Good to know for next time :)

Ambience = We sat in the back room behind the bar area this time.  It seemed like a nice idea at the time but there was another patron there who was literally laying down in the booth on the phone talking business for a few minutes.   It was even more awkward when she randomly got up and insisted that she and her other guest (who had not arrived, yet) were going to sit at the formal dining table for larger parties.  The staff handled the situation professionally and gracefully, though.  Next time I'll prefer to sit where we normally do (in the more lively bar area).  It's tighter in there, but it just feels right for a wonderful spot like Dick's.
