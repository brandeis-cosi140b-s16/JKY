I don't want to be too redundant but the food here is spectacular. It's literally a hidden gem of Phoenix, they don't even have a sign on the entrance. The service was exceptional and the food was outstanding. I ordered the Carne Adovada and I highly recommend. The pork was rich and hearty, when you eat them with the eggs it's a party in the mouth.
