Omg I love this place! 

I got a Bloody Mary that comes with a beer chaser. Such a good combo. For lunch I got the spiced burger and fries. Their portions are huge, served on huge plates. Definitely could share if needed. The burger was super tasty. My friend ordered the enchiladas and those were incredible. 

I'm convinced anything on the menu is a hit. 

New favorite place.
