I loved Richardson's and this place is the "same" - same menu, etc...the ambiance is terrific here and the server was very prompt and attentive.  I had a lovely Perrier with lime and ice to start - and ordered the Red River Chile sopa.  Let me just say if you don't enjoy spicy, don't bother with this soup.  It contained, beef, red chile, cheese and beans (dollop of salsa fresca).  Very rich flavor from the red chile and a nice kick.  Next, I had the chicken quesadillas - cheesy, crispy and enjoyable.  It came along with a red salsa and a green tomatillo-based salsa.  Great flavors and very fresh food along with a warm, cozy atmosphere.  I will definitely be back!
