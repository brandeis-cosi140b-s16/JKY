This review is strictly written based on the fact we ate at Dick's Hideaway for our wedding reception dinner and utilized the private dining. Being from Ohio we realized it was very very difficult to get responses back from the staff, and we also seemed to have multiple contacts over the planning time when exchanging emails. We tried leaving  a few messages, and we did have a little better results then, however they did call us at 4 am one time...yes 4 am! When we got into the private room and seated there is also a private bathroom for the group however soon after someone from the bar walked right in and used it. I immediately asked our server about it and got some quick attitude from her on me asking to lock the door to not let them in....I mean we did put $500 down just to have the room so I think we deserved the right to call the shots! After that we heard the waitress yell out to the bar not to use the bathroom saying "She just got yelled at, and doesnt like to be yelled at"...yes we did hear you Michelle! Then we also noticed a sign on the door saying....Private Party Stay the "F" Out....dont know if they were trying to "take a dig at us" but we thought it was pretty funny and had the entire wedding party sign it and it will soon be framed here at our house as a momento.

However, the food was TRULY AMAZING!! and HUGE portions which had everyone giving compliments both during and after the dinner. Would I be back...absolutely! What would I tell future wedding goers....to be persistent...they can make it great...BUT its alot of work!!

5 stars for food...but heavily waited on service and common courtesy
