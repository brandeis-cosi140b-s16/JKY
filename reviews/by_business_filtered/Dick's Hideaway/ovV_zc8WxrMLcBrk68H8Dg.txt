I love Dick's! I haven't ever had a bad meal here. The blue red and white enchilada's are amazing-especially the one with shrimp, although the chicken is tasty as well. I also like the turkey enchiladas and the green chile pork ones. The garlic plate is divine and easy to share with a group if you like garlic and don't mind tasting it for a day or so afterward. I love the way it smells inside and I love that it is always dark and cozy. Always one of my favorites!
