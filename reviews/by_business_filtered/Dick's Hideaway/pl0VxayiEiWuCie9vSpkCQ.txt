Small and hard to find first time there.  Aside from that great ambiance.  Small place with a very personal feel.  The menu has a lot of great options, but you can not miss the smoked turkey/ duck rellenos.  They are filled with amazing meat, topped with your cheese and you choice of red or green chili, every time i think about rellenos this is the first thing that pops into my head.  Service is great sometimes and fair others, but with food this good it easily makes up for it.  If you go for breakfast get a bloody mary, they serve it the traditional way with a beer back.
