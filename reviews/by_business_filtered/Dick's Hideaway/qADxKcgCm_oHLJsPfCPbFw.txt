I lived in Albuquerque for four years and really miss the food.  I met a guy who lived in Santa Fe who recommended this place.  The worst place in ABQ was better than this and would cost a third of what they charged here.  I got the red and the green chile.  Both were unpleasant--the red tasted burnt.
