This place always popped up as a high-rated restaurant on Yelp and after reading all the reviews, I decided to give it a try.  First of all, like everyone says this place is a true hideaway, there are no signs.  It is very small with only a couple tables, with dim lighting and rich wood as the decor.  Second, it is a delicious New Mexican/Tex Mex place.  As soon as you walk in the door, you smell the smoker and all the delicious flavors.  Our waiter was awesome, gave us very helpful tips on the menu and portion size.

The meals are very large, extremely hot and impossible to go finish unless you come on a very empty stomach.  My friend and I both tried the Carne Adovada, which isn't your typical Mexican but it sure was yummy.  The pork is so soft and it is marinated for hours in a rich chili sauce, you can really taste the smoker - it is so overpowering! Let me just say, the beans served with the carne were some of the best beans ever.  

This is by far some of the best southwestern cuisine I have ever eaten!  Next time, I would really like to try some other dishes!!
