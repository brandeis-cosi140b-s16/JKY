Awesome service and the house margs were yummy. Ordered the roasted garlic app, loved the sauce and the peppers, the garlic was very large and easily spreadable, however no garlic taste. I prefer smaller garlic that is more potent as I love garlic! Ordered the  adovada and it was superb, my husband ordered the pork mole and he liked it. A little pricey but the adovada was worth it. Would not order the garlic again unless they use smaller, more pungent garlic.
