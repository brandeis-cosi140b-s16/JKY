Dick's hideaway is such a great gem to stumble across.  Food is awesome, drinks are delish and the decor/inside is so dark and fun.  As a night nurse we often discuss where we should go in the AM and have a morning cocktail to shake the night off, Dick's is always our first choice.  I love that they're open early and totally get it.. a group of us will walk in and they always know we want mimosas and they take the time to chat and joke with us. Love this place!
