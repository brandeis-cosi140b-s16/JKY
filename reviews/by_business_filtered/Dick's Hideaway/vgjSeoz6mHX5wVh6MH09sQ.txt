Love it!
The food is VERY spicy though.  Luckily, I have burned off all of my taste buds so far from all my mexican food endeavors, however, the wussies out there should take note :)

Just realize that this place is VERY small and can get VERY crowded.

I was there once and George W Bush came in to eat there.  Evidently he loves the food.
