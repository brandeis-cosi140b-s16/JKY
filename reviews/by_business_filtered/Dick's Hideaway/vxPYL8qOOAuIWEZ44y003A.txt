I don't know how it is that I've lived in this area for as long as I have and haven't been to Dick's until last Sunday but I'm glad I finally made that choice.

My friend & I went to have brunch as amazingly enough, there was no wait. I guess we were the lucky two that day for it was 11:00 am. Tiny bar area but I was a fan...it was cozy. We started with the Bloody Marys which were really yummy. We split the breakfast burrito with chorizo, potatoes, and beans...delicious! Perfect amount to be split.

Our server was friendly and attentive and service was quick. 

All in all, a solid experience!
