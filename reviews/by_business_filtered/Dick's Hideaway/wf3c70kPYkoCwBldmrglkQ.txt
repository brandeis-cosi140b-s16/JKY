A true hole in the wall restaurant with some of the best Southwestern fare you can get in the Valley.  You'd be doing yourself a disservice if you didn't at least try this place once!  There's something to be said about the parking and spacing in the restaurant, but on purely a food basis, it's a winner. 

I could write an encyclopedia raving about this place, but I'll let you all be the judge of that.  Instead, I'll list a few things of importance (to me), and therefore probably should be to you as well:

- It smells really good in here. As in, you will leave the place smelling like cedar and smoked meat, and want to eat your own arm

- Get anything with adovada...the meat that's marinated in this stuff sits forever and, stewed up, makes me want to cry 

- Vic's meatloaf with green and red chili

- Fantastic Bloody Mary's and a shot of ale to balance it out (it's got a kick)
