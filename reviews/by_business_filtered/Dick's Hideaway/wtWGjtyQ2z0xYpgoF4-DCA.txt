I've now tried this place several times.    I want to like it, and I rarely write bad reviews, but, UGH!   The cost versus what you get is so out of whack that I'm compelled to write.   

The food is very HEAVY/greasy, it's expensive ($100.00 for 3 people) for what you get, and the preparation is poor at best.   My friends had the steak and the carne adobada, I the rellenos.   We had the garlic dish, which sadly didn't come before the meal but, rather with it.    But, even that is that wasn't a big deal.   

However, sadly, all of us pretty much confirmed that the meals, had we made them at home, we would have tossed and taken the family out.   People seem to want to compare this place with Richardson's due to similar DNA, unfortunately the place is not anywhere near as good as Richardson's was and I can't really put a finger on why.

If you like heavy, greasy, premium priced food, then this place is for you.
