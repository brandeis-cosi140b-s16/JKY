I picked this restaurant randomly from Yelp.  I sat down at the bar and I was immediately greeted by the people around me.  Apparently the guy was from the same hometown I was at.  He told me I picked the best restaurant in the city.  Cool!

I had a nice conversation with the man next to me for the better part of an hour.  He suggested that I have this fish dish, which quite honestly, I just didn't feel that the food was that amazing for the price.  

But the ambiance was cool, and I would definitely come back for happy hour if I was in the city again.
