"Fresh" off the plane, we grabbed drinks at Diego.  The waitress was very friendly and helpful, the drinks were cold and satisfying, the snacks were delicious.  There was also a beautiful array of tequilas on the wall.  Maybe it was the grumpy exhaustion, but I found the prices to be a bit much for what we had.
