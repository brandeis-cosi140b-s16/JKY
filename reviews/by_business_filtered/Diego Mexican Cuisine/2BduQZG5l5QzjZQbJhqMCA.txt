The food is amazing...and the fact that they have the Chihuahua cheese.  They won me over before I even put the food in my mouth...but what got my friend and me to go back the following evening for another dinner before leaving Las Vegas was the service.  We sat at the bar and they were so lovely that I want to bring all my friends to Diego's.  
We had the enchiladas verdes-delicious...ask for extra Chihuahua cheese.  The ceviche was amazing, both the verde and another one that tasted like oranges.  And the guacamole, which is a dish I am particular about, was fresh and tasty. 
The next evening I had the tasting menu with the ceviche, salmon and fish taco.  They were all delicious.  flaky fish marinated to perfection.  Then the dessert.  I was most excited about the goat cheese cheesecake which was the perfect amount of tangy with the jamaica glaze.  The tres leches was good.  But the real star of the show was the coconut flan.  I'm going back and definitely eating more of it...and I don't even really like coconut, that's how good it was.  

All topped off with a margarita.  How perfect is that?
