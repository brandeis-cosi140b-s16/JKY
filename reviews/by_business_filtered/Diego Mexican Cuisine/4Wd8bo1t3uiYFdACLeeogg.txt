The four stars is for the service.  The food was uninspired. I'm biased living in San Diego and having killer options every day.

Our party was a disaster. Changing the # of people the night of, swapping people between the first margarita and actually ordering the meal, etc. The staff all handled it great. 

We ordered table side guac. It was table side guac. Not too hard to screw up but fun for people that haven't seen it before.

The margaritas were simple and tasty, ordered "skinny" style for no simple syrup.

The carne asada ($35) was a big piece of fat...not too happy about it, but luckily wasn't too hungry that night and not in the mood to complain.

Would try again for sure just on the service, probably order something different.
