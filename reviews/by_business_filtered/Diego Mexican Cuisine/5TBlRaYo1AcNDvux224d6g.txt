I really wanted to like this place and for the most part I did.  The major flaw that I cannot look past is the Tortilla soup.  They brought out a bowl with a piece of chicken and cheese in it, then poured hot water on top.  I tried putting lime and salt into the bowl but I couldnt keep spooning water into my mouth.  I also had to cut the chicken since it came in 1 piece.

Other foods were good, but I can turn on a sink for hot water.
