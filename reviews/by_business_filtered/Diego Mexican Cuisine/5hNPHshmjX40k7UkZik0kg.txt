Never ate @ Diegos just dropped it like its hot @ VIDA! haha

I went here last weekend it's was cool went for a friends cousins birthday who was so nice to pay for the entrance, Happy Bday Victor!

If your from Out of Town then Girls $10 Guys $20, Local Girls $5 Guys $10

It is an older crowd  club, music went from Salsa, rock en espanol, reggaeton, to hip hop. pretty much it!

Now if you really like what your wearing BE CAREFUL! drinks are going everywhere, by the first hour I could just lick myself and be drunk!

It was cool, but it's a place where I would run into my mom.
