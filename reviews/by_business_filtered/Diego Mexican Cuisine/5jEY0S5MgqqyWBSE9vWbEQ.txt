We had an incredible meal here for our anniversary thanks to all the positive Yelp reviews. My husband and I are big Mexican food lovers and had very high expectations, which were more than met. The margaritas were fresh, the tableside guacamole was to die for (go for spicy--you won't regret it), and my skirt steak fajitas were divine. My husband had the pork carnitas and agreed that my dish was better, but his was still very good. Try not to fill up on chips before the meal--easier said than done, but you'll want to leave room for dessert. We had the banana ice cream with churros and caramel sauce (I forget the name of the dish). Service was attentive but I don't remember any particular details--I was too focused on the food and my nice margarita buzz. We will come back here on our next trip for sure.
