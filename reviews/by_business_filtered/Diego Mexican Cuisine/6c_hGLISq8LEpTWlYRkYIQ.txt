Couple of hits, couple of misses, but overall a really good experience.

Do try the mango mojitos, no matter what.  They're magical!

Enjoyed two of the three salsas they serve with the tasty chips.  Did not care for the green salsa, but could not get enough of the spicy salsa.  Wife really enjoyed the mild salsa fresca.

For our second pound of chips, we had the queso fresco, two separate dishes, one with a black bean base, the other with a superb chorizo flare.  These were a definite highlight of the meal, but were really quite filling.

I went for broke (Vegas, ya know?) and got the "surf and turf"--a filet and shrimp enchiladas.  The turf was spectacular; the surf, well, it was low tide.  The turf would make a great dish on its own.

The wife opted for the wholly unexotic chicken tacos al carbon.  She reports that the chicken was very bland and wholly unseasoned.

We skipped dessert, too stuffed to even try.  

The service was great and really added to the experience.  Overall, a pretty decent meal for the money.  I will definitely go back next time I'm in Sin City.
