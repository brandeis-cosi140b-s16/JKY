Blaaaaah. The food was lacking, the service was lacking. I had the "signature" Diego Carne Asada, and there was no notable marinadey flavor that I associate with even the weakest carne.The chips were crumbs and the salsas forgettable. Even the drinks were meh at best, and how can you mess up alcohol? A $90 meal for two people, and seriously I would have eaten better at one of the Strip's seventeen LA SALSAS!

You hurt me.
