My husband and I both ordered the chefs sample plate and it was delicious!  We also ordered a side of beans and rice to split.  My husband didn't get enough to eat from just his plate but the waiter told us before that they were small helpings.  What I didn't eat made up for his big stomach but the food really was delicious.  My husband isn't a fan of mexican and he was surprised how much he liked it.  Super good, loved everything and they were very accommodating for our three unruly children.
