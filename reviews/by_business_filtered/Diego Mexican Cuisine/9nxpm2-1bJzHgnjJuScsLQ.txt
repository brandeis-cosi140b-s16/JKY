Dined here last week.  Food was delicious, especially the tableside guacamole!  But we think the server forgot to place our order - since it took 45 minutes to arrive after the apps.  By that time we were already full and couldn't finish our meals.  They need to work on the timing, but atmosphere and food for good.
