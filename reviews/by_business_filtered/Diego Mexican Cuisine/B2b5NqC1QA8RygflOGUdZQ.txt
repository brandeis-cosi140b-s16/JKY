Mediocre.  I had the chicken tacos.  They were pretty bland; the chicken didn't have much flavor.  My mojito was great, though.  (Thank goodness--it cost $12!)  My cousin slipped the hostess $20 to get us seated quickly.  I was kind of disgusted that they took the bribe, but happy not to have to wait too long!
