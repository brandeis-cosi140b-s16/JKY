Just returned from the wet hot East Coast and I was jonesing for some rip roaring Mexican food.  I wanted some salsa as hot as  the lightning storm I had just waded through, and thought Diego might be the place.  The place was packed, and the red walls lured me in.  We couldn't get a table,and since we were jet lagging bad, we ate at the bar, which turned out to be beside a waterfall.  Bathing in the negative ions of the water, I began feeling slowly refreshed, as  I took in the sophisticated red red decor and suave art works.  The friendly waitress handed me three notebooks, and I thought there was going to be a test, or at least I might get some school credit, but no, it turned out one was just the tequila menu.  By the bottle, because I wasn't going to pay $45 for a shot....so I finally focused on a Pomegranite margarita with a float of Grand Marnier, since it matched the red walls and helped me blend into the Vegas aura.  A few slurps later, and I was happily  diving into homemade chunky Haas avacado guacamole with big crispy tortilla chips,  (One slight improvement might be warmed chips.) and three salsas.  A fine way to get the palate going.  We each ordered tacos, one pork and one shrimp, and the marathon was one.  Three tacos later, I was satisfied, along with some of the tastiest refried frijoles ever!   The light touch on the food made me feel like I was back in California already!
I'm ready to go back and dance when the restaurant turns to a club!
 The portions were so huge, I had a shopping bag full of food for the plane the next day
Nothing beats using Las Vegas as a travel hub!!!
