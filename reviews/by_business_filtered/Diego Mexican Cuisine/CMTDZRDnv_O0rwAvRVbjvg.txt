This place is easily accessible if you're staying at the MGM, if not, enjoy the maze.  

Prices are comparative to other decent Vegas restaurants...so yes, overpriced, but no more overpriced than everything else.  Expect to spend at least 30 bucks.

Their food is good, portions perfect.  I had the steak tacos, which were more akin to steak fajitas, but they were good, so I didn't mind.   I had leftovers, which I enjoyed and needed the next day.  The green salsa - delicious...if it was a drink option I'd be all about it.

My only complaint is the lack of Margarita popsicles.  They are advertised everywhere and despite the cold, un-Vegas-like weather, a margarita popsicle sounded delicious.  Plus, you look a little less ridiculous walking with a popsicle instead of those yard-long plastic juices people have leashed around their necks.  Our waiter looked at us as though we had asked for some alien dish and then went to check on the popsicle status...none to be found, check back tomorrow.  And as everyone knows, the shelf-life for remembering to do something in Vegas is about five minutes...so unfortunately I missed out on the marg pops. 

Overall, I'd gladly return, in the summer, and next time I better get my popsicle.
