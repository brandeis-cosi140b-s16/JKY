Probably my favorite place we ate at while on this Vegas trip.

We had a round of different margaritas and everyone was very happy with each of our margaritas.  

I had the shrimp fajitas and loved them.  The rice and beans were delicious and i enjoyed the salsa so much I put it all over all of my food.  The corn tortillas were fresh and delicious!

I will definitely be returning!
