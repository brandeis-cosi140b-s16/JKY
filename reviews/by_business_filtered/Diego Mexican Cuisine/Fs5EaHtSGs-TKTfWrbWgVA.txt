I am absolutely in LOVE with Diego Mexican in Las Vegas, NV.

After visiting by chance last September, I knew that Diego was at the top of my "must do" list each time I visit Vegas.  My last trip, I broke the record and experienced the infamous Mexican cuisine 3 times... smh.

What a treat!!! :-)

The best part about Diego is the service with a smile.  Each person not only holds true to the motto "service with a smile", but is also very knowledgeable about the food and top shelf tequila selection.

MUST HAVES:
Fresh guacamole made to order table-side; WARNING: you will not be able to complete a meal after margaritas, chips and guacamole.  I like mine spicy :-)

Top Shelf Margaritas - The waitstaff and bartenders know every detail about each premium tequila served.  Ask question  and you will taste the purest mix of orange, lime and tequila. :-)

There are many exquisite main courses to experience at Diego.  To be honest, by the time my entree arrives, I am usually two stuffed and only take two bites...

When in Vegas... Do Not Miss This Treat... Xoxo
