Decent Mexican cuisine with a great looking restaurant. It is located inside the MGM Grand and when we went on a Monday night had no wait, even though it was Memorial day. We ordered the fresh guacamole and a gentleman came to our table and made it right in front of us with ingredients that we wanted. The food was good, but nothing amazing. Would go again if at the MGM.
