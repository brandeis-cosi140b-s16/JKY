I've been here quite a few times, and each time it just gets better and better. This time we sat out near the main thorough-fair, instead of deep into the restaurant, and since people watching is my thing, it was perfect. Started out with the classic Diego margarita, which is always awesome! We ended up splitting all of our food, cause the portions are huge and just always amazingly tasty!!! We shared the carnitas burrito, OMG was it good! Highly recommended...
