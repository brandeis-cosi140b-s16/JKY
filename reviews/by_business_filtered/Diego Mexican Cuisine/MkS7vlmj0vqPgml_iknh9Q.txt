Yummy spot; worth checking out, especially if you don't want to spend a fortune for dinner. 

It's a little tricky to get to from the main entrance of the hotel (meaning it's a jaunt). The food is prepared well and the restaurant gives off a fun and trendy vibe. One major drawback, we were seated near a really noisy group of about 20 people (the amount of tequila consumed by this table may have added to their noise level). It made it really difficult to carry on a conversation with the others at our table. 

Highly recommend the guacamole prepared table side!
