One word to describe the food at Diego: INTERESTING. Personally, I'd say Diego is good only for their salsa & chips. If I'd ever order from here, I'd get take out chips and salsa and eat it in the room. Somehow, I didn't even like their margaritas...how is it possible to screw up a margarita?? Idk... Anyways, we ordered the four course meal, and it wasn't terrible. It was...interesting. I could see how someone might think it tastes good, but it was just not for me. It's a beautiful place and the dishes were presented nicely but IMO NOT worth the money. Eat elsewhere Yelpers!
