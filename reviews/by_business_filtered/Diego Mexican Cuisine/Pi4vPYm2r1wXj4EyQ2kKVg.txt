Diego was one of the best Mexican restaurants I have eaten at.  
- It has a great casual yet slick environment.
- The guac made fresh at the table was awesome - I love spicy food, so the server customized it accordingly also.  
- I had a flight to catch in about 40 min, so they pushed my order through and I had food + drinks + guac on my table within 10 min.  
- The Renello was melt-in-the-mouth good...
-  It is somewhat expensive, but its in MGM and fairly classy - and totally worth the money in terms of quality of food.  

Would definitely recommend as the choice of Mexican food in Vegas...
