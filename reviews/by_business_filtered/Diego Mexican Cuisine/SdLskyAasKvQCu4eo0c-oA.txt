5 stars for the UNBELIEVABLY delicious guacamole, made at our table. I think it's key to tell them to make it spicy, though! it has the perfect kick!
1 star taken away for the gross sea bass that 3 of us ordered that was bad, off, whatever... just not good.

The service started out well...and then suffered from there. But the ambiance, the ease of which they seated 8 of us...and that guacamole would give me reason enough to come back and give them another chance.

Oh, and the mayan martini was DELISH...
couple that with a vat of guac, and I would be a happy camper!
