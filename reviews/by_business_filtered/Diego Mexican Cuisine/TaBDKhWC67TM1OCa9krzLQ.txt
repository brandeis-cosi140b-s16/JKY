Gosh, did I hate this restaurant. For being in a high-traffic area in Vegas, I am shocked it remains open.

Food: We came during happy hour so we were only allowed to choose from a mediocre 10ish item menu. No one was impressed, and two of our party got horrible food poisoning from the pork. Can you think of a worse vacation to get food poisioning? Bland, all of it.

Service: It took us over 20 minutes to get our check closed out. This was in the middle of the day with the bar half-full. Our waitress just disappeared for a solid 10 minutes. One of the busboys accidentally dumped salsa on me. A mistake, of course, but Diego isn't replacing those stained clothes.

Ambiance: Was okay. I was seated next to an open doorway that led to the hotel walkway, so it was very loud. Probably better seats in the house than the one I had.
