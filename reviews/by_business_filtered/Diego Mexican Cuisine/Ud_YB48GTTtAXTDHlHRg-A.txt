DELICIOUS!

Ordered off of the tasting menu, still large enough portions, you get a FANTASTIC deal and delicious food.  (Three courses, starter, entree, dessert, around $30 per person.)  The service was wonderful.  I got beef taquitos, a pork dish (that I could cut with my fork, yum!) and a caramel flan for dessert.

And to all these people griping about price?  It's the MGM Grand in Las Vegas.  Every other place on the strip that isn't in a food court (with the exception of Denny's) is priced similarly.  Maybe laying off the slots for a bit will add some cash to your food fund.
