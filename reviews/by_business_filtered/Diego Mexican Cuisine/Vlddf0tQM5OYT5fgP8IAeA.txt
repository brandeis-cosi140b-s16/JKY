We had intended to make an appearance for happy hour but got the times wrong.  Please note it's done at 5:30 (not starts at!)  This put a damper on our expectations: from affordable mexican eats to high end fare.  The latter fell short with bland, overpriced food.  Service was very pleasant, but do yourself a favor and avoid the chile relleno at all costs.  Bluck.
