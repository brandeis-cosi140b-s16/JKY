The prices at this place go up every time I eat there. For this reason, I'm not giving this place five stars, though I might otherwise. The food is always fantastic. Best chips in Vegas, possibly the entire southwest.  You MUST try the goat.  It simply melts in your mouth.  The margaritas and tequila selection is great too.  And it must be popular.  How else can one explain the meteoric rise in the prices since it opening.
