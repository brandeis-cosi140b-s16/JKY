I was taken here for a large group dinner so we had the back room to ourselves for the night. I didn't pay for the check so price wasn't a concern of mine for the evening. 

The service was pretty attentive but we were a large party in on a Monday night. The Guacamole de Lujo was our family style starter and it was fantastic. Some great Haas avocados were mixed in with some other quality products to really start the meal off right. 

For the main course I mostly honed in on the Pollo Horno con Mole, Chile Rellenos, and short ribs which were all decent but not overwhelming. The decor might translate to the Mexican countryside as they claim but the food isn't close to authentic Mexican. 

The bathrooms are tucked in an odd corner and inconvenient to get to along with a "shared" sink area which is kind of strange. This place is also tucked way in the back of the casino so if you valet or come via monorail you will burn 400 calories (1.5 miles if I remember, haha) just trying to get into this place. 

The place isn't as bad as some people in these posts make it out to seem but for the prices and the competition just in the MGM I think this shouldn't be your first choice.
