So much fun here... I came here in 2008 with a group of girlfriends and some guys friends  from Jalisco and just  like us they  wanted to go dancing like real dancig not just a club with like top 40 music. They told us about Diego's so we went, it was so alive when we got there the walk through the MGM was great  the entrance was 20 bucks but well worth it. I had the remy and coke drinks coming so i was feeling great quickly, they were playing salsa, cumbias, spanish rock and all of a sudden BANDA (Mexican Regional Music) !! they whole room went crazy it was like Finally they played something other than lady gaga or hip hop it was a great night and the drinks were great My friend Maria Perez had a couple of cadillacs so they must have been really good cuz she knows her drinks... A great dance floor and long bar with enough bartenders to not keep you waiting... Enjoy..
