This is one of the more decent Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas, Nevada.   I like their coffee, it's served with chocolate just the way Diego Rivera (to which this restaurant was named after) likes it.  The salsa is hot, I think made with Habaneros - I tricked a friend into trying it and it made his face erupt like a volcano.

The food is great and the portions are..well American sized, definitely more than I could eat.  The ambiance is good, very nice wall decor of Diego's work as well as Frida's.
