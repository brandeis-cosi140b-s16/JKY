He looked at me and said "this might be the best ribeye I have ever had in my life". "He" has worked in the food industry for over 15 years and tends to be a harsh critic, so I knew I needed to reach across the table and try a bite. Wow! The carne asada rare at Diego was fantabulous!!!!!! My food was good too. And the fresh hot chips were a bonus. 

I liked the modern decor and ambiance. Service was not necessarily the fastest, but it was not at all lacking. We were well attended and really enjoyed the whole experience.
