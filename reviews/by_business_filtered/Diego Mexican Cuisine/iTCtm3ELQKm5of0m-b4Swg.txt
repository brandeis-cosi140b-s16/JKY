Diego was really a disappointment, as both a restaurant and club.  We were excited, expecting some delicious Mexican food and a fun night of Latin dance music.  The atmosphere is pretty sleek, but it wasn't really packed enough for a Saturday night.  We ordered the queso fundido as an appetizer....it was really small, but didn't matter as it was pretty much flavorless and somewhat difficult to dip tortillas and chips into anyway.  We ordered a pticher of margaritas, and it was pretty much like a pitcher of bad, overly sugary sweet and sour mix with a little but of tequila that we could not taste. Despite having paid quite a bit for this pticher, we couldn't even finsh one glass a piece, as it was just too sickeningly sweet.  I ordered red snapper, which was the seafood special of the day.  It wasn't bad, but just wasn't exciting.  It was pretty much grilled fish on a plate of salsa.  Disappointed by the food, we rushed to the bar to try several more drinks and await the paty that was about to start.  We tried the Frida Margarita, which was a little better, but, again, we could not taste the tequila.  The bartender was really friendly, but it didn't really make up for the signature drinks of Diego.  Around 11 or so they started moving out all the chairs and tables and gave us wristbands to stay for the club.  Unfortunately, it just never got crowded.  Those who did come in, were mostly middle-aged couples.  It is possible this place gets going later at night, but around midnight, we decided to look for a better party.
