love that the guacamole is freshly made in front of you right after you order! The lady will ask how you would like it done and tailor to your preference! I ordered the "Chopped" Salad with avocado, squash, corn, cabbage, etc and was perfectly made.  Ambiance is very nice and waiter Leo was attentive. The bad: there was some technical issue at the time we paid our bill with credit card and had to wait a long time...
