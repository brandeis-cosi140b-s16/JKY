As an authentic Mexican...this place is bad....and I mean bad like (90's cool).....The food was way yummy...and I know great Mexican food...Trust. ....Try the pitcher of Sangria. It is a must! 

The decor is very sweet....It was sorta reddish pink? Sounds weird right but it was a nice touch....the staff was friendly and fast. The atmosphere was definitely a party atmosphere... 

after hours the spot becomes a salsa/Latin nightclub...we had a blast with the margaritas and hip shaking music.... what a way to start out a night of partying...

I will mos def come back to Diegos....order EVERYTHING...j/k
