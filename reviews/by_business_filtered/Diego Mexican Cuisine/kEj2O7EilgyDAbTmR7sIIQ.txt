My review is not really based on the restaurant portion of the venue, but more of the after hours when they turn the place into a club like scene. 
It was on a Saturday night and around 11:30pm when the place really started picking up. The Dj was pretty good , he played a lot of variety that kept the people dancing. However it seemed like everyone was trying to pack into the area next to the bar, instead of spreading out throughout the rest the of the place. So it  was definitely elbow to elbow room mostly, like most clubs. 

The bar was very stocked. They also had a variety of drinks, even a numerous amount of different type of tequilas. The margaritas I had were very tasty and well proportioned. 

Overall it was a good atmosphere, the decor was nice, and the place seemed very alive. 

Like I said, I cannot contest to the food, but hopefully I will be able to one day. I am quite curious.
