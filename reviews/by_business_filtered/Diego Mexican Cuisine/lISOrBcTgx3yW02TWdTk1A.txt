meh, meh, meeeeeehhhhh

did not impress me at all.  the margaritas were too sweet (triple sec is GROSS), the sangria was more like a wine spritzer, the mole was a little too smokey and the tortilla soup tasted like french onion soup.  the halibut and the taquitos were delicious.  highlight of the meal was the coffee flan that we took to go.  

i might come back here for dessert.
