This place fits perfectly with the rest of the restaurants that line this area of the MGM.  I'm so used to the little hole in the wall Mexican restaurants with decore exploding of pink, green and yellow and mariachi singers galore that this was a welcome change, with it's red and silver modern decor. I'm not big on fancy Mexican, because to me, authentic is always those whole in the walls or street vendors and you never spend more than $10 to be stuffed, but Diego far surpassed my expectations.

I met some friends staying at MGM for dinner and they picked this place for dinner.  I ordered the carnitas enchiladas and my friend ordered the Diego special.  I can't remember what my other friend ordered...tacos?  Anyway, we also ordered table-side guac.  I had a margarita on the rocks and my friend had a mojito.  

The table-side guac was SOOO good.  My only complaint was it was a very small serving and barely enough for 3 people.  My enchiladas were good, it could have used a little more sauce.  Also, I don't usually eat the beans and rice, but they were really good when I tried a bite so by the time I was done eating, my plate was nearly clean.  My margarita was also pretty perfect.  The food presentations were on point as well. Again, my only complaint was that the portions are pretty small.

The restaurant was pretty empty so quick service was not an issue.  Our server was friendly and fast and we never had to wait to get waters refilled.  Overall, a great experience and I'd go back if I had friends staying at MGM craving some Mexican.
