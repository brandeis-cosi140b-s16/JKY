Summary...overpriced imitation Mexican food located in the MGM grand. 

The good...the table side guac. That was the highlight and very very tasty. The service was also fast and friendly. If the chips served with the guac hadn't been overcooked to slightly burned (you know that burnt chip flavor) this would have been very good. 

The bad...the food was average to poor and everything was overpriced. I've had excellent Mexican food and this falls into the inauthentic imitation gourmet bucket. When you order a combination plate you're receiving three small versions of typical fair. I ordered the "Diego" combo plate. The fish taco was ok (pretty salty), the chicken enchilada was AVG at best, and the beef tamale was terrible.

With all the options in Vegas, even at the MGM grand, I would highly advise going somewhere else. You can do better. Really, you can do a lot better.
