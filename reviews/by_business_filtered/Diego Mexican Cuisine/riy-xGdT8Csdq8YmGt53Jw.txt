We had to come here while in Vegas...my bf is a tequila fan and i knew he would like to try some new ones.  Chips & salsa were AMAZING.  Seriously.  The chips were not only warm, but they were seasoned with salt and spices!  SO GOOD. The empanadas, taquitos, chicken fajitas, tortilla soup...all was amazingly delicious, and not heavy or greasy feeling at all. And they have a big wall of tequila to choose from!  

We sat at the bar, there were about 3-4 guys back there, all very friendly and gave awesome service!  This will definitely be a must-stop whenever we're in Vegas :)
