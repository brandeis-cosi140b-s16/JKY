Coming from So-cal, and living in the Santa-Ana area where authentic Mexican food are a dime in a dozen, Diego definitely is just another run of the mill fancy Mexican cuisine that you can get anywhere. However the hit on your pocket book is another story of its own. 

I have to say I did enjoy their food. Did I think it was worth the price that I paid at the end of the night? Not at all. I ordered a plate of tacos, enchilada,  carne asada plate and also including 4 beers. My total came out to be about $140 before tip? Anytime when a Mexican restaurant charges into the triple digits, its probably not worth the price of admission. The location isn't all that great. You are in the middle of the casino walkway where there is constant foot traffic. People are constantly peaking on to your table to see what you are eating, so I wouldn't exactly call it romantic. 

I wasn't satisfied or disappointed by Diego. I just expected them to charge a little less.
