My boy told me that diegos is the spot on friday nights for those interested in having an awesome time while dancing to spanish music and he was right on. We were there the moment they opened theirs doors at 1130pm on fri night till the lights came on. Only time dancing does not occur is while ordering drinks, on second thought I take that back. It smaller than your average venue but its should suit those not interested in those ridiculous club crowds. Here you can dance without spilling drinks and stuff like that. From this experience I see that people at diegos are interested in what needs to be done..... No B.S.  We tried to go back on late Saturday night and the wait was two hours, no bueno.
