When I lived in Vegas, I was fortunate enough to be invited to Diego's soft opening.  The food was good then and it's good now.  Fast forward to Yelp Spring Break, my friends and I needed a quick bite after checking into our hotel and 'wichcraft was closed.  We wandered over to Diego and asked if we could sit at the bar.  We were promptly seated and ordered some drinks, nachos, and enchiladas.  The salsa and chips were complimentary.  

The service is great and the food was brought out piping hot from the kitchen.  After hours in the car, this was exactly what we needed to prep us for our evening to come.  Because restaurants struggle in their first years, it's good to know that Diego lasted all this time inside the MGM.  Salud!
