Only come here for happy hour drinks.  All of the food we had was ridiculously salty.  The carnitas were so salty we could not finish them, which was unfortunate considering the price.  I've had much better Mexican food for half the price back in San Francisco.  Ignoring the food, the happy hour drinks were actually quite good and one of the better deals you'll find on The Strip.
