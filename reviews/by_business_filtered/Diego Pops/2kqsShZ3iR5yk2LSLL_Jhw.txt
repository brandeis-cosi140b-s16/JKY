I LOVE the tacos here. The shrimp and pork tacos on a corn tortilla are a must order. Chicken tortilla soup is also delicious and must be tried. Brussel sprout nachos are good but nothing to write home about but the street corn queso is actually pretty delicious.

House margaritas are good and decently strong, but I love any of Diego pop's drinks that come in a coconut. So good! 

The environment is really fun but I knocked this review down a star because the bartenders can be a bit strange. I wouldn't reccomend eating at the bar as they brought our entire order out In a Jumbled mix. 

Definitely look this place up if you are in town. Good food and a fun environment!
