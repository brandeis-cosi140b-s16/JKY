We went in here today thinking that it would be amazing and unfortunately we were disappointed.

Im a big fan of queso so we tried their queso and it came out tasting more like cottage cheese.

I also got the salmon bowl and the salmon came undercooked. 

My friend got the shrimp bowl and it came with 3 shrimp. 

Its an awesome set up but dont go here thinking youll get a great meal
