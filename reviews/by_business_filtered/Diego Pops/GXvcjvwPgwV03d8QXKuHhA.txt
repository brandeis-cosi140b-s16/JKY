Great food and an amazing selection of unique drinks. They have a great selection of tequila and mezcal, up to and including a shot that's $80! I did not try it...but I will one day. 

Ashlyn, our bartender, was the best! She is so friendly and accommodating! My friend and I were interested in the mezcal and thankfully she let us try it first. The best I can say is that it's an acquired taste!

I'm really into Diego Pop's. Great drinks and great service, especially at the  bar. It's also not too crowded so you can get your drinks and food quickly. Margaritas are on lock.

If you are in Scottsdale check it out!
