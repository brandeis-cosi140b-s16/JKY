I have had take out here several times for lunch.  The food is always awesome and ready to go when I get there.  I liked it so much and always wanted to sit outside on their adorable patio, so my fiance and I decided to venture away from downtown and try it for dinner this past Sunday evening.  We were seated immediately but our server was nowhere in sight.  It was at least 5 minutes before she even acknowledged us.  When she finally appeared, we ordered some drinks and appetizers....and then she disappeared again.  For a long time.   She finally came back (empty-handed) and took our dinner order.  She told us both the bar and the kitchen were running behind.  It was a fairly slow evening but we were understanding.  The drinks and appetizers were eventually delivered by a different person.  Everything was just beyond slow and took forever to come out, including our entrees.  Yet a third person (bartender?) brought us our second round of drinks at some point.  We asked her for extra tortillas and they never came.  Our server never checked back on us until we were done with our meal.  I'll reiterate - I love the food here.  And the patio is so quaint and cute.  But the service stinks.  I think I will stick with lunch take out.
