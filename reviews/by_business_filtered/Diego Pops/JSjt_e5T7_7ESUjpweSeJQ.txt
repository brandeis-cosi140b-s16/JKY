Brussel sprout nachos, crispy cod taco and grilled shrimp taco were all wonderful and super tasty. Combine that with a fresh margarita, wonderful ambiance and kind service and you get yourselves five stars. Great outdoor, shaded seating but the indoors looked tastefully decorated! Would be back here in a heartbeat if we lived here!
