I really want to love this place because of the patio !! 

The food is can be tasty depending on what you get . Stay away from Poke . Very little fish is served . I really like the guacamole but the chips need to improve ASAP ! Been stale all of my visits . ( it's not that hard to make tasty fresh tortilla chips!) 

The reason   for 3 stars is : Bar. I have had to correct my own margaritas . Either too much sweet or too much sour. The other cocktails are very weak . I had 4 specialty  drinks yesterday and did not even feel a little buzz lol. My two girlfriends said the same . Our tab was over $150 .. Should be able have a little fun from that ! NO. 
 
The experiences I have had with the bartenders is lame ! I really think they need to re think who they hire. Bar staff seems grumpy and annoyed if you sit there and very unexperienced. ( perhaps they recruited from a Olive Garden or Sizzler ?!) Highly suggest they get some bartenders who have been working high volume bars in the area. They will bring in a better vibe, higher clientele and most importantly better drinks ! 

I have heard this from quite a few people I know - word is on the street  : Pass.
