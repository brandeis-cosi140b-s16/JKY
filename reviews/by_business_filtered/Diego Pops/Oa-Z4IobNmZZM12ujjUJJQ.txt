Holy god!! Everything is so so good!! Let's just start off with service... So immediate, so friendly, so helpful!! Food came out almost instantaneously!!  We ordered salsa (very spicy), guacamole (worth every penny), and their corn queso to start (out of this world)!!  The pineapple pork taco was sweet and delicious! The green chili chicken bowl was literally cooked to perfection! Needless to say we were stuffed after all this! The "fresh one margarita" was very fresh. Oh, and if you come Monday for happy hour (3-6) you get 1/2 price apps, and discounted drinks... And all day Monday is Taco Monday... So $2 and $3 tacos!!  This is seriously AMAZING and needs to be checked out by all!
