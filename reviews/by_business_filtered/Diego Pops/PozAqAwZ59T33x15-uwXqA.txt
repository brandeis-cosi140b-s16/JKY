Neat "quaint" looking place on outside....with a little bit of nice outdoor seating....way too dark and boomy music inside, where we ended up sitting, so hard to chat with our friends.  Their different "bowls" are both tasty and plentiful and they provide a real nice variety of fairly unusual sauces to put on it as you go.  Their standard salsa with the $2 chips n salsa order was outstanding.  As for their tacos....take a pass on the crispy pork one, for sure....too greasy. :-(  The bartender and his assistant in training  were both very friendly.  But, our server was more interested/focused at times early on in us answering her questions, vs. her answering ours......she got more helpful as time wore on. My "shrimp" bowl was good, but I felt sorry for our friend with the taco (it looked pitiful) that ended up ordering a dinner salad.  Not sure I'd go back.I give it three stars, because three of the four of us (that had bowls) were satisfied. I suspect it is a better evening "bar scene" place than a lunch spot for the more "vintage ones" like ourselves.   Seems to be many other nice choices in this nice area near "old town" though.
