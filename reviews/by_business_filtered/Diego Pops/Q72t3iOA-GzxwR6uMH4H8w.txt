I've tried. I really have. However, Diego Pops is too inconsistent for my liking. The food is fine but it's not worth the crapshoot that has become my every experience. Great service? Rare. OK service? Likely. Bad service? It's happened. When I want a quick lunch, quick being the operative word, I've learned to take my business elsewhere.
