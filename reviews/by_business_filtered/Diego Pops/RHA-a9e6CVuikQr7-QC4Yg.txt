I don't ask for much in a dining experience. I don't have any weird allergies or ask for a million sides of ranch. I tip. Really, I am just looking for my server to be attentive and have mild social skills. Our server fell below this standard and that was really disappointing. 

The ambiance & design of this place is adorable. The food is creative & different. Everything we ordered was delicious- the corn queso, the playa poke, the tacos, & the churro sundae! It was a good temperature with great presentation. Once we asked for the sauces, they were a fun element. We just never saw our waitress and waited a long time between ordering courses. Our app was never bussed...even though we had scraped every bit of delicious queso out of the bowl.


I'd go back and try it again- maybe for happy hour or the nachos.
