Been there a couple of times and the service has been okay along with the food. Recently went and the manager had an issue with my friend and made our group feel horrible. Service was down hill from there. The place had maybe 20 customers and we were ignored. Then when we ordered the waitress/bar tender spoke over my friends conversations to keep asking about what tortilla we wanted. We were never checked on during the service. Also drinks were ordered and were taken from the table even if they were not finished. Not worth it!!
