Good taco & ambience, but their service and chips were so terrible that I question ever coming back.

My fianc√© and I were greeted by the hostess and were seated.  About five minutes later someone came by and asked if our server came by, we said no and ordered our drinks and chips & salsa.

We got our chips & salsa and about 40% of the chips were stale. They tasted like they were cheap restaurant-style chips (which are typically large), but we're obviously broken into smaller pieces. The salsa wasn't bad, but nothing to return for.

As we chomped on chips which many were just plain hard,  we wondered where our drinks were and we wished we had ordered waters to tide us over while we wait for our drinks.  Another waitress came by (I guess the waitress the other one talked about?) and saw that we were half way through our chips & salsa with no drinks. She asked if we would like waters and we quickly responded, yes please.

We never received our waters although that waitress passed us over six times afterwards.

The patio was almost full, but there was only one group inside.  There were two bartenders and a whole bunch of servers which were mostly talking to each other and putting orders in.

Fifteen minutes after ordering we got our drinks, we were almost done with our chips.  At that point we were asked if we wanted to order entrees.  Based on the wait I decided to just get one BBQ chicken taco. I only had to wait about five minutes and I enjoyed the taco. But honestly it was soured by the poor experience.

I acknowledge that maybe we got the bottom of the chip bin, but the server confusion, forgetfulness and over ten minute wait for 2 drinks all on a Sunday that wasn't that busy is just disappointing.

With such a variety of taco places, I can't recommend this place.
