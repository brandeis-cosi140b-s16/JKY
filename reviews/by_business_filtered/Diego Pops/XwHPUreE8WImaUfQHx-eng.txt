Went here tonight with my family for the first time for my 23rd birthday dinner! Had a blast! The environment was supper cool and laid back! Our service was outstanding and very friendly and our food was to die for and extremely fast! Over all this place is killer and now one of my fav restaurants to go too. Prices were also awesome! I definitely recommend the Brussel sprout nachos! I can't wait to go back and try something different! The server even gave me a huge rainbow rice Krispy treat for dessert because it was my birthday :)
