I go to Diego Pops all the time (the manager, Corey, said better to come here too much than to Taco Bell..truuu). I wouldn't come here that often if it wasn't amazing. The food is sooo good, they won a ton of awards at the Taco Festival so that's not just my opinion. I always get the street corn queso, it's basically liquid gold. They have a great choice of different tacos and bowls, they just added burritos to the menu too. Their drink menu is fantastic, and they just added pitchers of margaritas and beer (holler). They also have a really cool dessert menu, I tried the churro fries once and they're as good as they sound. 
Everyone that works there is really nice and the service is always on point. The bartender with the bow tattoos is so nice (I suck for always forgetting her name) and Taylor is a great server, she's nice and really attentive. Any time I've ever had an issue they've always taken care of it right away! I had a weird reaction to a drink once so they brought me out a different one and comped it for me. Sooo nice of them. Basically, you should just try this place, it's really good and you won't regret it.
