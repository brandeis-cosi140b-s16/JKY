As a 20 year resident of Scottsdale, I remember this location being a pottery shop for the longest time.

It's nice to see them redevelop the building into a cozy Mexican restaurant.  The patio and outside bar are good areas to enjoy a meal when the weather is nice.

The prices are reasonable and I enjoyed my skirt steak rice bowl with stewed beans.  The flavors and the different sauces that you can add make for a nice option without the heavy sauces and cheese that come on dishes at most Mexican restaurants.

Overall I enjoyed my experience here and plan to return.
