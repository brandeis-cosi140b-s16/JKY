"SAY YES TO TACOS!" 

Hmm, I hadn't thought of it like that before... but as I make a point of always listening to demands made by illuminated changeable letter signs (like the one in the front of Diego Pops, ushering me toward a life of complete taco acceptance,) I decided this lunch time would be taco time!

Our group ordered a bunch of apples and then flew solo for the Entrees. The appy that stuck out most to me - The Brussels Sprout Nachos!

Did your inner child just twinge at that thought of putting Brussels sprouts on nachos? You should have! You should have just experiences a quick flash back to the overly steamed, and just downright terrible Brussels sprouts mom would either force feed you, or use to hold our dessert ransom until we had finished them. And now, you're telling me this Dr. Doom and Bane (big green guy from Batman)'s love child is coming after nachos, the most delicious food you can think of off the top of your head?! Not on this yelper's plate!

You can take a breath, Inner Child, because these nachos are the bomb! The thing is, you mom made brussels sprouts wrong. Sorry Mom... You don't steam them for days, you cut them in half then flash fry them in a super hot pan so you burn their little faces off. Then you put them on nachos and they're the best thing in the world! 

The only thing that could possible top them is the pink (aioli?) sauce they serve with it. It's coloured pink with beets, but its tastes like a mashup of garlic, creamy egg somthin-or-other, and love. I want to put this on everything now and do shots of it at parties.

The tacos - yeah, they were pretty good. Sorta like street side tacos, except fancied up in some form or another. Fancier, but not necessarily better.

All in all, it's a funky little place with delicious Mexican influenced dishes and I'd be happy to check them out again.
