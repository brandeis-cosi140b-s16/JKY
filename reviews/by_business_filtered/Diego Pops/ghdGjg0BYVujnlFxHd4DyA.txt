Stephen was one of the best waiters I've ever had. He dealt with such a large group so perfectly. He had great recommendations too! No one was ever without a drink. Best service ever. 

Now on to the food...so delicious! The house salad is a little sweet but they have an array of salsas to spice anything up! The beet crema salsa is out of this world good. The salmon was perfectly cooked and seasoned. 

I'm so happy I've found this place, it is one of the rare Mexican food joints that can be extremely healthy and is really conscious of different dietary restrictions. 

We both had two drinks each, appetizers, and entrees for about $50. That's a steal on date night  in old town if you ask me!

Not to mention the mango habanero margarita is one of THE BEST MARGARITAS IVE EVER HAD!!! I will 100% come back just for this. You know how most spicy margs are a little earthy? This wasn't like that at all! The chili rim had me licking my glass (no shame). 

Props to the decor as well!
