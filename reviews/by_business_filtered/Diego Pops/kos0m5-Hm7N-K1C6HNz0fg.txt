My coworkers and I traveled to Scottsdale for a work convention, and I planned a dinner event with Diego Pops. From top to bottom they were AMAZING! Not only was the staff great to work with and were incredibly attentive to each of our nearly 30 guests, but the food was amazing. They were proud of their award-winning tacos and special sauces and rightly so! The drinks were amazing as well - I personally LOVED the prickly pear margarita. My coworkers keep talking about how good the food and drinks were days after the event. The venue was perfect for our group as well. It is a nice blend of trendy and laid-back seating, and we loved being able to sit both inside and outside with their lovely patio. I was surprised that the venue wasn't packed when we were there either because the prices are so good. Next time we are back in town, we will definitely be making a stop back at Diego Pops.
