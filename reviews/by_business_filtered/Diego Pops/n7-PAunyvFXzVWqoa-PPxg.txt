Cute outdoor patio. Our outdoor reservation wasn't honored and we were sat inside. We wanted this cute little place to be fantastic, unfortunately it wasn't. Our table was abandoned and we felt shunned as if we were lepers. Our drink orders were received late and spastically when we simply ordered "another round". Our table was left un-bussed and waters empty. Apps, were dropped on the table before our first round. My tacos were not fresh from the frig cold but far from warm.
When it was time for finish up our second and last visit to Diego the waitress sprang to life and retrieved our bill in under 30 seconds. I'd have been nice if she would have been able to deliver our first round in under 30 seconds, in reality it was closer to 30 minutes.
