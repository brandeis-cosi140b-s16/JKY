This place is awesome! Tried it for a taco Tuesday this week to try a new place and will be coming back for Happy Hour for sure. The HH prices are unreal for the quality of food! Half off Apps....... yes please! 
Great variety of food as well, the green chilli quesadilla was so good I ordered two and the salsa was on point! 

Down side no taco Tuesday specials but they say they do them on Monday. Taco Monday.... Guess ill be trying them out on a Monday. 
Service was really great too! Taylor was our waitress and she was perfect! Remembered all orders, had a great personality and was fun to banter with in food selections. 

Wish there was more larger table settings outside. Only had tables of 2,4 and a 6-8 table. Would of been nice to have more room to spread out. 

All in all- heck yes I'm going back and taking people!
