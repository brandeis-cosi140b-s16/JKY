Not a bad little place.

The inside has a weird 50s diner-ish look to it.  I did not like it, and next time will choose the patio area which seemed much nicer.  Our service was very good when we went.

We started with the corn queso dip.  I liked it a lot and would recommend it.

We tried a selection of the tacos.  They were good, but nothing stands out as great.
