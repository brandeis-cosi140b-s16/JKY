I'm a fan!!  I like the decor, there's a large patio space and there is plenty of room inside that kinda reminds me of a standard Mexican restaurant but with splotches of chic vintage decor.

Happy hour deal is awesome.  Taco Mondays are awesome.  The pricing is not even close to greedy which is rare in Old Town.

The food is good too!  We tried just about one of every taco and the only one I was a little disappointed by was the skirt steak one - needs more flavor.  BUT this can be easily remedied by a large array of sauces/salsas that come to the table with your food!  We also tried the fish taco which was excellent.  The braised pork and chicken ones are solid.  

Its so refreshing to find an establishment in Old Town that's just so good all around!  Great food, great service, AND great pricing??  This is one of my favorite spots already!
