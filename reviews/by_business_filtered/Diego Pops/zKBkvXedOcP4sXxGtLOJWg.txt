Came in to check out some tacos.  Hands down best place in Scottsdale for tacos and drinks alike.  Their all scratch kitchen and all scratch bar are by far the best I've had.  Bar tender Kimber took great care of us behind the bar.  Told us to come in and check out taco Monday's.  Hands down we'll be back Monday.  Come in and check out this place.  It's a must.
