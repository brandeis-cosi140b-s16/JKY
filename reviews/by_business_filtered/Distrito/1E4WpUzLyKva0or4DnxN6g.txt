great, great hotel restaurant.  i didn't realize til now that this guy also owns Mercat in chicago, another awesome restaurant in the city.  i loved that place, so i shouldn't be surprised about distrito.  

i stayed here one night with some of my lady friends and ate lunch and breakfast.  oh, and pool snacks.  we had:

lunch:

the guac.  OH YEAH.  and if you check in on yelp, it's all FREE and shit!   it was super goooooooood.

the carnitas tacos.  small.  but tasty.  tres tacos presented on a cool, taco-plate-thing.

brunch:

my friend and i did halvsies on:

the eggs benny
the french toast

it was the first time my friend ever had eggs benny, and it was delicious.  so was the french toast.  it was all, frenchy and toasty.  and it had some sort of creamy topping or filling on/in it.  it was SO good.

phil was the one who served us both times.  hi phil.  you're a nice man.  and cute, too.  we sat out on the patio both times, since it was beautiful out and when you're visiting from chicago, march has the WORST weather.  we soaked up that sun so good.

the decor inside though was pretty awesome.  walls made of those puffy balls you find at the ends of your ankle sock heels, and seatbelt straps woven into each other.  pretty.
