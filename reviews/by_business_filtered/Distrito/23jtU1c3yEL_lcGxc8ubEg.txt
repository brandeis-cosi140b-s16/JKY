My husband and I booked brunch at Distrito and could not be more disappointed. It was one of the worst service experiences we've ever had. Our waiter was incredibly entitled and rude acting. My husband ordered a drink and the waiter snapped "that's the most repulsive thing on the menu" after he acted completely offended when we requested brunch menus. Bt the way, this was a reservation made on open table for brunch. The food was okay, but pretty forgettable. We will never be back!
