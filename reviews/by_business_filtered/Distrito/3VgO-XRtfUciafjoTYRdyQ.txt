We came here to try out this new place I saw in the magazine. The place/ambiance and the colorful walls was nice! There was a live performance which is cool. Our server explained really well the menu because it was our first time. My boyfriend and I ordered the guacamole with crab which is so good, for the main course we ordered carnitas taco and pork belly. The pork belly was okay, I'm not a fan of the beans that came with it, the portion was small and it was $20- not worth it. The carnitas was excellent! The flavors just exploded in my mouth. The service was good but in the end it took them forever to take the bill so we have to wait. I'll probably come back for happy hour and eat the carnitas again.
