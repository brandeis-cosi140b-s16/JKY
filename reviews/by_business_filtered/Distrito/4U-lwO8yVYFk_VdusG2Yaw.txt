Wow, what a disappointment. In what aspects? Honestly, all aspects. Here's some detail.....

Service: We sat for about 10 minutes before anyone filled water (sat with empty glasses), had to ask for more water 3 times throughout the meal, waitress was on her first day on her own, which I get, everyone has a first day, but she didn't know the menu, never had any desserts so couldn't recommend one and when we asked what we should get "to go", she said she wouldn't know, bizarre! Saw our bus boy twice, no water, dirty table.  Honestly on a 10 point scale, service was a 3.

Food: mediocre at best. Absolutely not James Beard quality. Why? Steak absolutely unflavorful, guacamole was an avocado with no spices and a sprinkle of Mexican cheese,..,for $10.  Fish tacos had a nice chipotle sauce, but it was over a fish stick, poor. Dessert was a chocolate torte. Literally, the chocolate layer cake (cupcake) was out of the freezer. The little chocolate log was okay. Food on s scale of 1 to 10 was maybe a 5.

Atmosphere: cheap and strange. Trying to be eclectic, but it just seems "forced". The hotel it's in is clearly a "pig wearing lipstick". It's an old hotel that has been poorly kept up and painted in funky colors and with unusual "amenities" that simply make it feel like what it is, an older, poorly maintained building that is trying to be trendy in a K-Mart/IKEA kind of way.

Summary: There's definitely a reason you see this restaurant on Groupon. They need to get people in the door and the food, service and value aren't doing it. AZ88 next door was packed and known for good food and service. But, this place was pretty empty, for good reason. Expensive for mediocre food and poor service. If this is an award winning restaurant, they are clearly missing some critical controls to keep it worthy. My prediction, this place won't make it. Here's a good way to gauge, if I were in the area again, I would rather try just about any unknown restaurant than go back to Distrito.
