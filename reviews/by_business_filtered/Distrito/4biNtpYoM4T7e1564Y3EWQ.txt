I had high expectations. Ordered the elderflower martinis after having them at La Hacienda. The difference being they use hibiscus syrup. Being a fan of St Germain liqueur I tried it. Big disappointment. Maybe it's the tequila but it's far from La Hacienda's version. 
The guacamole is very good and the shrimp ceviche appetizer is a little too busy for my liking. Too many flavours. 
I tried the duck tacos. Mine had muscle joints in the first bite which is not very appetizing. Very oily so couldn't taste the duck. Nonetheless it was ok.  Also tried the hamburger which my partner said was delicious.  For an iron chef restaurant I'm disappointed.
