This is the first Yelp review I have ever written but I had such a great time here that I had to share! While staying at the Saguaro, my friend and I popped into Distrito twice. Both times we sat at the bar while Jay was bartending. This guy is incredible! The watermelon margarita he made was by far the best I have ever had! He was extremely knowledgeable about tequilas and also created several other concoctions that were amazing! We also had a few plates from here and the food was great, and I normally am not much of a Mexican fan but it was all delicious. I highly recommend this place and make sure to sit at the bar and watch Jay work his magic!
