Located in a beautiful corner of the Scottsdale Civic Center, the restaurant itself is bright and eye-catching.  I was the only one there for breakfast on this particular morning.

I ordered the Cochinita Verde, which is a slow cooked pork dish paired with breakfast potatoes, a fried egg, and flour tortillas.  The pork was tender, but it lacked certain brightness I associate with authentic Mexican cuisine.  The flour tortillas were thicker than the ones I'm used to as well.

The coffee is really good here.  I rarely comment on coffee, because it seems like a standard item across all restaurants, but this is a good one.

Service was welcoming and everything came out in good timing.  I'd go back to this place, but I'd probably wouldn't order the same thing again.
