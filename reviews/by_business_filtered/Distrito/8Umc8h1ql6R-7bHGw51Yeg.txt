We rented out the Zocalo Room at the hotel and all of the food came from Distrito. What can I say - if i could give 10 stars, I would. We had a group of 14 people and every single person raved about each and every dish, the wait staff and bartender were SUPERB and so friendly. I have never felt so taken care of at a restaurant before. 

Food and drink wise, another 10+. Guacamole, the salad, the tacos...everything was fantastic.

Thanks to the whole team for making our event so special. We'll definitely be back.
