This place was just so-so. I got the guacamole, which seemed lacking in flavor, a michelada, which was tasty, and an order of something with duck, duck queso? Something was super weird about it. The weird part about it was I was in a pretty empty place, on a Saturday... I thought the decor was cute, but the food needs work.
