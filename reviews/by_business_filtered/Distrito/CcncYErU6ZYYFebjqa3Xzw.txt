I ended up at Distrito thrice in the same weekend while I was celebrating my birthday at the Saguaro.  It was the perfect stumbling ground for some much needed (and delicious) sustenance between drinking!

The guacamole was a definite fave amongst the entire group.  I ended up ordering the Queso Fundido with duck barbacoa twice - YES, it was THAT good!

The breakfast the was included as part of the resort fee had everything I could have asked for - juices, bagels/toasts with an array of spreads, perfectly cooked bacon, delicious scrambled eggs, potatoes, house-made sausage patties, fresh croissants & pain au chocolats, yogurt & granola... all awesome!

The decor is simple and funky, with the exception of the super-bright marquee menu board, which can be an assault on the senses - especially if you are there for some late night grub! 

I will be back - hopefully for the bloody mary brunch!
