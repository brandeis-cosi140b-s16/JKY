Nestled into the heart of Old Town, at the former Mondrian location....I just had to come here knowing that Chef Jose Garces YES... celebrity Iron Chef was the genius behind the menu.....drool!
All menu selections were served in sharing portions which makes this perfect for small groups or out on a date. Choose from a selection of ceviche or Barbacoa plate selections.....and tacos from A to Z. And can I tell you... a library of tequila to kill ya! 
Patio seating under the clear AZ skies....my fork was ready! And I was not dissapointed. ENJOY
