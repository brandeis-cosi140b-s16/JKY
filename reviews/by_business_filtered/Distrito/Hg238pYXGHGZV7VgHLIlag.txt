Oh my. Way over the top as a physical setting and expections way beyond results at the table. Pretentious servers. Nice review of the drill and specials. But really no service beyond that. Margareta selection seems interesting but nothing special. Mahi tacos quite good...particulaly with the aoli base. Barbeques heavy,over spiced nothing subtle here. The plantain was interesting as a side. 

Decor is bizarre. Knotty pine,  voodoo art, lots of glass bottles of mexican soda as decoration, elements of modern lighting, patterned but plain chairs and tables. Maybe 3-4 designers who didnt talk to each other?
