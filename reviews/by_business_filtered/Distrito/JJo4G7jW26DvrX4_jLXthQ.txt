Service outweighs the food, and not in a good way. While we had made a slight error in not including two toddlers in our reservation at 5:30 on a Sunday, they stuck us at a high table. We asked the hostess if we could sit at the standard size table (same size - 6) next to ours and was rudely told that it was reserved for another party. When we asked for clarification, seeing that we had two children under 2 and the table was about a foot taller than the high chairs, she said it was in another servers zone and they can't do anything about it. Okay, I get that there could be issues with zones, but maybe try being nice and not jerks about it? 

Next, we ordered guacamole - 1 jalapeño and one without (for the kids) they placed the jalapeño one in front of the kids and said it was without, but said it was the opposite.  Luckily we caught it.

Last complaint, the time it took to get our food was extremely long. Luckily its right on the park there and we spent our time on the grass with the kids while we waited. 

I should note the waitress was very nice and attentive, but the rest of the experience was definitely the low point of our trip.
