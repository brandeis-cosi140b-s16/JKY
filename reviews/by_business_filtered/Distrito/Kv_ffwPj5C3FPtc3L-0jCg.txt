Another Jose Garces joint -  unique experience in the Saguaro hotel. The decor is funky and the waiters are all hipsters in kicks. Maybe trying a bit too hard. 

Yelp check in deal for guac....sweet.

The menu is Mexican with a twist. The lengua tacos were dripping tender goodness. A bit pricey for what you get. The queso fundido was cheesy gooey tasty. Sangria was a bit light.

Seems to pick up after night and some long benches make for a good group session. The hotel is similarly funky.
