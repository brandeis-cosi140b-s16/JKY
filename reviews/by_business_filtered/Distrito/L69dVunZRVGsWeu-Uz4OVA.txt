This review isn't for the restaurant per se but for some of their staff

We went to the Scottsdale Center for Performing Arts for a music concert tonight and Distrito was there to provide appetizers.

I can't eat Jambalaya (shrimp allergy) but they had guacamole and chips so we requested that. The "chips" were fried pork skins however so we decided to pass. A few minutes later we were surprised when one of their staff came over to tell us they got some tortilla chips just for us... one of the people here at the booth walked over to the restaurant and came back with a basket of chips specifically so they could fulfill our request.
 

That's going the extra mile in my book and definitely worth 5 stars for CUSTOMER SERVICE.

Based on this experience we will definitely try the restaurant.

FYI... the guacamole and chips are really good.
