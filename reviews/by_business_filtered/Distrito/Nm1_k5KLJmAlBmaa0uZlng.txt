We had a very memorable meal at Distrito,! After reading the other reviews, we were ready for the moderate serving sizes (we don't need huge piles of food). Our table was on the patio, and the warm evening sunset added to the relaxed feeling.
 
The hostess left both the happy hour menu, M-Th 5-7, with much cheaper prices! We ordered a hand made guacamole, the tuna ceviche, and four of the street tacos. The food is art, with the small tacos looking like beautiful pieces of sushi. The food was incredible in both presentation and taste.

We finished by sharing a delicious dessert. We were extremely happy with every aspect of this restaurant. If you want huge portions with cheap prices, go elsewhere. If you can appreciate truly innovative Mexican food, that will blow your mind, try Distrito!
