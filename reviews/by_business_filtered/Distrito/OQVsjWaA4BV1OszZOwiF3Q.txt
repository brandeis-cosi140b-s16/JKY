Great Mexican food for foodies. I had the guacamole and chipotle and shrimp tacos which were small but absolutely delicious. The Jefe margarita was not generous in portion ($13) but very, very good. 

Service was friendly and average in attentiveness.

The ambience is delightful...there was a live guitarist playing on a Saturday night. Would definitely repeat.
