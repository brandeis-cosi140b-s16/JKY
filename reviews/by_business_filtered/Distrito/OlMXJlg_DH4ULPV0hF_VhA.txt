Food was great however service was super slow. I asked for lemon for my water and seafood as soon as I placed the order. It didn't come until after I was done with my seafood starter and my water glass was half empty. My drink also came after my food arrived. Even though I asked for it after I placed my food order, server should have coordinated it to assure it got here before.
