The food was GREAT.  Since we were there for restaurant week, we were able to enjoy a sampling of their items and loved everything (ceviche, nachos, mahi mahi tacos).  The service was okay.  The food was so good that I really want to give it more stars.  I never thought decor and energy of a place would be such a turn off but sadly, it was for me and Distrito.

My main issue with Distrito is that the decor is too colorful and busy.  It also seemed too casual (i.e. outdoor seating of picnic tables) given the menu seemed a bit more upscale.  We were seated at a small table inside that had a bright pink glittery top. Alone it would have been super cool but it was too much to take in with the multi-colored and differently designed walls and tables around us.  We asked to move to a table with a normal top which was a table too large for just 2 people.  A couple of the walls and the bungee cord divider reminded us of Easter Basket designs which was strange.  Overall, the place is a bit of an eye sore.  

The energy level in the place was very low but it was a Monday night and the bartender said it's much livelier Thursday-Saturday.
