I would have given this place 4.5 stars.

Nice decor, great location and good food.

Tried:

Guacamole & chips - very fresh and delicious
Carnitas tacos with pineapple/jalapeno salsa, radishes, on homemade corn tortillas (moist and delicious), street taco sized (3 of them).  Delicious
Chilen relleno - stuffed with kale, quinoa and cotija cheese in smoked pepper sauce.  The sauce was flavorful, the rest of it was a bit bland.

A little pricey for the size but worth it.  Apparently they have Taco Tuesdays and happy hour that is pretty good.
