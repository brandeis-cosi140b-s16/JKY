Decided to come here last night because we saw it in a hotel magazine advertising for supposed upscale, fine dining restaurants. Walked in around 8:30pm on a Saturday night, it was my girlfriend and I and only three other tables. That should have been my first sign to walk out. 
Service was good but given how few patrons there were, service should have been exceptional. 
Food was mediocre at best. Sad when the highlight of your Iron Chef restaurant is your guacamole and chips.  Some of the plates were downright terrible and shortly after dinner I got very ill out of nowhere.  Worst part was I tried to order a blended cocktail like they show in their ad and our waitress told me that's not possible because they don't have a blender.  

Portions are small, prices are decent.  All in all I would never go back but I don't think there's much risk of that because I would be surprised if this place stays open much longer.
