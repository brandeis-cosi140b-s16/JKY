Went here for my birthday with my family.  On all accounts, it was amazing!  For one, Scottsdale has needed a good tapas place.  Now we have it.  The service was fantastic, the atmosphere is fun and funky, and the food is fabulous.  My mom loved the chips and guac.  The guac was nice and limey.  My favorites were the steak in adobo and the chorizo shrimp tacos.  Though it's tapas, you actually get a good bit of food in each item.  My suggestion is to start with 2 plates per person and then build from there.  We over ordered, but it was amazing.
Will definitely be back.
