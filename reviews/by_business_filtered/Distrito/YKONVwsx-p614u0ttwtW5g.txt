Ate here last night with a Groupon. Saturday night at 7 p.m. and the place was totally empty. Not a good sign. This hotel has really gone downhill in the public areas. It is dirty and run down. The bathrooms had PAINTED over tile, gross. It was borderline creepy. 
Distrito has this tasting menu thing for $55/person and it is a total joke. I think they change it for the Groupon people so it's just the cheapest things they offer. It was guacamole with cold, broken chips, then a tiny ahi tuna appetizer then a serving of 3 tacos for each person. The tuna appetizer was really good, but there should be one for each person, not just one. There is a huge sign up in the bar that says $2 Taco Tuesdays. Okay, so for $55 a person, I just got a $9 guacamole, an $11 appetizer and what would be on Tuesdays $12 worth of tacos? That alone would not add up to $55 for one person, let alone two. The fish taco was a rock hard piece of fish that had been fried to death, too. It also came with one drink per person. 
the one thing we ordered extra and it was very, very good was the duck barbacoa. That is what is keeping me from one star review. That dish was excellent. 
Our service was pretty bad, but the waitress knew this and comped the barbacoa, so at least one thing positive. 
Anyway, don't buy the Groupon thing-it's a joke for $69.00. Just come here and order the barbacoa and some chips and salsa, which was pretty good salsa. But you better go quick as I don't think Distrito is going to be around much longer.
