First of all, I'm usually skeptical of restaurant reviews in those free city magazines you see when traveling. When we arrived in Phoenix our luggage didn't so we were stuck in airport reading all the "what to do in..." literature. Distrito was featured in Where and the photo caught me right away; the design looked funky and inviting. We decided to give it a try and boy did it prove my skeptisicm wrong. Excellent experience from start to finish. When you walk in you are met by a wall of Day of the Dead masks and bright colors everywhere. Our server, Chris, made it a special night. He knew the menu and instilled a fun attitude. The menu is tapas style and the prices are well worth the quality. The food came fast, was hot, fresh, and delicious. Great service. And the food was exceptional. We loved guac, which was made at a station fresh, the ceviches and the carnitas tacos. Highly recommend.
