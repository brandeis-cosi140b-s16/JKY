The locale itself is beautiful. Our server, Brittania, was relatively new, yet did a fantastic job!!! The food not as great. Guacamole had good taste but it was too "mushy" for our taste. We had the carnitas and the shrimp/chorizo tacos. Not a lot of meat on them, but flavors were good. Until we went back to our room and something did not do me any good. I would definitely come back for a drink because of the ambiance and great service, but would not drive for the food
