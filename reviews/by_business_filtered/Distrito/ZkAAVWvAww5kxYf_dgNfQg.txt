Coming from Austin, TX where modern mexican food is the best, I was highly impressed. The vibe might be the coolest in Old Town. The decor is right up my alley, young/hip/sexy. The guac is unbelievable, the beef brisket is so tendor and juicy. The beef tacos are the bomb. Nothing bad to say about this place. I hope it makes it. The only negative was the staff, took awhile to come greet us when we sat down. The place was pretty empty on a Thursday night at 8pm. Ohh, I forgot that they had live music and the guy playing sounded like the frontman from Fleet Foxes. Hopefully people will hear about this place and make it more popular.
