Distrito = Distrito Federal, i.e. Mexico City. I like the low light atmosphere and great selection of craft cocktails. The Mezcal Mule was legit, got that true smokey mezcal flavor in a strong dose. 

The menu uses some really creative ingredients and the dishes are exciting, including some desserts that are downright beautiful to look at.  You wouldn't think to include cilantro in a dessert but it worked perfectly (can't remember name, crema something maybe?).  Also tried the coconut cream chicken enchiladas. Unique flavor, I was a big fan. Unfortunately the insides of the enchiladas were cold, despite being served on a hot iron skillet. 

The previous evening I had the salmon ceviche, which was incredible, and the carne asada. The carne asada tasted great despite being too tough to chew in parts, must have  been a tad unlucky with that cut. Regardless, I will keep coming back.  Love it!
