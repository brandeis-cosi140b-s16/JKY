Sorry to write a poor review. It's definitely not the worst I've ever had but do NOT go here if you're hungry. Very small portions and expensive for being so small. Service was good, really cool vibe in the restaurant itself (eg good decor).  I would recommend the guacamole and the drinks, I got the agave drink and it was awesome.  But ya I don't think I would be going back unless I was forced into it by my friends for some sort of event. Good service though so can't hate on that.
