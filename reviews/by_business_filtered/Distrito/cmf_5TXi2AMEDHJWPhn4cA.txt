DISTRITOS is tucked away in the (very funky) Saguaro hotel in Old Town Scottsdale. I agree with other reviewer DISTRITOS is geared to a younger crowd. Although I don't qualify anymore, with my taste buds are in tact and my family buds were in tow ,we gave lunch a go. The Express lunch at $15 is the way to go. You get a choice of a small appetizer and small entree. Small but tasty. Service is trendy but we just bitch slapped the rude waiter and he fell into line. If your hungry and want a big meal of really good food,go to DISTRITOS and order for two.
