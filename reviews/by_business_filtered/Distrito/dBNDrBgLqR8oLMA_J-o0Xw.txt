OK, I've been here twice and I have to give this Mexican Modern restaurant an A+ for ambience.  They have clearly taken care to really focus on the decorative details.  The food, unfortunately, is another matter entirely.  Dinner portions are 'tapas style' which I believe is just an excuse for them to present excruciatingly small portions at uncomfortably high price points.  I ordered  the pulpo which was beautifully presented, but short on flavor.  The chicken tacos were likewise beautifully presented, but were virtually absent of any actual chicken.  Each small corn tortilla was covered in a mound which consisted almost entirely of a red mole type sauce which had a single note flavor and drowned out all the other ingredients.  My dinner companion ordered a tamale which came out in a modern deconstructed style, but portion size was again an issue.  This tamale was certainly no more than a third of the size of a normal tamale and the ingredients were also drowning in mole sauce making it a one note experience.  Including tax and tip, $26 for two miniscule dishes is simply too high a price to pay regardless of cute decor.  Not sure about the long term prospects of this establishment and given the history of this particular location and the abundance of dining choices in Old Town, they really need to bring their A game in order to succeed.

Another disappointed reviewer below wonders why she didn't stroll over to The Mission which, for the same price point, would have provided a far heartier meal.  I would have to agree that for a complete dining experience, including creative and flavorful latin cuisine, The Mission is a far superior option.
