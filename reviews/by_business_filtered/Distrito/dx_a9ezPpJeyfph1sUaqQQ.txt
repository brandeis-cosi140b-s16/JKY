Really good food that's just a little dressed up (Iron Chef style).

Tacos carnitas: Excellent.  Pork done perfect, tastes rich and crisp.
Ceviches: Odd.  The hamachi and atun were really more sashimis -- completely raw but with nice sauces
Cochinita a la pibil: Pork cooked just right, lots of good spices and flavors.  A tad mushy, but...
Spare ribs: As good as they get. 

Pricey but, for the most part, well worth it.
