Yelp describes two stars as "Meh. I've experienced better." How fitting - my EXACT feelings on Distrito. 

Myself, my boyfriend, and another couple from out of town had dinner at the restaurant on Saturday night, as we were staying at the Saguaro to enjoy the pool and Old Town Scottsdale. We were seated promptly for our reservation -- in fact, the restaurant was nearly empty at 7:30 on a Saturday night -- weird, but okay. 

We ordered drinks - the guys ordered the Mexican mules, which they said were pretty good. I ordered an Elderflower margarita, which I would NOT recommend. It had a very syrupy taste. I asked the server if I could please order another drink instead, and he said sure, and brought me a glass of wine, telling me the wine was "on the house" since I didn't like the original drink. Very nice, but unnecessary. Well, surprise surprise, when the bill came the margarita - more expensive by about $4, and taken away from the table - was still on the check! Um, would have rather paid for the drink I actually had. 

The food was just okay. Everyone at the table ordered some variety of tacos, and we all agreed that the tortillas were far too thick and overwhelmed the small amount of toppings.

For me, the service is what sealed the deal on never coming back to Distrito again -- when there are SO MANY great restaurants in the area, Distrito should realize that service is what sets you apart. We waited over 30 minutes to place an order. My friend waited that same amount of time to get her drink, after asking twice. When we were trying to place an order, a server walked by and we said "excuse me" -- he made eye contact and kept walking. No thanks! 

I would recommend spending your time and money at another Old Town restaurant that will give you great food and service!!!
