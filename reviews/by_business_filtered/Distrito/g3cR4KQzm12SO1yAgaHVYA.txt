Meh. It was ok. Margaritas were good but margaritas are always good, service was acceptable though definitely not friendly (our waitress warmed up a little after she dropped a fork on my dad), and the food varied greatly in terms of taste and quality. Do not come here expecting typical tex-mex food. Even though I knew what I was getting into, I still felt like something was lacking. My sister's mahimahi tacos were delicious, but the others were just ok, and the larger plates were also just ok: Pork belly better than salmon better than chicken. It ended up being quite an expensive meal, and just ok.
