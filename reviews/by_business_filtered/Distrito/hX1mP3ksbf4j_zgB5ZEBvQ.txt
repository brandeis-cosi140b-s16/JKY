stopped by around 2:30, sat outside on the patio. great lunch menu for $15 one small plate and entree.

we had the ceviche, red snapper tacos, and nachos with sangria and coronas.

will definitely be back.  Great patio that overlooks the park behind the hotel.


really liked the design of the restaurant. our new favorite mexican restaurant.
