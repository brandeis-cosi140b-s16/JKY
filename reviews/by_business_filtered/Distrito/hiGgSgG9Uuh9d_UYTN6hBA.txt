First time in Scottsdale.  Stayed at The Saguaro. Luckily for us,  The Distrito is part of the hotel.  Went to dinner there 2 nights in a row....awesome.  melt in your mouth brisket. Amazing mahi mahi tacos. Tamales with mole. Ceviche and pulpo. Great wine list. Great service.  Our waiter Chris had great wine pairing recommendations.  Go hungry and order one of everything
