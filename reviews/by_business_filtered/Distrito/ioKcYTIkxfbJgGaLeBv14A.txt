A colleague recommended Distrito as a good spot for my husband and I to have dinner while in town for business. We were excited to try it as I love to eat, and it had a reputation as being a bit trendy.

When we walked in I was super excited to see the decor, a gumball wall, glitter top tables and other fun touches. It's really a sight to behold. We chose to sit outside, since it was a beautiful night.

Upon our servers recommendation we ordered a couple drinks, and some guacamole. Then we ordered the tuna ceviche, a few tacos, the corn crema and a few other things. The taste of the tuna ceviche was quite good, as was the corn. The rest of the food was frankly underwhelming. 

The worst part of the night was the service. Our server efficiently took our orders, however, a runner delivered our food. We never saw anyone again, not to check on our food, and we could never find anyone to ask for our check. Finally we asked another server for our check. Our server apologized profusely and admitted that he had forgotten about us. We accepted his apology, and it does happen, but they were not busy at all. 

We were very disappointed in our experience.
