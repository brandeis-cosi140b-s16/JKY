I've eaten at Distrito twice, and I have to say the first time was definitely a better experience. Three of us met for breakfast, and it was excellent! We grabbed a spot on the almost deserted patio in the warm morning sun, which was lovely despite the plastic chairs (they got a little sticky on my bare legs as the sun came up further...!) The decor is bright and vibrant, just like the rest of the hotel, with a cool rustic slant that I liked a lot. 

Our server was really sweet and attentive, and kept our water constantly refilled. We all ordered the Huevos Rancheros (I'm a sucker - I LOVE Huevos!), and I was very excited to try it somewhere it was likely to be more authentic than Canada! I really enjoyed my dish; it was filling and well cooked, but definitely hotel-ified, if you know what I mean! The sauce was a little sweet, and there were some greens and radish sprinkled on top more for decoration than flavour. I loved the cast iron it was served in, though.

My second experience was dining solo in the evening. I entered via the patio gate, still relatively early - around 8pm, but was mostly ignored by the server (this became a theme) until brusquely directed to the hostess on the other side of the restaurant. She was lovely and showed me straight to a table on the (sparsely populated) patio. The same "charming" server eventually came by to give me menus, and was not very responsive when I asked her questions about the drinks and dishes. She did make some recommendations, which was good because it was hard to read the menu with only the light from one candle on the table! I ordered the Enchilada de Pollo and the Distrito Margarita. The cocktail was pretty good, but the enchilada was disappointing. It had an odd, over sweet taste to it, and not enough spice for me. I drenched it in hot sauce, which helped, but it wasn't my favourite. 

I'd come back for sure, but probably in the morning!
