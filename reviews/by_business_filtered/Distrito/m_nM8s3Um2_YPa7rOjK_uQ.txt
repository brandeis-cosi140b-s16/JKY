We are here at The Saguaro to stay for the weekend, and ended up at the bar for some drinks and grub.  First the bad: beer is not on tap.  What the hey??? It's a billion degrees outside, Arizona! Don't you want a cold brewski on tap?

The VERY good: the tacos were delicioso! Especially the hongos (mushroom). Rich, savory, filling. The fish tacos were light, crispy, with crunchy veggie garnishes. 

Worthwhile stop, except for that beer...
