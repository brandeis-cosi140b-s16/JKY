I really wanted to like this place, but it just doesn't deliver. 

The decor was modern mexican and very colorful, but the food was not impressive and the prices were high for what you get, even for downtown Scottsdale. The servers were friendly, but overly attentive and borderline annoying to the point where they kept wanting to remove our plates before we were finished. 

I ordered the Jefe margarita for $15, which was served in a tiny glass filled with mostly ice.  What little margarita I had was very smooth, but two sips later, it was all gone. My friend had the red sangria which she liked and was actually served in a regular size glass. 

We shared the Camarones Cevichi which was good, and the chips and guacamole which might have been the only thing worth the price we paid for it. We also shared the Chicken Tacos  and the Mexico City Style Quesadilla - both looked pretty, but underwhelmed on taste.  $70 dollars later, I wondered why we just didn't walk across the park to The Mission. 

Iron Chef Jose Garces might be a great chef, but this new restaurant falls short.
