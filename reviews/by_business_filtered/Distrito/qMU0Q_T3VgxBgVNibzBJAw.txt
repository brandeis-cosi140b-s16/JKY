My friend and I stopped in for a quick snack before tackling the AmeriCAN beer fest at the Civic Center yesterday. The decor is really cool, very comfortable but modern and fun. The hostess was great too, however our waiter was determined to leave a bad taste in our mouths. I'm not sure if it was how we dressed (maybe looked like beer fans and not his type of clientele) or the fact that we just wanted the ceviche and waters- but he didn't hide his disdain for us or our small order. He said "that's it!??"And then grabbed our menus and walked away muttering under his breath. When we ordered chips and salsa a bit later, he advised us that "well it's not free, it's actually 5 more dollars" as if our order was so small that we couldn't afford chips. The ceviche and chips were great, but I would hope the staff could try and make guests feel welcome regardless of check amount.
