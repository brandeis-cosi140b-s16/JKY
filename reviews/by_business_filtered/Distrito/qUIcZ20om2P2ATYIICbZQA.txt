We stayed at The Saguaro on Saturday for TJ's birthday and came here for dinner and wound up coming back again the following afternoon after a fun day of boozing it up at the pool. 

They have a simple menu and the food is meant to be served tapas style. The food also comes out as it's ready so the service may seem disorganized and uncoordinated, but that's just how meals are served. 

Their homemade guacamole is to die for and also comes with chipotle salsa. Tip for Yelpers: Check-in here on your phone and you get free chips and guac!

I had the the JG Steak Supremo tacos which were three small tacos served up with avocado, refried beans the the most tender, melt in your mouth cuts of skirt steak I've ever had. Accompanied with charro beans, this really was a top notch meal, washed down with Dos Equis. I also got to try a Mahi Mahi taco which was delicious. And the girls raved on about the Queso Fundido with duck barbacoa.

The portions on the tacos are very small, but if you have the chips and guac and a side, you will leave feeling satisfied to full. The atmosphere is trendy casual, while the prices are upscale casual. 

A great place to grab a bite. I can't wait to come back for brunch!
