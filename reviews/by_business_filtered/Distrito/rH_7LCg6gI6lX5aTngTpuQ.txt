Sadly, Distrito does not live up to an Iron Chef's restaurant expectations. I've been to this restaurant three times just to verify that I wasn't missing something. I found the pricing to be somewhat reasonable but most of the dishes were hit and miss...mostly miss. 

Service was subpar each visit and most employees seemed like they didn't want to be there. The restaurant really wasn't too busy so not much excuse for good service. 

The descriptions on the menu make the selections sound appetizing but none of dishes tasted anything like what was described and also found that there was usually an off putting flavor in most dishes. Can't be more descriptive except that every dish ordered seemed to be missing something or had something added that didn't enhance the experience.

This is the second Chef Garces restaurant I've tried (Chifa in Philadelphia also)  and found both to be just OK. Chifa recently closed in Philadelphia due to poor quality and service and I wouldn't be surprised if Distrito follows suit.
