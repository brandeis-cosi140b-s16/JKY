this was a second stop on recent bike pub ride with Rage cycles. i like the new bar/restaurant layout. they have a very Dia de los muertos motif going on. it is bright and open, but intimate and not stuffy. 
there are flecked gold tables in the bar area and large wall with skull sculptures lining the shelves. the bar is replete with soft mood lighting, but there's an overall feel of swanky, 70's ish-ness to it. the white starkness is gone and this area is much more inviting and conducive to drinking!

our bartender was friendly and quick, important on a pub ride.
