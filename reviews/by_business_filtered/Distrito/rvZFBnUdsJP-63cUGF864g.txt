Yummy and cute. The Yelp reviews had me worried, but my sister was staying at the Saguaro for a visit, so we thought we would try it out for lunch. The guacamole was awesome! And the tacos were delicious. We'll be back for Taco Tuesday. $15 lunch special with appetizer, tacos and soft drink was a great deal to boot.
