We went to Distrito for a special mother's day brunch, but ended up being taken for a pricey ride. My family and I wanted to do something special for Mother's Day and so made online reservations for Distrito. The website mentioned that there would be a buffet, but did not name a price. 

Upon arrival, we were surprised to find that our only option was the buffet line. None of us were starving, but by that point we figured we didn't have a choice and so ordered a pitcher of sangria for the table and went and got food. 

To say that the buffet line was disappointing would be an understatement. The food was not fresh and appeared to have been sitting for quite some time - ours was a later seating (1:30), so it looked like we were getting the leftovers from the big rush. There were a few cold salads, four hot dishes, grilled corn, and a meat carving station. The salads were underwhelming, the hot dishes dessicated, and the carving station decidedly meh. For example, one of the hot dishes was Eggs Benedict - it had been sitting in the chafing dish for so long that the yolks of the poached egg were cooked solid. I will say that the grilled corn and guacamole were quite good - although the chips to go with the guac were stale. 

Beyond this, they had a thoroughly average omelette station, as well as a street taco station serving the same street tacos that the giant sign on the wall said sold for $2 each on Taco Tuesday. 

Dessert was a selection of what looked like pre-packaged pastries and lukewarm, dried-out bread pudding.

When the waitress finally brought our check, we were shocked to find that they charged us $45 per head, plus $32 for the sangria. You expect to pay a bit of a premium for Scottsdale on Mother's Day, but close to $300 for four people to eat dried up, mediocre food is ridiculous. And as an added bonus, all four of 4 of us have been suffering from "gastrointestinal irregularities" the next day.
