We enjoyed our dinner here very much. Yes, the decor is dark but modern, and we found it to be quite romantic for our purposes. I can see how a large group would not appreciate this though.

The waitress was knowledgable and excited about the food offering and my husband, never one to make a choice on his own, received an earful when he asked for a recommendation. Our waitress listed about 4 or 5 of her favorites! Needless to say, it didn't make his decision any easier, but I like hearing and seeing the servers get excited about where they work.

We ordered chips & guacamole and it was fantastic. You could taste the smokiness of the roasted jalapenos and the covering of grated cotija cheese was a great touch (and one I will steal the next time I make guac). 

We also ordered a carafe of Sangria which I absolutely loved. Some of the best I've tasted. 

My husband ordered the pork belly and I ordered the prawns. both meals were superbly done, not too large, but definately enough to fill us up.

Embarassingly, my husband informed them that it was my birthday, so we were treated to a chocolate explosion on a plate which was absolutely amazing.
