I'm pains me to give Distrito only 3 stars. I've been to the original location in Philadelphia and counted down the days until it opened in Scottsdale a ways back. I've been here for my birthday and considered it one of my favorite restaurants, but last time I went I had a really bad experience.

 I was thrilled when I was able to get one of those Groupon type things for Distrito. I took a friend and we ordered our usual - fantastic fish tacos and margaritas. 

The waiter seemed nice at first, but when we presented our coupon he grew annoyed and disappeared for like 45 minutes with it while we were waiting to check out. He eventually came back and told us in a rude way that he would be including a 20% gratuity and then was nowhere to be found for like another 30 minutes while we waited with our credit card. He finally took our credit card and after what seemed like eons we were able to leave. I felt this was so rude considering we eat here all the time and would have left a nice tip but after the behavior and his forcing me to leave a tip I felt the need to write this review and likely won't go back as it left a bad taste in my mouth for Distrito.
