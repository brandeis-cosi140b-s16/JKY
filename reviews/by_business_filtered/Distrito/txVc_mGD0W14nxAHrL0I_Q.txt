The atmosphere was cool, urban, trendy feel. Very open feel, dining inside is surrounded by the outdoor windows and has a very light and airy feel too it

I really enjoyed the food and experience. Our waiter/bartender, Lucky was very friendly and helpful. I loved the Naranja Roja Margrita. It had a little spice to it and you never know if it will be to one's liking. Lucky mentioned that if I did not like it he'd be happy to make me something else or add additional agave to tone down the spice. I always like to hear that so if it's not drinkable your not on the hook for $12.00. I know most places will accommodate you when it comes to something you don't like but it's refreshing to be told that up front and makes the decision easier to make. The drink was awesome! I would highly recommend it. You did taste some spice so it was not a drink to drink fast.  We also had the Pescado which was had a great flavor.
