We went to Distrito for the first time on a Saturday night. Pleasantly surprised by the colorful decor, open doors overlooking an amazing park and the creative menu. We were celebrating a birthday so we went LARGE and ordered just about everything! The blood orange margarita will have you craving more...seriously fantastic! We ordered all the appetizers and LOVED them all! We pretty much all had cravings for tacos so we ordered a couple of the taco bars to share and it was delicious. Some of the best guacamole I've ever had and the chips are homemade and perfect.
Our service was superb! Our waitress Hillary saw to each and every detail and was well seasoned on the menu and how things were prepared...we all think that's very important! There was no disappointment with her suggestions. The manager Ben was attentive and came to our table a few times making sure everything  was perfect, exactly like a good manager should.  We ended our evening with yummy cappuccino and dessert.  My only disappointment was no flan...I would highly recommend this gem in the middle of Old town Scottsdale! They even have free valet parking. Jose Garces should be proud of this establishment.
