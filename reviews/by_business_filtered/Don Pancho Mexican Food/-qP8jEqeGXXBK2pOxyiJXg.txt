First of all, I always compare places to my mom's real Mexican food. Nothing ever comes close to my moms food! I don't go to Mexican food restaurants often, but I decided to try this place out because of how many times the place has switched owners and names. I've always tried the different restaurants this place has become. I'm glad I checked it out! The food was awesome. I haven't tried everything yet, but I have tried the tortas, beans, rice, and quesadillas. It was all great and full of flavor. It is probably one of the only places that comes close to my moms Mexican food which to me is saying a lot! Besides the food, it is a great place to eat. Very welcoming and clean. The people who work there talk to you like family, and the place is most likely run by family. I like to support local small businesses like this. So go and do the same and try it!
