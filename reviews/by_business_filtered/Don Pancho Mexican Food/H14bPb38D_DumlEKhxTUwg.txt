I absolutely LOVE this place. I had the best meal there. It was a wonderful carne asada with a great flame grilled taste. It was very juicy and tasted just so delicious! I'm a huge fan of grilled food so even the grilled jalapeno was a delight. The people were so friendly and kind. The man at the counter suggested a couple of different items, and gave us a basket of chips with dip to eat while waiting for the take out. They also have fantastic sauces! It was really difficult to figure out which we liked the best. If made to choose, it was the roasted salsa verde. But all of them were fabulous. This really is the best Mexican food in Goodyear or in the entire area. I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants very real, very lovingly prepared food. The restaurant itself is very, very small and we were there for take out. But there are more things that look scrumptious on the menu and hope to be back very, very soon.
