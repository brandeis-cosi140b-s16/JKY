Maybe it's a bit of emotional eating when I come here but the food is tasty!  If u want Mexican food Taco Bell style this place is not it. It authentic southern Mexican food. You have to try their quesadillas or tacos de Maiz (corn) ..so good! Especially the carne asada...it's so good that if a piece falls of my place , the three second rule always applies. It's small inside and a lil dated; study the menu because its a bit overwhelming but the hospitality from the owners makes up for it and adds to the old nana and tata's house feel. Just want to hug 'em both!

Dress: Anything goes here. 

P.s. Area can be a lil sketchy at night and they close early.
