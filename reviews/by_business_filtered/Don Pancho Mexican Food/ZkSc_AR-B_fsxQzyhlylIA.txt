FINALLY a good Mexican restaurant!!! My husband & I ate here and we will be back! Very small inside with only 10 or so tables, but we didn't have a problem finding one on a Saturday evening. I had the chicken enchiladas & my husband had a carne asada burrito & pork tacos. Mine was delicious, and so was his. The pork was so flavorful!
