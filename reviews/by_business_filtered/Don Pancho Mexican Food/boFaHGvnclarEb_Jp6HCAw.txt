Wow, right off the bat the cashier was very welcoming and his service skills were on point. Ran thru the menu and took his recommendations and ordered #11, #8, menudo, and the goat soup. #11 was the ribs and its like nothing I've ever had before. Like the man said, this is not just food, its an experience. Boy I'll be back every year from now on.
