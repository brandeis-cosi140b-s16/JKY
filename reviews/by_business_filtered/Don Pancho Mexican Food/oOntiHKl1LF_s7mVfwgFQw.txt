My wife and I stopped in before the Cardinals game for dinner. This place is excellent!  The staff was so kind and gave is samples of there red and green sauces with chips.  I ordered a red chili burrito which came with delicious rice and beans. My wife ordered cheese enchiladas. Both meals were delicious and large portioned. The prices were awesome 2 delicious meals for 20 dollars. Some of the best Mexican food in town. We will definitely be coming back.
