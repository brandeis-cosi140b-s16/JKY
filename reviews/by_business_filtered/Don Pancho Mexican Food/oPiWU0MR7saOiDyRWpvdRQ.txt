OK so let me start by saying, "Why did it take us so long to find this gem?"
Admittedly, we don't go down Central all that often, but when have, we've see Don Pancho's and thought, we should stop there.  Finally we did!    GREAT authentic food, along with the traditional Mexican us north of the border think of too!  Great carne asada, carnitas, a sweeter pastor, great selection of salsas and attentive service with very reasonable prices!!

We really love your place,your great food and personalities!
