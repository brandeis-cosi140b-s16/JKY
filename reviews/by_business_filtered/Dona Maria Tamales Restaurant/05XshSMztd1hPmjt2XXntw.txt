this place is YUCK! Food taste like it just came right out from the can..even the rice seriously though this is not authentic Mexican food..food is just too expensive, kids meal for burrito substitute rice and beans for fries was about $8 and my kids did not eat it just the fries because the burrito was just nasty! No taste! All bland that dessert was not an option. Tamales!! Don't get me started! Tamales were non appetizing that the server had to take back because 2 were overcooked that the beef was burnt and the cheese tamale looked like overcooked chicken I'm not lying seriously it was not cheese! But the server said it was cheese and it only looks like that because of the sauce they cook it in..BTW being Mexican and my knowledge of REAL Mexican food, a cheese tamale is slices of cheese with jalapeno slices and salt, no sauce!! So yea did not pay for that crap..Save your Pesos and go elsewhere,, want real Mexican food go to North-town in Las Vegas where the place looks crappy to even eat at and I swear to you, that's where the best REAL Mexican food is served!
