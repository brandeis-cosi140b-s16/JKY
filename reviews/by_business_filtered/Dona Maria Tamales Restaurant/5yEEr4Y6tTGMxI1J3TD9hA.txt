After hearing all the hype we finally decided to go and get some tamales, unfortunately we ordered a dozen (some to take home of course!) before we tried them.  While waiting for our order we were served chips and salsa and were very disappointed.  It was obvious they don't roast their ingredients and it just tasted like tomato.  My wife asked for a spicier salsa or something more authentic and they brought another but still disappointing.  The tamales and accompanying sides were also very bland and not very good.  This place reminds me of a cafeteria and the food is definitely not authentic.  Don't waste your time or money, we will not be going back.
