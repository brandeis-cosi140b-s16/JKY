I am a fan of Mexican food and I love Chavelas.  I've been searching for a Mexican restaurant that makes these in Vegas.  I was apprehensive when the waiter asked me how this drink is made... then excited when he said they could make it... then slightly disappointed again when they brought the drink to the table.  Not what I am looking for.  But things improved as the food came to the table.  

I had the pork tamales and Chiliquiles.  Both were above average and the homemade tortillas were outstanding.  Chips and salsa were very basic but had a good flavor.
