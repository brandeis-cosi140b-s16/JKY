wow, this place was pretty blah.
my fam was in town visiting family and they took us here.  they raved on the mexican at this place.
started with the chips and salsa, chips were fresh and tasty, the salsa tasted fine.
my uncle stated we had to try the tamales, even though i am not usually a fan.  i got the chicken enchilada/cheese tamale combo it was simply boring but the red sauce on the enchilada was good, i wish i had just gotten cheese.  the tamale was overcooked and really hard, i gave up on it real quick...i will stick to my no tamale rule.  the accompanying beans and rice were goof especially with the super spicy chipotle salsa we received when asking for something spicier.  
oh yeah, it came with a choice of soup or salad, i got the salad, there was no vinaigrette so i got a really runny ranch dressing with it, one i added salsa to it, it was fine.  my dad and bro felt similarly with their meals...pretty let down.
i don't really see myself returning, especially cause the next day we stopped at del taco which i thought was really good especially in comparison.
our waiter was very nice, so that was a plus.
