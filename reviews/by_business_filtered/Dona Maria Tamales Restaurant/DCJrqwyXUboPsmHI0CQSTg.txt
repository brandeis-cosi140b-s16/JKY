How this place gets almost 5 stars is beyond me. The Salsa is basically tomato paste and sauce. The chips are store-bought the guacamole taste frozen. 

The octopus and shrimp cocktail is actually really good but the nachos was the worst ever. Lacking any life as a nacho!

The beans and rice looked old and tasted stale. 

Really a poor effort in the kitchen to be maintaining any freshness and standards.
