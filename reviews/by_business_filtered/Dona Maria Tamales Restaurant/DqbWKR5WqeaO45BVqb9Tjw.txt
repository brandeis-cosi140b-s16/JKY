I Used to love this place. Now I hate it! It took them over an hour and 15 minutes to make Mexican dishes! Is this not what they do? The place was not busy and definitely they did not have the right to blame their poor service on the half packed establishment.  We also had to ask for a Manger two times as they could not get a cheese quesadilla right. My son was in tears at this restaurant. He was very hungry and grumpy after the first 40 minutes. We specifically asked for the kids meal first as we always do. Most importantly, It was a new job celebratory party for myself and my son's Grandmother's birthday party. After this I demanded that all drinks be comped plus the kids meal or I would walk. They still only took off half the drinks and the kids meal. 

They did somewhat try to redeem their lack of good service by singing happy birthday to an 83 year old Great Grandmother. Managerial staff decided delivering huge loads of ICE cream to the table and flan or rice type dessert was the ideal way to make good on this overpriced overrated garbage food. I never been more under impressed by a Mexican Restaurant in my entire life. If they had only listened to my requests I would have given them 3 stars at best. Delivering a table full of sweets to a family who is mostly diabetic is ridiculous and uncalled for...it was a total waste cause we all shared one dessert. It literally felt like this staff were so disconnected and weren't even on the same planet as they worked together with no cohesiveness at all. It's a shame this place is so high priced. I literally don't see them keeping their business in this economy.
