Sheesh 27 dollars for Lunch for 2 with water to drink!?!? WTF

Pros: Staff is very friendly.
the inside decore is very well done.
Service was quick and on point.

Cons: Quality of food is just MEH... 
We had the seed pod and all still attached to the bell pepper in my food... not acceptable to service the garbage parts of veg when your charging 13 dollars...
Obviously the prices are out of control.
The "Lunch menu" should not average out to about 11 dollars a plate... not including soda.

Staff was nice but the food quality does NOT justify the price.  Wont be returning.
