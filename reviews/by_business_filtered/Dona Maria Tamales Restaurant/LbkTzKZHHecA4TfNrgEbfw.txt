First off the service was excellent. They were very welcoming at the door and the servers were quick and friendly. They were great with refilling my wife's WATER (but they did not offer to refill my 1/2 full soda).  The soda costs $3.10; seems a little ridiculous not to even be asked for a refill on such an expensive soda. I agree with most reviews about the chips and salsa-not good at all; tasted store bought. We both ordered their famous tamales with beans/rice sides. Pork tamales lacked flavor and spice. The chicken was ok, but nothing to write home about-again could have had more flavor. The cheese tamal was unfortunate: although it was the most flavorful, I have no idea what kind of cheese was in it. The cheese was a solid block and very difficult to cut with fork. As it was in the tamal, the cheese is sitting like a rock in my stomach. Bland beans and rice. 

Overall, service was good. Food was ... Eh.... Price was too expensive, especially for lunch and especially given food quality. I was wavering an would almost give 2 stars, but the $3.10 soda was outrageous. So 1 star it is. Would not recommend. Would not go again.
