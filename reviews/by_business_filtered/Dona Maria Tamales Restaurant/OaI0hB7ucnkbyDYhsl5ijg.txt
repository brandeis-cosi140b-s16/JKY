Man, I just love this place. It's become my go-to comfort food over the last dozen years of coming here. Love the homemade flour tortillas, the chicken fajitas (enough for 2 or lunch the next day), the pork tamales, the tortilla soup and the margaritas. The food has always tasted the same, the staff are the same faces year after year, and -- the best part -- I am never, ever rushed when I'm here. Just sit down, relax, enjoy the complimentary chips and sip on your drink. When I need to unwind and let somebody else cook, this is my place.
