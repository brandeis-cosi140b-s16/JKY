The food is good.  The service was good. Why only 3 stars?? The prices are ridiculous! Let me remind you that this place is far from the strip to be trying to charge these kinds of prices for a basic Mexican plate! $18 for a carnita plate! It had the smallest serving of guacamole and sour cream was extra, small serving of rice and beans. My husband got the ala carte burrito and was still hungry. He said he wasn't going to pay $8 for beans and rice but now wished he did. Lol Our friend got a plate with 1 chicken enchilada and 2 tacos for $16! The chips and salsa were ok. The salsa was thin, not much flavor. The margarita was made with a mix. It was ok. I should mention that this was dinner time. They do have a lunch menu that's a bit cheaper. Also, it does say Summerlin but it's about as far north east as you can get to still be called Summerlin. Tenaya and Cheyenne! I almost forgot! They do make their own tortillas but each tortilla was half and inch thick on one side and paper thin on the other. (Someone needs to go back to tortillas 101 class Lol)
