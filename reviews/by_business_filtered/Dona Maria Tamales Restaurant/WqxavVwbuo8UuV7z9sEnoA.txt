Steak Fajitas are super delicious.  So much flavor.  Also good seafood enchilada, except for the use of fake crab.  The nicest waiter assistants I've ever encountered!  Really good red sauce for the enchiladas, but you can choose from several sauces.  They are very open to modifying dishes for those who can't eat certain things.  It's a big restaurant with a nice open welcoming feel.
