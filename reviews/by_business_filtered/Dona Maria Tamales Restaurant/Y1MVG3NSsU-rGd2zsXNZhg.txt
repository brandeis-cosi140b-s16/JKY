Fresh and amazing flour tortilla's!  Blows away any Mexican food I've ate in a Casino.  I had the Carne Asada Platter which they subsititute a NY Strip steak instead of the thin flank steak that I'm used to.  The steak was prepared perfectly and a nice change to the norm.  The restaurant is clean and I've been there twice now. I'll definitely go back.
