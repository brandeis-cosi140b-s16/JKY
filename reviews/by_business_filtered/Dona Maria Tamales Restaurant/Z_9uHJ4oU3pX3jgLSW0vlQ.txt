My parents enjoy Mexican food and when they visit us we go here now that Viva Mercados closed.

Their tamales are decent, but I think the place is a little overpriced and the margaritas and rest of the food are just okay.  But I must admit I have yet to find a better Mexican restaurant in the valley.  I have many favorites in my hometown of San Diego that would blow this place away, but I am not traveling 8 hours for a Mexican dinner out.
