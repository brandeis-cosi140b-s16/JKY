I am starting to love this place, from the outside it doesn't look very big but as you enter into it the room just seems to keep going and going. Its well laid out and the d√©cor is very typical of a Mexican Restaurant;  that being said maybe even an upscale Mexican Restaurant since you have a waiter, a food server and even a third guy floating around keeping dirty plates off the table and empty glasses full. 

They sit you at a table serve you a bowl of very good if not freshly made Salsa and a bowl of chips as you read over the large menu with plenty of tasty dishes to choose from.  I've had the Tamales and I've had the burritos and I have to say OMG to both.

Both were served with plenty of sides and it made me regret ordering the bean and cheese dips to go with the chips and salsa.  I took a sip of a few of the Alcohol drinks my GF ordered but didn't indulge myself and can only say that they were strong and had a great flavor and seemed to be well worth the cost. 
I will always be willing to come back here. 

I just noticed this from my previous review and wanted to make sure to add it here: Just remember to ask for a small side of guacamole or you will end up with a weeks supply to take home.
