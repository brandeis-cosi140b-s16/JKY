As a white girl with half of her family being Hipanic, I was raised on Mexican food. Sad to say, but this place was so-so......It is up the street from Mountain View Hospital, so while my sweets was in surgery, I suggested this place his family based on Yelp....I failed on this one! The tamales were DRY! The chile colarado taco was super soaked in BAD red sauce (passed it to my sister in law, she said it tasted spoiled!) Chile Relleno's, so sad that is was covered in red sauce, yet the batter was greasy, and tasted like it was fried in old oil.
The only saving grace of this experience was the service, great waiter!
Will I, or my family members come back? NOPE! I'll stay with Macayo's or Pepe's for the good Mexican food!
