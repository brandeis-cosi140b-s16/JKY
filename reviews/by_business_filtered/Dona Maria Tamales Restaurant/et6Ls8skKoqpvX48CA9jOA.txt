I love coming here for dinner.  The food and the service is excellent and fast!  They start you off with chips and very tasty salsa.  I usually order a bowl of pozole (excellent) and pork tamales (so yummy).  Prices are very decent, everyone is very friendly, margaritas are nice and strong!  The dining area itself is huge, so there really is no wait for a table.  I believe they have happy hour from 4-6pm daily.
