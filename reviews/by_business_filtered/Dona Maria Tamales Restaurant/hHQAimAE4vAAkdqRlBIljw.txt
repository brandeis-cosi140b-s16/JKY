The food is decent, the service is slow, and the salsa is barely spicy.

Mexican restaurant rundown:
Chips and Salsa: The chips are actually fantastic. They taste fresh baked and have perfect crispiness. The salsa however is rather bland. Basically it lacks any serious spice, and that seems like a crime when paired with these amazing chips.

Food: Decent. Emphasis on the decent. It's unmistakably Mexican, but it lacks any real pop. Nothing exciting, nothing unexpected. The ingredients seem fresh enough, but the result is just okay.

Cerveza: Bonus points for having Negra Modelo and Dos XX Amber on tap.

Service: Slow! Restaurant wasn't even half full and we could barely get a waiter's attention.

Good, not great.
