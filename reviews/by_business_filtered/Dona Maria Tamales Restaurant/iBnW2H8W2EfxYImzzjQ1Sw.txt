They get a 1 star cause there's nothing lower. How they got a 3 1/2 stars idk. Nothing about this place is authentic. Everything tasted like it was from a can, even the rice and I don't think there is rice in a can. We got the very over priced tamales which there named after to try them and sent them all back. Some were very burnt that we couldn't eat it and some were not even cooked. ( still watery inside). All the food is extremely expensive like $20 for 2 tacos and a green enchilada. Iced tea was $3 and soda $3.15. And even the soda was flat. The service was ehh, they finally asked if i wanted a refill when I was leaving.
