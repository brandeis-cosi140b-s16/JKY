I love Mexican food and this place delivers. From the outside it does not look like much but on the inside it is very well decorated and has super tall ceilings. They even have a tortilla making machine which might be cool for the kids.. High ratings on chips and salsa and the enchiladas. Found the tamales a bit dry. Good service.
