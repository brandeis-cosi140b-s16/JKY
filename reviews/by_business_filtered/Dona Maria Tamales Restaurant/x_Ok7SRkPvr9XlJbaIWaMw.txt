The hype for this place is too high. The enchilada cheese tamale was mediocre. I think those bragging about how good the place and the cheese tamale is must have had too many margaritas. Enchilada Cheese tamale was more than $5 and that's for one small tamale. Not worth it. Plates are too expensive for quality. Not a place I'd recommend or come back. $20 for a margarita, a small tamale and small cheese enchilada both a la carte.
