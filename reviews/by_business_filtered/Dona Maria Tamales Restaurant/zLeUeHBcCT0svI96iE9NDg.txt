It amazes me that this place gets anything over one star.  Maybe this is California Mexican, but it is not Texas border Mexican.  We picked up tamales for a birthday party.  Ordered 2 dozen.  Received only one dozed packed in a plastic bag all mashed together.  A mess.  Called and they redid the order.  Still a mess - sweet tamales packed with chicken and cheese.  Really?  No pride in how they were sent out.  Tamales were tasteless and greasy.  HUGE disappointment.  And $$$!  $24 for a dozen.  Sent home salsa and chips in the bag - salsa tasted like Ragu and chips were greasy and again, no flavor.  This is NOT authentic Mexican - don't waste your time here.  There are many other places in town to eat good Mexican, and if you are in a rush, you'll get more flavor and authenticity at El Pollo Loco or Taco Bell.  Yes, it was that bad!
