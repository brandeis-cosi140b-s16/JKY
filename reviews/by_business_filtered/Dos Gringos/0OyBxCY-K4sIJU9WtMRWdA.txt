Dos is a great bar to visit after a spring training game or a day of drinking. It has plenty of outdoor areas to hang out, giant jenga, air hockey, drink specials and in the heart of Old Town. It's just a generic dive bar and one that's worth the visit if you've been drinking, it's a random hour of the day and you want to continue drinking. The food's mediocre bar food and decent food to dine on while taking in a few drinks. And with at least four different bars, you'll rarely have to wait in line for a drink. So next time you find yourself drinking when the sun's still out...remember Dos as an option.
