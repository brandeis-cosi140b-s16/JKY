I do like this place.  Taco tuesday is a great value here!  My biggest disappointment is that they won't honor their special when the spring training games are on....so they just loose this local to the other bar down the road for awhile!

I have updated my review to reflect 5 stars!  I did this as a result of the contact from the Customer Service Manager Jeff.  He contacted me and explained it must have been a mistake on the part of the staff.  They DO HONOR their specials even during the Spring traning games!!!  WOOHOO!!!   He was very genuine in his communication and very nice. It is this kind of reaching out over just a little issue that makes a business stand out!!!  I am on my way back!! THANKS DOS GRINGOS!!!
