If you are over 24 you are too old to be here.  

First, this place has beer.  Don't order mixed drinks, don't order wine, both are gross unless your sole purpose is to get trashed, which is the mission of every underage and young, young 20-something at this bar.

This is the place you'd go to with your fake ID because when you're 19 this is what you think a bar should be.

Expect people over drinking and throwing up very early on in the evening in the bathroom.
