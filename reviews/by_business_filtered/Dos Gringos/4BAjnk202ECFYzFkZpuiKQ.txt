Dos has lost a lot of its appeal from years back.  It used to be the day drinking capitol of the world but now there's hardly anyone there during weekend days.  It's got that Rocky Point vibe which is supposed to be dirty and a little run down but I think they're taking that a bit far.  It doesn't look like it's been renovated in decades.
Corona's used to be $2 anytime which made it our starting spot but they have since gone up as well.  I think they're up to $3 which is pretty much the same thing so no big deal.  
I think the shift away from Craftsman Court and the west side of Scottsdale road to other more popular streets is what has made the crowds disappear, not necessarily any huge thing they're doing wrong here.
