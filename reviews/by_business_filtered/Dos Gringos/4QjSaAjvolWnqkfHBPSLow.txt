A party of about 20 of us went to the Dos Gringos location in Old Town Scottsdale on Friday evening for a happy hour. Our server Fernanda was fantastic, as was the manager, Patrick. Both were very friendly, attentive and accommodating for our larger party. We ordered a mix of appetizers, which were all wonderful, and various items off the menu for dinner. I ordered carne and shrimp tacos, which were perfect but did see a few of their supergooey...whatevers and those looked amazing! Must try on my next visit. There were several other parties of various sizes filling up both the back and front patios, as it was a perfect afternoon to be outdoors. Thank you, Dos Gringos!
