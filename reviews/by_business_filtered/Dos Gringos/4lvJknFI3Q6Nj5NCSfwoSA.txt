I love drinking here, but the service is always God awful. Seems like each time I go, the waitress is complaining about something in her life, or how busy her night is, or some garbage. Just shush at get my drink. Food is good, drinks are good, please work on the service! Also, place needs a good scrubbing. I feel like I'll get an STD from if I touch something in the bathroom.

Prices are kind of high for what you get.
