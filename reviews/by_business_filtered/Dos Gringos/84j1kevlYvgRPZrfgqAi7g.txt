This place is definitely a party place. The bar area was pretty busy for it only being 5:30pm or so when i was there. We only stopped in for appetizer's so that is all i can rate on at this point. It was loud, the service was okay, and the food was just okay. I had planned on ordering a couple items but started with just the crispy tacos. I wasn't blown away so we stopped while we were ahead. 

The crispy tacos: the shredded beef was alright the avocado salsa saved the little tacos, without that they would have had no flavor at all. 

I would say try something other than the crispy tacos, i hear that the Rocky Point Nachos are good so maybe give them a go. 

All-in-all my experience here was okay, not great, not horrible just okay.
