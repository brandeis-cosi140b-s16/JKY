Came to this location on a Saturday night. It was pretty dead with a few customers. The bartender was really nice and we told him it was our first time there. We ordered chips and salsa with a martini and beer. The chips were great but the martini tasted like juice so we decided to order two shots of my favorite grey goose vodka to get the alcohol kicking. 

Things got awkward quickly because the shots tasted like water with a hint of alcohol. My husband hesitated on saying anything because we hate complaining but it was pretty disappointing.  When the bartender came by, my husband politely told him that he isn't trying to say that it was the bartenders fault but the shots we got tasted like water. The bartender immediately got annoyed. He just shrugged his shoulders and said he poured us shots and left it at that. My husband even said that he understands it's probably not the bartenders fault and that we didn't want anything else but thought it would be good for him to know. We've worked in restaurant before and know that sometimes management will water down the bottles. The bartender walked away and we got our check and left after paying. 

Unfortunately, we won't be coming back to this place. it was really clear that the staff  had no interest in retaining new customers who were excited about finding a new place to enjoy their weekends. 

When I worked in the restaurant business, I alway made sure that first time customers would be a returning customer. Our shots were $9/shot and that's pretty expensive when you feel like you drank water.
