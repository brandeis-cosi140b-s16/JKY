Cool patio, we sat out back where there were nice big booths with benches to sit on, lots of decorations everywhere and funny signs to read. Food was good all around the table- chips & salsa, street tacos, breakfast burrito, mini chimis, & chicken flautas. Not one complaint from anybody we were with. We were in there on a Friday night and they had a nice flow of music from a deejay and a girl walking around with whipped jell-o shots, fun environment for sure! Was a good crowd without being overly crowded too.
