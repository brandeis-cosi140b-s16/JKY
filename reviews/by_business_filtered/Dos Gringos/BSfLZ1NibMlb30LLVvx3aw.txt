Absolutely appalling service!!  My friends and I came here to celebrate a birthday.    We got there around 5 pm and the place didn't seem busy at all.  We sat outside at the bar.  Our first bartender was extremely helpful, (15 mins) unfortuneately I didn't get his name.    The second bartender named Ted, (1 hour) was absolutely obnoxious.   He made rude remarks regarding his customers sitting at another table and  he signed my tab without my consent!   Forged my signature!   How awful was It to hear everything coming from his mouth and we're ALL paying customers! 
 I have been in the restaurant industry for number of years and experienced alot of different bars, and clubs.   I have not been treated soo horrible in my entire life.   Not to mention, he knew it was a friends birthday.    I will NOT go back to Dos Gringos-Scottsdale no matter how good looking the bartenders are.
