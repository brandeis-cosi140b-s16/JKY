Having been to all of the Dos Gringos in the valley, I'm tied for my favorite between here, and the south Tempe location(priest) I love the outdoor 'tiki bar' vibe they have going, and the bartenders/ servers are usually fun and engaging. Not at all a typical 'Scottsdale' bar, in fact, the very opposite. Usually very friendly crowd.:) I love margaritas and if you get here during happy hour, they have awesome deals! Regular, flavored, frozen, on the rocks, you pick, there all delish(even though from a mix, not overly sweet). The food is actually really good, I love the burros, tacos, nachos, gringo rolls, etc.never a bad choice for a fun night out, or drinks with friends:)
