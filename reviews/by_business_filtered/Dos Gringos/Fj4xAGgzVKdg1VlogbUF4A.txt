This is not Mexican food! 

Went there for lunch so that way wouldn't have to go pull my car  out of the garage. Was greeted by the bartender and ordered a coke. She then handed me a menu. A little pricey but I decided on the shrimp tacos for $4  and added rice and beans for another 3 here's a novel idea why don't you just make a taco plate  without the upcharge? No chips and salsa were offered for munching on while I waited. And needless to say their tacos are very tiny I think I had one shrimp on each taco smothered in mango salsa. The tortillas they come on are gross. The rice was cold and crunchy and the beans were extremely salty. What a waste of time. Stay away from their food. It is not Mexican food!!!!
