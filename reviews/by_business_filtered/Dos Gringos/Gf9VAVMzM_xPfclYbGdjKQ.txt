This is a good place to go on a Thursday, not so great on a Tuesday.  We were one of 2 groups on the patio.  Our waitress came by once and we didn't need anything, so that must have meant we didn't need anything for the next 45 minutes.  She came back to check on the other group and seemed to make a point not to make eye contact with us as she disappeared.  The next time she paid attention to us was when we chased her down to close our tabs.
