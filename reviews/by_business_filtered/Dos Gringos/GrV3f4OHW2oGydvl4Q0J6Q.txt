I went here on a bit of an off night during the week. It wasn't too busy but I could definitely tell this is one of those wild places to go on the weekends.... you know what I am talking about. Big, lots of rooms, smells of booze soaked into the wood floors...yeah that.

Luckily since it was during the week they had some really cheap Coronas. I also had the steak fajitas. They were surprisingly very good.. I was expecting a bit on the meh side considering this is more of a party place. They also had a desert that was nearly mind blowing. They wrap cookie dough in a chocolate tortilla and then deep fry it..and then its server with vanilla ice cream and chocolate syrup. If you are on a diet this is the PERFECT thing to screw it up with, and its damn good haha.

The service was pretty solid, it was just the bartender running the tables. Since I was near the bar it was easy to flag him down if I wanted something. Hopefully I will be back on a weekend sometime to see how crazy this place really gets!
