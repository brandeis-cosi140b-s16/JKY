It is a little divey and grimy but I say that in the highest regards. Tons of patio space and decked out in bright colors. Had some cervesas and cuba libres (rum and coke but add a lime and it is called a cuba libre). 

We ordered the chimichangas and my two friends swear that it was sprinkled with crack and that it was the best they have ever tasted. I cannot vouch as I was intoxicated and as long as it had cheese on it, I was shoveling it into my mouth without regard to taste. We will be back when we are in the neighborhood and are in the mood for a late night menu while drinking.
