You kind of have to know what you're getting yourself into when you go to Dos.  Chances are there will be drunken college kids, some people way too old to be there, and then some people like me and my friends, who are somewhere in-between. 

I was there on Saturday for a day drinking birthday pub crawl.  For some reason, I always forget they have food here, and not just refreshing adult beverages.  I ordered the mini chimis, which were definitely NOT mini.  That's ok, I like 'em big anyway ;).  They were surprisingly good.  My margarita was what I expected, not mind blowing in anyway, but straight forward and salty, (just on the rim).  There were also girls handing out free shots of tequila, and sweatbands.  

Like most bars anymore, they have the obligatory giant jenga.  As my friends were playing, excitement broke out in the bar as some guy who used to be on "The Bachelor" showed up.  I couldn't tell you who he was; reality shows are not really my thing.  My friends were impressed, and went over to infiltrate his gathering.  Eventually we convinced them the crawl must go on, Bachelor or not.  

I'm always surprised that I still like Dos, and it doesn't hurt that the same hot bouncer always seems to be working the door every time I go.  As I exited out the front, he told me that he liked my hat.  Had I been a little quicker on the draw, I would've told him that I liked his muscles; such are the perils of day drinking in the heat....but I digress.
