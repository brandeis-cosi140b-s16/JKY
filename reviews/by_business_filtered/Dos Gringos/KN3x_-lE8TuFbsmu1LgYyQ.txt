My friends and I come here quite often. It's always a pleasant experience. They have amazing food, delicious drinks, great service, and friendly and fun bartenders that keep us coming back for more. Prices are reasonable especially for the area. We usually like to pre party here but it's a great way to end the night also. I am a huge Dos Gringos fan and will always be.
