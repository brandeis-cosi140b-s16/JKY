It sure isn't authentic Mexican food, but why fool ourselves.  That's not why we're here.  We're here for our nacho fix and some Mexican Moonshine at noon and it always fits the bill.  The food is as it says it is on the menu, the prices are fair and as a bonus to y'all, I went out on a limb and tried the ceviche.  I would definitely order it again.
