I used to love coming in late and finishing my night in old town here because they have bomb food and great drink specials. Not to mention their awesome staff! But now I have to go to loco patron (which I hate) because it's the only place to get late night Mexican food. I don't know who the genius is who closed the kitchen but they did a great job of running off the majority of their business.
