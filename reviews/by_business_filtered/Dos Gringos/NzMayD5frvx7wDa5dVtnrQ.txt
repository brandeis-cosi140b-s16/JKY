During my five-day stay in Tempe/Phoenix, I honestly did not have a single bad meal.  Every restaurant and coffee joint I stopped at gave me great experiences.  I wanted to end my trip out to Arizona with a good dinner, and I found myself at Dos Gringos to hopefully find that last meal out west.

Honestly, the name sold me pretty quickly.  Obviously, I'm not going to expect fine cuisine and classy dining at a place called Dos Gringos, but being a fan of dives and being one with my fellow man, it sounded like a good place to experience.

Despite it being chilly at night now this time of year, it was still an experience upon arrival.  It's like the tacky, somewhat tasteless, lampooned Mexican version of TGI Fridays, with a whole bunch of crap all over the walls, and a whole lot of hand-painted placards with sayings that make all of our inner-14-year-olds chuckle and appreciate.  The parking was free and plentiful, and I'm always a fan of the grungy, Christmas lights hanging all over the place kind of decor; my kind of style for relaxation and no-nonsense.

There were TVs everywhere, which was nice to watch some Sunday Night Football in the process, and I sat wherever I pleased.  Service was from a cute petite blond waitress who was quick to take my order, deliver my beer, and bring my food when it was ready.  I ordered an enchilada, and two "street" tacos, which were corn tortilla apparently.  Don't take my word for it, being an uneducated in Mexican food, east coaster, but I thought it was great.  Definitely different than the kind of "Mexican" food I can get in Atlanta.

Overall, I can't say that I had a bad experience.  The food was filling, not really expensive, and tasty to my tastebuds.  Beer, football on a mild evening in a place full of 56 pieces of tacky Mexican flair and a waitress with a great smile, and I can't complain.  Solid, adequate way to end my dining binging throughout the Phoenix/Tempe area.
