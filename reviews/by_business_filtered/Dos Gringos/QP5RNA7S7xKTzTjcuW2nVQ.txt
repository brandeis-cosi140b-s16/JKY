I wish this place wasn't in Scottsdale (i.e. I wish this place wasn't full of cougars and 19 year old girls dressed in couture at a sticky cancuny bar in AZ). 

So yes, this place definitely wants to be a low-key version of Senor Frogs here in the Valley. And ya know what, I'm ok with that. I'm all about a good margarita and authentic mex food...but let's face it, not everyone is good and not everyone is authentic. But if you have an outdoor bar and a tiki feel...at least you can make a lot of people happy.

So I was here on this bar crawl thing which made me a little bit ashamed...I just was too sober to disregard the fact that my group was full of those people in that bar. But despite the crowd and the LAME dj...the ambience and set-up here is superb. Now if we could just get something akin to that in Central Phoenix...with a day drink, laid-back scene that doesn't scream I wish I was still 23 and ooo by the way did you see my new Prada?
