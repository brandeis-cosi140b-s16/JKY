Awesome tacos, awesome service. What more can I say? 
Went in last night craving tacos, sat on the patio, and was greeted immediately by my server, who introduced herself as natasha. She was very nice to my friends and me, cracking jokes and telling us about the menu. It was so refreshing to see a server who enjoys her job and has a good time with her customers. 
We ordered the nachos, which she suggested, and loved them. 
Will be coming back, no doubt!!
