Dos is what I like to call a "sure thing"

I say this because I know that I will always enjoy the food and always have a good time. I love the feel of Dos, the way everything is kind of everywhere and the outdoor atmosphere. While most people go for the cheap drinks and to be scene (intended spelling) I actually like Dos for the food and good service.  I love that they use black beans instead of the typical refried like most other mexican food joints. Don't get me wrong though, it's still a bar, and it's a fun place to start off a Friday night or grab lunch drinks.
