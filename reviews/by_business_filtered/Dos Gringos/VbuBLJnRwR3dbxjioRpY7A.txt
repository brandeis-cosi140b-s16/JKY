Dos is my favorite Scottsdale bar because of the relaxed atmosphere. Thankfully you don't get as much of the fake crowd here, you know the one whose crazy photos end up on DirtyScottsdale.com the next day. There's two floors and the bar offers a nice selection of brews. SoCo Lime is the big shot here and you'll usually see people sipping Corona's with lime. You may even see the occasional body shot. While this is certainly a great destination for a night out, it's also a great place to do some day drinking when the weather isn't so hot.
