this is always a fun place to come in and have a brew. i've only been once during the late night rush, and i have to say i'm not that into the power drinkers and college drunks, but the afternoons and early evenings are always nice. 

their outdoor patio seating is fun and actually quite charming. their little fish tacos are suprisingly good. just the right size to soak up some of that belly beer. 

the staff have always been friendly and quick with service. a great summer (or in scottsdale, fall, winter, spring) hangout.
