Dos Gringos holds a very inebriated spot in my heart. My mom moved to Phoenix from Tennessee a few years ago and one of the first spots she took me to was Dos. We went there for happy hour, which turned into us staying and drinking more! All I can say is after living in San Diego Phoenix has it made for drink specials!! I have been coming back to Dos Gringos every time I visit the ol' mom's place. I've never had a bad night here and the food has always been exactly what I expected. I am pretty Irish so the desert heat doesn't allow me to partake in its events during the summer too often, but fall and spring they better be ready for me because I'm  taking full advantage of their happy hour prices!!!
