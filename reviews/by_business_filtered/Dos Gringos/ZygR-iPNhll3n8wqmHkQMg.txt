Lousy service. Could not get a water refill or chips or any attention. The bottom line is we had to get up and chase down our own drinks, water, chips salsa and when food came after almost 45 minutes it was warm at best and the excuse was were training a new person in the kitchen. No one that evening appeared to care about service and this place was not at all busy. We had to go for some volunteer work across the street and I tried to speak to someone but they did not stop by before we had to leave so we were not late. Most of us had maybe 15 minutes to scarf down our food as it was.
