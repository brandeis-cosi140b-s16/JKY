Went on a Saturday evening and was surprised that it wasn't packed
The outdoor patio seating area was nice even if the mists were going 80mph
It wasn't that hot but whatevs 
Our server was really great
She was nice and very attentive 
This is a great place for drinks
I had a house marg and it was yummy
The food...
I was kinda iffy about it
So I asked the server what she liked 
I got a 2 option dish... Enchiladas and rolled tacos or something
I was really surprised by how tasty they were
They also came with rice & beans
My group was very pleased by the food here and we would stop by if we are ever in the area again

Ps- they have Cornhole here
