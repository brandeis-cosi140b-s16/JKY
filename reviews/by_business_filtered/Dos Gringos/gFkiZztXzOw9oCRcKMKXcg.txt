I've been to Dos several times and always walk away thinking it was just ok.  I wanted a low key night.  Whereas I can't say low key-ness was had the entire evening, Dos was exactly what I had in mind.  The friendly bouncers informed us of the 50 cent night special every Thursday.  Pay $5 at the door, get 50 cent corona and wells until midnight.  SOLD!  Coming from NOLA where the drinks are insanely strong, I get a bit sad when I see the one shot pour perfectly calculated in my Scottsdale drinks.  Not the case at Dos.  I don't know why, but the awesome bartender upstairs was pouring heavy, and I liked it.  Speaking of, there IS an upstairs filled with a large patio, bar seating, pool table, air hockey and nooks to fit all your friends!  The upstairs and the heavy pouring bartender definitely turned my "just ok" feeling about Dos to "let's go to Dos!"

The food is average Mexican bar food but will definitely save you from the morning after blues.  The weekends can get a little intense and there is usually a band playing.  As of my latest visit they had stereo music playing accompanied by a live drummer. The outdoor/indoor options can transform the day/night to your liking.  I'll definitely be going back!
