Excellent chill, lay back environment with decent food, great drinks and EXCELLENT customer service. 

Thanks Cameron and Will for the witty and genuine service. The sarcasm was an added side dish.  

I highly recommend this bar! Their appetizers and drinks were great. The staff were not your Scottsdale type of bar tenders. I went on a Wednesday night after a Brush Bar painting experience next door and it was a super chill environment.  I was super surprised to encounter country music, a laid back atmosphere and such fun bartenders.  They even invited us back!
