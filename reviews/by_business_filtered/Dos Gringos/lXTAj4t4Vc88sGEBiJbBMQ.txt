This place is actually pretty fun to go to at night. In the daytime, it is a really chill place to hang out with friends and drink beer. The food (tacos) are not bad. They are on the small side but taste pretty good. 

The only problem that I have with this place is that it does not smell very good. It's not extremely dirty (it is as clean as it can be with a ton of drunk people around all the time) but it just smells like bathroom.
