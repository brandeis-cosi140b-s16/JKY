Came here to meet with friends after the comedy show.  Like a mini high school reunion.  Maybe I am not in my 20s anymore and like the dingy bar atmosphere anymore.  Wow.... The place is dirty, sticky, and just ek.  The restroom on my, it was scary.  The service was horrible to top off the experience.
