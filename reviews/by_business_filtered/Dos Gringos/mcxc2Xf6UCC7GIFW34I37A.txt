Probably one of the worst experiences I've had at a restaurant in a verrrrry long time. Went there with a group of probably around 15 people Saturday night. It took 45 minutes for our drinks to come out and half of them were wrong. About an hour after we ate, my boyfriend and I were concerned about where the food we ordered was. The waitress admitted she forgot to even put the food order for us two in! She had no idea what she was doing and had probably 3 other people helping her after more than one of us complained about the service. It was absurd.
