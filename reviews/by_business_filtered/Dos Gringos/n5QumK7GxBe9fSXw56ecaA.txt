This is the place to be on Tuesdays for Tacos n Tequila Tuesdays. The tacos are CHEAP and AMAZING in flavor. Margaritas are only $3 and have a delightful kick. Someday- I will get around to trying other things on the menu-but you just can't beat their tacos! In the high heat of summer- you can sit on the patio and and still feel fairly comfortable. The have an assortment of over sized games, TVs, and occasionally DJs. A great place to meet up with friends. If you sit inside- sit near the bar and ask for Barry. He's the BEST "Adult Babysitter". He is everything you want in a bartender and server.
