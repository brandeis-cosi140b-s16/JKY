I went to Dos Gringos after work to relax , only to have been met with TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!! waitress notified our group that she had to leave, she offered to transfer our tab to another waitress only to return twenty minutes later to inform us that all other waitresses refused to service us , because our group was sitting outside. ( which was under shade and with misters on I might add). I will never recommend Dos Gringos to anyone!
