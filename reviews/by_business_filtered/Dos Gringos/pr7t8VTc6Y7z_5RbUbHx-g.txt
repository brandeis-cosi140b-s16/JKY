I really like this place. It is absolutely over-the-top with cheezy signage encouraging day drinkers and tequila, to a point that you know they don't take themselves too seriously. Beer is cheap and drinks aren't too bad. 

If it's cold outside (about 6 weeks per year for you out-of-towners) this isn't a good spot. It is very airy and open, which is why I like it in the sweltering summer. Most of its competitors pack you in to dark, cramped spaces and no amount of AC seems to cool things down. As with anywhere around Scottsdale, you'll still run into big crowds and belligerent frat boys, but I suppose it just seems more in place here. It's like our own little slice of Rocky Point, just without the bacon wrapped hot dogs.
