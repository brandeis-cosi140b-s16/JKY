ok, on those nights that you really don't feel like going downtown, but still wanna go somewhere to chill with friends, this place is PERFECT!  whats not to love about the sweet margs, cheap beer, and awesome happy hour specials!   the chicken dip is absolutely amazing!   We used to come here for dinner once a week also, but since they took the stuffed poblano off them menu, we really only come for drinks and apps.  the employees are so much fun and the whole atmosphere just makes you forget your stress.. or was it all those delicious strawberry margs?...   hmm :)
