I usually come here whenever I visit Arizona and I love it every time.  There is always a lot of people and good times.  I like how it is open air and Mexico themed, brings me back:) 
The bartenders are always nice and on top of shit.  There is no cover either, which is always a plus.  Also, their carne asada tacos are BOMB!
