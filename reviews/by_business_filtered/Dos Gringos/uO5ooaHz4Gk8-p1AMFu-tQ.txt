Went fairly early on a Friday night. It was starting to get busy and waitress said they were short staffed...everyone looked of average height to me though (insert knee slap here). Anyways... Got chips and salsa for $1 and some Gringo chicken tacos and some flautas. All had that satisfying grease flavor that washed down well with beers. Waitress was nice and stopped by a couple times. Good night. Oh yea, they had a corn hole game going on the patio too.
