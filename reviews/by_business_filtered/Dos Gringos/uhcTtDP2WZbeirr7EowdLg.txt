I've had pretty mixed experiences at Dos Gringos... on the one hand, their drinks are always stiff and cheap, which is a big win in my book. On the other, the place is always empty, and if you're ordering food, the service in the kitchen is severely lacking. The place is so big that without a lot of patrons, it feels like you need to bring a group to have any fun. If you're just one or two people looking to hang out with new folks, you're going to find yourself sitting alone at the bar.

When you can get food, it's actually pretty good. The pork chile nachos are my favorite, so you can imagine how sad I was staring at them, from my table, sitting in the kitchen window for 10 minutes before they were finally brought to my table last night! When it comes to Mexican food, there are a lot of great places in Phoenix, and honestly, I just don't see waiting that long to be served in a place with very few customers when there are so many other options... (For the record, I also watched other food sit in the window for similar amounts of time. I have been a waitress before, and I understand it being hard to run food when the place is slammed, but it was pretty empty, and there were idle servers.)

Bottom line: If you're going with a big group for drinks, it's a good place. If you're going for food or with just a few people, don't expect it to be packed, fast or much of a party.
