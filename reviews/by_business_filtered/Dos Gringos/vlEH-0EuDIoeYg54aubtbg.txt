I don't get it... I feel like I missed the memo.

Food is aweful- I don't care how drunk you get, you'll still know it stinks!

Rainy day margarita is my one good memory that I can take away from this place- good times.

Interesting blend of people- old, young, and everywhere in between. Yet, still not the first place I'm willing to go to.
