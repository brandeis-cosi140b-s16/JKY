As we were sitting at Dos Gringos last night I turned to my friend and said "this is what's so great about living here." Really, everything about this bar says 'Arizona summer'. Fun, casual decor, huge outdoor patio, misters on high gear, people hanging out with their bathing suit under their clothes from just coming from the pool-or in our case going to a pool....
Some people will tout this as a college bar, well it is kind of. However Dos makes no promises to be something it's not. As soon as you walk up to it you know what you're in for. So if it's not your cup of tea, mosey on. As for me this seems like a fun place to spend a lazy afternoon.
