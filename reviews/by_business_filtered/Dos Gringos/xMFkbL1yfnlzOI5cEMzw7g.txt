I am Hispanic, and my husband knows how to cook authentic Mexican food. Both of us have worked in the restaurant industry. We have both been to Mexico multiple times. When we want Mexican food, this is one of our spots. 

At lunch, the service isn't speedy, but it's not super slow either. They could use more waitresses. The chips and salsa are respectable, not the very best, but good. 

The crunchy chicken tacos are literally the best I've ever had. They put guacamole in them, which I've never seen before, and they're delicious. My husband always orders the chimichanga special and he raves about it. 

It's kid-friendly too, which is hard to find when you want decent food but can't find a sitter. Our young kids like the games and atmosphere. And I suppose it can be said that dudes would like this place as there are thin young women in tank tops and daisy dukes prancing around. They don't look TOO tacky, but it's a bit more butt cheek than my 13 year old stepson needs to see.
