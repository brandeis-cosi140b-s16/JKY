I've always loved Dos Gringos, from the old one I would frequent in Tempe to this location we pre-game at during kickball season. They have big open patios perfect for sipping on Coronas and they've got decent Bloody Mary bars on Sundays. 

The Carne tacos are cheap and delicious, and they have crazy specials during games. This is a great place for groups or lazy day drinking.
