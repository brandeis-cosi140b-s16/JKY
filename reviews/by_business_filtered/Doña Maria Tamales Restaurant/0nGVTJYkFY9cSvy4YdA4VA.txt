I have been going to Dona Maria's for such a long time. I had to stop a few years ago while I was pregnant with my son because I had friggin nose like a bloodhound and could smell EVERYTHING when I walked in. No matter where I sat, it smelled like someone shat on the coats, or at least in the vicinity of the coats. So...needless to say, a toilet smell makes me not want to eat. I do have to point out that it was the pregnancy elevating my senses, but whatever. We came back last week and were very disappointed. The prices were increased from last time, and my favorite soup was changed. They put friggin garbanzos in the veg soup. C'mon man. I do want to share this little disgusting tidbit with you though:

Upon ordering the soup, you get a condiment tray. It is a three tiered holder with cilantro at the top, lemon slices, and chili flakes at the bottom. I accepted it and used it like it was my own, especially for me. The waiter came to the table and asked if I was done with it. I said yes because he could clearly see that we were done eating. OMG. He took my tray....and placed it at another table. What the hell? I had used my fingers to grab the cilantro out. If I had known that the tray was communal, I wouldn't have even touched it. My face just dropped and I felt some food coming back up so we paid our tab and left with a bad taste in our mouths. Whatevs. I'm over that place.
