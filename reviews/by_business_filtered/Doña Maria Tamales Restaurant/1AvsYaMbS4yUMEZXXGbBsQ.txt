A place like this calls for numbered issues:

1. The dinner special (Tamales, Enchilada Style) was way too salty. 

2. The tortillas were very obviously store bought; they were served dry and hard. 

3. The micheladas are nothing but your choice of beer with Bloody Mary mix. This was especially disappointing bc we were craving micheladas. You can find better ones at Bonito Michoacan. 

4. The menudo was extremely bland. The broth tasted like watered down ramen soup BEFORE you put the seasoning in. The actual tripe was very soggy. I may be wrong but I think this means they didn't cook it long enough? Either way, it's not the way I like it. You can get better menudo at Pepe's Tacos.

5. Are we having a lime shortage again? Not one lime seen, but lemons galore. In the menudo, the food, and the micheladas. No lime.  

6. The salad that is offered with your food was comical. Store-bought cheese and half a tomato placed on top (not even diced up).

The chips and salsa are good. I leave this restaurant with a full stomach of that. Unfortunately nothing else left a great impression and we will not be returning. For the prices this place offers, I would expect the food to be a lot better. Very disappointed.
