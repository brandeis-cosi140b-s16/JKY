I always come here before heading to work. I get my frozen mango margarita, the BEST in town by far for the price and size. Its Vegas, you pay too much for any alcoholic crap on the strip anyways.
But this place does not pull your money out of your pocket.

Food is always fast, service is ok, its a family style so there is a lot of chattering sometimes late and not much paying attention to late night alcoholics like me :)

The only down was once, when I spilled my new drink and was not offered a refill or replacment free or cheaper. It was totally ignored.

Oh well... othetr than that I always had good food and strong drinks there.

its tricky to pull in from las vegas blvd and charleston, so go on 4th from charleston and pull in from the back.
