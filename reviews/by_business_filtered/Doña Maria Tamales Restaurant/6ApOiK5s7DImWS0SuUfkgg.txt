I only let my old lady eat here once a year, otherwise the bitch would be 300 lbs. And if that ain't a good enough endorsement for ya, how about this: I was having lunch there one afternoon while a nice Latino gentleman was painting the mural. While I sucked down my chips and salsa, he painted a farm-hand's moustache with chiaroscuro outbursts of vigor reminiscent of Picasso himself. Fooloshly, I yelled, "Make it bigger!!!"

He looked at me perplexed.

"Make the mustache bigger, se√±or!"

He smiled. 

I was in a friendly place.
