not good, not particularly bad either. the chips and salsa are pretty much the best part of the meal. The fideo soup is also OK. The tamales are actually decent although not mind blowing as several reviews have mentioned. The chicken soup is also OK, full of vegetables with a side of tortillas, enough for a complete meal. 

One thing I hate is the cooker's addiction to the microwave. Ever wonder why the plates are super hot when served? All cheese is grilled with the micro, which really sucks as it burns and dries the food. It also gives the impression that is not fresh. To be fair, the problem is common in most (if not all) the mexican food restaurant I've been in Vegas.

The place is OK for an office meal. Not for a family feast.  

I hate that every time I go the TV is tuned to soap operas. I mean, can we watch the news or at least NFL network???

Overall, average restaurant. The staff is very friendly, thou.

UPDATE: went for lunch today. Boy, I could hear the microwave all over the place. Please stop!!
