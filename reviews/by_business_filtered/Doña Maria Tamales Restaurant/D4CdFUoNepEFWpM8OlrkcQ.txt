These tamales are amazing!!! But get there early, we went 2 days in a row. On the first day our tamales were amazing and the service was fantastic (because we got there early for breakfast.). On the second day the tamales weren't as great but still so so good! And the service was a little lacking but they were busy so it's all good. They freshly blend the colada drinks so it's just fresh and yummy!! By the way I recommend the chicken tamales, they are by far the best of the bunch! Prices are good, staff were nice, and the restaurant itself is like a really great hole in the wall.
