Ah, Dona Maria, I have had you bookmarked for so long...

My co-worker brought me here during lunch to celebrate my birthday. This simple Mexican place in Downtown Las Vegas is "OK".

We started with fresh, tasty, and warm chips. Came with a nice, tomato-y salsa. We also ordered the guacamole, which was good.

I decided to go with the combo plate that was 1 enchilada and 1 tamal. I got a chicken enchilada (shredded, decent, nothing great), and a pork tamal. The pork was not impressive, however the tamal itself, the corn masa specifically, was quite good - this is what to get when you come here, after all, it IS in the name of the restaurant.

Service was fine. It was not busy during lunch time and everything was clean. 

Come for the tamales, you will be glad you did.
