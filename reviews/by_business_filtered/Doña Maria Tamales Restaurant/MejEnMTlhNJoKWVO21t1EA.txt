Do√±a Maria's is known for their tamales and you can order them individually or by the dozen for take out as well. They serve both the red (beef) and chicken (green) as well as the dessert (pineapple raisin) ones which I was never quite fond of. 

Pozole is similar to Menudo minus the tripe. It is a pork based soup or stew with hominy, chiles, garbanzo beans (traditionally), and other seasonings. Garnishes include cabbage or lettuce (cabbage is better), oregano, radish, cilantro, avocado, and lime juice. Most of the time I come here, I get the Pozole and a tamale or two. Their tacos are good - the avocado being one of my favorites. Their albondigas soup is excellent as well and Melanie tried the Menudo this trip and said it was good.
