Worst Mexican food I've ever tasted. We moved here from San Diego and have been searching for good Mexican food. This place is far from it. If you're from Cali (south bay, city heights) don't go here. You'll be disappointed. I'm curious why the locals think this is considered good Mexican food? Low standards I guess. The salsa tastes like hunts tomato sauce.
