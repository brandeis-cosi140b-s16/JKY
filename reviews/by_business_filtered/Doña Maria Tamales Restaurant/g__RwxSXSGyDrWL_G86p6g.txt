Came here with friends, one of which swears by their tamales. We ordered a dozen tamales (3 red, 4 green, 1 sweet). They were gooooooddd...and HUGE. I ate two and doggie bagged the rest to bring back to the room. I gave a starving, drunk, pleading friend one of my leftover tamales and he LOVED it. 

Pros: 
+Free unlimited DELICIOUS chips and salsa 
+Friendly, funny, attentive server

Cons:
-I didn't personally try the sweet tamales but my DRUNK friend did and he couldn't finish it. And since I didn't try it, no star lost :)

I'm definitely making this a must-go-to whenever I'm in Vegas. Wish I was back in Vegas already for more tamales :(
