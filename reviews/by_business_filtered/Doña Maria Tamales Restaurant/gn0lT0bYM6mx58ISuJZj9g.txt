After hearing from everyone & his/her brother & sister about this place AND seeing in the paper how its a huge local Christmas tradition to stop by and pick up 100's of tamales at a time, I decided to try it out for myself.

I wanted to go in and sit down but unfortunatly my time was pressed & I got a Chicken Tamale to go. The price was kinda high at $4.15.....$2.75 would be more reasonable BUT it is what it is. When I got home I was surprised to see a big bag of warm homemede tortilla chips & some mild sauce. This made the price a little better and the Tamale did not dissappoint.

I look forward to going back & sitting down & trying a combination platter & reviewing it here....stay tuned
