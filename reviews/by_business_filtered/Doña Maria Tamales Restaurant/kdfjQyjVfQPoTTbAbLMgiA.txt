I can't say enough about this place!!! Not only is this one of my favorite places to eat but the food is amazing. Best margaritas you will ever drink!!! Tamales are beyond delish. I'm Mexican and make everything homemade so it's hard to please my Mexican palate. I decided to have our wedding reception here and I couldn't have been happier. Rafael the manager took amazing care of us and my guests. Everyone raved about the food... Thank you Dona's for making our wedding magical. Love the waiter Antonio. Love this place.
