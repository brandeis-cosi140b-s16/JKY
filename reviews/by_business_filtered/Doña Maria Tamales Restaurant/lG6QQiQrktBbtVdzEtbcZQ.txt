The food was mediocre at best. First day I had steak and carnitas tacos and they both were alright. The carnitas was dried up like it was made a week ago and I didn't even have the stomach to try the steak. The service was good. The next day, I had posole which was kinda good but they put too much flavor. It was too salty.
