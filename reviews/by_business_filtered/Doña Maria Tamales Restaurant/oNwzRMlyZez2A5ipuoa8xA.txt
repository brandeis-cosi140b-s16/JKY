Maybe one of the worst experiences I have ever had at a Mexican food restaurant. Actually, it was the worst. It took us 45 minutes to get our food. I ordered the the taco plate (two tacos, beans and rice) and my gf ordered the tamales plate. Now, the tamales were good, nothing bad to say about them, but the fish was discussing. First off, it was the blood line cut, so it was super fishy tasting (to fishy tasting to eat). Then they upcharged me 3 dollars for steak, but I had gotten fish? Mind you I did not eat more than one bite and left the rest of the fish tacos for them to pick up and throw away. So..They would not take the 3 dollar charge off when the fish taco on the menu was only 30 cents more than a shredded beef taco(what the plate was supposed to come with I guess). The waiter did not tell me it would cost any more money. So when they did not take it off, the owner/manager tried to lie his way into convincing me that his price was right. End the end I just laghed at him, had him charge me the 3 dollars and wrote on the receipt that was his tip.
