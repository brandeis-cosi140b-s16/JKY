We have passed by this restaurant many times and always said that we bet that dive-looking place has the best Mexican food. So tonight we tried it. We won't go back. We got a margarita. It was strong, which is unusual so it had that going for it, but that was it. The mix had no flavor, not lime or even sweet. Weird. The chips and salsa were good. People on Yelp had said that. I ordered the Mahi Mahi tacos. The menu said 3 and there were only 2. The fish was very over cooked. There was supposed to be a mango salsa. I guess there were a few mangos there. There was so much mayonnaisey something on it that it ruined it. Just overall icky. It came with "grilled" veggies which were Birds Eye at best and not grilled. The rice was white with peas. Way too much butter. I only picked out the edible pieces of fish and left the rest on the plate. All that for $19.00. My husband ordered a steak and enchilada plate with green sauce on the enchilada. The steak was chewy and although there was green sauce on the enchilada there was red sauce inside. What? The waiter should have mentioned this. The Mexican rice was too tomatoey. He didn't even finish his food. Not once did the waiter come to our table after the food was brought. When another waiter came to take the plates he asked if I wanted a box. I said no. He didn't bother to ask if there was something wrong. I had planned to order a tamale to go just to try it based on the reviews. Honestly, by that time I just didn't care. Side note: We overheard the people in the next booth ask for limes and the waiter told them they only had lemons not limes. What?? A Mexican restaurant that doesn't have limes? 
We sure haven't had much luck finding a good Mexican restaurant here. Any suggestions?
