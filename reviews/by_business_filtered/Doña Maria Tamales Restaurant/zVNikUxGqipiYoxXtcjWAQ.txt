I don't know which is worst, my anger or disappointment ..I've heard a lot about the place &decided to give them a try. So I called first thing this morning when the opened and placed a order for a dozen chicken tamales to pick up at 630. I get there at 615 , they charge my card , then come out to tell me they don't have any chicken tamales!!!  Not only did I waste my time but my gas and in case anyone forgot gas is $4 a gallon premium and I live in Henderson! Although the manager was nice I made sure he understood that the reason I placed a order in advance is so I wouldn't have these kind of issues and considering they took down my number when I called, common courtesy or at least any type of professionalism could of been showed by simply calling me! Ugh!
