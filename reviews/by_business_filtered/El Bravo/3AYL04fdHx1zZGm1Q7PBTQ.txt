I'm being generous by giving this place 3 stars. Being an AZ native I know my Mexican food and this place is very mediocre at best. Took the family for dinner after craving tacos and decided to go to El Bravo since it had been years since the last time we went there for their infamous chocolate chimichangas. 
Chips were delish...thin, crispy and served warm. Salsa was okay, wish it had a little more kick! Husband had shredded beef tacos with chile relleno, which had a green sauce over it that was bland. My daughter and I had combo shredded beef tacos with beans. The meat was nice and hot and flavorful but the taco shell was really greasy and thin. The beans were horrible! They tasted like they had been burned. My son took one bite of his bean tostada and said "gross". With all the great Mexican food in AZ I don't think we'll be back...
