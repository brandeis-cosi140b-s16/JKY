Good food and a friendly staff typically make for a positive dining experience, El Bravo delivers on both fronts.  

On my latest visit I opted for the green chile popover, it was very good.  The popover bread was perfect and the green chile was very tasty and pretty spicy.  I've had the bean and cheese popover and the sweet one as well, both are great.

I've ordered just about everything on the menu and have never left disappointed, although that may have something to do with the delicious cookie they give you with your ticket.
