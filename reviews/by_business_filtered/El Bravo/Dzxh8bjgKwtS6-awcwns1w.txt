Restaurant was recommended by another couple we heard talking while eating at another Mexican restaurant.  I order a shredded beef chimichanga enchilada style with red suace. The suace was less than average, the meet had no flavor and it was the thinnest chimichanga I have ever seen (it's my go-to at any new mex. Spot). There was hardly any meat at all and it was flavorless. The meal wasn't cooked properly and the tortilla was still soft and chewy. My wife had a combo plate with enchilada and tacos which again were a little below average. Really wouldn't recommend this spot at all. We were the only ones in there too, now I see why. Via delosantos is down the street, try them after or instead...your welcome!
