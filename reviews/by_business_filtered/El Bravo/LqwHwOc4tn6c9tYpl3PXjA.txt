So I wouldn't go there on a romantic date, but you will find me there for lunch a couple of times a month.  
The chips and salsa are good, but what I really go there for is their Fry Bread.  I've eaten at the competition and it's good, but El Bravo does a fantastic job of satisfying my need for overindulgence.  I get the Navajo Taco, and there is enough meat, beans, cheese and veggies to make two meals.  You've gotta try it :)
I've never had to wait for a table and the food always comes fast enough to make it back to the office before my lunch break is over.
