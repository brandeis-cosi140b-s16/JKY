Went here with my wife and daughter. I haven't been here in many years but I remembered it being delicious. I remembered correctly. 

The food was amazing. I had a number 4 and added on a green beef burro. My wife had the number 6 and split some of that with our daughter. My daughter had the kids plate, which looked good. The only qualm is they don't offer a kids menu, just the single selection of a kids plate that isn't on the menu. It was good though. 

The service was very good. 

I will definitely be returning.
