I've been trying to get to El Bravo for months, and I finally made it! 

The atmosphere is pretty cozy and the staff was very friendly. I ordered a green chili burrito with beef and potatoes, and I also ordered a shredded pork taco. The burrito was great. The green chili was a winner in the flavor department. On the contrary though, the shredded pork was pretty bland. It almost tasted like it wasn't spiced at all. It was unfortunate, but it didn't ruin my visit. Lastly, I got to try some of a chicken burrito. I am definitely ordering chicken during my next visit. It was some of the best tasting chicken that I've had at a Mexican restaurant. It was well seasoned and not dried out! I've had so many bad experiences with chicken at Mexican dives that I've pretty much stopped ordering it, but El Bravo will be my exception.

I'm going to need to try more, but all in all, El Bravo was pretty good.
