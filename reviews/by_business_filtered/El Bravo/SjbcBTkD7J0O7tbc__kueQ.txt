The green corn tamale with green sauce was awesome!  I came in after the lunch crowd so it wasn't really busy, but service was lacking. 

It seemed that "regulars" got more attentive service and I had to ask for everything, more water, utensils, clean plate, no one came by to check on the table after I was served until I was finished, etc...

It would be worth another try and if nothing improves, I'll write it off completely.
