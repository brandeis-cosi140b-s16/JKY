The wait for a Saturday night wasn't really that bad.  The place is quaint and cozy but didn't feel too crowded.  We waited a while for the food, and I was totally fine with that... until I heard what sounded like the beeping and door opening/closing of a microwave.  Now I know it's the 21st century and the microwave has been a kitchen staple for years... but if I wanted a microwave meal, I could do that at home!  We started with the chips and salsa, and while the chips were light and crispy and delicious, the salsa really missed the mark for me.  I love a chunky pico de gallo style, but this just had weird seasoning and watery consistency.  The stuff in the squeezy bottle was even weirder tasting.  Okay, so no salsa... but the food that was coming out looked good.  As we got down to the business of ordering, we quickly realized there are no kids menu options.  We opted for a regular enchilada plate ($8) and I thought Little Guy could have leftovers for lunch the next day.  Wrong.  The regular plate came with a single enchilada, rice and beans.  So basically a kids portion for an adult price?  The #6 boasted a tamale, flauta and beef taco.  I was most excited about the tamale, but was a bit let down... The filling was sweet - something I guess I'm just not a big fan of.  The flauta was very dry and difficult to cut but was topped with some tasty guac.  The star of the plate hands down was the beef taco.  I think I'm in love with a crispy flour tortilla shell!  The chimichanga got good reviews at the table.  Bonus cinnamon crisps at the end rounded out the meal nicely.

Overall this place was good.  I seriously think Filiberto's is comparable.  For the price ($35 for two kids and one adult, two waters and one Sprite, chips and salsa) I'm not sure it's the best choice for the quality, but I can't deny I'd try this place again just for a plate of tacos and a bucket of cinnamon crisps.
