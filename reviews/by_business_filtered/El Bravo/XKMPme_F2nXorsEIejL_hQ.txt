Growing up in Arizona, and the west side-I only find El Bravo okay.  I had never been there before, even though I love Los Reyes de la Torta which is down the street.  I had heard a lot about the place and I finally had the chance to check it out.  I ordered a beef picadillo burro and a chicken green corn with sauce tamale.  

The burro was extremely disappointing.  It really didn't have any interesting flavor, spice or ingredients.  It was filled with beef and raw shredded cabbage, which I didn't enjoy. The tamale on the other hand was definitely the right choice--if it weren't for the tamale, El Bravo would have been a two star place for me.  The tamale was the best restaurant tamale I've had- the masa was soft, moist and perfectly seasoned.  However, for over $5 a tamale, I thought it was a bit expensive since it doesn't come with anything.

A nice surprise are the cinnamon sugar crisps that come with your bill.
However, for a disappointing burro, great-but expensive tamale and a soda, I got out of there just under $17.  So is El Bravo good?  I think they have some good things on the menu.  Would I spend $17 for okay Mexican food on a regular basis?  No thanks.
