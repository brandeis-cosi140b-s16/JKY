Do not go there if you're looking for "fancy".  It is however, authentic.  Y ou'll see the short Mexican" ladies cookiing in the back.  They have fresh made tortillas you can buy to go...which I always do.  Really enjoyed their shredded beef tacos and enchiladas.  If I'm in the area, I make it a point to stop by...even if it's just to buy a dozen of their homemade tortillas.
