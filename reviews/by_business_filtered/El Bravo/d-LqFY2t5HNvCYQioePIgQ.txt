This very good and inexpensive mexican food. They have excellent tamales, the green corn tamales are good plain or with chicken. The shredded beef with green sauce on frybread is superb, as is the frybread dessert with honey and powdered sugar. The one main issue with El Bravo is the consistently spotty service, but the food is consistently top notch if you can put up with the service.
