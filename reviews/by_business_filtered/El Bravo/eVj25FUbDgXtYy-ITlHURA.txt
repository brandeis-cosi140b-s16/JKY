Chose to dine in later on a Friday night.  It was clean inside, and the gentleman waiting tables and manning the register had quite good customer service.  The family photos on the wall are a nice touch, and while the furniture isn't perfect, it's not ripped up either.  The bars on the front are unsightly and unsettling though...I wish they would just have a rolling shutter or gate that would come down.

They do try "get you" by charging for the chips and salsa...in fact everything is extra, so don't go expecting a free tortilla like Chipotle.

I ordered the beef tamale and cheese enchilada combo, all rice, with an wff.  The beef was a tad chewy but had a nice slice level.  It was also a tad on the smaller side.  The red sauce made sure it was nice and moist.  It also had some potato inside and what looked like a green olive.  While it had a spicy kick to it, I do feel it overall lacked flavor (perhaps the meat wasn't marinated or slow cooked long enough, or was overcooked).  The rice was one-note, bland but not unpleasant, cooked decently,

The enchilada (which I ordered minus the onion) was pretty much perfect with the egg on top.  A bite with sauce, cheese, tortilla, egg, and rice was solid.

My bill for my tamale/enchilada plate and a flan was $17 before tip, which was a tiny bit higher than I expected, but their service was really quite excellent, they keep the place very clean (a girl bussed a table even though they were closing down the kitchen in a few minutes) and the food is satisfying.

I appreciated the little cinnamon sugar chip dessert that came with my bill too!  While I am sure some would fault them from being a bit too American-ized and inauthentic with their menu, it obviously sells well here, and coexists with the more traditional and perhaps more flavorful or spicy options that Sunnyslope offers.  I'd definitely recommend El Bravo for its cleanliness, quite decent food, and great customer service.
