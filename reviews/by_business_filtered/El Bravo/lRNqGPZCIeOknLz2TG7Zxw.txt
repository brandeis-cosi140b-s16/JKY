How have I not been here before?  Finally stopped in and oh my, delicious!

My son had a bean burrito. He loved it. I had a bite and the beans are great!  I tried the Mexican taco. This is a must try!  You probably only need one. Especially I you have the chips and salsa. Quite simply the best taco I ever had. 

Service was a bit slow, even though they weren't busy, but not enough to keep me from reccomending or returning. 

Â¡El Bravo es muy bien!
