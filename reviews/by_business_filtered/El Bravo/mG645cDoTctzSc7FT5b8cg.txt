LOVE this place. Eat here twice a month at least. Very consistent in quality. I love the pico type salsa with warm chips nice touch!. I always get the stacked enchiladas with extra onions & lettuce. The enchilada sauce is so creamy smooth. Also love their Indian fry bread with beef and green sauce. Fry bread is fluffy yet crispy enough to not be soggy when smothered with the green chili beef!
The staff is incredibly polite and kind. I feel like family when I'm there.
