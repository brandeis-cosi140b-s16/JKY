My coworkers and I always have a hard time deciding what to do for lunch.  One day, my coworker Mike suggested this place since we were in the mood for Mexican food.  He said the food is really good and he's been going there regularly for years.  After leaving that visit and going there multiple times, this is by far my favorite Mexican Restaurant in the Valley.

We always start off with some chips and salsa.  Make sure you try the sauce from the squeeze bottle.  It's so good that you end up eating so much chips and leaves you with little room to finish your meal.  If you want more appetizers, I would recommend the cheese crisps with peppers!  And if you like horchata, This place gives free refills :)

My favorite item from the menu is the green corn tamale with green sauce!  It's a must have when I come here.  I would usually pair it up with a bean and cheese burro.  If you have a really big appetite, go with one of the combo plates.  You will leave full with one of those plates. 

The staff here are really friendly and welcoming.  You'll see them chatting it up and laughing with the many regulars that come in.  Food comes out fairly quick even during the lunchtime rush.
