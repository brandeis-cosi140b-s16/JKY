Great Authenic Mexican food. I have been going here for over 15 years and it is one of my favorite mexican spots in town. Great tacos, home made tortillas and most everything is fresh. No host/hostess you just pick a table and they will help you out. Try the mexican indian fry bread come with powdered sugar and honey very good. Prices are pretty good and the wait is not bad during the week.
