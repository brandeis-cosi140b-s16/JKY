We had high expectations after reading the 4/5 star reviews for El Bravo, but our dinner tonight turned out to be only average.

We ordered the chips and salsa ($1) based on Calamari's recommendation which was wise as the food did take a while.  In fact, almost 20 min for one beef enchilada with rice and beans ($6.35) and one chicken green corn tamale with green chile sauce ($3.75).  

The masa of the green corn tamale was tasty but the chicken filling was on the dry side, so we were definitely grateful for the spicey green sauce.  The enchilada was drowning in a red sauce and yellow cheese - I could not taste the shredded beef at all.

Service was actually quite decent.  The waiter took our order promptly, inquired about our food and got us the check promptly.

If I happen to be in the area again, I think I'd choose to eat at Pepe El Toro Mexican Food just 1 block North instead.  Although there's only counter seating and no ambience, the food is totally authentic and kick-ass tasty.
