OMG, their cheese and onion enchiladas are superb!!  You pay a buck for chips and salsa, but that's worth it to me.  There are so many mexican places that serve weird hot sauce with their chips instead of real salsa, and this place had great salsa, so I'll pay the buck!  Sometimes the service is a little slow, but always polite, and the food is always fresh and delicious.  The restaurant is clean, and the seating is casual and comfortable with both booths and tables.
