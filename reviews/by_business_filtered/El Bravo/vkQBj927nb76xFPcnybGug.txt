The green sauce is amazing here.  The vibe is authentic, the food is on point Mexican, and the price is reasonable.  I freakin' LOVE the popover desert they have with powdered sugar and honey.  So simple, and unhealthy, yet so good :)  The food always comes out hot and fresh, and appears to have some older Mexican female at least running the show in the kitchen...which is a good thing.  Authenticity oversight, I dig it.  

I love taking people here who want "Mexican".  There are a ton of other items I have yet to try, but it's only a matter of time before I knock them all out.  

DEFINITELY check this joint out.
