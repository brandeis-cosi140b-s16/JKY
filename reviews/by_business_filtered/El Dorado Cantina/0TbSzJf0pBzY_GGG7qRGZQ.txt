We had plans to hit the place next door and I was craving Mexican food so our local friend recommended this place. Our party of 10 got there around 1130 and had a great time. The service was impeccable - I never had to ask for a thing and that's what I expect. The food was DELICIOUS and so were the drinks - I had the divorced eggs and some white sangria and the watermelon drink as well; husband had the street tacos and he finished those in record time and then started eating off my plate. Servers and the chef were constantly flitting about making sure we didn't run out of anything and that we were happy customers, which we definitely were. Prices are great too, I would absolutely come back my next time in Vegas!
