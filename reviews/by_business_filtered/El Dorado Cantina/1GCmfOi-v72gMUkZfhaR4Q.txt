Being from Los Angeles, I've tasted many flavors of Mexican cuisine. Tonight in Las Vegas this restaurant put many to shame. I'm a big fan of cochinita pibil and Executive Chef Paco does it right. Make sure to end your meal with the flan, it's also done to perfection. Not only was the food on point, the staff was friendly and quick with service. The environment is clean with a fully stocked bar with big screens all around. Do yourself a favor and try this place out. Tell Chef Paco, Rich and Phil sent you!!
