Wow... Amazing service! This is one of my favorite new spots in Vegas!

Just a heads up, its right next to a strip club. So when I was pulling in the drive way the girls with me were wondering why I was talking them to a strip club lol

I was surprised for a place next to a strip club the food was pretty good. They make fresh guac right at your table! They also have $1 street tacos from 3-6 and the rice is sooo mouthwatering delicious.

We met the executive chef Paco who was really cool. He hooked it up with some free coupons for the next time we visit. Gave the girls 2 free flans which was literally the best flan I've had. It was soo thick, rich and creamy straight up the chef's grandmas recipe. He even gave us free passes to the strip club next door. We really feel like VIPs here :)
