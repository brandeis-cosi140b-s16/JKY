This place exceeded any expectations we had! At first we laughed walking in because it shares a building with sapphire gentlemans club and we had my daughter with us, but it is a legit restaurant. Super nice inside with a friendly staff. The food was good. I had the shrimp tacos. They have black bean refried beans, which I have never had! I loved them! I can't wait to try the saut√©ed grasshoppers next time!
