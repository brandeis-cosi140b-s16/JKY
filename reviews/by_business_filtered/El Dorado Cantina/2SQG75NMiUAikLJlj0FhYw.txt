My gf and I can here since we saw how many good reviews this place had. We had a tough time finding it since they don't really have a sign up. When we walked in the staff greeted us and we got seated right away. Free chips and salsa! The food was delicious. Our waiter being from our home town San Jose did a great job recommending items on the menu. My gf got a margarita and she said it was the bomb! 
Plenty of TVs to watch the games/fights!  
We will definitely be coming back!
