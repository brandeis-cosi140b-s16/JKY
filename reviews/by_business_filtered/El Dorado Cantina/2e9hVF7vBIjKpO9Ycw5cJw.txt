What delicious food they have. I celebrated my 30th here with my twin sister (we are out of towners) We were hoping it would have been a little more exciting and full of people on a Saturday night, but it was pretty dead. They did put large sombreros on our heads and sang Happy Birthday to us, so that was fun. 

The food...man, it's been a couple of months, but I do remember really enjoying their rice and beans. I tried a couple of different tacos and liking them all. Everyone seemed to enjoy their food too as there weren't any complaints. 

I'm not sure if I'd ever come back, since we only frequent Vegas a few times a year and Vegas has so much to try and see.
