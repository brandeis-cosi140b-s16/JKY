This is without a doubt the best Mexican food I have ever had. Every bite was fresh full of flavor! The service was excellent and our glasses never went empty. The head chef Paco visited our table and was very kind and personable. He gave us complimentary flan and it was incredible! I don't even like flan but it was one of the best desserts I have ever had. We will be visiting here every time we are in Vegas! Don't let the fact that it is connected to a strip club discourage you from going. It has its own separate entrance. I give this place 5 stars in every category and I wish I could give it 10 stars on the food!!
