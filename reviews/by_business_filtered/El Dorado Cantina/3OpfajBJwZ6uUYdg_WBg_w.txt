Some of the best local restaurants are off the strip, just like this one. 
Next to Sapphire Club, El Dorado is a large and lovely restaurant with food that I would call gourmet Mexican. (No sloppy sauces or refried beans here).
Had lunch here with a friend but I'm thinking this would be a great place for group happy hour or a dinner with a small group. 
Tried the table side guacamole dip (their nacho chips are home made on site too), the waitress made the dip without onions per my request! Gourmet shrimp taquitos were what taquitos should be. The flan was s u p e r b (brought an extra one home)!
