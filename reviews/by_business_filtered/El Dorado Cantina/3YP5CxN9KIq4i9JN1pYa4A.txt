Overall excellent place, yes it's in the same building as sapphires gentlemen's club, but once inside you will forget the club is even there. The food is great, I had the big berry sangria and street tacos, as well as the aquachiles. I was expecting the aquachiles to be very spicy, but they were PERFECT.. Right amount of lime as well. There is a wait list if you come late at night, but bar seating is always open as long as there is seats available. Friendly staff, and friendly chef. (Chef Paco) You will love it, will come back soon for sure.
