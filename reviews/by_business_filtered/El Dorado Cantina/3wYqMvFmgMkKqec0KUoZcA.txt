Where do I start!!! Everything was so delicious! The Mahi and shrimp tacos to the best flan ever. I am coming back tomorrow for the Chilaquiles! Enrique was our waiter, he is very nice and tentative and gave really good suggestions. He even showed us his picture with Aaron Sanchez from Food Network.
