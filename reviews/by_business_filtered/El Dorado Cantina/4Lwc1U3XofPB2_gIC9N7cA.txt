What best stands out is the service. I have been here twice and service has been consistently amazing. I would recommend starting with the table side made guacamole and chips. Nothing beats fresh made right in front of you guac! We also had the house margaritas (highly recommend it). For dinner we had the enchiladas and new york strip steak, both were really tasty and well cooked. I feel like you can't go wrong in anything you choose. 

Finally the best part of this place is that they are 100% GMO free!! What more could you want!
