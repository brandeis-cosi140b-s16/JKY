This is my new favorite restaurant in all of Las Vegas. Don't let it's location scare you away. It is in no way affiliated with the club and the restaurant is very family friendly. 

The food is awesome and the great service made it that much better. I love how chef Paco interacts with his costumers and does everything he can to make his guests happy. Overall it was a great experience. 

For those of you trying to find this place it is next to the strip club. It was a little hard to see where the restaurant is at first but it's there.
