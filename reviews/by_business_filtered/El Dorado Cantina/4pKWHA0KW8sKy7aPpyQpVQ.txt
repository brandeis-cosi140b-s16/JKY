This is me and my boyfriends favorite Mexican place in Vegas. We love that it's non-gmo with vegan friendly items and open 24 hours!? We were sold from the start. We've eaten here at many different times in the day and the service and food are consistent every time we've gone. We have gotten many different dishes, but I would highly recommend the guacamole, because I love that they make it at the table, and also the fajitas! This past time we went was on a Tuesday night because we thought they would still have 50% off for industry night. We learned that they had ended that just a couple weeks before :( but at least they still have the Monday locals deal so we weren't mad! We decided to check in on yelp to get the free flan. I heard their flan is good but me and my boyfriend are personally not fans of flan, so our server (I forgot his name) said he could switch it to something we might like and we decided to get the churros. And they were AMAZING! We love this place and always highly recommend it!
