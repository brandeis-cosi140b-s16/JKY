I live out of town and every time I am in Las Vegas I make it a point to go to El Dorado Cantina. The food is delicious, as it is made with fresh foods that are described in the front of the menu. The service is always great and efficient. I usually get the Burrito, which is always great, but I decided to venture out and try something new. I got the Mexican Corn, which is a side dish, but it was good enough for a full meal and a wonderful treat. I love coming here, the ambiance is relaxing, the people are fun, Chef Paco is awesome and makes amazing Mexican Cuisine. I can't wait to go there tonight!
