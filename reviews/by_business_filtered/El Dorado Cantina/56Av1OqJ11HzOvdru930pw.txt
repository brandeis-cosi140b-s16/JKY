Don't let the location stop you from trying El Dorado Cantina. Located in the same building as the Sapphire Gentleman's club but a totally different establishment. The food is organic, non-GMO which is a bonus. Started with the Jalape√±o Margarita ... That's got quite the kick. Complimentary chips and salsa were good. Salsa was good but not spicy. Fresh Guacamole made table side allows you to have it made spicy or mild, your choice. Husband and I chose the street tacos. You choose any three out of 6 different tacos and served with rice and beans. Friend ordered the chicken enchiladas and her husband ordered the carne asade bowl. The green sauce on the enchiladas was good but spicy! The bowl was huge and tasty. Also order the grilled corn as it is the bomb! The corn is sweet and juicy and the coating is salty and slightly cheesy. Ended the meal with the flan. All four of us shared one as we were all stuffed but had to try it. It's creamy, and rich  and worth every calorie.
