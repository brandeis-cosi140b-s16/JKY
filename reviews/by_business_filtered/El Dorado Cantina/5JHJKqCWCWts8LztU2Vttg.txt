Really cute chic Mexican literally to the right of Sapphire Gentleman's club. 
If you are a guac fan then you will love this place. Table side guacamole was amazing and plentiful. 
I had the chicken enchiladas. It had a little spicy kick and was good. Served with beans and cilantro rice. 
End with the classic flan!! I devoured it.
