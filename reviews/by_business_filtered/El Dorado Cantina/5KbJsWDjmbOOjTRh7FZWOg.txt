If you are looking for authentic mexican food using organic ingredients then you have found the holy grail.   The food at this place rocks.   

We were quickly greeted at our table with chips and 3 different salsas.   Beware, the habanero is hot.  Watch out before digging in.

We started with the guacamole, made at the table.  Delicioso.

Next onto the shrimp cocktail.   Prepared perfectly, and dont think twice about taking a chip and getting the pico from the glass.   You will thank me later.  Fresh and tasty.  You can really taste the differnce organic tomatoes make in all of their dishes.

Next up....taquitos unlke any we ever had.  Usually these are a hot mess at the crappy mexican joints, but not here.   The chicken was perfect with a smokey taste.  Yummy!

Finally, you can't and shouldn't walk out of this place without trying the flan.  Unbelievable!

Chef Paoo stopped by the table to ask about our meal.  Nice touch.  You can really tell from talking with Paco, he cares about th quality of th food.  

Dont let the locations fool you.   Sure, its next to a strip club, but we felt safe the entire time.  This place is awesome and worth th effort to find.

ps....open 24 hours for those late night munchies!
