We went to celebrate my friends wedding. food was good .. We have a waitress she seems like she has no clue what she was duing. We ask for split checks first thing, before anything. She send wrong food and she told me she was going to void a plate because it was a wrong food but she end up charging me the food. She took forever to give us our check. She was so slow I don't know how she can be a waitress if she has no clue for what she was duing we like food but after all we can't go back . So sorry..
