This was a pleasant surprise. An organic Mexican restaurant open 24 hours this good!!! Wow!! Everything we had was excellent!  We will be BACK!!!!!!!! Chef Paco came out to see us to give us the flan. He used to live in Pleasanton California very close to us. The flan is his grandmothers recipe and it was soooo creamy. Must have.
