If you like organic and non-GMO food that is freshly prepared with just enough flavor to enjoy, but not over power your pallet this is it. The table side guacamole is fantastic. Okay, I know allot of restaurants do this now, but this is very efficient and they don't interrupt you to tell you about the finer points of avocados, garlic and lime juice. They just make it quickly and set it down. Today our table had the Cedar Chipotle Salmon, and the Pineapple Shrimp. The flavors in these two jewels come at you from different angles to create a center of happiness. On my previous visit I had the Shrimp Tacos.Too many restaurants cook the shrimp until they are as hard as rubber balls. Finally someone can cook shrimp and leave the flavor and texture in place. Don't let the address on Industrial fool you. This Cantina could be in any premium Strip hotel.
