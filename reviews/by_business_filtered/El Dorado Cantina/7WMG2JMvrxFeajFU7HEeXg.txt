Organic. Mexican. Food.

GMO-Free. Mexican. Food. 

Gourmet. Mexican. Food.

In Vegas. With a discount for locals. 

The chef comes around and delivers dessert, chats with the diners. Great service even aside from this, but it is a  bonus. 

I'm not a huge fan of 2 out of 3 of the moles and the location - adjacent to a strip club - isn't my favorite, especially since I'm bringing my young son along. That's why it's missing a star here. 

However, the atmosphere inside is nice and the food overall is delish. And did I mention it's Organic and non-GMO and gourmet?!
