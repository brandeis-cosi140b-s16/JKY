We saw the great reviews and decided to take a friend for dinner. Bonus it was locals eat for 50% off  even drinks! Monday! When I found out it was next to the worlds largest strip club I had to do nothing but laugh, only in Vegas. But I decide to trust the yelpers! So glad we did. don't be afraid of the location the door to El Dorado is literally right next to the strip club door . it's a gorgeous restaurant inside and the food was great. Loved the street corn. And now for the steak fajitas! YumO! Let me say I have been to many many places over the years and the fajitas all sucked compared to Coyotes in Henderson on sunset. So when I tried them I expected to say ehhh not as good, but to my amazement they were delicious right up there and I will be back. I'll bring anyone I know to try it. We also had the carnitas tacos which were stuffed full of meat and delicious also. The rice a buttery cilantro rice was a nice change from the standard dry Mexican rice at most places. Our friend ordered the chicken enchiladas she said the green sauce was spicy and she loved it. Then the cherry on top was the flan we got for free for checking in on yelp. Very yummy and the chef himself brought it out to us and introduced himself. If you're a local try it on a Monday you'd be crazy not to! Make sure to get a reservation the place fills up pretty fast.
