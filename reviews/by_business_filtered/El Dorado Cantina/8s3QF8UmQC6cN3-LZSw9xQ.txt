A buddy invited me here for lunch and when he told me it was in Saphire I thought I was getting the $5 all you can eat taco and tits special.  To my dismay there were no boobies, but the food was awesome!  We shared a carne asada burrito that was off the hook and some chicken enchiladas that were good, but not as good as the carne asada.  I would highly reccomend this place when you are near the strip, but don't want to deal with going to a hotel.  This place also a really cool vibe a good drink menu.
