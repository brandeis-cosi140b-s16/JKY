Went there last night....and the place was super busy because they have 50% off for locals.....anyway we managed to get a table and  in the end our experience was great. EXCELLENT MEXICAN FOOD we are coming back.
PS
My friends and my self work in the industry and we were amazed
 About Enrique who apparently was the only bus boy....as soon we get sat  he greet us and brought water...then he gave us a good recomendations...then I saw the guy behind the bar doing the same thing....never have to ask for refill ......he was on point.....he served our food and asked if we liked another round of  drinks ....5 seconds after he was making a guacamole on a different table....at this point we said: it's a bus boy, barback, Food runner or a server????
Its a Ninja!!!!!  We said lol ..@wish we had a bus boy like him in my work place.
