Every part of our experience was excellent.  Our waiter Chris made some awesome suggestions.  Food was super fast.  The manager and the chief came out to our table to check on our meal and if everything was to our liking.  It was the best dining experience of my life.  Flan was amazing and if you feel like some adventure try the grasshoppers.  They taste kind of like nuts.  It is a little odd that it is in the same building as a strip club but once you find the restaurant it is totally worth the unsavory location.
