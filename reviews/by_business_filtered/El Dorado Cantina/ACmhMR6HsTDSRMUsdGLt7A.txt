This is a very good restaurant. Good atmosphere, good food.mi would give it 5 stars but for a couple things.

I had the "Trio" Fajitas, which is Fajitas with steak, chicken and Shrimp. The food was fantastic and the portion was huge. How huge? For the first time in my life I could not eat it all, there was meat on my plate. I never do that, it impressed me. For dessert I had their Flan because it was free since I checked in on Yelp! Don't forget to do that!

Now for the detractors. I can't give a 5-star rating because:

1) The restaurant is located in the same building as the largest strip club in the world (according to the sign outside). we did not know this googling the restaurant and trying to find it, and just about gave up on it as we could only see the huge strip club (warehouse-sized building). Only by turning around in the strip club's parking lot did we finally see the front door of the Eldorado Cantina not far from the front door to the club. 

2) I ordered an Ice Tea to drink. When I went to take a sip of it, my nose smelled what can only be described as sewer water. It was NASTY. I asked the waitress to smell it and she gagged. She said she had heard that complaint before but this was the first time she had smelled it herself. I asked for a diet coke and it smelled fine. Something is not right with their water.

Other than that great restaurant. I will be back for those fajitas!
