Let it be known I'm commenting on the street tacos only. If you're looking for a great, healthy taco look no further! Happy hour these bad boys are $1 each and it's absolutely delicious. Best carne Asada I've had in my life. Honestly if you're looking for a range of Mexican food, I can't vouch, because all I ever get here are carne asada tacos. You can't beat the price during happy hour or locals Mondays where your check is half off!
