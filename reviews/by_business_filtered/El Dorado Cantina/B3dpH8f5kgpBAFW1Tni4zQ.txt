Stopped by after a long weekend in Vegas, was looking for something off the strip, was not disappointed. Food was great and so was the service. Had the jalapeño Margarita and the El Dorado Cantina Margarita, both were delicious.  The jalapeño had a good kick to it too. Got free chips and salsa too, I liked the green and red ones. For entrees we had the mole sampler and the chilaquiles. The portions were out of control and the taste was great. I really liked the green and pumpkin flavored mole. The Carne Asada was tender and flavorful as well.  Then throw in the flan, great meal. Will be back again.
