Hard to find place. It is in the same parking lot as the famous sapphire strip club. Free margarita was very nice. Place has a nice feel. Free chips is also very good. Veggie burrito was a little bland so you might want to ask them to put some sour cream and guac. Guac also has a lot of garlic which depends on your palette - some might like it.
