Can you say delicious? Everything, from the salsa choices and the guac, to the street tacos (we had the all pastor) and all the entrees was amazing. And then there was the flan. I'm picky about that. Creamy, rich, smooth, and obviously carefully and freshly made. And churros too! The drinks were pretty fabulous, and worth the price. We'll be back for sure.
