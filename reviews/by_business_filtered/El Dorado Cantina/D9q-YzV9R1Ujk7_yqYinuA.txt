Great new Mexican restaurant just off the strip.  Nice atmosphere, great music, drinks with a variety of authentic dishes at the right prices... They even have breakfast. ..Pozole and albondigas.   I did not try it but they have an authentic grasshopper appetizer dish...... Maybe after a few glasses of sangria!!  Seems like a great place to hang out after work.
