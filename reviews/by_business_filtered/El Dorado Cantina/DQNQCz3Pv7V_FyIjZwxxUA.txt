So I came here since a good friend referred me to it. The restaurant has been open for 2 months so fairly new. Love the restaurant ambiance, dim lighting, sugar skulls, very comfortable seats, big tv's for the bar, and great selection of tequila. 

We sat down at the bar and had Jessy as our server/bartender I believe. Very knowledgeable, we came in for happy hour which is 3-6 pm, $1 street tacos , 3 dollar domestic beers, 4 dollar imports, and 4 dollar well drinks. All beers are in bottle, no draft beer here.  

They ask you if you would like any chips and salsa they give you 3 types of salsa mild, med, and hot. All 3 were very good.
For the tacos I had 1 of each they have 5 types. Top 3 are the Carnitas, alpastor, and cochinito. Get those 3 and you will be extremely happy, especially paying 1 dollar each. The Margarita was decent but not bad.  

We got 7 street tacos, 1 domestic beer, 1 margarita, beans and rice and only paid 19.47 so yeah I definitely think this place earns 5 stars.
