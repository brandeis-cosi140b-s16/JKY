Oh my various Gods! This place is just what Vegas needed - a Mexican restaurant that makes authentic Mexican food while at the same time taking gastronomical risks! 

I know that this place isn't going to be for everybody. I also know that it takes a certain type of person to walk towards the blue neon of Sapphire at 2 AM for Mexican food. The unassuming entrance gives way to a modern dining room and bar. It's well lit, yet there's an abundance of velvet and mirrors and the knowledge of what is going on on the other side of that wall that give El Dorado its distinct Vegas-y vibe... This isn't the place for children to order quesadillas while their parents drink margaritas!

There are crickets on this menu. 

Delicious, spicy, crickets. You should order them. You'll be a better person for it. 

They also serve Ghost Pepper salsa. You should only order this if you're ready. The flavor is amazing but the heat is serious and lasting! If you're not sure just start off slow and see how much heat you can take (if the habanero salsa they gave you with the chips when you first sat down scared you then don't order the ghost pepper salsa!).  This salsa is one of the most wonderful things I've ever had so if you're of a type that enjoys the flavor of pain I highly recommend this salsa!

There are, of course, many traditional items on this menu that you'll recognize and love: fresh guacamole, tacos, burritos, enchiladas... But they also have a selection of mole` and that's what makes this place special. I tried the sampler plate and found each of them unique and enjoyable in their own way. My personal favorite being the darker, chocolate based mole`.

El Dorado Cantina is the kind of place you go to at the beginning or the end of a night of drinking, a refuge from the neon, sanctuary from boring Americanized Mexican food.
