We were sold the second we saw everything they make is non-gmo. The food is amazing! I had the chicken burrito and my wife had the chicken street tacos. Got a complementary flan for our check-in. It was the best flan we have ever had. Chef Paco brought it to our table and said it was his Grandma's last gift. It was more than amazing. We'll be coming back for life.
