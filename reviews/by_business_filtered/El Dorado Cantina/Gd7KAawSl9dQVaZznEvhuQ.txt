After a few attempts at grabbing late night grub at local yet over-crowded taco bars, we decided to try El Dorado Cantina. We initially passed by the location a few times due to a combination of the dark street, discreet signage and the unexpected location surroundings - but were pleased to receive some of the best service I have ever experienced, a great food selection in a very cool and relaxed environment.

Don't let the location deter you from trying this restaurant.

We were promptly greeted at the front door by the hostess who seated us at a back table. While the restaurant was a bit dark, it seemed chill/cool/clean.

Our most outstanding waiter, Andy, visited the table, discussed the menu with us and provided recommendations. He was able to name-drop the farms where El Dorado sources their meat and brought out watermelon agua fresca for us to try, be still my beating heart. I love agua fresca and their offering did not disappoint.

We opted for the:

Tableside Guacamole - Gluten Free & Vegan
Chipotle Chicken
Cochinita Pibil
Watermelon Agua Fresca

The guacamole was on point and we ate so much, so quickly, that by time the food came out we didn't have much room left. As native Texans, we both should have known better than to eat 8,000 pounds of corn chips before a meal but who can say no to avocado. Andy made it so perfectly spicy, I wanted to cry (tears of happiness).

I found the Chipotle Chicken to be on the dry side, but the sauce balanced it out a bit. It should be noted that I took most of it home and promptly stuffed my face with it the next morning. It was my main source of fuel for the Rock n Roll marathon later that evening.

The service was outstanding, the food was solid, and the environment was both relaxed and comfortable. Definitely worth a visit.
