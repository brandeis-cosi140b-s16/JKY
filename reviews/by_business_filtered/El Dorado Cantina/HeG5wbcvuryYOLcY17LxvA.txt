This is my weekly lunch spot. ESPN on the tvs and the staff is very friendly. The chef comes out and greets every guest during their meal. 

I've been several times now and try something new in each visit. My favorite item: Carnitas Street Tacos. 3 huge tacos that taste delicious. 

Get the green salsa w/ chips and mix with their rice. You'll love it.
