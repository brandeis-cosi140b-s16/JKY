I'm sorry to say we were underwhelmed. The chicken was dry, the enchilada sauce and beans tasted like they were from a can, and the salsas were mediocre at best. Had I not watched the feature on the food network, I would have passed it up due to the fact that they share an entrance with a strip club.
