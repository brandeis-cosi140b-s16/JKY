Delicious.  Steak and chicken breast tenderized and seasoned perfectly, nothing dry or bland.  It was too busy for a table so we sat at the bar, but the food was so tasty that no one cared.  The portions are pretty big too and I ate my entire plate and half of my wife's plate that she couldn't finish.  I had one of the platters, she had a steak burrito, and our friend got a steak bowl, everything was delicious.  We drank water and ordered the guac and chips.  Everything came out to $90 tip included.  Worth it, but next time I will wait for a booth, order drinks and make an evening out of it.
