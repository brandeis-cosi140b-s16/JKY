I'm hesitant to hype it up too much and let the cat out of the bag, but this place is easily one of the best-kept secrets in Vegas right now. The only thing to complain about is the location, as it shares a building and parking lot with the infamous Sapphire strip club. 

Sure, El Dorado Cantina has a separate entrance from "the world's largest gentleman's club," but the walk up to the front door can be a little awkward if you're with children, a first date, your parents, or a business acquaintance -- especially if they're the opposite sex. Trust me, though -- Once you walk inside, you'll totally forget there's nothing but a red wall that separates the restaurant from 70,000 sq ft of topless women.

Previously a sushi house, El Dorado Cantina has been totally upgraded and remodeled and now features a sophisticated decor with a cool vibe and a great ambiance. The interior includes rich brown woods, hand-woven red wall coverings, several antique-looking mirrors, and wrought-iron light fixtures with soft lighting. The bar also offers more than 100 tequilas, Horchata, multiple types of sangria, and several house-made juices including pineapple, hibiscus, watermelon and more. 

The great food and exceptional service are what truly distinguish this restaurant from other Mexican spots, however. Chef Paco routinely visits the tables to speak with his patrons and many of the items are prepared table side for your pleasure (including the margaritas and guacamole). I've tried a different menu item each time I've dined here and truly enjoyed everything I've experienced.

The flavors in the food really pop out and make a profound statement, and I guarantee you'll have a hard time deciding what to eat after you read the extensive and enticing menu. I've visited El Dorado Cantina multiple times and dined with groups as large as 15, yet I've never heard anything but compliments from my friends and colleagues. This Mexican restaurant is a definite palate pleaser.
