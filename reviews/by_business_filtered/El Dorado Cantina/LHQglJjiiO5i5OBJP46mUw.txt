Wow amazing dinner! We came in without a reservation and sat at the bar. Our bartender Omar was real helpful in helping us decide what to have for dinner. I had the steak and shrimp fajitas and my wife had the chicken tacos. Omar managed (without much effort) to talk my wife and I into three desserts. Each more amazing than the next. The flan was the best I've ever have! We will be back
