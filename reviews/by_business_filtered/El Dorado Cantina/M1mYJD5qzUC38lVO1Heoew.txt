We had a hard time finding the place. After passing it and doing a u turn we realized it's in the same building as sapphire gentlemens club. That was a bit of a turn off and we considered not going, but I'm very  happy we did. 
Once inside the place is very nice. We went for happy hour (3-6 every day) for $1 tacos. I had one of each of their five street tacos. All were great as was the service. Paco the chef came to our table to make sure everything was ok. That's always a nice touch. We will be back soon.
