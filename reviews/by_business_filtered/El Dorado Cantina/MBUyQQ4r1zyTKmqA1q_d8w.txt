My last outing here was fine on the whole, but there were some discordant notes.  

Tableside Guac was very good but noticeably salty, while Albondigas Soup was excellent, with savory meatballs standing out in a hot vegetable-oriented broth.  Although Imperial Shrimp wrapped in bacon and lightly fried was a good starter, I believe the dish would taste better without the fish stuffing.  

My main of a slow cooked Carnitas Rajas Burrito, packed with marinated pork and Cilantro Rice, roasted peppers, Refried Beans, fresh Guacamole, a Mexican blend of three cheeses, and Avocado Salsa in a warm Flour Tortilla, featured tender carnitas and was both filling and satisfying.  But I would have liked more Pico de Gallo and a saucier burrito.  And a mound of Cilantro Rice on the side, outside the burrito, seemed superfluous.  

Seating was comfortable but there was not a heavy server presence, and the waiters who attended our table kept switching.   At meal's end I had to ask two different servers for the check, and the men's restroom was messy.  Nevertheless, because the food here is noticeably fresh, clean, and composed of high quality ingredients, and is available 24 hours, El Dorado Cantina is an asset to the Las Vegas Mexican cuisine dining scene, and worth another look.

3-1/2 Stars overall on this visit.
