Do not be put off by the location!   You will miss a jewel!

I stopped by with my 7 yr old daughter and husband for a late lunch today and had my socks knocked off by the quality of the food.
We came by after attending a pumpkin patch in the rain and when the gps guided us into the sapphire club parking lot, I thought that the restaurant was inside the gentleman's club.  But no,  it is a separate entrance to the left of the club entrance...... And worth the trip.   I will be going back.  

The kids meal menu is $6 and includes a decadent churro + chocolate cinnamon sauce dessert, more than that, the bean and cheese burrito that came with my daughter's selection was, in her words, "yummy!"  She says that her favorite part was the tortilla,  and I have to agree,  the tortillas here have that flakey crunch that is so good.

I had the lettuce wraps and accidentally cleaned my plate.... I usually can't finish a restaurant meal,  but this was tasty and not heavy and well....I looked down and there was very little left.

My husband had the pulled chicken burrito and it was excellent too.  The chicken was succulent and nicely spiced.  An item I will go back for too (he gave me a small bite).

All in all I recommend this restaurant to anyone who is fond of good eating in a calm atmosphere....I did not have the opportunity to try any bar drinks but the margaritas at the table next door looked very tempting.....

I could see this place being a great evening place for a non kid crowd.
