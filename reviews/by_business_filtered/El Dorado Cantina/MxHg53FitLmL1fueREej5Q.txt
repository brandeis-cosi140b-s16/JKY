BEST MEXICAN FOOD IN TOWN! I'M SERIOUS! Came into Vegas not expecting to find much for mexican food, found out the El Dorado Cantina was right by where I was staying at, saw this place on yelp and I have to say 100% worth it! You get good portions the word stingy doesn't exist here. I highly recommend starting with the table side guacamole you get "ALOT" The chicken enchiladas "SUPERB" and the street tacos, "TRY ALL OF THEM". Also try the Homemade FLAN so rich and creamy. BOTTOM LINE if your in town do yourself a favor, if you want quality mexican food that matches with quantity check this place out! Special Thanks to our waiter Rosemarie fantastic service and awesome personality, and the executive Chef PACO he made this all possible!
