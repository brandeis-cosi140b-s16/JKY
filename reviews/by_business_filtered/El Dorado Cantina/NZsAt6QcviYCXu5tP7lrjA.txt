Do not go here if you want customer service. it is one of the worst restaurant I've ever eaten in Las Vegas since I've been here since 1995. When we first got there they seated us at a booth that was absolutely filthy. Then they moved us to another booth where the seats were full of grease but we stayed then they told us we couldn't have happy hour in the booth we had to go to the bar. when we went to the bar the bar told us that we could have happy hour in the booths no one seems to know what was going on there. Finally after sitting at the bar for 20 minutes the bartender took our food order. But there's one good thing about the restaurant the food  The chef needs to move out of that restaurant and go to someplace where he'll be appreciated at. Because the service at this restaurant is abominable. oh and to top it off the $5 margaritas that were on for happy hour we were charged $11.00 for but we didn't say anything feeling that we never come back here again. As for me and my friend being limo drivers we will never ever suggest this place to any of our customers.
