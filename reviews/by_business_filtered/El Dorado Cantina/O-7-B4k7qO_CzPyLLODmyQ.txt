Amazing food.. amazing staff.. everything I've ordered is great, although I always retreat to my regular order of the pulled chicken tacos and rice :) which is pretty much already put in to order when I walk in the door. The carnitas and carne asada tacos are great too.. def check this place out and be sure to grab a drink from Omar at the bar!
