This place is great. So important to eat organic and non-GMO. the food was great, the restaurant itself was great, but most of all ....the staff is great, from the hostess who greeted and seated us, to Amber our server who took such great care of us and our disabled son, to the Amazing Chef Paco who personally brought our mist delicious flan to our table, then stayed and chatted with us for several minutes. We'll be back every time we come to Vegas.
