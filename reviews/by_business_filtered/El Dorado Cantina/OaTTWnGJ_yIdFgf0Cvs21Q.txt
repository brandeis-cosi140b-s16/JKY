I've been here at least ten times.  The food is always delicious.  And the cucumber  jalape√±o margaritas: fabulous!  The service is excellent, but I now have a MAJOR pet peeve.  The restaurant has started charging to refill salsa, and they charge to give you tortillas in a supposedly Mexican restaurant.  I find this to be incredibly insulting, especially when you consider the food and service comes at a pricey expense.  I'm sorry, but we are not in Europe---charging for a salsa refill is just not acceptable.  I will be returning in the future but if they continue charging to provide salsa refills, it will be the last time I come back.  Previous rating: 5 stars.  My new rating: 3 stars.  Charge me for salsa again: 1 star.
