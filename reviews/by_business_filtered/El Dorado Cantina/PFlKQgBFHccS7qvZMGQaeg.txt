We stopped by Vegas on our way home from a camping trip in Zion. Food was excellent! The staff is friendly and attentive. I ordered the carne asana street tacos and they were flavorful and fresh! The salsa that came with the chips were delicious. And you must order the flan! I usually don't order the flan because I'm not a fan of custard, but this flan is unique. It's like a cross between flan and cheesecake. Chef Paco came by and chatted with us. Very humble and genuine. Make sure you come and check out their happy hour. $1 street tacos!!
