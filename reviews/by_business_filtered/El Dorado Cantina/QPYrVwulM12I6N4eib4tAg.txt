We came for Mexican Independence Day last night, and we hit a home run!  

We had a very large group, and even though they booked another group over us in the back room, they still accommodated us in the front of the restaurant.   The wait staff was pretty good, especially considering the size of our group. 

They gave us pitchers of sangria on the tables for free. It was nice, but it was pretty watered down, which made it very light. 

They also had complimentary tequila shots on the hour. I think this was for the whole house, and not just for our party. 

Towards the end, Chef Paco came out, and greeted everyone. I took a picture with him and then he made me take another one with a Sombrero. Too fun!!

Ok....now for the food...I ate GRASSHOPPERS!!!!   They have them on their appetizer menu, and someone got an order.  They ordered the garlic lime, but there is a habanero version too. I was proud of myself for eating them...I actually thought it was pretty uneventful. I was worried after the crunch, there would be a squish of guts, but there wasn't. It was just crunchy and tasted like garlic lime.  

For the rest of my meal, I got the table side Guacamole, which was good. I tasted someone's Shrimp Taquitos and they were delicious. And my main meal was the Mahi Mahi Tacos minus the mango salsa. I put some of my fresh guacamole on them instead. The fish was cooked perfectly and flavorful. Oh yeah...The rice was amazing!!!!  I ate every bit of it, but was too full to eat both tacos. 

I will definitely be back!!!! Loved this place!!!!
