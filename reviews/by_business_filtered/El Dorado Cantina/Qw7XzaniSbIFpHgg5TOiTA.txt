It's comical driving here as the restaurant is surrounded by strip clubs (gentlemen's clubs).  In fact, the restaurant shares its building with an establishment with a catchy name like The Lucky Lady or the like.  The restaurant is upscale in its appearance and the waiters and employees are very nice and professional.

I absolutely loved the chips and salsa but my margarita wasn't very good and our main dishes were just not tasty.  I walked away very disappointed.  I was hoping for an outstanding meal but it didn't happen for our group.  Too bad.
