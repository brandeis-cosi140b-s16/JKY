First time there this evening. Sooooo yummy! The customer service (Melanie (general manager, Chef Paco and waitress), food and decor were great. My chicken street tacos and hubby's carne asada tacos were  so flavorful.  The chef even came out and introduced himself to us. The table side guacamole was great. They make it fresh right at your table. The flan was delicious as well (chefs grandmothers recipe). All their food is organic and tastes fresh. There are 3 other sit down Mexican restaurants in our area. We have visited them only once and never gone back. We used to go to one until they increased their prices $4 an entree. I'm glad as a dtlv resident there's something close by that has great tasting Mexican food with good prices. We will be back again for sure! Monday's they offer 50% off for locals.
