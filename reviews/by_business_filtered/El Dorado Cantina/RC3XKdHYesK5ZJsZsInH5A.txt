The French toast was unbelievable and one order feeds two easily.  The fajitas for dinner were great and the House Margarita was even better!  Our server was Enrique and he was fantastic!  The chef, Paco, came out to greet us and provided us with a great sense of the restaurant's hospitality. We will be back!
