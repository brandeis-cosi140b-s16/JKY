Great place for a work lunch! Had the Tostada Salad with shrimp - the presentation was beautiful and the chipotle ranch dressing had so much flavor with just enough heat for me. The portions are huge but I made sure to save room for dessert.  I must say Chef Paco's flan is the best I've ever tasted - the texture was perfect and the flavor was heavenly.  Will definitely be back again soon!
