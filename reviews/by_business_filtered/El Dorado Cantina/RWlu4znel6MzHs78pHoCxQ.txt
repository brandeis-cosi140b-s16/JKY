We've been here a few times and the food is always really fresh and delicious. Last night was exceptional. Our waiter Neil was really knowledgeable about the menu as I don't eat dairy or grains so it's always a challenge for me to eat out. 

We ordered the crickets as an app and they were surprisingly good.  I had the Siegel Platter and the meat was super flavorful. My fiance had the Mexican burger and said it was amazing. His sister had a quesadilla and she said hers was great too. They got the churros for dessert and I did not partake, but they could not stop talking about how life changing they were! 

Super yummy dinner at El Dorado Cantina last night!  Chef Paco even came to our table to make sure we were happy with our food. Awesome service too!
