Don't let the location fool you, this place is the home of authentic Mexican cuisine.  My boyfriend and I were hesitant at first but being the foodie that I am, I couldn't resist to try this place out. From the cantaloupe water to the guacamole made table side to the habanero salsa and enchiladas, our dinner was delicious. My boyfriend and I are from Mexican decent therefore we become huge critics when it comes to the food of our land, let me tell you we were not disappointed.  There's only one word to describe the food.. AUTHENTIC.  If you haven't tried this place you're missing out.
