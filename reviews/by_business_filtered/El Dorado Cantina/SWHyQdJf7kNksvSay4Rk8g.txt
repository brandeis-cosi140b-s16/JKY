Wow - found this place on Yelp on our way out of town. The temptation to turn around and eat somewhere else was high when we rolled up and saw it was attached to Sapphire Gentlemen's club - we are so glad we stayed. 

This review is 4.5 stars. 

The food is incredible, very authentic and flavorful. The three complementary salsas that come with the chips are just a pre-indicator of the delicious food to come. Our waitress, Tiffany, was very sweet and knowledgable about the menu. She gave some great suggestions and made some killer table-side guac. 

All in all, really great experience. Highly recommend for a good treat off the strip. We will definitely be back. The menu also boasts that it is all non-GMO and mostly organic ingredients, and the prices were super reasonable taking that into consideration with the fact that it's Vegas.
