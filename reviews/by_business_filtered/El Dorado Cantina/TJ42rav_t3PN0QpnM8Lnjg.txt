Being in Vegas with family we decided we should find some really good Mexican food.  Yelp did not disappoint.  The only downside was that this was in the same lot as a gentlemen's club and when approaching from the south it appeared it was in the club.  We passed it and decided to eat elsewhere with the family.  

Later that night we decided we really wanted to check this place out and see if the reviews were legit.  It was bugging me that there were over 650 reviews and 4.5 starts but the place appeared that it was in the club.  Could it be true that the food is good in a strip club????  As soon as we pulled into the lot we realized the restaurant has a separate entrance than the club and was a GREAT spot!  The food was delicious and the service was spectacular.  Can't wait to go back to Vegas!
