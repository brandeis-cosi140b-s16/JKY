Excellent service. Executive chef Paco came out and introduced himself to our table. We were here with three other folks for a party of five. We had a variety of dishes and all were tasty. The drinks were stiff and very good on value. I particularly recommend the shrimp tacos. The tostadas de tinga on the happy hour is a huge portion for the cost. We will definitely be back.
