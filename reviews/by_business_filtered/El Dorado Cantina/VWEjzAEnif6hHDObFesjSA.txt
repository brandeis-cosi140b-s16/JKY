Wow! This place was amazing. We had never been there before but it was right around the corner from Vegas Machine Gun Experience. Kind of a funky spot since it is literally attached to Sapphires Gentleman 's Club but do not prejudge. The decor is extremely classy and they are organic and non GMO! They also have vegan options as well. The food was delicious and the staff was super friendly and personal. In fact, Chef Paco even came by to introduce himself and let us know that they offer 50% off for locals on Mondays!

I will definitely be coming back soon!
