Amazingly yummy food n great dining experience..  got free chips and 3 kinds of salsa to start with. We ended up eating 3 servings of those between two of us. We ordered shrimp taco and veggie burrito.. Very fresh and delicious.. Also the chef came to the table to check on the food.. Very sweet waitress Annabelle.. Cannot ask for more.. Highly recommend this place.
