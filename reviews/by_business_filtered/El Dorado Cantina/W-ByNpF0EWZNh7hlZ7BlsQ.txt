I would have given this place 5 stars for the food but the service was horrible. They sat us at a table near the bar so the bar tender was our server and the wait began. and continued... and continued... and continued........ Finally after what should have been a 45 minute meal turned into 3 hours of mostly waiting for our barteneder/server to come back with items we asked for. I will try it one more time
