I was here in mid-July and I have to say, excellent experience all around! I honestly wondered if all the positive reviews were for real, but add mine to the list. Chips were crispy, salsa was delish (although watch out for the hot one-- it's VERY hot) and the drinks were fresh and wonderful. My husband had the pozole soup and carne asada tacos and was super excited about all of it. I had the shrimp tacos-- fabulous. Our waiter was great and the bartender told us they make their own marg mix (which is probably why it's so good). The chef even came out to talk to us and ask if everything was OK. Amazing food and service, no complaints. Oh and when we were driving away, the waiter ran out after us and told us he gave us the wrong bill and accidentally overcharged us-- what honesty! I was super impressed, I must say. I'll for sure be back.
