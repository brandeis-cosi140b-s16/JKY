As much hype as this place has gotten, I figured it would for sure suck! But to my pleasant surprise....it was A M A Z I N G !

The best part about it is that it's in a strip club -- keeps all the super-pretentious squares away. It does have a separate entrance, so you don't actually have to go in the strip club...but you still have to park under the electric blue neon glare of the Sapphire signage, among all the strippers, bros and pervs. Not a big deal, tho! 

The second best part is the food -- I had carne asada tacos, and they were OUT OF THIS WORLD! The black beans and rice that came with them were also EXCEPTIONALLY delicious -- they had a delicate flavor to them that I can't even describe, but I could have eaten  10 plates of each :-) I also had a house margarita, which was basically like any other margarita...only presumably GMO and organic, blah blah blah.

Prices are a little high -- for my 3 tacos it was around $15. But I don't mind paying a premium for bad ass food, which this is! Service was OK -- everyone was friendly and helpful, but our waitress did fudge my friend's order twice. (Minor stuff, and my friend did not even bring it up, so no harm no foul.)

I'm only docking one star because of the chip situation. They bring you a basket of chips and some salsa when you are seated, but then the waitress gives this weird legal disclaimer-type spiel about how the first basket is on the house, but additional baskets are $3.50 each or something like that. I thought that was kinda miserly -- for $5 a taco, ya can't throw in some friggin' tortilla chips? The fact that they announce this at the very beginning of your experience kinda creates an awkward vibe.

Other than that, a GREAT place and I will be back for sure!!
