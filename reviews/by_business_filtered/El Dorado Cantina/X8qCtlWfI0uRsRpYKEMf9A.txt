A new modern twist to Mexican food in Las Vegas. Finally I have found a restaurant that serves NON GMO foods!

I have been disappointed in the quality of Mexican restaurants that we have in Las Vegas. Usually if you want good Mexican food, you have to go to California. 

This restaurant takes the cake. Probably one of the best Mexican restaurants in Vegas. 

We ordered the table side guacamole, carne asada and carnitas street tacos, chicken enchilada,  and deep fried ice cream. 

Wow. Foodgasm heaven! I still am thinking about the ice cream... lol. 

Everything was fresh, had enough kick to it, and tons of flavor. 

The ambience was amazing. A cool Gothic Spanish feel with a modern twist. 

Service was great as well. 

The only negative is that it's next to a strip club. But for all the parents the strip club is not connected. Also the rice lacks flavor and needs more like and salt added to it. 


We will definitely be back!
