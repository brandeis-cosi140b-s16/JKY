This place does not disappoint!! The waiter was super nice! The ambiance was good!! 

We had the carne Asada burrito and shrimp tacos!! 
Wow sooooooo good!! The rice is amazing! 
I also had the red sangria and was not disappointed!! 

Hard to find as you have to park in the sapphire strip club parking lot and it basically right next to the front entrance of the strip club. But don't let that put you off!! 
In our entire stay is Vegas this was our favorite place by far!!!! 

The chief came out to meet us personally!! 

Don't hesitate to go to this place!!! 
Just go!! We got our free flan and wow sooo goood!! 
The chief even brought us out a cream strawberry dessert and Even better if that's possible!!! 

This was our 15 wedding anniversary and they didn't  know but made our last dinner in Vegas so special!!

Thanks to chief paco!! 
You made our night!!! 
You guys killed it!!
