My wife and I saw the restaurant on the food channel and decided to come on our first night in Las Vegas.
We are big fans of fish tacos and we were not disappointed. The mahi was fresh and grilled, not fried as at so Many other restaurants. They were delicious. 
We also has a bacon wrapped shrimp appetizer which was fantastic .
Our waiter Chris was pleasant and professional. He told us things about the food and the menu and made our dining enjoyable . The place is a little hard to find as it shares the parking lot with a strip club, but it is no big deal.
Highly recommend it.
