The food was amazing! Ordered the cochinita and fish tacos. Only thing I had to say was that the beans and tortillas were a little dry but the manager comped us a drink so it made up for it! You definitely need to make reservations because walk-ins have to wait a little longer. And the flan...the flan is a must try! Checked in and got it for free...even if I had to pay for it, so worth it!  Going to have to come back! Oh wait, preparadas... you guys have to work on them a little more..let's add extra ingredients to make them better!
