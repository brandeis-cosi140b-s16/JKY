I recently paid a visit to El Dorado Cantina on a weekend trip to Vegas and man was I so glad I did. The bar was set so high on my last visit I didn't think they could top it but nope, I was wrong, they sure did and then some.

I was with a significantly smaller group this time and elected to sit at the bar. The overall service, experience and food is very much still top notch however this time I was able to sample the table side ghost chili salsa and the jalapeno cucumber margarita.

So let me tell you about both, sitting at the bar I had the honor of being served by the head bartender Tiffany. (If Tiffany is reading this, I'm sorry for misspelling your name, not sure if it is with an "I" or a "y". The ghost chili salsa is prepared for you table side which in this case was bar stool side. As the restaurant is well known for, the ingredients are extremely fresh and they are very generous with the ghost chili. Tiffany added like 11 chiles I believe and when I saw that she had double gloved I was like in my head what am I about to get myself in for. The end product was fantastic, spicy yes but not as hot as I thought it would be and it was a perfect complement to the food I ordered. Make no mistake this is very hot but if you're a fan of spicy food, you can handle it, c'mon, live a little. On the jalapeno cucumber margarita, Tiffany was very thorough in the preparation and it demonstrated itself in the taste. By far, the best margarita I've ever had. I'm not into sweet cocktail drinks, I'm more of a beer guy but this drink was no cocktail this was a masterpiece. Perfectly balanced, spice, tartness, sweetness and boozy kick. Man, I didn't want that to end. So on Tiffany, she's VERY VERY easy on the eyes (wink wink) so I was pretty stoked I was at the bar and she ended up being my bartender. She put on the Angel game for us too, she's rocked!. Chef Paco, well what can you say, he's the man in Vegas :)

Can't wait to be back!!
