I haven't actually eaten in the restaurant so I will save a star for that experience. I have had the pleasure of having their food a couple of times with having it brought to our office. Very very good food! It was so flavorful and filling! I've had their tacos and burritos. I can't wait to actually go there and try different menu options.
