This place is excellent in all ways. Don't be put off with its location (next to sapphire strip club). Families are all around.
Food is 5 stars. Guacamole, enchiladas, veggie tacos, free yelp flan......all awesome.
Service is 5 stars. Excellent as well. Including the guac guy! Our waitress was Amber, she took great care of us. Most guac guys are in a rush, but this gentleman (Ulysses) took his time, tailored it to our tastes and chatted us up. Chef Paco and manager greeted us too.

Grab an uber and come over here Asap.
