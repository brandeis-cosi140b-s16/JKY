Mexican restaurant with some personality (including its location attached to Sapphires) haha. The only reason I came across El Dorado is due to its proximity to my workplace, and I'm glad I did. 

The street tacos are amazing! Authentic, fresh and delicious. You can choose from a variety of meats including al pastor, carnitas, carne, pollo, and more. Think traditional Mexican restaurant-sized portions too so you might have leftovers. Shoouulddd have leftovers I should say...

I'm a sucker for corn elote and I'm glad I ordered it because it didn't disappoint. Also, Vegas locals get half off on Mondays (maybe just for lunch, call and verify). When we went, a Yelp check in also meant for a large, free churro dessert. Yes please. 

After coming here a few times, a common thread seems to be slow service, especially for lunch in an area common for businesses. But hey, can't say I won't be back!
