Don't be discouraged by the overcrowded parking lot for the gentleman's club next door. The service and food were fabulous. We attended the late night happy hour for drink and food specials. We had the margaritas and the street tacos along with empanadas. All the food was freshly prepared with top of the line ingredients. Flan was a great way to finish the meal incredibly rich and from an owners family recipe. A must try. Wonderful experience. If you go ask for Raphael at the bar great attention to detail and loves our Yelp family!
