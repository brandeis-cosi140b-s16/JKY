Went here w my boo. Honey with all the massive billboad action, I expected this place to be the bomb dot com. We were not wowed.....food is healthy but not very tasty. For the high prices, it was just ok. 3 stars is because it's organic. but here's the rub. Veggie tacos got wet and flimsy. I might as well had served myself because I was like "where's waldo?" looking for my server LOL. It's cute if you are going with a crowd of swinger friends to the strip club RIGHT  next door.  Mexican food is good with a little booty ha ha ha.
