So I have never written a review on yelp before but this place was so good I just had to. My wife and I were in Vegas for the weekend and went with two friends looking for some good Mexican food that wouldn't break the bank. This place had great reviews on YELP and so we were like let's do it. TRUST ME... Some of the best Mexican food I have ever had for such a good price. Please go and support this place. The owner/chef even came out an introduced himself to us and told us about his mother's recipes. Awesome. Great service. Great food. Great atmosphere. If you are staying in Vegas and don't want to eat at the expensive places at the hotels just go a little off the strip and hit this place up.
