Traveling and being Gluten free and not wanting to eat hormones or pesticides, I was thrilled when I saw a billboard for this place. It just popped up on my walk back to the hotel like a gift from heaven. I thought it couldn't be true, but it was. Great, healthy, mexican food. The location is a little out there, and right next to a big strip club, but don't let that stop you. The service was a little slow, but I went back the next night and told the waiter I was in a hurry to catch a plane, and they served me almost immediately. Sean, the general manager was friendly and accomodating both nights as well. This place pretty much has everything, inlcuding fresh margaritas.
