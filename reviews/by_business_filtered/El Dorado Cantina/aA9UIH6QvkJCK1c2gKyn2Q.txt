As we pull up, I gave my wife a bit of a shock, when she saw we were pulling up to a strip club, "Michal, Where are you taking me!!". I should have read the reviews more carefully so i could give her a forewarning, haha. We were later approached by a promoter selling strip club entry passes as great "couples therapy", which made for another laugh. 
        Apart from the questionable location this place was awesome! 
Service was quick and friendly. We found out that our server was also a Michigan native  and long time globe trotting waiter. 
Hours are are 24/7 just like it's neighbor the sapphire GC. Great for us as we were looking for a 3:30AM dining spot after a satisfying but tiring time at XS nightclub.
Food was excellent. We started with a traditional complimentary Mexican appetizer of chips and salsa. We especially liked the burnt chipotle sauce. The guacamole was made table-side with generous peppers, garlic and onion mixed in with a mortar and pestle. The best dish was the Carne Asade street tacos, these were truly above and beyond.

One downside was that our server was very slow to get our credit card at the end of the meal, we had to just put money down and leave. It was also entertaining though because we saw that he was preoccupied serving a stripper which kept him distracted.
