I had high expectations for this restaurant because I've only heard good things about it. Maybe I was there on an off night but I just wasn't pleased. 

I came on a Monday because I heard about their local special. 

We were sat almost immediately upon arrival which was nice. 

But then our server came over. And he was weird. He seemed stoned. No joke. 

They bring you chips and salsa almost right away which was nice. However, it's spicy salsa and their water glasses are essentially over sized shot glasses. I was with 3 other people and WE ALL were going through these glasses of water in less than 3 minutes a pop. I swear the poor bus boy had to fill our glasses 15 times. 

We asked for a pitcher of water and the server brought over a pitcher that was the size of a regular glass. (I wish I was kidding).

If you own a MEXICAN restaurant and serve SPICY food then the water glasses should be NORMAL SIZE! I was so annoyed by this. 

We got the steak quesadilla for an appetizer and that was very good. 

But then after that... We waited over 45 minutes for our dinner. We were seated at 8:20 and didn't get our dinner until 9:25. On top of that? The food wasn't great. We each ordered different tacos (Chicken, Fish, and Carne Asada). And all three were  bland and boring. 

The refried beans were gross. I LOVE refried beans and I couldn't even eat a second bite of these. 

The only thing I didn't try were the drinks (they looked very good) and I might come back to try them but I won't be ordering any food. I'll be sitting at the bar.
