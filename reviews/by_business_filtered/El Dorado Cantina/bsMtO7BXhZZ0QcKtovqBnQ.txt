Just stopped on to El Dorado late night tonight.   What a great spot!!  Great food and decor!!  Lots of organic products and the menu tells you where they source a lot of their products.  The cochinita pibil tacos were excellent.  Our bartender Rafael kept our drinks full and made us feel right at home.  He even gave us a flan on the house that was one of the best I've ever had.  I would definitely recommend stopping by!
