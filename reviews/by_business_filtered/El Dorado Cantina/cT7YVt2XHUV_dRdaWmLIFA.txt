El Dorado not only brought a delicious menu to the table but when Rafael is behind the bar the service is hands down the best!  Especially when it comes to the late night industry crowd he has definitely turned a restaurant located next to Sapphire of Las Vegas gentlemens club a "Local spot" for the service industry.  Thanks Raf
