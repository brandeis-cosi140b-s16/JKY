Ok so first off yes it's next door to a strip club !! This place should not be judged for that. I went with a friend of mine who said you have to try this place , so I did. Well I'm glad I did because the food was right on the money !! Fresh clean food, and if you like hot salsa well they have that too. Our waitress was on top of her game, very friendly and fast. I would recommend this place to anyone.
