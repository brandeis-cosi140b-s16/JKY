Vhalery was a fantastic server! She was attentive and made us feel right at home. She gave a us a menu tour since the menu was quite overwhelming at first. We decided on the elote and carne asada tacos. It was quite tasty! She suggested that we get our elote shaved which made it so much easier to eat and less messy. From there we tried the tres leches cake, the flan and the churros. The tres leches cake had a strong rum taste which was interesting. Other than that, everything was on point! I definitely recommend this spot!
