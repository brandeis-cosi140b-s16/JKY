I usualy dont leave reviews on Yelp, but this time i had to make an exception. Everything from the food, service and ambience was PERFECT. We met Chef Paco who was super nice and their lovely waitress. I highly recommend this place their food was AUTHENTIC MEXICAN FOOD which is hard to find now a days. My husband and I were extremely satisfy with their wonderful service. Please consider opening a Dorado Cantina in Los Angeles, Ca. We will greatly miss you until next time we visit Vegas!
