Super cute decor in here. Feels like you are really in Mexico ! The guacamole is handmade at the table and the watermelon water is so refreshing. I had the chicken enchiladas for dinner. My friend had the cilantro crusted tilapia which was cooked just right. Chef Paco came around and personally greeted each table. Located next to Sapphire. Yummy! Jesse *our waiter* is the man
