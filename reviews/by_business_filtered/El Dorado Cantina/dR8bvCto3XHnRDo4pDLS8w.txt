First time here tonight! My husband & I took a trip to Las Vegas & I yelped near by restaurants that were open late & El Dorado Cantina pops up. I have to say this place is phenomenal! From the nice ambiance, nice servers to the amazing Street Tacos, let's not forget the flan! It's a MUST have. I'm a Latina & I know what flan is supposed to taste like, and this was AMAZING!! Chef Paco was very sweet & took the time to introduce himself to us. I will definitely be coming back before I head back to the OC.
