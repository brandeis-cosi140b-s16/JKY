Food is excellent, and service is excellent. One of the best Mexican restaurants, anywhere. Prices for drinks are waaaay too high...$11 for a regular margarita, $8 for domestic bottle beer. The drinks cost as much as the food, which is ridiculous.

There was never a mention anywhere that this is located directly adjacent to the "Starfire" strip joint. There is a separate entrance for the restaurant, and once inside, you would have no idea you are next to a strip joint. It did not bother us at all, but might put off some folks. 

Both the Manager and the Chef, Paco, came on the floor to check out how we were, and to be sure we were satisfied.  This place really rocks (aside form the drink prices).

I don't believe I received the 10% Yelp discount I was supposed to....
