First time here. I was relieved to find out it's only next door to Sapphires and not part of it. Very nice decor and atmosphere.  Amber was our server. She gave impeccable service.  Chef Paco came around and introduced himself, asking if we needed anything.  We tried the Imperial Shrimp for an app. Seafood stuffed shrimp, wrapped in bacon... yum!!! I had the chicken enchiladas and he had the pork carnitas. Amazing food. Definitely recommend.  They have free salsa lessons on Tuesdays and it's Latin night on Wednesdays. Great service & great food. Highly recommend!
