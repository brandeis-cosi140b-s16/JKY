Absolutely loved the place - my girlfriend took me there for my birthday and the food, service, and prices were all excellent. The location is a very odd choice - not only is it on Industrial Road (for people who do not live in Las Vegas, Industrial Road tends to be a very seedy access road that runs parallel behind Las Vegas Boulevard) but it is literally right next door to a higher end gentleman's club called Sapphire. Regardless of that, the food is all organic, non-GMO etc, and very good. Considering how that kind of food is normally very pricey, I was surprised that the prices were in line with other non-organic restaurants of comparable style. Our server was very polite and knowledgeable, and the atmosphere was great. There was a little bit of a wait (about 15 minutes) according to the hostess, even though we observed several empty tables. We both assumed it was due to possibly being understaffed, so we hung out at the bar while we waited. In about 10-15 minutes the hostess came over to the bar and seated us. My only objection was that there were large television screens everywhere with baseball being played, but that 'sports bar' atmosphere is pretty much the norm in Vegas now. Luckily the sound was turned off. I would recommend it to anyone - local or tourist, just beware it is beside a 'strip club', so if you tend to be conservative or prudish you may have an objection to the location. But it doesn't really affect the experience in the restaurant at all.
