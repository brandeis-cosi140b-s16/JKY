First time trying El Dorado cantina today and totally suprised by the awesome food and customer service. Chris our server was super welcoming  and tended to all our needs. I got the three taco combo, al pastor and chicken. The meat was fresh and flavorful. My friends and I only wished the cilantro rice had more flavor.  But I have every intention to go back, visit,  and tell all my friends! Chef paco came out personally introduced himself, walked out our dessert and was so hospitable!  Would definitely recommend coming here again.
