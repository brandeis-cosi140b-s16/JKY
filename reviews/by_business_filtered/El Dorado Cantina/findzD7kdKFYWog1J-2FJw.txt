This spot is just another to go spot for our household! We've been her on multiple occasions. Last night we caught Book of Mormon Broadway show at the Smith Center and need a satisfying and bursting of flavor meal afterwards. That's kind of hard at 10:30pm to go to a half decent spot. 

This spot is open 24/7 and right next door to your local Sapphire Strip Club! What a brilliant restaurant owner. If you're coming for dinner it's best to have reservations. Lucky for us it wasn't too busy! 

As many Yelpers could agree THE TABLE SIDE GUACAMOLE is everything. One bite and you'll understand why it's worth the $14. Also, the house FLAN is MUST so take a couple less bites of your entree to save some room! (;

The menu is pretty simple so it's easy to pick your typical Mexican dish. Great! The staff is friendly and excel in great service. However, like most of the great spots around time it. Service always depending on how busy they are. So it's a hit or miss but the food makes up for it. 

Overall, El Dorado Cantina is about convenience, great authentic food, great decor, great staff, great organic and non-gmo food for the health cautious eaters. 

Negatives.... Insufficient parking spots, awkward venue next door, only one complimentary chips basket that they announce so awkwardly from the start. 

If I was the judge of your potential selection of this spot it's MUST spot to check out it may need a couple visits in order to become a favorite. IT'S WORTH IT.
