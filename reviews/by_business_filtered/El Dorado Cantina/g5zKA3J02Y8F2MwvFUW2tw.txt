Don't be turned off (or on) by the strip club next door.  The El Dorado is probably one of the BEST deals in Las Vegas...especially on Monday night...local's night.  The atmosphere is festive and the food is delicious.  If nothing else, you can talk about what is happening on the other side of the wall while you drink your delicious margarita...wink!

P.S. You can take your kids here.
