First things first: the door is hidden right next to the front door of the Sapphire Gentlemen's Club. A bit intimidating, especially when we drove around in circles looking for it, then entered to find a loud wedding party in the restaurant, and waitresses in red satin bustiers and fishnets--very Vegas, but it had us wondering, Is this part of the club? No! DO NOT BE DISSUADED!! The hostess assured us a quiet(er) seat in the back room, and that the wedding party was leaving soon. :) After the dubious entrance, we ordered margaritas and focused on the extensive menu. There weren't many people there; other than the yelp reviews it seems that there isn't much advertising for this place, and the waiter told us it had only opened a few months ago... but is open 24/7-- how dangerous!! 

Our waiter and all the staff gave excellent service throughout the evening. The maragaritas were poured at our table and were hands down some of the best I've had-- and I'm from SoCal so we know a bit about Mexican food... and drinks. The food was incredible, and I only hesitate a little when I say one of the best Mexican meals I've ever had. I had the street tacos (carnitas and chicken), and split a bowl of posole with my husband. I'm used to more watery posole; this had the richest and most flavorful broth I may have ever tasted. Each in my party of four people agreed that it was an exceptional meal. I know I'm bubbling over here, but after living on the East Coast for a long time, this place was literally an oasis in the desert. And the red velvet rose wallpaper is fabulous. Do not miss this restaurant. Or the flan.
