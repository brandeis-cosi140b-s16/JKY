After hearing great things about this place I decided to take a group that was visiting from out of state. We were given waters and then waited 15 minutes to place a secondary drink order for beer and margaritas. After another 15 minutes our drinks arrived and we're okay. We ordered food including quest fundido, carnival dinner, burritos, and street tacos. The tacos were okay. Some really good, some awful. The carnival plate was ridiculously average and bland at best. Quest fundido was good not great. Service was terrible. I won't make the effort to try it again as I feel we had a large enough taste of the menu. I know service can be up and down but the food was so average I can't imagine having a better experince.
