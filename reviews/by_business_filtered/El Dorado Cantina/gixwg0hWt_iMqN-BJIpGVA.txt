Stop reading reviews and just go!!!! Hands down the BEST Mexican food we've ever had at a restaurant! Please open up a location in LA!! The fact that it's organic and non-gmo is what makes this place a gem...we honestly wouldn't have gone if that wasn't the case. The location IS next to a gentlemens club with the same parking but it has its own entrance and it's honestly not that big of a deal. Our server was Amber and she rocked it! Gave us good recommendations that weren't your standard "this is popular BS" that a lot of servers do to push certain items. She checked on us often and made sure we had everything we needed. We ordered the Carne Asada Burrito and 3 Tacos ( Al Pastor, Chicken, and Cochinita). The burrito was absolutely phenomenal. The beef was so tender I though I was eating short ribs! The tacos were all really good too but Cochinita was the star! I also ordered the Strawberry Margarita was which so good and so much! It's practically a fish bowl drink and it's not full of unnatural simple syrup or triple sec. Everything but tequila is organic in that sucker and they're even working on getting organic tequila too. We then met Chef Paco when we got our Yelp Flan (which is no small portion) and he told us about his grandmas authentic recipes and the importance of organic ingredients. It's no wonder that the food, especially the meat, is so tasty! We will definitely be back every time we come to Vegas!!
