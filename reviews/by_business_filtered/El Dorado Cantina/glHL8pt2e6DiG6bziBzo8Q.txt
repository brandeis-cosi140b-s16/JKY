Unfortunately I was only able to eat here a couple of times during my stay.  The mole sample platter and flan are definite "must haves." 
The bartenders, Juan and Ashley, are awesome. 
Happy hour is 4 to 6pm and  12am to 2am. 
 Locals get 50% off on Mondays. 
Everything I had was outstanding. A little off strip, the area is very safe.
