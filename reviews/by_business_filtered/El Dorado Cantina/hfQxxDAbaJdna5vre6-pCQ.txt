I have 5 stars especially because of the service. Mark was our server and I have to say he was one of the nicest and best servers. 
I got the cheese enchilada. It was ok. It could've been better if it wasn't so dry. It came with rice and beans and I have to say the rice is possible the best rice I have ever had (and I eat a lot of rice).
