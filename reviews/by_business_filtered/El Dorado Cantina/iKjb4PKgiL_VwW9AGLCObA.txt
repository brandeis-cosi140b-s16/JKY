Came in after work with a girlfriend. We were in fairly early so we didn't have to wait to find seats at the bar. We ordered a few glasses of wine that came quickly, and our food order was taken promptly thereafter. The table-side guacamole and the queso fundido (with mushrooms!) are musts! From presentation to taste- nailed it! The cochinita tacos are phenomenal and the chicken Feinstein is on point! You can't leave without trying the flan. Seriously. 

You can't beat the organic ingredients. Nowhere else in Vegas is it so evident that quality is a top priority here. With an entire menu full of GMO free selections, you can't go wrong. There's something for absolutely everyone. 

The service was great- thanks a lot, Marco and Sean!  See you again soon (like Sunday. Make a reservation for me! :])
