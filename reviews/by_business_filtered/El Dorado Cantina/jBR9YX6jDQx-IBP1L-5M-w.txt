You've got to find this place. Seriously, take the time. It has no affiliation with Sapphire strip club, but it is attached.
   Chef Paco is the real deal. He takes serious pride in his food. Chorizo fundito was ridiculous. Margaritas and carne Asada were brilliant. Add in the mariachi and it was a perfect evening. The fresh salsas and chips kept coming long after I was full.... And save room for his mama's flan.
