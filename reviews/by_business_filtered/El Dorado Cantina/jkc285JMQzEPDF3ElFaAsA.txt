The food at El Dorado Cantina is the best Mexican food I have had in a very long time. Not only were all the dishes full of amazing flavor but the whole experience was first class. We even had the Executive Chef, Chef Paco pay us a visit and he was so welcoming he made us feel like family. The way he spoke about their food creations gives you a real insight into why the food is so amazing, he truly cares and believes that fresh and organic is the only way to cook delicious food. My family and I will definitely make El Dorado Cantina a favorite.
