It took 45 minutes to get our food while everyone else was being served around us. Once it became apparent that our order was forgotten, we became the "invisible table " as the staff avoided making eye contact with us until our order arrived. Halfway through my meal our waitress asked us if we wanted a to go box. Food was good but have had better at other establishments and not worth the price of admission considering the service.
