Once again El Dorado Cantina is simply divine!

My high school friend from Los Angeles came into town and of course I suggested lunch at El Dorado Cantina! Well, where else would I go for a scrumptious perfect lunch? No, Im not embellishing this review, the food is that superb. Honestly cant believe how good it really is.

I ordered the shrimp taquitos again! My friends ordered quesadillas, table side guacamole and the salmon entree. We were all so happy and clearly stuffed by the end of lunch, but we made room for the Famous Flan!

The complimentary chips and three salsa sides is yummy. My favorite is the habenero salsa(careful its super hot, but I like it that hot in my mouth!)
