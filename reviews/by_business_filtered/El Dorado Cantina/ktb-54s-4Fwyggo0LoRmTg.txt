This place lives up to its YELP reputation.  We had an appetizer plate with cheese empanadas, taquitos, bacon-wrapped shrimp and more.  The empanadas were amazing.  Then I tasted the taquitos.  I don't like pork but I loved these.  Crisp, flaky, with amazing flavor.  The Mexican Corn is over the top good.  My husband got the feinsteins chicken.  Crispy onions over a delicious chicken and potato dish topped with fried eggs. So good!  The best thing we had...the churros.  Crazy amazing.  We will be back.
