I must begin by saying that be warned this restaurant is part of Sapphire Gentlmen's Club located OFF of the strip but not too far.  I had to share that because it caught my boyfriend and I off guard (More him than me given it was his first time in Vegas).  While it is part of Sapphire it is separate in the sense that it has its own entrance and you are not at all exposed to the scene.  

Now as for the restaurant.  Its a nice restaurant, and we were pleasantly surprised by the food.  We started with fresh guacamole, which was a bit more salty than what we prefer.  For dinner I ordered the Chicken Enchiladas with black beans and rice, and had the Torta de Milanesa.  We both really enjoyed our food.  The salsa on my enchiladas was divine.  

The Flan we had for dessert was one of the most delicious I have ever had.  It was thicker and creamier than most.  It was simply fantastic!

The quality and portion of the food along with the price, make this a winner in Vegas.  It was easily the cheapest meal we had and for the price one of the best.  

If you are in Vegas this is worth your time!
