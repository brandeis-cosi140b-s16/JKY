It's June 1st and it's busy packed can't get a table unless you have an RSVP so my friends and I tried the bar for open seating. With only two seats open waiting for a third it took about ten min to get asked if we would care for something to drink but then decided to help out the two women before my friends and I who literally just sat down. I've been here before and it's good but I feel as though they only target a certain type maybe my friends and I weren't that type.
