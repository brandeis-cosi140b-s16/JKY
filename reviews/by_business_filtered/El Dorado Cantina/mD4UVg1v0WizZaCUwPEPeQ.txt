Let's get real.  This is the best Mexican food you can get with flavors that most resemble true Mexico cuisine. The tacos are out of this world and the rice bowls are teeming with flavors I have never experienced.  If your looking for typical American-ized Mexican food this is not the place for you.  While your here make sure you leave from for dessert. Flan or Fried Ice Cream are a must.
