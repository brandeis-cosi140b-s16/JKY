I recently celebrated my birthday here and I can honestly say it was one of the best dining experiences I have ever had. From the food, to the service and finally the entertainment, solid 5 star experience all the way.

As advertised on the menu the food is all organically grown and they are very selective in what they use. In fact that very day they had brought in some specific type of chiles that are only organically grown in Mexico. You taste it in the food.

Our large group ordered practically everything on the menu and it was all great. The standout for me was the bacon wrapped shrimp which was stuffed with seafood. I pretty much o'deed on that. Everything was phenomenal mind you. Which included the desserts, (when I said we had everything on the menu, we kinda almost literally did). The desserts had the home made taste about them, especially the flan. It's hard to get a flan that has the right balance of sweetness and consistency, this place nails it!

This being a "cantina" I have to put in my two cents about the drinks. They have all your standard Mexican beer and a wide assortment of craft domestics. The ladies in my party totally digged the margaritas as the mix is also made in house with organic ingredients.

The head chef "Chef Paco" would regularly check in with all the customers and he is one funny S.O.B., part of the fun and entertaining atmosphere here.

Would definitely recommend this venue for any special occasions or just for a night out. Making this spot my regular next time I'm in LV.
