Had such an amazing time here! Came in with a few of my girlfriends and not only was the food amazing but the staff was as well. They took the time to get to know me and give me their personal recommendations. Thanks to Miranda, Amber, Daniel and Chef Paco we enjoyed the amazing chicken tinga, quesadilla, and the most surprising the GRASSHOPPERS! Everything was amazing and you could taste the time and effort put into each dish. I'm so glad we decided to try something new! We will be back for sure :):)
