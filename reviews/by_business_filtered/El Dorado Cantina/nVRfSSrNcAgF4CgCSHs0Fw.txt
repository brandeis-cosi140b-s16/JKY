Wow. Unbelievable service and food! I came on a Friday night and was sat within a few minutes of arriving despite the fact that the restaurant seem relatively full. The atmosphere was young and energetic. I ordered the street tacos and honestly the portions were bigger than expected. The BEST street tacos I've ever eaten. Can't wait to go back and have that margarita again!
