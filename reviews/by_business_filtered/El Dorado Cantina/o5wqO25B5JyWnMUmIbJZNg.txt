The food was great. I hosted a surprise birthday party there, and everyone seemed happy with the food and service. Our server's were Roark and Maria--both were excellent at customer service. The chef even came out to make sure everything was to our liking. He gave us his business card, and handed out discount cards for future visits. Even the margarita's were delicious. I'm going back to this place for sure.
