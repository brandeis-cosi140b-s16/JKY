Man, what a great experience here. We checked in on yelp and got some free Flan (which was amazing). Chef Paco did a great job. The carne asada burrito was unreal. Marc, our server was awesome and made sure we got the best service/deals. This is by far our favorite Mexican spot now. Lindo Michoacan doesn't have anything over this place. COME HERE.
