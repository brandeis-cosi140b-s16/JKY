Awsome place. I really enjoyed it. I only got fustrating because I couldn't find this place but its in the same building as sapphire.  When you walk inside you walk into a more up scare mexican restaurant, which I loved. Very chill and relaxed feel too.

Service was really good. Our waiter was very out going. Lol beware of the Habanero salsa. .. hahaha they told me it was really hot after I had already put it in my mouth. Hahaha.

FOOD: 
Table side guac ! Bomb! Had garlic too. It added a little something to it. I enjoyed it very much. And my waiter made it just how I like it.

 Requeson enpanadas were super delicious. I wanted more! I could have had two orders for myself, they were that good.

The ceviche (its called something else on the small bites menu) was really fresh. Very filling. The shrimp was delicious.

Carnitas Rajas buritto (wet with red sauce).  Good flavor. Loved the butter rice and very good size portion. 

Flan
Uhmmmm I'm mexican and my grandmother makes flan.... and this flan was better than gramas. Lol. Sooo good

Paco the chef came out and asked how the food was.hes doing an amazing job. I will definitely be back soon and recommend this place to more peoplw.
