The service was excellent!!! I was just a little disappointed with the seafood enchilada that I ordered, the shrimp was literally tiny ass shrimps and the scallops was hard and the fish wasn't all that great. The description on the menu was very misleading, other than that the service was great and we even got 25% off because it was on a Monday and we happen to be locals. The flan was good and the habanero salsa was FIRE. The 25% kinda made up for the disappointment maybe we'll be back but it'll definitely be on a Monday! Please use better ingredient for the seafood enchiladas!!!
