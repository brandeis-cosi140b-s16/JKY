Located next to Sapphire "gentlemen's" club :] Not an issue for me, I just thought this was a stand alone restaurant & I had a little trouble finding it! 

I am pretty newly vegan (vegetarian for over 1 year & vegan about 2 months) so I ordered the veggie tacos sans dairy products with black beans & cilantro rice. Awesome!... until I got to the rice. It tasted buttery so I didn't eat it. I asked the waitress & she confirmed: the rice is made with butter BUT you can ask for it without butter. This was totally my bad as I didn't tell her I was vegan, I just assumed I made the dish vegan by removing the cheese. *lesson learned* The black beans were amazing! Way better than the refried pinto beans. Order them if you can! The veggies in the taco were very fresh & had great flavor. 

They give you chips & a trio of salsas to start off with. The salsas, even the hottest one, could be hotter but that's just my opinion. I'm sure they are plenty hot to some.

Also had the watermelon water; it was so refreshing! They change those daily, I think. They had other flavors listed but today they only had watermelon. 

I will absolutely come back & I will make sure to tell them I'm vegan! The staff & chef are very accommodating!
