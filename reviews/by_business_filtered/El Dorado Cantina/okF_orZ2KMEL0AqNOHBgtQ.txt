Food was delicious!!!!! Green salsa & beans are to die for. Chris was our server and he was awesome. He's very friendly and professional has a great attitude. I would recommend this place came during lunch it was packed thats how you know this place is good. P.S. I am very picky with mexican food. Place is pricey and mondays is 50% for locals. Nice environment.
