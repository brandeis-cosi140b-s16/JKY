My friend is gluten-free and we wanted Mexican, so we were very pleased to find this place (I guess it's on a find me gluten free app). Enrique and his mustache was fantastic, the nachos and taquitos were the best I've had in Vegas, the churros and flan excellent. Chef really loves what he's doing. Don't be put off by the fact it's attached to a topless gentlemen's club - this place was clean, comfortable and A+ service. Looked like they had a large gluten free and vegetarian menu. I will definitely be back :)
