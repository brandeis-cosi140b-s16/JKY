Fun atmosphere and really good food. This is much better than you might imagine. Our server Chris (aka Cinnamon), was excellent. He had a great sense of humor and he knew the menu. His recommendations were spot on and he directed is to Yelp for a free flan for desert. Chef Paco came to the table to make sure we had a nice meal and enjoyed our experience. We will definitely be back.
