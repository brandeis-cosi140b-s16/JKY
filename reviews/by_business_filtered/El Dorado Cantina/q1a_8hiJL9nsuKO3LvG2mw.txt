We decided to go back to El Dorado on Father's Day because we had such a great time the last time we were here. Luckily the manager Sean recognized us from our last visit because we didn't make reservations and the place was packed. We had a drink at the bar with Omar , who made us some sweet Cadillac margs, then the next thing you know Sean has a table for us,Amazing!! Our server was Autumn and she was awesome, we promised we would spell her name right. Margaritas and apps and Mole and this and that,,, it was all awesome, at the end Chef Paco brought out an amazing Churro plate with chocolate and banana fosters sauces ABSOLUTELY AMAZING ..I feel sorry for you if don't experience the amazing food and service at The Eldo!!
