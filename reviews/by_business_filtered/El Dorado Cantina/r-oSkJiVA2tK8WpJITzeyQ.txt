SLOWEST SERVICE EVER! My bf and I gave this place another shot after our first experience was not very impressive (assuming they were having an off night). You can tell that they are extremely understaffed, It took the waiter about 15 minutes to come greet us and then another 15 minutes for me to get the margarita I had ordered. Also, the drink must have spilled a bit on the way to my table because there was more salt running down the sides of my glass then there was on the rim.

As for the food... The salsas that went with the chips were pretty tasty, we devoured them waiting for our food and asked for more chips that never arrived. I ordered the chicken fajitas, and they weren't bad but it was nothing to rave about. My bf ordered the street tacos that our waiter had recommended and he also wasn't impressed. For dessert we got the free flan after we checked in and we also ordered fried ice cream on top of that. Once again another 15-20 minute wait! By that point we just wanted to leave but we couldn't because our server was no where to be found even 10 minutes after we had finished eating dessert...


As I said, the food wasn't terrible, but the service was and that most likely put a damper on the whole experience for us. We most likely won't be back :(
