All I can say is wow.  The restaurant is in the same building as Sapphire with a separate entrance next to the Gentleman's Club.   It's very upscale with the typical entree running around $15 bucks or so.  The table side Guac is amazing.   The drinks are very price with a standard Margarita costing $11 and a pitcher costing $32 and you'd say those better be good Margaritas and trust me when I say they are.   All fresh ingredients and no sour mix and they don't use mystery Tequila.  The Street Taco section of the menu has a great selection and they're all terrific.    If you're a local then you know to go on Mondays.   Did I mention they're open 24/7. Only Vegas baby.
