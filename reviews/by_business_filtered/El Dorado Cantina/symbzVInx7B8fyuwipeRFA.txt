Gmo free and organic. Genius billboard - food is great. If you can't handle the heat this might not be the place for you.  Spicy salsa's.  There might be some mild ones for you sensitive folks but keep those ones away from me.  I loved it.  Yeah its next to a strip club, its funny how all these reviewers keep acting surprised by that, yet every review mentions it.  But not mine, oops.  Hit this spot, its great.
