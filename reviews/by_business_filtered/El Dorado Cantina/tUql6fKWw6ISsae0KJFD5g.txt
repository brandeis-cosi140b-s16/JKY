Let me start off by saying that this is the best Mexican restaurant I have ever been to - bar none. The staff was absolutely wonderful, and our waiter (Juan) was such a sweetheart. He was attentive, lively, and he even mentioned the Free Flan coupon on Yelp. 

Let's start off with the salsa. You can tell it was homemade, and I loved the fire roasted flavors. 

We also ordered the Queso Fundido with Chorizo and it was amazing. Creamy, spicy, and piping hot with pico de gallo on top - don't pass this one up! It was delicious, to say the least.

I ordered the Chicken Street Tacos while my wife ordered the Chicken Quesadilla, and both were superb. The chicken was juicy with perfect flavoring and the rice served along side of it was divine. 

Last but certainly not least, we got our free flan - and MAN, was it incredible. The chef, Paco, brought it out to us and personally thanked us for coming in. To top it all off, he handed us coupons for breakfast. Talk about top of the line service. In the end our waiter shook our hand and we were off. This place is a real Las Vegas gem. We will absolutely be back.
