Wow! One of the best restaurants in Las Vegas. Bryan was our server and he tried everything possible to make us happy. I am on a special diet and they did not have anything on the menu I could eat. So, he called Chef Paco to the table and Paco took notes of what I wanted and made me a special dish. Paco and Bryan really took care of us. I highly recommend this place.
