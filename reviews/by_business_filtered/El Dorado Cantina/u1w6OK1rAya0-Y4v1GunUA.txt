I'm from L.A. originally, and a little spoiled when it comes to mexican food. My diet for most of my adult life has been at least 50% burritos. That said, when I first tried the food here, I was going in with pretty high standards. I was not disappointed. Amazing burritos, delicious tacos, deep fried ice cream...bacon wrapped shrimp...oh my god, this place rules!
