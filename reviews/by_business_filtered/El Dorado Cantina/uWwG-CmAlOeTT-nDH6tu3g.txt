Our waiter (white guy, sorry forgot your name while drunk!) was SUPER friendly and attentive. Gave us check in for a free dessert for a flan, which was super bomb.

Hard to find entry next to strip club, but we walked from Circus Circus and we're sat immediately on a Friday night. Boyfriend and I split a veggie burrito which was very filling combined with free table chips and three kinds of salsa. Would return! Three stars because parking lot was filled with taxis and strip club people were very rude at entry
