I wouldn't feed this food to stray dogs. Mediocre at best. I get its all sustainably grown, non-Gmo,free range or whatever is gonna keep us from getting cancer these days. I've had better chicken in a MRE. I won't frequent this facility again. It has the marketing hype of a mexican restaurant, but really you're just eating in a pretty decorated place in the corner of a strip club. No one expects great food in a titty bar, but these other yelp reviews would have you thinking otherwise. It's a bolo, don't eat here.
