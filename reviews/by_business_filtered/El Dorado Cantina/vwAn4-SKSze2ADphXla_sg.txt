I was recommended this place by a friend.  I have been to all the other "4 and 5 star" places in Vegas and can honestly say it's the best in Vegas.  The atmosphere and the staff are excellent but the food is 2nd to none!  They use all organic and range free for everything.  This will be by new favorite place I go to twice a month!
