I was taken there by a great friend for a business lunch. He had raved about this secret find. It did not disappoint. Although it feels a little odd in the location, in the same building as a popular strip club, it has its own entrance. But from that point its amazing. Awesome food, very friendly service and a warm and inviting chef roaming the restaurant welcoming patrons. Perfect score.
