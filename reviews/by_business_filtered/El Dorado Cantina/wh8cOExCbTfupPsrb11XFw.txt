This was an experience to remember! From the first course to the last everything was just jaw dropping. Chef paco really out did himself. The salsas were completely different from other restaurants. It was if I was eating a home cooked meal. We ordered a variety of tacos and was not disappointed. The portion was so generous I feel as if I got way beyond my moneys worth. After eating the appetizers my boyfriend and I were convinced we were on a show on the food network channel. The staff was very welcoming and the chef himself came to check if we needed anything else. Definitely my new hangout...I loved it!!
