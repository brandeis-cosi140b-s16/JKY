Everyone has been talking about this place and I have been meaning to stop in. The entrance is literally next to the Sapphire's doors. I was pleasantly surprise with the decor with the rich reds and dark woods, trendy and chic. You get the typical chips and house salsas which were three and all very good. We ordered Guacamole, prepared table side this was good, Chiliquilles with Carne Asada which was delicious the green sauce was perfect, Chile Relleno, fried just right that the batter soaked up all the red sauce and cheese was melted, Chicken Enchilada, the taste and seasoning was good it was just dry, lastly the Flan, so rich and creamy I had to box what little piece was left.

I informed the wait staff about the dry Enchilladas and Chef Paco came to serve our dessert, apologized for the mishap with the new cook that forgot to add sauce inside and offered to make us a new one to take home. we declined and told him next time we will take the offer. He gave me his business card and coupons for our return. That was a pleasant surprise and it really shows that as a Chef and owner that he cares about the service and quality. 

I definetely recommend this place for the great food and exceptional service.
