What a great little find. Our friends invited us the the El Dorado Cantina. The GPS told us to turn right into the parking lot which is coincidently Sapphires Gentlemen's club. The restaurant is right next door! Always good to start the morning off with a chuckle. We walked into the restaurant which has the walls appointed in a red  motif with wood finishing. It is just funky enough to be cool & hip with big screens so you can watch sports. Ok, enough about that...how about the food? I applaud this restaurant, they are Non GMO and source their food  from sustainable farms. Our server was very pleasant & immediately brought us fresh chips & 3 kinds of salsa. Debby ordered guacamole which was prepared fresh table side and delicious. We shared steak quesadillas & queso fundido. Our friends had the mole combination platter that could have fed the table. Great food! Will return here.
