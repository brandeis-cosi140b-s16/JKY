We go here once every few months. Being where it is at, it is a 20 min ride for us to get there. I don't know how or why I talk myself into this place... my wife "likes" it - so maybe that is the reason.

I have never had a horrible bad experience, but I have never had a WOW experience either. The pricing is more than your corner Mexican restaurant - the place is REALLY cool - so I would expect the food to be more/better.

Just average - just A-OK - Just Satisfying. Good to go - just don't expect anything out of the ordinary.
