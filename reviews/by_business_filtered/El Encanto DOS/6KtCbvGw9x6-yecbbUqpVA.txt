El Encanto (Cave Creek) and El Encanto Dos (Carefree Hwy) are not owned by the same folks as  the original El Encanto restaurant located in Cave Creek  and nor is the food nearly as good as.  The food at El Encanto Dos is over rated!  In the past month or so the portions have dwindled to the point that when I order the steak fajitas, I think of vegetable fajitas with a touch of  tough steak.  The flour tortillas are so hard and dry they might as well be made of cardboard. Not worth the drive!!  An experience you can live without!!!
