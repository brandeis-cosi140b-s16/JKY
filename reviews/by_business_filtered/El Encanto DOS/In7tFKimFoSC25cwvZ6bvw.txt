Very disappointed that our favorite Mexican restaurant completely disappointed us on Cinco Di Mayo.

We went there completely out of our way only to find no celebration.  We came from Georgia where all the restaurants give away T-shirts and celebrate with all kind if fun things.  Our drinks were in plastic and service was slow.  We will find a different restaurant next year, actually we aren't sure this will be on our list again,
