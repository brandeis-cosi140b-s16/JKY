This is our local joint and a favorite place to visit for a tasty meal.  The staff is friendly, and most of the time on the ball.  Be prepared to wait on a Friday or Saturday night.  The big hit, the Pollo Fundito, best in the North Phoenix area.  Pork Carnitas are great to!  Margarita fan, well this is the place.  Get the frozen (they are more potent) and sit back on the patio.  They grow fresh veggies right there on location.   A staple restaurant for this family and worth the trip up to Desert Hills.
