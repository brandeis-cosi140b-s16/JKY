We were excited to try this place out, we love mexican and heard good things. Big let down. The food was average, but the service was terrible. My 2 year old couldn't sit and wait anymore, I ended lunch walking around outside with him because our food took so long. No drink or chip refills. Come on people!
Skip this place and go to the original El Encanto instead.
