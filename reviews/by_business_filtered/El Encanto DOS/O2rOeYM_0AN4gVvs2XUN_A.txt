Great food, and our family of eight tried a number of different items and no one was dissatisfied. The pollo Fundito was a big hit by a few people in the party. Our server Wendy was terrific! She was attentive, friendly, and ready with descriptions and recommendations. 
The skinny margaritas were yummy with a nice bit of tang. We also sampled a few desserts. The winner was the Flan,but only by a small margin over the three other desserts tried. 
I would recommend you stop in and try the food if you are near Cave Creek. In another month or so sitting on the patio for your meal will be fabulous.
