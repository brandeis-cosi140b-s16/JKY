Take out or sit down and be served...this joint is consistent in both service and quality. There is a 50% chance of your server being friendly. There is a 99% chance your server will be competent. Not once have they screwed up my special orders. They have know how and when to upsell. The food is fresh. The place is clean. They are not slow or shy to refill the chips and salsa. I even dig the other customers. It's just a laid back place to get your grub on. Cheers!
