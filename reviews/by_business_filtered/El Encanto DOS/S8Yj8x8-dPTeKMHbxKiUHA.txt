We went there on a Monday afternoon.  It was slightly crowded.  We sat in the bar area.  It took a while to be noticed.  We placed our order which came in good time.  The meal was terrible.  I ordered pollo fundido and did not like it at all.  The only thing I could taste was sour cream.  I would not go back, I would sooner drive to Phoenix and get better food.
