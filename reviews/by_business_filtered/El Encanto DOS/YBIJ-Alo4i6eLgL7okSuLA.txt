I love their new menu items (new a year or so ago). I highly recommend their veggie enchiladas, even my chicken loving husband loves them. This place has improved quite a bit over the years. 

Fast, friendly and helpful 5 star service. Good good and great drinks. Perfect chips and a variety of decent salsa. All right in my neighborhood!
