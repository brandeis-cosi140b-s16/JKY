We have been eating here for many years because of the close proximity to where we live. There aren't a whole lot of options as far as dining out goes in our area, but this happens to be one of the closest and one of the best out of what is nearby. The service here is usually very good and this restaurant is always clean. Never mind the random sparrow that passes through by accident - the doors are often open when the weather permits. 

I am not a huge fan of the salsa here, which is a tragedy considering that the salsa is often an indication of how good the food will be. The hottest salsa is okay and ads a nice touch of smokey spice to the green corn tamales, which are among my favorite green corn tamales. The rice and beans are always tasty and the salads are wonderful as well. My husband recommends the Pollo Fundido. 

There are new items on the menu, which are worth trying out, but the prices are a a few dollars higher than what I would expect to pay considering the ingredients and portion size. 

The margaritas, whatever your favorite flavor, are fantastic.

The outdoor patio seating is nice when the weather is chilly; outdoor heaters and fireplaces keep you toasty while you eat. 

All-in-all not a bad neighborhood place to come and eat a decent meal or share a drink with friends.
