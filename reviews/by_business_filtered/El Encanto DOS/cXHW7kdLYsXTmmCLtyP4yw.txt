While I hate writing terrible reviews I feel like this experience was necessary. My parents and I sat at a booth in the bar area, which was not crowded at all and received no service within the first 10 minutes of being there. While watching the waitress Emily giggle and drink her soda in the corner we decided to move to the bar in hopes that the bartender could provide better service. Cheryl, the bartender was amazing and went above and beyond to provide excellent service while making casual conversation which I think is great! I wish my experience started with Cheryl because it would be a 5 star review between her service, drinks, and the food.
