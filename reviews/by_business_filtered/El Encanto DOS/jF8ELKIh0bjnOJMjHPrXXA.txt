I'm hooked on their steak quesadilla with green chili sauce like a ten dollar hooker to crack. It's that good. I have dreams about it.

Damn good strawberry margaritas as well.

And like Daren writes, the pollo fundido is pretty amazing. Also recommend the pollo chimi with green chili sauce and sour cream. Or red chili sauce... Both are great.

Best Mexican I've found anywhere in the valley so far.

Bring your appetite because the portions are huge.

My only gripes are that the service at the inside bar almost always sucks and the cheapskate moron of an owner needs to fix the ridiculous urinal that's about 10' off the floor in the men's bathroom.
