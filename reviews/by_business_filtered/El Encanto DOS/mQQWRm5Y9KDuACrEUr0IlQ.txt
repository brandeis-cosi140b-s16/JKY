Visited again today at lunch time. I should have known we would have crappy service when we were greeted at the door by a sign saying to seat ourselves as no hostess was on duty... Sorry for the inconvenience. I think there were only 2 servers working TOTAL. Horrible service and the flour tortillas were not fresh. They were very dry. I think this the last strike.
