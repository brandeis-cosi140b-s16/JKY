Went back with a friend of mine (not my choice) from out of town who LOVED Encanto when she lived here. I tried convincing her to go elsewhere because the place is so awful now. Well, our drinks were horrible to start off with. A pi√±a colada that was riddled with ice chunks, no flavor, and half of the glass was filled with whipped cream. Ordering the pollo fundido, I got what I expected. A dry, flavorless chicken filling wrapped in a greasy tortilla. The fundido sauce WAS good, however it was cold, and just not worth the jacked up price they charge. Never. Ever. Again. Even if an out of town friend wants to go. I'll take my business down the road to Plaza Bonita instead.
