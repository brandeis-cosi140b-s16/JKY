Great food and awesome service! 
Love the atmosphere...
Would highly recommend the spinach queso dip they offer and the pollo fundido for an entree is fantastic! 
The chips and salsa are tasty... 
Also, in the winter, sitting outside is so fun!! Love the outside bar with super friendly bartenders! 
My favorite server is Natalie, she's always upbeat, happy and does a great job!
