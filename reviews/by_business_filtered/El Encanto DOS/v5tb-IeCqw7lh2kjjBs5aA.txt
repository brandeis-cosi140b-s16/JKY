Very consistent and great food... Close to home too so we frequent this place a lot. It's not that the food is amazing but it's pretty authentic Mexican American and we like it. Really love their salsa trio that comes with complimentary chips (especially the green variety). Tasty margaritas and I love the Flan if I have any room left... We like to sit in the bar area. Pretty fast service in there. When it's not too hot the patio is fun to hang out on with friends. A pitcher of margaritas, chips, salsa and some yummy guacamole makes for a fun happy hour with friends too!
