Visited El Encanto with some friends for lunch the first time last week.  The restaurant has a great atmosphere.  We sat inside with a view of the pond and the ducks.  The service was good and the food above average.  

The green salsa is fantastic with a wonderful flavor.  The chips are fresh and they are happy to refill as you request.  I ordered the carnitas which were terrific.  Others at the table had the carne asada, the fajitas and the pollo fundido.  Good reviews on the food from everyone.  Portions were generous and we all left with no room for dessert.

Great place for lunch or dinner.  The restaurant has a nice feel and  you certainly won't leave hungry.
