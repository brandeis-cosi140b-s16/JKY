Came here for lunch because the kiddos wanted to hang out and feed the ducks. My husband and approaches the hostess stand and was rudely told by Robin that they were not seating any one outside. We talked it over for a bit and the kids really wanted to stay. I re-approached the hostess and she asked if we wanted to sit by the window. I said yes and she reiterated that no one could sit outside. I laughed it off and made a comment about the kids wanting to be outside to play. She said (very curtly), "Well, this IS a restaurant and kids can't just run around." I laughed and told her that we would be dining elsewhere. My kids had been standing there quietly the entire time - no running, no yelling and no fits. I guess she had to assert herself and put us in our place. I'm not sure why they have the ducks and allow kids to feed them if they don't want kids playing outside. My husband then asked her for her name and her supervisors contact information. She told us she was in charge - we asked her if she was the owner of the restaurant (to which she answered "no"). We then requested this individuals contact information. She reluctantly have us an email address. She then told my husband "well, what should I have said to your wife?"  At this point we disengaged with her and left. We headed down the road to the Buffalo Chip Saloon and had excellent service. 

This was the straw that broke the camels back - the food was mediocre and this type of service is abhorrent. If my children are misbehaving then feel free to tell me something but don't provide me with preemptive and unsolicited parenting advice. This place is definitely off of our list of places to eat. We will use our hard earned money to patronize establishments with staff that knows how to treat its customers.
