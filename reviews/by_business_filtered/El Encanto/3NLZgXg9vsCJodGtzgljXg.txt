One word: meh.

The end. 

Just kidding! Service was kind of bad. I had to ask for lemons and coke FOUR times. Rice was decent. Vegetables were good. Shrimp was good but the habanero sauce was kind of bland. Salsa tasted like pure tomato sauce and cumin. Where is the flavor? Corn chips needed salt. 

Pond was pretty, though. 

Nice try guys but I probably won't be returning on my own terms.
