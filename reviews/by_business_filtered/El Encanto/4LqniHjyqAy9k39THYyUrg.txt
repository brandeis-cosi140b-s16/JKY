This is a great place to bring out non-Arizona guests. If you have any kids in your group they can feed the ducks and turtles. Usually there is a wait, but the huge patio makes for a nice place to relax and have an adult beverage, especially when it's hot outside.

Food consists of your typical Mexican entrees all with rice and beans. It's a couple of bucks higher than your a chain Mexican restaurant, but worth it for the location and atmosphere.

Recently, I was there on at Saturday night and was told the wait was 1.5 hrs, but before we finished our first margarita (45min)we were seated at a nice window table.
