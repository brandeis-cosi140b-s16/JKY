My review seems to be inline with most of everyone. I will say that the Chicken Queso Fundido was pretty damn good and the chips and salsa were ridiculously addicting.  The margarita's were eh not my favorite but it was more less for the ambiance and good company were there for. I've heard positive things about the El Encanto Dos, maybe I'll give that location a try sooner or later- or cut my losses and find a better Mexican establishment in that area.
