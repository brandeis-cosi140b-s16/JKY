First time visiting the restaurant last night. Can also say it will probably be my last. 
My complaint with this place involved the service, the prices and the quality of the food.
We had some family in town and had just finished with an event nearby. Someone suggested we try El Encanto for dinner. After arriving we waited about 20 minutes for our table for 10 which is understandable on a Saturday night.
When we were brought to our table we were promptly brought waters and chips & salsa by the bussers. But we had to wait at least 10 minutes for the server to take our drink order and wait an additional 15 minutes before our drinks were delivered.

We ordered our food, it came out in a reasonable amount of time, but my entree was cold. I ordered the pollo con mole enchiladas which though they tasted ok, they were cold. This entree was $14.99
My boyfriend had the "special" 5 jumbo shrimp swimming in some chipotle sauce served with veggies and rice. $17.99
Thank god we waited so long for our drinks we filled up on chips and dip.

Then the server had a difficult time splitting our check. We were told the computer wouldn't allow him to split the check any further and everyone's tickets were messed up. He probably should have suspected or at least asked at the beginning if the check was to be split. 
On top of it all he added a 20% gratuity. 

All in all, I felt that this place was over priced, the service was slow, the food was served cold and the portions did not equal the pricetag. Also, not very accommodating to large party's.
One positive thing I can report is that the house margarita was quite tasty - though it was mostly ice.
