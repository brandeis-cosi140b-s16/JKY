The atmosphere is delightful! What a hidden gem! There is a beautiful duck pond surrounded by outdoor and indoor tables as well as a patio with live entertainment. Today they had a musician and a flamenco dancer! My son loved looking at the ducks, turtles, and fish in the pond. 

The food was delicious! I had the pork carnitas and they were satisfying but didn't leave me feeling overly stuffed. The chips they served at the start were good although I had a hard time deciding on a salsa. They serve a mild red, medium green, and hot red. None in their own worked for me, but salsa is an individual preference. I appreciated all of the gluten free designations on the menu. The waitstaff and hostess were friendly and helpful.

Why 4 stars? The bathrooms and foyer/bar need some work. There is a very strong odor. I personally think that the bricks, tiles, and grout- just in the front area and bar- need to be pulled up and replaced. It smells so strongly of stale beer. Fortunately you only pass through this area on the way to the gorgeous main eating areas, but it is enough to mention this in the review in the hopes the owner sees it and makes a note that yes, the customers do notice the smell.

Despite this small flaw, I look forward to returning soon with my family. What a great local joint!
