I've been here only twice. Today would've brought the experience down to a 1 star, but the previous one being a 3 - I settled on a 2. 

This place is huge and dripping with atmosphere. It's sprawling in fact and the patio wraps around a duck and swan pond... can be fun, but can also be annoying. Depends on how you feel about birds. Maybe it's romantic. Maybe it's disgusting. Personally, I find it to be a little bit of both.

The food is average. The salsa is very tasty, but not spicy enough. Today they were having a buffet style thing for the mad rush of mother's day. The place was empty though. There were a lot of wait staff - about one per table... on a buffet night even. With all these servers, we found it nearly impossible to get service.

We opted out of the buffet since it didn't seem cost effective (or appetizing, but we had driven so far we thought we should make the most of it), and sat at the bar forever waiting for one of the 5 servers to stop watching Castaway on TBS long enough to ask us what we wanted.  

The margaritas were weak and not very cheap. The waiter was rude, but he brought us a refill during a commercial. I think it's simply too far to be worth it. If the food was above average and the service was good, this would be a fun time. The whole area is a very touristy spot. I'd suggest it as a place to take your parents when they come visit you.
