My favorite Mexican place in the Phoenix metro. Very friendly service and great food. Not even a steak place, but the stuffed poblano Ribeye is the best steak I've had in the Phoenix area. I enjoy the variety of salsas they bring to the table. Another favorite is the polo fundido. My young nephews loved feeding the ducks in the pond. Great patio year round.
