Great place to have a romantic Mexican dinner. The seating by the pond/water is tranquil and something that you don't find anywhere else. The food is good, better than average. They are very generous with the chips and salsa here. Which is something that you don't find at a lot of places. I am one that likes to dip a chip in my meal and I don't like being told that "I am going to have to charge you for more chips". I love stopping here when I am in the neighborhood, great watering hole after a long ride on the bike.
