Hadn't been back here in sometime. Was very disappointed at the slow service and mediocre food quality. Sure not like it used to be. Even the manager negotiated what she'd bring in response to a simple request for sour cream. Too bad. Used to be a favorite with good food, drinks, service, and ambiance. Seems even the ducks have moved on.
