Whether you are looking for great Mexican food or a retreat away from the Phoenix metro area this is an ecellent place to go.  The entrance with the decorated walkway and pond stocked with coy fish and ducks makes you feel like you are walking into a "real" mexican restaurant that is in Mexico.  On the inside make sure to get a table that overlooks the pond and enjoy the atmosphere as you enjoy the authenic food that they serve.  This place is a must see when visiting Cave Creek.
