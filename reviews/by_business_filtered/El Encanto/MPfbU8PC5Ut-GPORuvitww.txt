I am thinking that the draw to this place is the pond with turtles, ducks and fish.  The water is a bit scummy but charming.  The food is average, not especially tasteful nor spicy.  It is good for atmosphere.  My hubby even left some food on his plate which is unusual.  Breakfast is better a lunch or dinner meal is questionable.
