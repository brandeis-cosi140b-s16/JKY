Skip the buffet. It sucked. I saw several people go in and look then come out shaking their heads.  My friend wanted breakfast so we got it. But it really was mediocre. Haven't got sick yet fingers crossed. I do go here often with out of town guests because it is a fun place with the pond etc. but never again the buffet
