The Complete Lowdown: El Encanto Edition. 

I live five minutes away and have been here countless times. Here is what you need to know: 

-Ambiance: spectacular. El Encanto has a large outdoor and indoor seating arrangement decorated with authentic Mexican titles and trinkets. It is quite lovely and makes you feel as if you are in a Mexican village. For the full experience, I recommend sitting outside next to the pond or on the strip of indoor seating that has windows to view the pond. That way, you will get the opportunity to be enchanted by the pond creatures (adorable turtles and ducks) and to be entertained by the children feeding them. You will also be touched by the warming and relaxing sunshine overhead--glorious.

-Busy: Be aware and warned--weekends are busy. You may have to wait 30 minutes for a table and scrounge for parking, but it is all part of the fun, excitement, and liveliness of the experience. Grab a margarita at the bar to enjoy the wait! 

-Food: every table is served chips and three sauces to start--all of which are very tasty. There is a standard red sauce, spicy chipotle sauce, and a green tomatillo sauce. Try the queso Guillermo for a starter--it is delicious. Being a health freak, I normally order the fresco salad or fish tacos. They are quite tasty but nothing mind blowing or fancy. If I am feeling indulgent, I go for the small portion of the cheese enchilada which comes with rice and beans. I recommend it. 

-One word: Margaritas! I have tried nearly every flavor and would have to recommend the original, mango, or raspberry. You will not be disappointed. Just remember, they are strong so I would advise not having more than two--drive safely and responsibly! 

-Service: I have experience the good, the bad, and the ugly. I would say 75% of the time the service is friendly and reliable. However, the more less than positive occasions I have been waited on by slow and standoffish servers. 

All in all, I come here for the ambiance, margaritas, and convenience. It only gets better the more you come due to its charming and appealing qualities. There's no denying--me encanata El Encanto! It is truly a special place.
