Maybe Texas Tex-mex spoiled me, but overall I am not impressed with Zona mexican food.  El Encanto isn't too bad though.  I've always left full and fairly satisfied with the flavors - and the chips and salsa.  Good chips and salsa get me every time!

The ambiance is unique but eating on the outdoor patio has it's downside.  Like birds?  I mean birds flying close to you, eating the food at the recently vacated table next to yours?  Not only were the ducks under the tables and being shooed away by the wait staff, but flocks of none too timid sparrows were cleaning the tables before the busboys got there.  Thoughts of bird droppings and disease did cross my mind.  My whole family was mildly freaked out by it.  Hopefully this was not a typical experience - it did occur only once in our several visits so I don't want to emphasize it too much.

Kids love the place.  Feeding the ducks, watching the turtles and fish, etc.  Great photo ops with the munchkins.  But, the next time I go, I will wait for a booth inside with a glass wall onto the pond.

And the good news is the bar looks dark and cozy.  So that waiting needn't be a drag. 

Solid value based on the food and the setting.  I've been there multiple times and will go again!
