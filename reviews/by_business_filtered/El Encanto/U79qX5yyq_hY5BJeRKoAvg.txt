SERVICE: 1 Star  (non communicative, bored, not helpful when asked simple question like 'What comes in this dish'....)
FOOD: 4 Stars, Tasted great.
we used to go years ago, for the atmosphere - the relaxed, funky setting.
I know they're big and 'busy' now...but...
does service always have to suffer when something gets 'successful'?..to bad.
Food was great...good on ya chef's and person bringing our lunch out to the table.
