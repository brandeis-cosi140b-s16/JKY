This place could be described as a tourist trap, but those types of places have bad food and the food here was rather tasty. Now, I enjoy mole, but usually it is too spicy for me, but that was not the case at Encanto. The mole was on the sweet side just as the waitress had mentioned. It was ladled over my chicken enchilada and I mopped up all the sauce with ease. We ordered a $7 guac appetizer and it came with chips and this was a good, traditional version of the mean green food. Nice chunks of avocado and no spice at all. The main attraction is of course the turtle pond. We got a seat inside, but we were right next to the pond. Outside is not worth waiting 30 minutes and we arrived at sort of an off hour on a weekend. Probably less folks here during week, but the food was well worth the drive to the West's most Western town.
