Dropped by for lunch and was not very impressed. I have been to this place years ago but things have changed and not for the better. 

The server/bartender was kind of slow and I ran out of water frequently. If we asked for more salsa and chips, would you not bring enough for everyone at the table? We had three salsas to start but the server only gave us one new one. They were very small as well! It's not about the customer at this place. 

I'm not a shredded chicken or shredded beef kind of person, so I was hoping to get ground beef in some enchiladas but that wasn't an option. We were told there was no ground beef. 

Next thing I see is a burger go by our table. This made me question the ground beef. Was this a shredded beef burger? No, they have ground beef but not for my order. So I asked if I could get a burger patty next time and assemble my own enchilada. That seemed to be okay. I understand the food is probably prepared in advance and the burger patties are pre-made, so I get that. 

I changed my order to a green corn tamale but there were no "meals". I had to order the tamale appetizer along with a side of beans and rice. How is this not a meal option? I'm just so confused. 

Also their portion sizes have seem to get smaller while the prices have increased. The food was just "okay" and nothing to share on social media about. Good thing I ate before I went or I would still be hungry.
