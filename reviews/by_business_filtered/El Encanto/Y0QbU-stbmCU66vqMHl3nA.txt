AMAZING! I am not the biggest fan of Mexican food, so when we decided to try this place for lunch I was kind of expecting the same greased up, fried, typical Mexican food. Boy, was I wrong! The ambiance is so perfect...with their swans & turtles swimming in the pond. The outdoor would be a beautiful venue for a rehearsal dinner or any fun get together. Decorated festive but not overdone. The salsas they bring out before your meal are tasty: mild/medium was my favorite. Husband loved the spicy & the tomatillo was  also good. We were told the portions are huge, so husband & I split the pollo fundido which came with beans and rice. Delicious! I had the most perfect prickly pear margarita. Overall terrific experience!
