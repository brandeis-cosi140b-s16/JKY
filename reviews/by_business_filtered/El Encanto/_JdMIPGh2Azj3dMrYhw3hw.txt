I've been going here for years and I just love this place.  It can get really busy on the weekends, but if you go mid-week for lunch you will find the patio very relaxing. The restaurant looks like it used to be a house.  There is a pond in the back with ducks and turtles that can be viewed from both the outside and in-depending on where you sit. The pollo fundido is the best, shredded chicken in a deep fried burro with jalapeno cream cheese and cheddar melted on top- probably a million calories, but worth it. I've never really had a problem with the service and the food has been consistently good.  Plus it's in charming Cave Creek, great place to bring out-of-towners.  Actually, the restaurant was even mentioned in a book I read recently (the author was local).
