Beautiful seating area next to a pond with ducks! Delicious margaritas by the pitcher for a reasonable price. Free chips with three house made salsas that are great. I ordered the enchiladas with red and green sauce - very good. My friend ordered a dish with the white sauce which was amazing! Service was a little spotty.
