I'm a lifelong duck pond fan, so when I found out this was a restaurant centered around a pond, of course I couldn't resist.

We were in town visiting my parents and dragged them there. They were good sports. The food was just okay... I'm certain there is much more authentic Mexican around, and probably for cheaper. But for ambiance this place is unequaled. 

The positive: 
Ambiance -- Beautiful outdoor seating alongside the pond, which had lots of feathered friends. Indoor seating all seems to have a good view of the pond as well. A great place to hold a function.

The negative:
There were quite a few blunders... Three of us got our food while my mom sat and waited... and waited. She probably had to wait 10 minutes, which got quite frustrating. 
Meanwhile, my boyfriend and I took the first sips of our "diet" coke and both gave each other a weird look. "Does this taste strange to you?" "Yes" "Me too" ... waitress comes, insists she poured diet, but brings back a new pitcher. Well would you believe that, this one actually tastes like diet! 
Beyond these blunders, this place is the only Mexican restaurant I have ever been to that charges extra if you go through your first basket of tortilla chips and decide you want more! 

The salsas that come with the chips were pretty good, but the guac we ordered was not so good (kinda bland tasty and mushy). It came with a small pile of chips on the side. Seemed like they were teasing with just enough chips to get you to want more, so you'd have to pay extra.

The bottom line: Great if you have a group and want a fun setting or are dining with kids and want them to be able to enjoy the duck pond. Don't go for the food. And I wouldn't go often. But for a cool one-time experience definitely worth it.
