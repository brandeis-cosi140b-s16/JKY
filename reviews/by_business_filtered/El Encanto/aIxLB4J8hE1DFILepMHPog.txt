There  is not large selection of eateries in Cave Creek but El Encanto is a good one.  I started off with a pitcher of margueritas and they were the best.  The queso appetizer was fabulous as was the fresh guacamole.  The pollo fundido was outstanding and the small size was more than enough.  They were able to accomodate our large group.  I will return!
