I love the atmosphere El Encanto has to offer. The pond rocks. My wife and I love the romantic setting and I believe it has received numerous "most romantic restaurant of the year" awards. 

The food is always top notch and meets/exceeds our personal expectations. The only reason I didn't give it 5 (WHICH I TOTALLY WOULD) was because I can't stand dining on the patio with all the birds. My fear of birds makes the dining experience a little trickier and every so often you see me jump up a little in my seat as a bird has just walked over my feet. UGGGGGHHHHH...

In winter, they put out the patios heaters which is always a pretty neat experience...weather permitting of course.

Anyhow, my wife and I can't wait to come back.
