We have been to Cave Creek several times and we always drive by and think we should stop in there sometime. Today was the day. We had friends visiting from out of town and wanted to take a bike ride so we headed out to Cave Creek and stopped in for lunch. It was pretty busy and we did have a bit of a wait but we just hung out at the bar while we waited for a table. If there hadn't been such a large group of us I would have just stayed in the bar area. We ended up on the patio which was nice. My hubby and I shared the appetizer sampler platter which was plenty of food for us. I really liked the tamale verde and I think I would order that the next time we go. Everyone in our group liked their food. I would have given 5 stars but the service was super slow!!
