Stopped in for lunch today.  I've wanted to try this place for a long time.

1 - Frozen margaritas were very good, even at $7 each.
2 - Chips and salsa were great.
3 - Service was very good.
4 - Atmosphere nice with view of pond and turtles.
4 - However, entree was awful.  My chicken (pollo fundido) was extremely salty.
5 - I won't be back.
6 - Do yourself a favor; stop for cocktails and move on.
