I liked this place. I got the fundido and it was very good. My husband got the carne asada and it was really tasty too. If you don't like eating by a pond, then don't go. Personally I thought it was a unique and fun experience. There are seats indoors with glass between you and the pond if you are worried about an amoeba or duck poo jumping into your food. Oh, and the margaritas are OUTSTANDING...and I am very picky about margaritas.

If you are ever bored on a Sunday in October definitely check out their farmer's market. We went there for brunch yesterday...it was very good! They had an omelet bar, waffle bar, fresh fruit and pastries, and also some standard Mexican fare. The market was fun...bought some excellent pineapple habanero jelly. I wouldn't recommend the popcorn though, brought it home and it was STALE.
