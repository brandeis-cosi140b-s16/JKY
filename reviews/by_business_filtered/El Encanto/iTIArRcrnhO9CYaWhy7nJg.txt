We hit this place periodically.  The food is good and the service is typically good.  It's very popular to sit out on the patio during the winter and spring months in Phoenix,  Pollo Fundido is one of our favorites and I also love the mole enchiladas (in fact, I had some just last night!!).  

One point of irritation - when booking a reservation for a party of 12, we were told that there was a 2-hour limit on the table.  I get it, you want to turn over tables, etc. - but it does not make guests (including a large group who are coming to spend money in your restaurant) very welcome.  Agree or not, it left us feeling kind of like we were told to eat and then get the hell out.  Unless service is slow, I don't believe I have ever sat in a restaurant for more than 2 hours anyway, but I found that being told that there was a table time limit a bit irritating. 

It won't stop me from going back because we love the food and atmosphere.  It's a good place to bring out-of-town guests when they are in Phoenix.
