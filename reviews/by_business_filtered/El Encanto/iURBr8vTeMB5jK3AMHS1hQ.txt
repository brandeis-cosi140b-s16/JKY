You'll see as many locals eating here as winter visitors/tourists. The atmosphere is comfortable, service is good, and food is delicious! 

It can get pretty busy during peak season, so make a reservation or come mid-afternoon to avoid the crowd, although they're great at managing the mayhem! 

Enjoy the patio if it's nice out. They fire up the patio heaters if it's chilly, and serve frozen pitchers of margaritas if you need to sit by the cool of the pond on a warmer day! 

Enjoy our beautiful town! There's not another place like it! ;-)
