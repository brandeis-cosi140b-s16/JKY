El Encanto serves authentic Mexican food in dreamy atmosphere.  Great for a date night or special occasion w my kids.  They serve a mole that I compare all other moles to.  The margaritas are also top notch.  My kids like the duck, koi, and turtle filled pond.  I understand on Sat mornings they have a mariachi band.  Customer service has always been great here as well.  Highly recommended for a taste of Mexico.
