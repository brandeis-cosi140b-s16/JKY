Went to El Encanto last night.  We started going there 12 years ago and back then the food was good but over the last few years (going maybe twice a year) it has gotten decidedly worse. Even though our last few experiences were poor we decided to try again hoping they were simply bad nights for the restaurant.  Unfortunately this trip was no better.  The chips served were cold and tasted like the oil needed to be changed.  I ordered a plato burro which was tasteless considering the sauce poured over top and the beef was chewy.  The tortillas was also dry and chewy.  My wife had the chilli relleno con pollo.  The chili was undercooked and tasted raw, chicken was overdone, my daughter ordered a bean burrito which she complained about the tortillas being dry and chewy, nothing special but it cost us $14 for the bean burrito with a side of beans and rice.  My other daughter had the pollo fundido which she said was okay. Should have clued in when I ask the waiter what he would recommend and the only thing was the polo fundido.  He said 75% of the patrons have that.  After trying other dishes I understand.   They forgot our appetizer of stuffed jalapenos so we cancelled them when the entrees were served.  Waited 45 minutes from order to entrees and they were not that busy. I used to recommend this place.  Have they changed owners? It seems their attention to detail and quality has gone down and the prices have gone up. Their menu mentions awards from 8-10 years ago.  No way would they get those now.    Not going back and that is a real shame.  Pains me to see what used to be a good establishment go downhill.  Don't waste your time.  There are many better choices for Mexican food.
