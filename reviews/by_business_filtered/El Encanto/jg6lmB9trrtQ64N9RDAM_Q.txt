Love the atmosphere of this place. The kids love feeding the ducks. Food is always pretty good. Margaritas are great. Didn't give it 5 stars because the hostesses are usually less than friendly. One of them made a rude comment to my four year old about buying ANOTHER pack of duck food. ( I walked up with her to the hostess stand to buy a second cone full) Ummmm, you sell it for the kids to feed the ducks. If you don't want them feeding the ducks or are limiting their food, don't sell it!! That's the reason my kids beg me to come here!
