This is a great place to get lunch in the Cave Creek area. The food is good and sitting on the patio with a margarita is great! The patio has a large pond inside the court yard with ducks and turtles. This is our favorite atmosphere out of the many Mexican food restaurants we have tried. We went in early February and it was a little cold out but it felt very nice still on the patio because of the heaters.
