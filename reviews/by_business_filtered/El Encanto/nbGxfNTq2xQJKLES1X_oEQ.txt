My husband and I took my sister here for dinner on her visit.  They have a duck pond! I love duck ponds, how Blair Waldorf! The setting is a spanish style- tile and colorful with indoor and outdoor seating.  I am sure it is very nice in the fall/winter but it was 109. Plus, the duck pond is cute, but smelled a little like the water at an amusement park, thus we opted for inside seating with a view of the ducks.  The food was fantastic and everyone was happy. The Tamales (chicken and veggie) were flavorful and had different sauces. They were huge though! So was my sister's chicken burrito. Very classic and well done. My husband had the carnitas (so I did not sample) but he was very pleased.  We will go back for sure!  Service was just ok.
