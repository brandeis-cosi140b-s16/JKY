Can I just say I love El Encanto.

I took clients there for lunch the other day.  They are down for the 'Season' from Chicago.  They were just enamored by the atmosphere.  Yes the birds can be bothersome, so don't sit by the pond!  At any rate, the service is always good, the food is fresh and piping HOT.  

My favorites are the Chili Verde and the Pollo Fundito!  YUMM!  The Chili Verde is slow roasted pork smothered with green chili...so good!  The Pollo Fundito is a chicken burrito smothered in queso blanco and run under the broiler...double YUMM.

It's a bit kitchy, but the service is consistent, the food fresh and tasty, and the whole El Encanto story is charming.

When you are in Cave Creek, Go, no RUN to El Encanto and don't forget the margaritas...so good!
