If you've ever had good Mexican food then you DO NOT want to eat here. The food was mediocre at best. The only reason for the 2 stars is the service. The host and wait staff were very pleasant, but other than that the food was terrible. You are better off crossing the street to Smokehouse. We had dinner there the next day and it was fantastic. Skip this place and cross the street.
