Dang!  I wish I had seen the reviews prior to visiting this restaurant but...it was not my choice, actually.

What completely freaked me out was that the bill was $85.00!  $85.00 for a meal for two!  For Mexican food!?  Excuse me!!!???

The atmosphere was nice, the waitstaff was average, and the food was sub-par.  Actually, the fish tacos were the worst I have tasted but my date loved the carnitas.  The pitchers of margaritas are largely filled with ice.  And everything is WAAAY overpriced for the flavor and quality of the food.

I won't return.
