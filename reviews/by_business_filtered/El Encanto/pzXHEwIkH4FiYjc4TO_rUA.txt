I like the setting with the pond and ducks and all but the food wasn't spectacular. Nothing really stood out. I ordered a pitcher of margaritas that cost 25$ and was half filled with ice which was a turn off. Service was good and the happy hour is ok with buckets of 6 8oz coronas for 5$.

I am not sure I would chose to sit on the patio where all the ducks and birds fly around dropping poo but you can sit inside and still have a good view if you pick a window seat. They had some live guitar music out side which was a nice touch. I might go back for happy hour but would probably go elsewhere for food.
