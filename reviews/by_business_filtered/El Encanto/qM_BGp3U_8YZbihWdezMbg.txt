Been here several times with family and just friends. Always order the frozen ritas....they are good and strong! If you need to find a great place to take kids this is it....very relaxed outside seating with plenty of animals to keep them entertained. They get to feed the ducks in a designated area as well. Service can be hit or miss so can't be in a hurry.
