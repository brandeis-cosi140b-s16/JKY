We were there in the winter (off season) a couple times and we had no problem with service. Loved it. I loved the thick, yummy baked cheese dip- too bad I can't remember what it's called. And the Pollo Fundido- yum! Can't beat the atmosphere; chill, beautiful, and... constant duck entertainment on the pond. My cousin brings her 3 year old to "the duck restaraunt" every time she visits. Love this place.
