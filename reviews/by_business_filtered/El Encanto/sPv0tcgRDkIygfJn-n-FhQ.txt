The duck pond was my favorite part , but it is kind of dirty and lacking pond plants for the turtles that live there.

If you are shopping along this strip and need a break this will do because It IS NOT THE WORST but also NOT The best in American style Mexican cuisine.

We thought we were going to try the $14.95 buffet but took a peek and decided against it because nothing to use looked appetizing and there were very few choices I think only 6 buffet pans plus an omelet station .

They gave us the chips and the 3 sauces so MAYBE it's just me but all 3 sauces had an unusual ingredient added that I didn't care for .

My Chicken Fajita salad came and I DO NOTE this was the greasiest and oiliest one I have ever had it was very generous with peppers and onions and red cabbage that I picked out because dripping with oil . The chicken had an odd texture sort of dried out but juicy like a dry sponge with liquid . My salad also came with Mexican Style sour cream and  guacamole . I asked for the re fried beans on the side and my husband tried them he said they were just unseasoned whipped beans that really needed some salt .

My husband tried the carnitas and thought the actual pork was OK but the black beans that came with it just had an awful smoke flavor to them and he also wasn't a fan of the corn tortillas . He was having gastric problems the next day and thought it was from here since  I was fine and it was the only food we had different the day before . (so it seemed like kind of visiting Mexico for real) I can't say positively that this was from here just a guess .

If you dine here a table would be better than a booth because you will have a better view of the ducks , swans and turtles .
