This is an interesting place to grab a meal. It is clearly designed as a tourist destination. The decor is over the top. There is a lot of outdoor seating, which is great. The place is deceptively large and quite busy.

We got a good seat right next to the pond outside. Our server was friendly and fairly attentive. We started with a pitcher of margaritas on the rocks. The margaritas had very good flavor.

The chips and salsa they bring out are good. The standard salsa had good flavor as did the spicy salsa. I would have liked more heat from the spicy, but it was good. I did not enjoy the green salsa at all. The chips were sturdy and crisp. We also ordered the Queso Guillermo for a starter. It had great flavor, but was saturated in butter. You will enjoy the flavor but will make you wonder about how much you are shortening your life.

For my meal I ordered the Plato de Mexicano. It consists of a cheese enchilada, beef taco and a red chile tamale. The taco was ok. It is good sized with ok flavor. The enchilada was ok. I would have liked a little more flavor though. The tamale was the best of the three. It was a good sized tamale and was quite tasty. The rice that comes with the meals is ok.

This is a cool place to bring people. That being said, it would not be my first choice for food if I was not entertaining people.
