I've been eating at this restuarant since 5th grade. In case you are wondering this is way way over ten years now. I've watched it grow and change. The Mexican food is great, not the gourmet Santa Fe style, but true AZ style...a little greasy, a little sloppy, but oh so good.

Aside from the food you can't bea the atmospher. If possible sit outside by the duck pond. It's a real treat. If you have little ones bring some change and feed the ducks.

WARNING: Watch out if you sit at a table by an overgrown palm tree, my grandmother got pooped on by an owl once...no joke!
