Visitied on Easter after golfing on a semi-hot day. Excellent chips and salsa/hot sauce to try before dinner. Had the appetizer for two, pollo fundido, a red and green tamale and 2 taquitos. Very good and filling for the $$ spent, would recommend highly! Cadillac margaritas hit the spot on a hot day.
