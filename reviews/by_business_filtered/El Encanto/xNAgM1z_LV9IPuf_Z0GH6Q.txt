This place is okay unless you have a large party because they only give you a choice of  four entr√©es.   None of which were very exciting.  I chose the chicken fundedo .  The chicken was very dry and had very little cheese sauce. You had to wash it down to eat it.
I hope this was a rare experience. They need to offer the regular menu because we were seated at separate tables.  I won't make it a destination for a family dinner again.
