Neat!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This place is like a trip to a non-petting zoo and aquarium and aviary while you dine on fairly decent Mexican food.  I was here for a late brunch and didn't wait at all.  I was near a window that right on the pond, and just about every turtle in the pond crawled out to come on over and see what the Rock was cooking and how I was enjoying it... no joke, see pic!

The ducks and geese were very active in the lagoon, showing off for all the diners, and it thrilled the kids to pieces.  The guacamole is decent and the 3 types of salsa you're given were all good in their own ways.  

If anything, swing in here for the atmosphere.  I bet its awesome at night.
