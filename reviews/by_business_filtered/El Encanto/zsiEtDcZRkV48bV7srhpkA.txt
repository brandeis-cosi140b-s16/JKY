We have been to El Encanto many times and have usually enjoyed the food, although never really raved about it. Tonight was more than a disappointment. The albongas soup although very tasty was barely warm. I ordered steak fajitas. Oh what a disappointment. Over cooked beef, and under cooked vegetables. NO fajitas flavor, no hint of marinade just overdone chewy beef and vegetables barely shown the grill. No wonderful caramelization........no nothing. My husbands a la carte taco (and something else) totally bland and tasteless. Can't even remember what he ate....that's how lacking it was. Sweet and attentive server. The restaurant was slammed and I can only guess the kitchen was in overload  VERY disappointing.
