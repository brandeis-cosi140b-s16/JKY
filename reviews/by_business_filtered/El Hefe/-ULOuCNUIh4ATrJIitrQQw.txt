A friend and I stopped by this joint after having a few drinks at the W.  It's a short walk, couple of blocks, away.  It was the middle of the week around 9 pm and the place was half full....good crowd, decent vibe.  We saddled up to a table near the bar and close to the patio.  We ordered a couple of drinks and people watched for an hour or so.

They serve a specialty Margarita here that's served in a large glass and a full Corona bottle turned upside down inside the glass, they call it a "Beer-garita".....it looks ridiculous.  Even more hilarious was the number of people who were walking around drinking this monstrosity....it reminds me of the tourists in Vegas who walk around with those giant tubes of Hurricanes or Margaritas....great people watching I tell ya!

Our server was very attentive and made sure our glasses remained full.  The music was pretty good too....a DJ was playing house/dance music.  Overall, it was a fun time.
