Fun for Friday and Saturday nights. Also great on Sunday afternoon. Only one problem is that the line for guys is extremely long and unless you go early enough so you don't have to wait, that's the only way you're getting in.. Well that's unless you're a good looking woman then you're always getting in.. Great place though!!
