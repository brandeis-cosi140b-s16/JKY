I would have given higher rating if based on food and drinks only, however I had a bad experience being overcharged on my credit card. I called and my message was never returned. Its annoying to have to resolve their mistake when you have a busy schedule. 
So to me, questionable service and management put a big damper on my experience.

Tip-try the duck taco 
Tip- try the beer-garita
Tip- cool beer tap right in the tables!
