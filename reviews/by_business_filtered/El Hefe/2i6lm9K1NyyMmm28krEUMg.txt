El Hefe Scottsdale is definitely as worthy of the way you spend your daytime hours as it is your after hours. I went during lunch and found the restaurant to be quite enjoyable. The club/bar layout is open and spacious, giving you an alternative option to the cramped styles of the traditional lunch spots. The tacos are phenomenal, I highly recommend the al pastor or duck carnitas, for great savory options. And the positive, aesthetically pleasing staff kept the experience light and full of good vibes. An all around good experience.
