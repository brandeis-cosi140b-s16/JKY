What was the point of opening a second Hooter's right down the street from another one? I almost feel bad for the girls who are forced to degrade themselves in booty shorts and low-cut halter tops, but then again, half the chicks on Mill dress that way anyway. I guess being leered at all day by half-drunk frat boys really grinds on you, so maybe that explains the extraordinarily bad service.

Our hostess forgot to tell the waitress we were seated, so that took forever to even get drinks. Then, she forgot to bring our appetizers. All that would've been fine -- some people just have bad days -- but the food was somehow beneath actual street tacos and more bland than Chili's. 

Couple all this with the obnoxious top 40 blaring from the speakers and every TV tuned to some idiotic sports spectacle and you'll understand why I hope this place burns to the ground. Leave this shit in Scottsdale, where it belongs.
