Fun cantina in Scottsdale. Good fun vibe close to Axis/Radius and within stumbling distance of The W. The service is attentive and friendly. The food looks yummy but I was too busy drinking. They have tables that have their own beer taps. Would love to get a group and try that out. The Beergarita (Coronita in a jumbo margarita) is a must try.
