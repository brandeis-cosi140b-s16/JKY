My friend and I tried to try out El Hefe last night. We got carded at the door, it was about 10pm. I thought it was a restaurant, so I was kinda confused. We sat at a high top table outside. We sat there for 20 minutes and no one came over. Maybe there are no servers outside, and I just don't know the El Hefe procedures? Anyway, we left. Went to Fuzzys and had a great time. I won't try again.
