1st Clue: All the restaurants/bars were pretty packed except here. Waitress was "ok" until you told her that some of our food REALLY sucked, then she didn't bat an eyelash. If 3/4 of your party says the food sucked, then it sucks!!! Hey tried it, now I know. The town street is happening here awesome weekday/night life but just not here!
