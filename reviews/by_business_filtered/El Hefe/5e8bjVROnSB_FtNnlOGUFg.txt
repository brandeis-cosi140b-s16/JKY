Whenever I head to mill the first place I stop at is Hefe. I always go there because I love the music. Not only is the music good, but the food there is awesome. You wouldn't expect a bar to have good quality food but I would totally recommend the chicken tortilla soup!!! The place is always fun and happening even during the week. They also have corn hole in the back which is always fun to get a group to play. Least to say, Hefe is the one spot you should hit every time you head to mill. Bring a bunch of friends because it'll call for a good night!
