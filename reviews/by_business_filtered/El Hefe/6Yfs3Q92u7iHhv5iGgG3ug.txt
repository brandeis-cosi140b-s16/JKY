brunch here and happy hour is awesome. At night it turns into your stereotypical Scottsdale d-bag watering hole. Among the sea of roid raged bros with overly gelled hair and drenched in Armani cologne, will you occassionally spot a pretty waitress dancing upon the bar, with a tequila bottle in her hand ready to pour into your mouth.
