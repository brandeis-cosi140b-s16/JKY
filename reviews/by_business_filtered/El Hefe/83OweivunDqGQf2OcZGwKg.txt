Love this place! Foods awesome, the staff is fun, and the atmosphere is contagious. You can't walk out of here without a smile. 

The food is a brilliant take on classic Mexican food and looks as good as it tastes. They have about a million tequilas and a million more margarita combinations. 

Located right in the heart of old town Scottsdale this place lives up to the hype. Beautiful women run wild in this place, However with that come the occasional tatted meat head but those guys are cool too (sometimes). The line moves fairly quickly as does the pace of the night. This place is usually pretty busy and always fun.
