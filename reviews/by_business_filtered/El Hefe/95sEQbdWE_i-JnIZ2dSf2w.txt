Went for lunch which I'm certain is a totally different experience than at night. The space is nice and has a very indoor/outdoor feel due to the large garage style doors. Service was fine and food was good. Not great but not bad. The descriptions on the menu were vastly different than what was actually served and we were surprised by that. The quesadillas were much more taco like than quesadilla like. The pollo torta had some sort of ground beef or chorizo or something on it which wasn't mentioned on the menu at all and the churros were not stuffed as described and didn't come with a side of ice cream as mentioned on the menu. I know this place is new and they're still probably trying to work out the kinks but really the menus should be reprinted to represent the food. It's also pretty pricey for what you get. I would go back for happy hour or something but don't think I'll be back for lunch.
