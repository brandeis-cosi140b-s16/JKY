Came in here during our Spring Training trip and this place was NUTS! El Hefe is like a weird corner of Vegas mashed up with a bar in Old Town. The place felt like a crazy house party inside of a bar, with everybody going wild the entire time. Nothing negative to say about this place-great place to check out if you're in town for Spring Training and looking to get weird. Will definitely be back next year!
