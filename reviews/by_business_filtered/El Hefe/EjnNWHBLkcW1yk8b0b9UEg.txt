The Scottsdaleification of Tempe has begun. Can the moron owners at least think of another concept to put on that corner of Mill rather than your nasty, overpriced and unappetizing food that already exists in Old Town? Apparently, nobody can remember that Tempe is a true college town and we don't want (even if I am not in college) to pay 6 bucks for a beer or 10 bucks for our frozen margarita's. They even charge you for those same lousy chips that they serve at the other location. On my two recent visits, nothing bad happened, the bartender was in a good mood and the servers all are showing off their butts in their workout outfits. El Hefe, the place to get ripped off on Mill, enjoy, but it does have a nice dual patio setup.
