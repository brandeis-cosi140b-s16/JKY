Free chips and guac for checking in! What a great deal! My bartender Austin fully explained the menu. I ended up trying the the fajita combo! Great presentation and taste; although it is a bit pricy. This may become a regular lunch spot for me.


Returned again on 05/27 for lunch and once again was blown away by the presentation of my meal. Service seems to be on point.
