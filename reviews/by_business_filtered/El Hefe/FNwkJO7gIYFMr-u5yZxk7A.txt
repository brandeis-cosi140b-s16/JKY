It's tucked away, but worth the search. The decor is very fun. The plastic covers on the booths are what you would expect to find in a Hispanic grandma's house. The chips and salsa are some of the best I've had. The first time we went, the hubs and I tried a bit of everything: nearly every taco and a torta. The most recent visit, we grabbed a taco and split a pork belly torta. If it's a first time, you gotta try the pork belly empanadas and chicken tinga. The table taps are really cool and, if I hadn't had my 3 mo old son with me, I would have had a beer. The only downside were the churros. The sauces were great and would have complimented the churros perfectly had the churros been cooked all the way through. I think the oil was too hot and crisped up the outside before the center was cooked. Even at that, definitely will return. Can't wait to try some nachos.
