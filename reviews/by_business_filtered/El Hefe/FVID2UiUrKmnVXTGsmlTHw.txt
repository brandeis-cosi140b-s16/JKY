Dear Mr. Hefe,

Although our end product differs, I too am in the Sales and Service industry. As you are well aware, there is never a shortage of notes from customers that wish to complain and often the compliments come few and far between. I would like to change that, today. I attended Cinco de Mayo at your establishment and had the most fun I have ever had in my life. You put on one heck of a show. From the "girls" that danced on the bar all night, to the "girls" that paraded around in bathing suits, it was impressive. Although I only ate one taco, I stared at a buffet of tacos all around me. And they were good. The DJ and the continuous ummmph ummmph from the bass provided the perfect rhythm for girls with daddy issues to rub up on strangers. Like I said earlier, you did well. Real well. The memories of easily manipulated coeds swarming your bar like a couple of retards fighting over the last two pieces of cake will not be easily erased. I can only hope that your Memorial Day party is just as sleazy and creepy!  Keep up the great work. Long live El Hefe.
