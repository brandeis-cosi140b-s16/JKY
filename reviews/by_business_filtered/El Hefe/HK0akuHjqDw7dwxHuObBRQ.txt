El Hefe "THE BOSS." What better way to spend a Wednesday night or Friday night in Old Town Scottsdale?!
Excellent beer and tequila selection. The servers and bartenders are all beautiful, and actually have brains, unlike majority of OT bars...
The table service is always on point. Rachel (with the dark hair) is exceptional.
Overall customer service is excellent. Sean Frantz and his team all do a great job for the company.
If you like tequila, booty, and loud music, then welcome home. 
If you don't like those things, then... Sorry? Maybe you suffer from a rare condition, who knows.


Obey the boss.
