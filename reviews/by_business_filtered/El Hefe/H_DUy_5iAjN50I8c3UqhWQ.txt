Went for the st. Patrick's day event and it was the best experience my group of friends and I had.  We all had so much fun!!!!! 
There were games to play,  everyone around us was really nice.
My main thing about bars are the staff.  The staff here are some of the best I've seen on mill Ave.  Nice,  attentive,  good attitudes. 
 Love it,  definitely going back with more friends
