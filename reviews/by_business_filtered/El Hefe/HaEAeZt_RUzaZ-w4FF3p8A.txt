We had a group of 13 of us today for a birthday/football get together .. Let me tell you that this place SUCKS 
We never even made it thru the door and this goon of a door man was looking at us 
Geez dude it's Sunday football and it's Scottsdale
We were dressed appropriately . Bottom line is
This place SUCKS way better places in Scottsdale
Then this doucher don't waste your money here
