Being a fan of the scottsdale location I decided to give the tempe location a try.

I enjoyed the steak fajitas which came with a roasted jalape√±o which was delicious!

I stuck around for the party on a friday night, it was rocking!! so much fun.

the only negative was that it was super crowded, but thats to be expected at any "hot spot'

Def the place to be on Mill Ave!
