Took the wife here for happy hour and could not believe the amount of fruit flies surrounding the inside of the restaurant. They were everywhere it kinda made me feel like I was in a dirty ass bar in Mexico.  When I asked the waitress she told me, " it is very normal for a bar to have these  fruit flies." Uhhhhh no not really.  My drink did taste good but swatting flies while drink kinda sucks.  Lets clean this place up.
