As a nightclub, I think this place is tops. It is the club that started a new fad in Old Town, inspiring other, newer clubs to be more like it with indoor/outdoor setups, plus the taps built into the tables is a cool concept. The servers there are friendly and the place is fun. So what's not to like? Well, I was completely underwhelmed with the food our table had ordered.  The burgers were dry and the portion size of the sides were very small. The prices were a little high as well. We left there feeling ripped off a little, with no intentions of returning for future dine-ins.
