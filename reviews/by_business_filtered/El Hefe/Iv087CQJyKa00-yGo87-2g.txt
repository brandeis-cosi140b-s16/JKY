Can't decide whether or not the staff is supposed to be super rude or if they are really that full of themselves. Besides the rudeness and shrewd staffing issue, I get the whole girls dancing on the bar top thing. The thing I don't get is why they look like 18 year old strippers with daddy issues. Let the freshman girls work the frat parties and get some older girls up there. I almost don't go in there bc it makes me uncomfortable seeing men watch these young girls and who knows whats going through their creepy minds...
