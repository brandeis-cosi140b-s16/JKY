My husband and I went in for an early dinner before a Livewire Concert, so we didn't get much of the "bar" atmosphere, which was fine with us. I liked the restaurant. Our server was so sweet, but obviously new to the job, which we didn't mind. The food was okay. It was one of those places that wasn't bad, but wasn't great. 
Would I go back?
Probably.
