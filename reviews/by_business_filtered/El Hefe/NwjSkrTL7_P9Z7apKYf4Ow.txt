Okay so this is your stereotypical Old Town Scottsdale night club.  One caveat....they shoot confetti into the sky from little guns.  Alright, I'm hooked. 

It's over crowded.
And I don't mean with just people in general.  I mean sweaty, overly intoxicated, overly "friendly" d's.  

You have to expect that going into a place where you'll wait in line for 45min if you don't have breasts, right?  But again....the confetti. 

They have chicks that dance on the bar running around with a whistle and a bottle of liquor pouring shots into whomever is brave enough to step up to the bar.  (This girl on her birthday! - no judgement needed.)  Note to self: this liquid they pour into your mouth taste more like battery acid rather than actual alcohol, but hey, it's the experience.

I have never even considered eating here being that I only force my friends into this establishment for special occasions.....or nights we've been over poured and feel like Superman.  

On my birthday we ventured in here for 30min-1hr.  Enough time for a drink or two and a couple confetti showers. Heaven.  If you haven't been I recommend at least going once to really experience a real "unce unce" night in Old Town.  It will be everything you imagined.  That is if you imagine things such as: sticky floors, tight shirts on men, girls with tube socks on bars, overly gel'd - spiked hair, tight/short dresses, long lines (outside and inside), ear drum bursting bass and CONFETTI. 

You're welcome.
