Last night was a blast! All the servers were amazing, really friendly and attentive but not pushy.  Even the bathroom attendant was really nice! The bathroom was super clean as well.  Loved the Hornito's drinks! I really can't wait to go back. I've been wanting to try here for a couple months and I'm so glad I went last night! I really can't wait to go back!
