Oh El Hefe, just about my favorite bar of all time. This place is like half bar half club and it's awesome, I've never seen anything like it (the closest thing I've ever seen to it would be Coyote Ugly). There are literally gorgeous girls dancing on the bar pouring tequila in people's mouths, it's insanity. All the bartenders/servers are basically supermodels too. They have pretty good food too but sometimes the service takes a little longer (sometimes supermodels aren't the sharpest). But seriously this place is awesome for a night out or even great for happy hour and they have good music! When I lived in Scottsdale I would always take my friends that were visiting to hefe and they absolutely loved it, definitely a go to bar of mine when i'm in town
