I guess I SORTA thought it,was ok, a lot like every other Scottsdale bar, but the vibe was only ok one of the 2 times I went. I like to people watch and noticed you should go with friends if you are under average to average in the looks department. From what I saw the bartenders only give the good service to their friends. We were in a totally sick ride so they liked us fine, I just felt bad for 3 average looking girls that I ended up buying a drink for cause they looked miserable.
