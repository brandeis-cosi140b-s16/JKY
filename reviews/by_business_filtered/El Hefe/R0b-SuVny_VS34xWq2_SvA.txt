I wouldn't even give this place half a star!!

The food was over priced and disgusting. We should have went to Taco Bell or Filibertos.

There were COCKROACHES crawling all over the walls and booths.
We complained to an employee who did nothing to resolve the situation or even try and kill the cockroaches,  he just let them continue crawling around the walls and booths!!

I'm absolutely disgusted and will never ever return to this establishment.

This place needs to be cleaned!! The booth we sat in had left over food in it!!

So gross!!
