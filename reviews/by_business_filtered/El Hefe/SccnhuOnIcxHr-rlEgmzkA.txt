Tried El Hefe again since it was so good the first time.  Once again was meet with a warm smile by Emily.  I already knew it would be a good night. Ordered a margarita.  Just as good as I remember.  Emily went over the menu again and recommended the tacos.  I went with the chicken tacos.

I love the big screens all over the bar.  I can catch the D-backs game and get all of the updates on the other TVs.  

Once again, good food, good service, big screens, Dbacks and Emily.  It's a can't loose situation. 

See ya next week.
