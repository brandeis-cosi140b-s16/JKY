I have generally been a big fan of El Hefe for a while - I would eat lunch there on my break, attend happy hours and head out there for a night on the town. Back in those goo days I would have rated this place at 4 stars. But the last few times I have been here to go out, the guy bartenders have acted like the roided out frat bros they truly are. Not only have I been overcharged for drinks two weekends in a row, but when I confronted the bartender about it this time he started yelling and cursing at me in front of my two friends (I bought 3 drinks) about how wrong I was. Bad experience to say the least. 

The only reason this place isn't a 1 star business now is because the front door man Taylor is a class act and a true professional when dealing with issues as opposed to the primal animals behind the bar. He is the only reason my friends and I might come back in the future.
