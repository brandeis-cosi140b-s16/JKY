The few times I've been to El Hefe have all taken place during late nights, so I was pretty skeptical to come for the food on a weeknight evening.

Came to watch the Suns game and got a prime spot at the bar with no problem. It was Tuesday, so you know what that means..and if you don't, I'll give you a hint: Taco Tuesday. El Hefes TT specials were great--$2 tacos and $3 draft Dos Equis. 

So there's the back story.. now for the food.

Their tacos were SO good. I mean, really, really good. If you go to Barrio Queen for this type of fare, stop. Don't go back there, you're getting ripped off. The tacos here were super flavorful, and they do not skimp on the meat. My new favorite taco spot!

Come here for tacos. And to make it even sweeter, come here on a Tuesday so you can get 'em for 2 bucks.
