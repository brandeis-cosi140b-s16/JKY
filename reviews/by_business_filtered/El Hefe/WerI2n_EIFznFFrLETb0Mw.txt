Other than the imposing "you need to start partying now" mentality that is endemic to the scene that is El Hefe, The vibe here is pretty cool when not bro-crowded (or "browded" if I may make up a term). 

Food is decent but the kitchen can back up quick-- if every table is taken during the day, it might take upwards to an hour before your food will arrive.

And I'm pretty sure the bar forces its employees to dance on the bar countertops and booths... *cow prodding the girls* "You stay up there an dance and feed those men that cheap tequila!"
