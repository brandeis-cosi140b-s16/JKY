For lack of better words I was very disappointed. When we got there we had plenty of time to order a drink during happy hour but were told there would be a 10 to 15 minute wait till they could seat us. They basically held a line didn't allow anybody else to get in for happy hour even when there is open seating on the patio, not cool. When we finally did order food they messed up and placed an order for a taco not a torta, not sure how you confuse the two. And I ordered the spicy margarita which I've ordered it in the past in Scottsdale it was delicious and spicy the one I ordered in Tempe was bland no flavor and not even a hint of heat. I have been warned that the bartenders were not up to par but I  usually make my own judgement and this validated that. I'd like to go back and give it a second try but there was just so many negatives in the small amount of time we were there I don't know if its worth my time.
