Got the free chips and guacamole through yelp and it was so yummy that I wanted more chips and dip...so we ordered the queso and salsa too.  All yummy!  The steak fajitas were delicious and the staff was wonderful.  The Cadillac margarita went down and my husband really liked the salty chihuahua margarita.  We finished things off with free shots from the manager.  Success for this old married couple's date night!
