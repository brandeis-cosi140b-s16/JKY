Went here to use a local dines coupon, otherwise I don't think we would have ever gone here.
Greeted by a friendly person, who sat us in a booth (first lead us to a table and I saw the taps at the booths and wanted to try that!!).  Small place with everything opened up to the patio, the weather was perfect.
Very good service from our waitress, with a good explanation of the taps, happy hour, and menu.  Speaking of the menu, it is a short menu that is somewhat hard to read.  We could tell we were going to be hard pressed to spend the $30 worth of coupon we had!!  
I ordered a salad (very large) and mushroom taco (very small).  It all filled me up and tasted great.  Hubby ordered chicken torte aka sandwich which was good and spicy enough.
This is definitely a hip place for young folks!  We were there early but were warned they expected a huge crowd (Thanksgiving Eve) later on.  
We enjoyed pouring our own beers (happy hour prices are very good!), however when the bill came, our waitress had failed to charge us for the beers!  We had to get her attention again and have her ring up the proper amount (which turned out be under $2 a beer!)  Of course using a coupon we tipped according to the full price, and we were very satisfied with the service.
The biggest drawback for me was..............smoking is allowed out on the patio and the place is small, so we had to smell this during our meal and I am allergic to smoke!!  Plus the music was very loud and we couldn't converse much.  
However it was a fun experience and different.  We left still feeling like we didn't get our Mexican food fix.
