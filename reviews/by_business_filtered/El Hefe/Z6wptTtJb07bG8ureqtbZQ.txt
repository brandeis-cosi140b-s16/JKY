In town for a networking event and decided to stop by for lunch. It wasnt really crowded which was nice but the bartender was cool and prompt with our drinks/food. I ended up ordering the chips with guacamole which I thought was really good and the 3 taco lunch special with beef cheek, duck, and al pastor tacos and I was a fan of all three. Like I said, it wasnt packed so I cant relate with others that have had issues but I would def go back again.
