Only giving one star because I have to. I do not make statements on racial issues, but tonight was very eye opening to me. A group of us (mixed races) flew in from SF for the weekend. We tried to get into this bar and were refused for the one guy that had a "white" t-shirt (he's black). I would not have a problem with this if it was a general rule that was applied to everyone. But from the entrance, we could see several men with white shirts on. When asked about it, we were told we needed to pay $800 for a table to be allowed in like them. Being me, I went to the side of the bar and asked a random man in a white shirt standing on the side if he had paid $800 for a table.... He laughed and asked what I was talking about. And then I had a security guard (from that same bar) tell me that what I thought I saw was correct and he saw it every night, but he didn't own the place so there was nothing he could do... 
This is not a place I would want to spend my money anyways. Just felt the need to share because I believe of you don't, your just part of the problem.
