Just moved to the area, and headed down to Mill ave to get into some trouble. El Hefe had good music, a lot of beautiful girls, and all the booze a man could ask for. All in all it was a lot if fun, and the people were very nice. 

We went there again during the day and had some tacos, the food was very tasty, the bartender/waitress was awesome, and the price was very reasonable. Go check it out!
