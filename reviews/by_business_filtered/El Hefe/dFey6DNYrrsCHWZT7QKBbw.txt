This place used to be great. Went for late lunch. Slow service, pretentious bar tenders (wow you make $60K, gee you so rich!) and a bit outdated. 

Walked out after 5 min..  this place won't get my money, nope.

Looks like management cares enough to respond and contact me. Manager Erik provided his cell and I will call him. I used to like El Jefe and want them to succeed. More to come..
