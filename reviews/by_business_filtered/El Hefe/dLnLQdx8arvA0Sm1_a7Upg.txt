I came here on a Friday night around midnight and there wasn't a cover. This place was PACKED. Felt like I was in a sardine can. If you want to dance, good luck, because the dance floor was crowded the entire night. My friends and I tried dancing, but there simply wasn't enough space so we couldn't enjoy it and went to the patio. The patio was great though, lots of space, seating, and even games. There's this bean bag tossing game at the end of the patio - some guys wanted to play so we split into teams and it was a lot of fun! 

I like that there's also girls on the bar that give free shots if you come up and open your mouth. Crazy stuff. Then there's seating inside if you don't want to go to the patio. This place is like a gigantic bar with a tight dance floor, that's the best way to explain it. 

The bathroom situation is very unique. So you wait 5-10 minutes in a boys & girls line  and a security guard allows one guy or girl to come in when a guy or girl comes out accordingly, just like the teacher would in elementary school - wait your turn boys and girls! Then, once you're in you have to wait in a normal line at the bathroom stalls. The bathrooms are gross, not polished or clean, just dingy and unkept. There's a giant mirror there though to fix your makeup or check yourself. Then the sinks are outside with soap which is a walkway so that's impractical. And finally, when you're done you're out of that chaos and into the dance floor chaos - one tornado after the other. 

Yeah, too crowded for my taste. Also the DJ wasn't very good unless you like oldies and 80's dance and hip hop. It's a nice place to hang out with friends on the patio, but inside the establishment is crazy and definitely not for me.
