Mr. T dancing on the bar on weekends is fun to see. Dancing bar- not chill.  Techno, and some Latin music.  Avg priced drinks for old town.  The girls doing beer bongs for ppl on the bar- cool to see but It feels like a college flashback.  The crowd was rude, snobby. Very much felt like I was in a BIG FRAT HOUSE PARTY.  The bouncers were nice.  :)  If you want to avoid the LONG ass line, have a girl with you and ladies have your cleavage out and hair extensions in!
