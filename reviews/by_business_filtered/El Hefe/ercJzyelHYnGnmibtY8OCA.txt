El Hefe was surprisingly busy for a Sunday at 4pm. I didn't expect to walk into a raging party but it was fun. The crowd was pretentious but entertaining. Almost every time I used the bathroom a few girls would walk out of the handicap stall. I wonder what they were doing in there? Happy hour just started when I showed up so I decided to try drinks I've never had before. My favorite was the loaded beer its a corona with a shot of citrus Bacardi. I love the decor here its very girly. I'll be back!
