Went here pre Livewire show 10/21/15. The service was good, but the food was meh. Ordered the Elote Dip and was not impressed. I don't know if it was to be served hot/warm, but cold it was. Tasted like eating creamed corn straight from a can. My sisters and I shared the 3 taco plate with each of us trying a different taco. Mine was the shrimp one and again it was served cold and I think there was one shrimp in there. The other tacos my sisters had also were cold. 

The location of El Hefe is great with lots of potential, but I would not make this a must go back to for myself or friends.
