This place was a ---- show.
Not very organized or clean and the staff was overtly and unnecessarily rude. 

While I thoroughly enjoyed the fact that there was no cover and the drink prices were decent, the negatives definitely outweighed the positives for me, here. 

Though this place is quite large, it definitely didn't feel like it. If the bar and patio area was not at capacity, it had to be pretty darn close. I couldn't even lift up my arm to drink my beer because it was either close to being knocked out of my hand or even better, my arms were pinned against a number of sweaty strangers.The music choice was not the best and the layout is generally not friendly to people looking to wander and mingle. 

If you don't enjoy being shoved into tiny or poorly lit corners and you dislike pop club remixes of songs, this is definitely not the scene for you. I suggest you get your kicks elsewhere.
