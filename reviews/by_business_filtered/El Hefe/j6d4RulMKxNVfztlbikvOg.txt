I've always felt like El Hefe Scottsdale was a stuck up bar that didn't need to be. This is one of the few places in all of Scottsdale that has ever questioned my attire - and I am usually the one in the group that get accused of dressing above the occasion. So how I got flagged, I don't know... especially since the bouncers were letting their friends inside with flip-flops and cut-off shorts while I was wearing nice jeans and a button up.

Once inside I've never been wowed by the prices either. I'd say they are again a bit too high for what they are (or maybe I don't know what they are), especially when you can go next door to Majerle's and pay half the price on nearly every drink you order.
