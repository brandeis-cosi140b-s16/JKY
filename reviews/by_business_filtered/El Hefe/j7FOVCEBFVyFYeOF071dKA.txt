I loved Canteen so much better than this place. During the DAY and at NIGHT-this place is obnoxious. The service was horrible, the staff was rude and stuck up. I didn't have the best time here at all. My friend and I waited at the outside bar patio during regular business hours....20 minutes went by and the bartender didn't even acknowledge us. He was too busy talking to his buddies at the other side of the bar. We walked out of that place so fast, but before we left we made sure to talk to the hostess about our issue. I, nor my friend will be returning here.
They did however have good music and the restaurant and bathroom were clean!
