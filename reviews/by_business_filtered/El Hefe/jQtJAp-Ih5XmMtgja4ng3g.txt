Try ran out of champagne for the $0.10 mimosa refills. As a result of this they told us they would comp us a round of drinks. The service was extremely slow and when the bill finally came they did not comp the drinks they said they would and added 20% gratuity for our party of six. We asked to speak to a manager and no one ever came except the server. I don't have a problem with gratuity included, however if you're going to add 20% to the bill I expect speedy service and a manager to come to our table when requested.
