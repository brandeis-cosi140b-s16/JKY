This place is cool but it gets PACKED during the weekends so get there early. Its a small place. 

We sometimes come here when they have the UFC fights, which is no cover which is a plus. Their beergaritas are great and so are there tacos. 

But we usually leave after the fights since you barely have room to breath.
