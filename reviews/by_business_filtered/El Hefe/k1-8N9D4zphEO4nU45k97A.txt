STILL a sh*t house. The decor, style and menu is nothing different from any other bar in the area but whatever. The reason for ONE star is because there was a cockroach in my friend "M" margarita drink. The worst part is it was in the ice and didn't realize it til it was drank. 
She was furious and I was hoping not to cause a scene so after being ignored by both bartenders when asked for the manager I finally saw her walking by and waitress confirmed it was her.
I told the manager about the situation and that we are incredibly pissed off BUT all we wanted was our money back and her to take care of the roach problem in the ice.
She did give us a refund and said she apologize for the situation. I told her that the ice needs to be dumped out from the bin completely. This is standard in any restaurant especially for things like this and broken glass. She disagreed with the assessment and walked away. 
We left the place but stayed outside to see if they would dump the ice. We hung on the corner for about 45min talking to friends we met up with and the ice was never dumped.
In case anyone hasn't heard, the Public House Bar next door, the one shut down, got a F health review. Why? They have a HUGE roach infestation. El Hefe shares the same building AND their kitchen shares a wall with the old Public House.
Just pass this place up. There are so much more  friendlier and clean establishments nearby. 
Damn roach...never seen that before in my life. Won't go back. TRY SCOTTSDALES location if you want to try this place. Might have better luck there.
