If I have to choose a Hefe, I prefer the one in Scottsdale but I think there are better places to be than Hefe in Scottsdale and in Tempe. They're both crazy packed.
The line is usually pretty long Thursday-Saturday and you're going to be rubbing a lot of shoulders and other body parts against people when you try and move around. Be prepared. If you don't like being close to people and you're not assertive, you're never getting anywhere in there. It's generally a very drunk, sort of trashy young crowd but what else are you on Mill for anyways?
El Hefe is the classic college club crowd and it needs to be experienced by everyone at least once in their life, but it's definitely not my first choice.
Also lots of people try to jump the patio fence while they're waiting in line...Don't.
