I love giving great reviews... Sadly, we also have to be honest and give bad. Took some friends there today. Supposedly it was the "hype" (sadly over).  Upon entry, the space was clean but crowd was more like gorillas hitting on helpless fawn. Yet the fawn were sitting on the bar. Not at, but ON. We sat outside (no hostess) so we just sat. Turns out there was a trainee/trainer for us. Neither had a clue as to "gluten free" including the standard table chips and salsa. Ordered a blended marg (NO Blender, "it broke"). Tacos and salsa great!!!  beer was beer. food was served fast and warm. Again, love the food - def a 3-4.5 on food. But after 19 minutes, we still were not table touched by either the trainee or trainer. There was only 7 table occupied. SAD. but I guess when you hire looks over ability, we should not expect much. Then again, I should know better in the area it is located in. Now, I know El Hef opened not too long ago, but with Hi-FI (a newer more gorilla like venue) the crowd must must explore new territory. El Hefe is "New kid on the block is now the red headed step child" But, give it 12 months and Hi-Fi will take that title. 

Back to point here. in short, if you are looking to be seen, go to either, maybe grab some food. If you are looking for a memorable experience of the good kind, there are 100 options within walking distance.
