A trip back to Tempe, and I was looking for a place I remembered from before, Canteen.  It's now become El Hefe's.  They've done some renovating, and more patio space out front.  The staff is friendly, although, a little like Hooter's girls.  Service was very very slow, food was great, $2 tacos very good.  I would look around a little in the area before stopping here, but...give it a try and decide for yourself.
