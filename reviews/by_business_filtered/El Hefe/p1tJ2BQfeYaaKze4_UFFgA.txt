The atmosphere on this Sunday was explosive. The staff was extremely accommodating, and constantly checked to see if needed anything, including the security. My waitress Kennedy was very engaging and energetic. I forgot to inform them of my food allergy and when the food arrived they insisted on replacing it. Overall a fantastic experience. It seems they worked on their synergy.
