Recently had a Wonderful lunch experience with friends and can't wait to go back! Kelsey was our waitress and very attentive. Ice cold draft beers and a delicious margarita with cucumbers - super refreshing! We shared Ceviche Tostada's, carne asada fries and the amazing El Hefe burger with jalape√±o marmelade.... Delicious!!!
