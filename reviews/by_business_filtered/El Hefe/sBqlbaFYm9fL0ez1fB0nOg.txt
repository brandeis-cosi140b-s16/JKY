My roommate and I were looking for a new place to try for dinner before a night out in Old Town.  We got to El Hefe at 8PM on a Saturday night.  We were quickly seated.  The music was so loud, we could hardly hear each other.  Typically a restaurant/bar doesn't bump up the music to that level until after 9 when more drinkers arrive.  We decided to try the Mexican Mule (being huge fans of the Moscow Mule).  We ordered chips and salsa as an appetizer.  I ordered the quesadilla for my meal and my roommate selected two carnitas tacos.  Our drinks arrived and the ginger beer in them was completely flat.  They were basically watered down tequila.  Undrinkable.  We asked if we could swap them out for something else.  The waitress complied.  As we waited for our replacement drinks, our main entrees came out.  Within 5 minutes, our chips and salsa arrived.  Another 10 minutes passed and finally our drinks arrived.  The delivery of the meal was a little backwards, but we were hungry.  The tacos were reported as "really good."  My quesadilla consisted of three mini corn tortillas stuffed with some chicken and cheese and folded in half.  Not what I was expecting, but they were OK.  Someone described it as the new Pink Taco.  I would say it's a cross between Pink Taco and American Junkie.  Will definitely return for some afternoon day drinking.
