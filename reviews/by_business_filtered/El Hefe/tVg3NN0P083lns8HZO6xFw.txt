My first experience here was awful. But my friend told me that I HAD to try El Hefe Tempe again! I was surprised at how quickly my mind changed. Our waitress was so sweet and the food was delicious!! I have to say, el hefe is now one of my favorite spots to eat at on Mill. Glad I gave this place another chance!
