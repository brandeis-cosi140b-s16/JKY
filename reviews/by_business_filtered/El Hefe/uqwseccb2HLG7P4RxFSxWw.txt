I use to like this place when it was the Canteen the music was great, atmosphere was chill, and it was a good place to dance until they turned it into el hefe and tired to turn it into Scottsdale in Tempe! now its overcrowded, bouncers are jerks and racist, drinks are pricey, you can't dance anymore because its overcrowded, and the food sucks. I use to go in there but its pack with mostly with horny dudes and its hard to even get a drink in a 10 min time frame. plus if your not white or a chick they won't let you in because they will find an excuse to not let you in after waiting in line for like 30 mins! I don't recommend this bar unless your white and your jeans are girl jeans tight because the bouncers are horrible and are racists just because the color of the skin. I notice they let white people in with shorts, tanks, basketball shoes, jerseys, and baggy pants but minorities are more restrict because they don't like them in there Establishment.
