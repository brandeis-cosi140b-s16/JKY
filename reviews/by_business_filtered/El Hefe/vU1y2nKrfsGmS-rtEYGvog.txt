The Boss? Seriously? This place is a mess. Went there today and it wasn't overly busy. Short line out front.  We waited 1/2 for a table. They text us, we showed up and got a table. Then the fun began. Hostess came over to tell us to get back in line.  Said we jump past people and took the table. We explained the reservation and she said oh okay, I didn't know. She then took our order of drinks and appetizers and left. 20 minutes later a waitress comes over and wants to take our order. We explain once again. Wait another 10 minutes, and nothing. Total of 30 minutes of my life I will never get back. All 3 of us got up and left. Walked over to Z Tejas where it's always good. Won't be back. Ever!
