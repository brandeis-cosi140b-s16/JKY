The place is not too bad within the general douchebaggy community. The problem of this place is the staff!!! The girls in the bar are there spotting the potential big tippers, I don't blame them but please.... I spent a good while with my card in my hand waiting for my order to be taken while the girls were attending all the boys around me... Fed up, I turned to my husband and told him to try to order himself. He took my place in the bar and within maybe 2 min he was back with drinks for everybody!!!! Shameful!!!
But the worst part was at the end... we ordered our drinks and without previous notice from the bar, once we got served and payed of course, this bouncer arrived with the worst manners ever, shouting to us to get out of there. We were really shocked since we were just two couples, quite calm compared with the rest of the audience, not really trouble makers... We told him that if they were not going to let us finish the drinks they shouldn't have sold them to us, right?  Well the bouncer started shouting even more at us and being incredibly rude, we left the place before things would go worse... Horrible experience, never again!
