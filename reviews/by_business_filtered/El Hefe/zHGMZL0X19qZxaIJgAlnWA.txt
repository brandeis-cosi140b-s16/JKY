El Hefe is a great addition to the already wild Mill Ave atmosphere!! I really enjoy the Margaritas and people watching on the front patio! The service is good, and the girls look good too! My friends and I go here a lot on the weekends, and sometimes to day drink! 

It gets extremely busy on the weekends so you better WATCH OUT when paying with a card!! My boyfriend was double charged $79.00 when he told the server to split the tab with our friends (even though they both signed their receipts)! Beware and check those bank statements!!
