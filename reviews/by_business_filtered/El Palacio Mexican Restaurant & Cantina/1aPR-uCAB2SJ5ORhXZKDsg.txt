I get the opportunity to travel extensively and I've come here once before and I had the beach dip, that's what brought me back honestly. I came around noon today and it was not really busy. The service was timely and appropriate for a restaurant.

My waiter, Chris was great. He made sure my time here was pleasant even though when I first was seated it was next to the window light which I hate but he quickly got me a good spot. He was very respectful and helpful and it didn't feel tip based which is awesome.

The one draw back is the staff don't seem to have a break area or choose to hang in one area alot. Makes it a bit awkward looking over at someone in uniform and on their phones or doing paperwork. 

The food was great, portion sizes are above average. They've also got a cool salsa bar where you can grab as much as you want on top of what's served. 

Overall I'd recommend to any visiting the area.
