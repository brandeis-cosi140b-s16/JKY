We went here a long time ago and didn't ever want to go back. We then got invited here by some friends and went. In a year the food and service has rebounded. We enjoyed our meals and the service was pretty good too! 

Everything was clean and you couldn't really find much to complain about. If its the same owners I am going to guess it was just an off night when we came before, we will be back for sure now!
