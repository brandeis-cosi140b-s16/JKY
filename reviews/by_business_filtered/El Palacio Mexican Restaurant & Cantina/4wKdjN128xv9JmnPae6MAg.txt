My husband and I stopped in before we went to see a movie. We had already had dinner so we only stopped in for a cocktail and some deserts. 

We sat on the patio which was really nice. We were the only ones sitting at the patio, so we were worried that we would be forgotten about but the service was still rather good.

He had a beer and I had a frozen strawberry margarita. The margarita was slightly watered down and could have used a bit more strawberry to it. My husband tried a beer called Victoria which actually wasn't bad at all. I also ordered a frozen ice cream. I went with the vanilla ice cream. The presentation was lovely and I enjoyed the deep fried ice cream. 

I did hit up the bathroom before we headed out to the theater and I was very impressed with the bathroom. The women's bathroom has a large full sized mirror and the handicapped/nursing bathroom is very large and has ton of room. 

Overall, it was a nice experience and we may end up going back for dinner on our next date night.
