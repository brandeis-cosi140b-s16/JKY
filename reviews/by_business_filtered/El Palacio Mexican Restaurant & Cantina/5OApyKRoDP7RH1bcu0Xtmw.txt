The salsa is watery and almost no taste. The proportions are also a little too small, but otherwise, it's an OK restaurant if this is the only Mexican restaurant near you. I liked the enchiladas. The waiter was not attentive, never came back after giving us our food. He seemed rushed getting our orders in. My mom ordered the taco salad and she didn't like it. The chicken is supposed to be grilled, but looked like it was boiled or baked without any seasonings.
