We went last night for Mom's birthday and had a good dinner. I was pleased with the service from the waiter who another reviewer referred to as a jerk - we sat just outside the bar area, had prompt service, were provided silverware without asking for it, had the specials explained to us. He went so far as to help us get a little extra food for free with the special and upgraded my mom's marg for her birthday.

The marg itself was good and the place has a good selection of local beers all on Happy Hour.

The food was good, love the rice and the beans - nothing dry or overcooked here. The chips came out fresh and crisp and warm. The only complaint I had was that my "empanada" came out in a folded over tortilla and not as a dumpling of sorts, which was really disappointing. I like the breadiness of an empanada - if I wanted a tortilla dish I would have ordered a quesadilla or another taco. The filling was good though and I enjoyed the salsa and the pico de gallo that came with the chips.

We were a little disappointed that the salsa bar is only available Tuesdays and Sundays, but we'll just have to come back. My dad swears by the habanero hot sauce.
