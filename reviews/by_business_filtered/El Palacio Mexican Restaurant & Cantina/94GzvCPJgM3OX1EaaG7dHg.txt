First time here and it's Taco Tuesday! Great drink specials and great food! We ordered the carnitas nachos, three tacos and my hubby had a house margarita. The nachos were good, and the tacos were amazing.  The house margarita wasn't bad either. We enjoyed this place and our server was very nice and helpful. We will definitely try it again.
