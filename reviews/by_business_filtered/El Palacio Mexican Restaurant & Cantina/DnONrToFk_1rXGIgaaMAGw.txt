I really love this place.  I love their happy hour - you get a little appetizer on the house as well as a little dessert at the end!  The bean dip and salsa are AWESOME.  The sangria is VERY good, although it is a little too sweet sometimes.  Everything I've ordered here has always been delicious.  

Only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because the service can be kind of slow/spotty at times.  Otherwise I love me some El Palacio.
