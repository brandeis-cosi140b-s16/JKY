Well, it used to be Long Horn steak house. So hey new Mexican place. Tried it out for dinner the other night. The menu is pretty much what you expect from typical Mexican joint. Nothing interesting besides your typical Mexican fare. Got the complementary chips. They are alright, on the salty side. I ordered a dish of pork with green chile (the name escapes me at the moment). It came with soup. Your standard veggie soup really. Whoa, horribly over salted. Same comment from the gf. With my entree it's not bad, and once again OVER SALTED. It's like the cook over salts every single item on the menu! OMG! And I love salty food! I crave salt! I typically eat stuff more saltier than most people. But yikes! I couldn't even take that! They need to fix that ASAP. A lot less salt and it'll be an OK Mexican place. I think I'll go to Abuelo's instead.
