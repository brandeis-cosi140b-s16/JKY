The Placeebo
By The Rue

I finally checked out El Palacio,
I didn't drink but I did eat though, 
Chips and salsa and a few tacos,
Next time I'll try the desert burrito.

The refried beans are homemade, 
Motorhead sings Ace of Spades,
My hi-top Vans are made of suede,
I had my first kiss in the fifth grade. 

Tuesday tacos are just a buck,
When you're feeling down on your luck,
This place can restore your pluck,
"Cause I'm the nurse who likes to....." -Ferris Bueller's Day Off

Get your tortillas in corn or flower,
I'm not sure what it's like at happy hour,
I'm sure it's anything but dour,
Before you come please take a shower. 

Como?
