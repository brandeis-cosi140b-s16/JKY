My husband and I dined at El Palacio last night.  We usually go to Arribas, but thought we'd try something new.  We started with the house margaritas, and of course chips, salsa, and bean dip.  All of these were ok.  My husband had the Mexican flag, and I had the Verde enchilada combo (chicken) with a pork tamale.  Both of us commented right away that everything was very SALTY.  I can't say much more about the taste because everything was so salty it just overpowered any other flavor.  On the plus side, I didn't leave feeling stuffed like I usually do at a mexican restaurant, because I didn't feel compelled to eat everything on my plate.  And the mini churros with whipped cream were nice.  Service was fine, no complaints, but the food was not worth coming back for.
