My rating of five stars is not for the food, it is for the customer service that Ray gave my friend and I. We stopped in today and walked into an empty restaurant. I ordered the seafood chimi which was not so great when it came to the table. Obviously Ray was paying attention to us because he ended up comping our entire meal when we were done. I just want to thank him for being so kind and offering his apologies for the food mishap. Way to go Ray, I may just give El Palacio a second chance some time!
