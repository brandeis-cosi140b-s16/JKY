I've read some of the reviews and am not surprised at some of the harsh comments, the truth is they are well deserved. We've been hear twice, the first time during their first month of being open which offered slow chaotic service, bland food and staff that seemed really put out to be helping us. After this experience we knew we didn't want to go back. 

Fast forward to the day before Thanksgiving 2013, after a busy afternoon and a taste for Mexican we agreed that surely after all this time they've gotten over their opening problems. Nope! Still just as bland, chaotic and full of staff that seemed unhappy to have to serve us. 

When they first opened we were excited to have a full service Mexican restaurant nearby, now as we drive by it daily it's a sore reminder of what could have been. We find ourselves missing Longhorns Steakhouse that used to be there.
