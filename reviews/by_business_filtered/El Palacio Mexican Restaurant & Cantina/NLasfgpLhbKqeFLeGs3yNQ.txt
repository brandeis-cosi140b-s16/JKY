Went here for dinner last night with my GF and her brother, SIL, and SIL's mother from Iowa.  We had the typical Sonoran Mexican foods for dinner -- burritos, chimichanga, enchilada, rice and beans, etc. etc.  One person had the taco salad.  We had a couple of beer and a few margaritas.  Chips and salsa were good and as much as you want.  Service was excellent.  Prices on the higher side, but not outrageous.  All in all, we were satisfied.
