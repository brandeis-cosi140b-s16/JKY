The Good:  The Salsa is pretty good, they give you both a hot and a mild with your chips.  They also provide a bean dip that isn't bad either.    

The Bad:   The food is nothing special.   I got the shrimp burrito and all it in it were bean, rice and five shrimp.  For $12-$13 bucks i was expecting a little more.    My wife had the carne asada tacos and wasn't that impressed either.

We went on a Friday night and they said it would be 20min wait.  No big deal it is a Friday night I thought.  But when we were finally sitting down half the place was empty.    So i didn't really get why we had to wait.

The waiter was unorganized, he gave us a check that had items on it we didn't even order.   To top it all off, its was really hot in there.   Its Arizona in the middle of summer for god sake.  If your going to serve sub-par food at least keep the place cool.
