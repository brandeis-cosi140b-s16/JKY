The first time I went, I thought maybe they just had an off day. I wasn't impressed.

It must have been a year between that first visit and the second. Well, it was during that second visit I remembered why in the hell I waited a year to return.

First of all, the service was less than average. I'm all for authentic Mexican food, but my server was so difficult to understand, and understand me, I was wondering if I actually had been transported south of the border.

It was NOT busy when we were there, but we were constantly looking for someone to help with the many issues we had during our meal. 

They screwed up my kids burrito, (how tough is it to NOT serve it enchilada style).

My other son ordered beef tacos, he loves tacos, took one bite and was like YUCK! I said seriously, it can't be that bad, so I - being the dad who was raised not to waste food took a taste. - YUCK is right. How can you screw up ground beef? Well, I suppose if you can't serve a burrito plain, ground beef is way to tough to cook and season properly.

I ordered off the healthy menu and the piece of meat that came out on my plate would have made a nice treat for my Labrador, but not for me. Now maybe it was because I waited 5 minutes before trying my steak that caused it to suck so bad - but I was hoping to get my son a new meal, (which never happened btw) because by the time the waiter came back, my boy was so stuffed on chips and salsa, he didn't want anything else.

AND - the drinks were never refilled or topped off. AND - they didn't even offer to take the tacos off my bill. Hmmm. Customer satisfaction 101 me thinks???

All in all, I will NOT be going back here. El Palacio means the Palace...in my judgement, the King and Queen need to get their kingdom in order.
