This was the worst Mexican food I have ever eaten!  When you arrive you get chips, two tomato based salsas (one mild, one hot) and a bean/meat dip that seriously looks like baby diaper remnants!  The chips are more on the thick side, and the salsa's are a little bland.  

I ordered a lunch special with three burritos (all dry-no sauces on top).  One was pork, which was very tough, grizzly and tasted like it had been reheated from the night before.  Then came the machaca burrito.  The machaca was ok, but nothing to write home about.  It did have about 3 strips of peppers and onions in it.  Finally came the bean and cheese burrito.  Not sure how they prepare their beans, but it is just not right!!  

I am glad my lunch special was so inexpensive, as I would have been mad if I spent more than the $6 that I did!  I'd recommend skipping this joint and heading to Macayo's or Serrano's if this is the style of mexican food you like!
