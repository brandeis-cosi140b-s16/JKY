Love this place!  The bartenders and food are excellent.  My only gripe with this place is that every time, and I mean EVERY time I have eaten in the dinning room, I have had horrible service.  The food is still fantastic, but the service goes right out the door along with my patience...  So my advice, sit at the bar or at one of the tables in the bar.  They are in the process of builidng an outside patio, I PRAY that the service is like the bar so I will be able to enjoy the outside this winter, but seeing that it is connected to the dining room... my hopes are very low.
