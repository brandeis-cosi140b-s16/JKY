I will be adding this place to one of my favorites.  The food and beer were great.  I usually not a big fan of the beans and rice, but theirs were fresh and real good.  They have a good selection of food and beer including some craft beers.  My wife had the El Padriono Burrito and I had the Seaside Delight with a Lumberyard IPA.  Loved it all.
