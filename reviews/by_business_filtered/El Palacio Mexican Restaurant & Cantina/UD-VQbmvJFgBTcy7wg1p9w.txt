If I could give this zero stars I would. This place is disgusting. Honestly, we are open to different kinds of food and establishments, but this place can't even make the basics right- cheese enchilada had a piece of cheese stuffed in the middle and not even melted, the tacos were horrible, and the service for a slower (6 tables total there) late-lunch time was ridiculous. Save your money and time.
