Stopped in to try something different. The salsa and bean trio served had great flavor, the chips were fresh and just right. I ordered the Verde Enchilada with pork tamale combo and my wife ordered the carne asada burrito. While the flavor of the enchilada was pretty darn good the masa of the tamale was ridiculously thick, I would have been able to make three proper tamales with that quantity. The burrito was a massive disappointment, thick chunks of steak in a very flat burrito. Again I stress that the flavors were fantastic but the quantity was pathetic for the cost. Overall- not planning on being a repeat customer.

As someone stated before, I'll be surprised if they last another year. For $10.00 more, head across the street to Texas Roadhouse.
