I like this place a little more everytime I go there. On Mondays they have killer margarita specials and on Tuesdays they have $1 tacos. I'm not talking about crappy dollar tacos that you get at Taco Bell neither, these are delicious, crispy and loaded with goodness. The machaca are my favorite but they are all really good. They bring you chips and salsa with bean dip as soon as you sit down. Their hot salsa is really good and the chips are nice and hot when they come out. This is gonna be one of my new hangouts as they have NTN trivia, reallly cool bartenders, great food and they are close to my house. Score!
