Not sure if this is the right place. Address might be off, but it's been a long time since I've done anything right. Gunshot. Inexpensive. Delicious. In an area of so many chains and theme establishments, this place has a great southwest vibe. Wyatt Earp and family would cum all over the place if they ate here. Great hard shell tacos and various dips for nachos. Also saw a sexy Latin chick at the bar on Christmas Eve there with two of her friends. I was with my brother and a friend. Was gonna say hello a few sips into my drink but the girls settled up and left pretty quick. I'm not that ugly so they must have had to be somewhere. If I ever see her again, it's game on.
