About your average Mexican food place..

The chips, Salsa & bean dip were all good. And can't complain about the food. I ordered the Shredded beef Chimi. Not to much filling but was tasty. Service was on the slow side. We didn't get any refills on Drink or chips/salsa. 

**PLEASE STOP** using your cups to scoop the ice with!!!! Every cup was extremely chipped. Not to mention its against health code!
