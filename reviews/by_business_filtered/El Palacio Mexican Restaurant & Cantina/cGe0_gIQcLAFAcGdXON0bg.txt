Honestly I have been here many times. The food brings me back not the service. I come in on Thursday nights for $2 tacos. They close at 9pm but have the Salsa bar shut down by 8pm. The server doesn't even ask if you want any toppings on your tacos that only come with meat. The tacos are good. A little too much grease on the tortillas for my taste. They really could put their guest service FIRST and build sales but really NO effort to do so. Just ok is good with them. Disappointing.
