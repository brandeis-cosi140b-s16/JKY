This place has officially made it on my list of places to go while visiting Arizona! You really can't go wrong with mexican food but especially when you have great service! Jesse was our server and he did an awesome job keeping up with us. His service was friendly, prompt and, most importantly, enjoyable. The food was great and the cocktails were even better :) I'd highly recommend this place! Thanks Jesse and El Palacio! I'll be back again soon...hopefully!
