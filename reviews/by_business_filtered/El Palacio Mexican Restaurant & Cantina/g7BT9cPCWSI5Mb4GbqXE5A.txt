Terrible service from Rebecca, charged incorrectly for one of our meals (fajitas) and the meat for the fajitas came 10 minutes after the rest of our food so our table was done eating by the time our part member got their food. Our waitress never apologized and rolled her eyes when we had to ask another server for our check. Needless to say, will not return. On a positive note, chips and salsa were good.
