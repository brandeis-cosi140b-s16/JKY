Ok so... I never thought I would give a restaurant only one star. But WTH this was just an CRAP. You walk in and the decor is ok host was pleasant and they had a taco Tuesday special. What could go wrong??? Well... The service was probably the worst we have ever had, I wouldn't feed the tacos to my dog and to top it off the margarita was awful (how the hell do you screw up a margarita? Well ask them lol). Sorry to say run fast run far I would rather have tacos from a guy selling them out of his trunk in Tijuana.
