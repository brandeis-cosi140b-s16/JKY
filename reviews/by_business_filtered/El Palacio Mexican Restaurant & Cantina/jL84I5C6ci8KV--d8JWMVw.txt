Not impressed with the service or the food, also we came because of a restaurant.com gift certificate and was informed that they weren't accepting them anymore, even though I had just purchased it today. Our waitress went to check on what could be done, when she returned about ten minutes later she explained that her manager had just left so she couldn't do anything except remove the charge for drinks. I ask what successful restaurant leaves themselves without a manager at 8pm on a Friday? We won't be returning, I suggest eating at any of the other food establishments in the area.
