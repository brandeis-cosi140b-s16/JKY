I can't believe this place doesn't let me carry my .357 Mag in.  That's probably why it took me so long to try this place.  It's difficult to eat at an establishment that doesn't support my 2nd Amendment rights to bear arms while eating chips 'n guacamole.  

Last night I finally ventured in.  Despite feeling unsafe and under protected (and after praying really hard to not get shot by the taco robber), I went in with my wife (egads, she also was not allowed to carry a firearm!) and partook of delicious chips, salsa that actually had a very nice flavor, decent guac (it'd been better with a little black powder dashed in), tortilla soup (which in all honesty wasn't very tasty until I dumped a whole bowl of the spicy salsa in), and carnitas (which were a little too dry).  

Better than the atrocity that is Serrano's.  Not as good as Manuel's (except for the salsa).  Despite my safety concerns and because of its proximity, I'll be back.
