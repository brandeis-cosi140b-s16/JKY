First visit here.  As usual I order the chimi on a first visit to a Mexican place.  It was fine.  Not great, but not bad.  I wouldn't avoid this place, but I wouldn't make a point of visiting again either.

Service was fine (perhaps a little slow).  Food was OK.  Chips were fresh (warm), which I like.  Salsa was fine (nothing special).  

Really rates 2.5 stars, but I don't have that option.  And it's not worthy of 3.
