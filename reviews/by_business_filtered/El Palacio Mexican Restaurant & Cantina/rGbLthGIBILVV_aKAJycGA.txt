It's just not good Mexican food at all. The only way you get good service is to sit at the bar. We still go there to sit at the bar, drink and play trivia, but not for the salsa, cold chips, cold bean dip and blah food.  Unfortunately I can't recommend a better Mexican food place around here either.
