I'm pretty surprised to see all of the negative reviews about this place. 

I go there quite often both by take out and sit down.     I can agree with slow service, especially on salsa refills, it seems to take forever and sometimes not even worth mentioning...   However, their food is pretty good. 

I had an issue tonight with my dinner and the manager took good care of me, replaced my meals even though you could technically say it wasn't their fault.   They didn't question it, they quickly replaced it and sent me on my way.
