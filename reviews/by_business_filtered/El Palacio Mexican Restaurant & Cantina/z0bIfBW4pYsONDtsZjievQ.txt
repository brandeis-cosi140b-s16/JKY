The food here did not meet my expectations for Mexican food; I'm being generous with 3 stars. There was every bit of 5 people in the restaurant and the service was still slow. 

Excited to see chips and salsa, I immediately took a dive. They bring out 2 salsa's mild & mildly spicy (that's a joke) and a bean dip of sorts (a ladle of their refried beans I'm sure). Whoa Lucy! The bean dip was horribly salty. No bueno. 

I tried the shrimp tacos, and for $9  (a la carte) I was quite disappointed. The taco shells had the look and feel of Ortega box shells; I'm sure they were made fresh, but I can't get over how flavorless and grainy they were. The shrimp were hearty though, nice sized. 

Our server, well....never mind.

I would LOVE to find a REALLY good Mexican restaurant. It's sad that I've lived here several years and have YET to find one.
