I don't even want to mark this as a one star. The food arrived cold and the This order and the service provided was atrocious. The delivery was well over an hr and 15mins from time of order. Several items were removed without me being notified as I would have cancelled my order if that was the case along with the horrendous wait time. And the delivery portion was shockingly unprofessional. The delivery guy pounded on my window instead of knocking on my door and was not apologetic at all. Even my neighbor came out after and asked if all was okay as he too was alarmed. I am 120% dissatisfied with this transition and the Un-professionalism that took place.
