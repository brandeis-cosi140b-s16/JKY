2 piece chicken meal is the best deal in town. It's only $3.99, fills you up too.  The chicken is amazing!  It's bright red (don't be afraid just tastes great, not overly spiced) and extremely tasty!  Meal comes with corn or flour tortillas, onions and beans. Though very simple, the beans are killer.  Just go try it for lunch, can't go wrong.
