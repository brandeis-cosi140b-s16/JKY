Tonight was my first time at this restaurant and I must say the food was not only excellent but, with excellent customer service.  We spoke to the son for quite a while and he was such a joy to talk to.  We found out the history of the restaurant. He had such a great attitude. We will definitely come back to this place again. I will refer my friends to come to this place. Pollo Supremo muchisimas gracias por todo. Bien rico!
