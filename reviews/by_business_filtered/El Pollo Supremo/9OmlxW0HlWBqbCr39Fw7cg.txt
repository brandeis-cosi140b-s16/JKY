This is my FAVORITE place! I have been going to El Pollo for 15 years, it's family owned with authentic Mexican food. They have the BEST salsa in the world, their tortillas are handmade and from scratch every day. The only have Chicken and Beef and you can't go wrong with either and if you can't decided they have an option for half and half. They only take cash, but there is a Circle K next door that you can get cash out. Also
