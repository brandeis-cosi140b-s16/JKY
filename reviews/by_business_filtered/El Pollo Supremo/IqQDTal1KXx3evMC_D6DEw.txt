I had read reviews about this place and was really curious to try it out since I was in the area. I'm so glad I did! I ordered a 2-piece chicken combo to-go and a side of grilled jalapenos. I appreciated that the wonderful woman working (who I believe owns this place) was nice and honest--I asked her if the 2 piece was enough for 1 person and she assured me it was plenty. She also didn't try and convince me to order extra sides or drinks. The chicken is really delicious and reminds me of a WAY BETTER fresh version of El Pollo Loco. They give enough tortillas for the whole meal and the overall portion of my 2-piece combo was great for under $5. Also, those jalapenos....yum! My only personal complaints: 1) Although it was lunch time and there were definitely a lot of people eating, I waited for a pretty long time for what I had expected to be a pretty casual/quick meal and was late to a meeting. That said, I will just order to go next time I'm on a time crunch. 2) I like the way the salsa tasted but it looks like it might be canned/some of the ingredients are canned. I grew up with home-made salsa and am pretty judgmental about salsa at Mexican restaurants. It's still yummy, so whatever. Definitely a great place and amazing prices.
