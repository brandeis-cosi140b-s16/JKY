i work in tempe, and this is one of my fave lunch spots!
i usually get the combo with white meat.  i think usually they usually put whatever meat is closest, but you can ask for white meat, and they don't charge extra.
for 8$ i get a ton of food!  a lot of beef, a large piece of chicken, beans, salsa, tortillas and pickled onions.  the chicken is super flavorful!  i LOVE the pickled onions.  they provide a nice addition to the chicken and beef.
my only complaints... cash only!  i never carry it as almost everyone takes CC now.  I don't go here as much as i would for that reason alone.
