Delicious chicken barbecue! Although time was a factor, it took 5 minutes for me to be assisted. Although, the food was worth the wait. I ordered 1/2 chicken that came with a choice of flour tortillas, pinto beans,
Salsa, and pickled onions. I satisfied my thirst with a refreshing Jamaica drink. I took my food to go as the establishment was a bit crowded. I enjoyed the chicken. It was crisp where it needed to be and still moist! Eating it with tortilla and salsa made it heaven. I'd definitely come back here and highly recommend this place if you enjoy a good Mexican plate.
