HOW DID I NOT KNOW HOW AMAZING THIS WAS? Occasionally, a restaurant comes along that makes me want to run around and bang on the doors of all my friends' houses in Tempe and yell, "WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?!" On the other hand, considering my affinity for delicious well-kept secrets, I suppose I respect that there are places in my neighborhood that I have yet to discover-- and will leave me satisfied and wanting more at the same time! 

OK, to reiterate, this is a hole-in-the-wall. That means you should have no expectations about things looking remotely nice. The first time I walked in, there was a smelly bum asleep on the waiting bench inside. He wasn't hurting anyone though! I thought it was strangely sweet for the staff to let him have a little nap out of the sun... I have simply gotten take out both times, which is quick and painless. Now, a birdie told me that the owners of this place are related to the owners of Restaurant Mexico--which is irrelevant to the food, but it's nice to know about the little connections around town! The talented and tasty apple doesn't fall far from the tree in that family. 

So-- the FOOD. The chicken is marinated in baby kisses and rainbows before it is mesquite grilled, and I hear the onions are pickled in jalapeno juice and vinegar. Together, that makes these two items alone truly the most delightful combination that man has ever known. I definitely recommend extra onions. The beef is nothing to scoff at-- it's seasoned, thinly sliced and tender.  The beans are beans. The prices have gone up recently and the combo plate (chicken, beef, beans, onions, salsa and fresh tortillas) now costs $7.49, while additional 1/4 lb meat options are up to $3.99. I will definitely be a regular from here on out.
