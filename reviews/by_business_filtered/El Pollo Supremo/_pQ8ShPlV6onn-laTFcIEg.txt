Yumm! That definitely hit the spot.

I was a bit confused by their menu, but it's pretty simple. There's not that much to choose from, but everything on there is G O O D!!

I had the combo and 1 dollar soda (free refills). This is a moms and pops shop. I love it!! It totally deserves a 5 star. C'mon ppl!!!
