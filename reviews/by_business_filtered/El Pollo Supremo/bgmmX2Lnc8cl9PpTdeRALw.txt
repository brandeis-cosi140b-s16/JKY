A solid three stars. I was hoping for an american clone of my favorite chicken place in Rocky Point and sadly, this didn't compare. Not even close. However, that Rocky Point chicken is the greatest thing to ever touch my tastebuds and thus leaves very big shoes to fill. The chicken at El Pollo Supremo was a little dry and I really wish there was an option to just get chicken breast instead of the 1/4 chicken that I ordered that was all dark meat. The tortillas served on the side were nice and fresh and I loved the pickled onions. For the price I'm not sure you can find a better lunch. Oh, and David Spade was at the table next to me so I guess what's good enough for celebrities is good enough for me ;)
