My Dad used to come here when he went to ASU and every time he would comes into town, this is definitely a spot we go to. The chicken is so good and perfectly cooked on a grill in the back! [i mean you can see the dude cookin' it up!] None of that already made stuff or cooked on a skillet...no it's a GRILL! The carne asada is so good because once again it is grilled! Their salsa is a tomato base salsa and not really spicy but has good flavor. Their tortillas are basically homemade but are from a local tortilleria in Phoenix. The meal comes with beef, chicken, or a combo, beans and onions! I always ask for a side of rice and grilled jalapenos! Oh and I bring my own lime since they don't have any lol
