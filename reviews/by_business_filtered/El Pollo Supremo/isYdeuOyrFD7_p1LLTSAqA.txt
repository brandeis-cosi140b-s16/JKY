Pollo Supremo leaves you with a wholesome feeling after you eat there.  It is money well spent!  I am vegetarian and usually get rice, beans, tortillas, pickled onion and salsa and it comes out to $4.  My husband gets the quarter chicken and eats it at least twice a week.  Their menu is simple, dishes are delicious and prices are affordable.  You cannot go wrong with Pollo Supremo!
