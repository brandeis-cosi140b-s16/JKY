We stopping in for a quick meal and split a half chicken.  The chicken was very tasty and similar to Tandoori Chicken.  The outside was flavorful and dry-ish while the inside was juicy.  The skin was extra crispy too.  It is definitely some of the best chicken in town.  

We did a little build-your-own tacos with the pickled onion, salsa fresca, pinto beans and corn tortillas.  It was refreshing to find a Mexican joint that didn't bathe their beans in lard.  Two of us split the half chicken and left satisfied.      

We were there at 8 15 and they flipped over the closed sign around 8 30 even though the hours on here say open until 9p.  May want to call ahead if you are trying to get there before close.
