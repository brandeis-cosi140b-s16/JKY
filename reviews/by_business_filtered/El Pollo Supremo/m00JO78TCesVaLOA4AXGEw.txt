I don't care that this place only takes cash. I don't care that the inside doesn't look fancy. I don't care that the menu doesn't have that many options. In my opinion, this is the best Mexican food in all of Arizona maybe even in all of the USA. I grew up on this food. I have been coming here since age 6. I always get the flour tortillas and put the beans, rice, chicken and salsa in them to make a burrito. The taste is heavenly. I have been to many places in Mexico and I have never found anything quite like their amazing chicken and salsa anywhere else. I moved to Miami and the only thing I miss about Phoenix is this place. I fly back just for El Pollo Supremo.
