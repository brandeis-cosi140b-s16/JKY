I almost hate to write this review...

But, here I go.

This place is awesome.  I get excited every time I am on my way there and this feeling has never escaped me for the last 8 years or so.  I try to only go once a month.  
I order the combo, beef and chicken grilled over some beautiful neon red coals tended by a real human being.  It must be hot as hell to stand there and grill all day.  I think that is awesome, the coals and the human.
With their dishes you get some decent beans, good salsa, (expletive) awesome pickled onions and your choice of corn or flour tortilla.  For me flour, always.

Now, I have to write this to give them the props they deserve but I want El Pollo Supremo to stay the hole in the wall it has been all these years and stay awesome.
The last thing they need is the Man vs. Food jerk in there stinkin up the place.

If you visit, live, pass by or get lost in Tempe do yourself a favor and look them up.

Oh yeah, it's cash only.  Deal with it.
