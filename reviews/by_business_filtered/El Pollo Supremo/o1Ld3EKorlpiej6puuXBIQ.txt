It was my first time here, so the nice counter lady said I should try the combo deal for $7.99. I had to minus a star for the carne asada because the majority of pieces were too chewy to consume and some slices had fat on the ends. So with that meat eliminated, I moved on to the chicken, which came in a red version and was the highlight of this joint. The two-piece all-white was one breast and one tiny wing, but I thought i was getting two breasts. I could have used that extra big piece of chicken too because my last of the giant three tortillas had nothing to put into it after the tasty first piece didn't last long. Best side dish was probably the marinated onions and the forementioned tortillas. Crispy skin on the chicken also, so I will return for more pollo por favor.
