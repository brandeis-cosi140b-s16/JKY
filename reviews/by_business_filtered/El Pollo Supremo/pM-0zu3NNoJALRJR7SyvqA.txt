Having been binging on Breaking Bad lately, I set off in search of a good chicken joint.

It's a tiny hole in the wall, so don't expect to eat here, but the prices are reasonable and you get a decent amount of food. I ordered the combo, which comes with grilled chicken, fajita beef, tortillas (corn or flour), beans, and pickled onions. Â¡Muy sabroso! I mopped up every bit with my tortillas, and finished my lunch stuffed and much satisfied.

Believe the hype, you won't be disappointed.
