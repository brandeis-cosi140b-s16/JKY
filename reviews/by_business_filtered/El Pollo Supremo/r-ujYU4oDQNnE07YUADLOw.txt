This place seems like a hole in wall but the food is very good and modest. They have chicken or steak. This chicken is red on the outside and the flavor is great. You can get plates or meals. You get tortillas, some plain salsa, cabbage that is very good, and your meat. I've only been here a few times but if you want something casual and feel like something yummy you can eat with your hands I would recommend it. The prices are very reasonable. You can eat here or take it to go.
