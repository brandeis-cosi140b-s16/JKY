I love this place, reminds me of this small joint in Mexico with amazing food. I always get the half dark meat chicken, 2 jalape√±os asados and corn tortillas, the salsa is tasty and the side of onion are delish... Make a taco and you are set! I only wish they would sell liquor here! That would make this place a gem in the Tempe area!

I honestly don't see why this place has lower than 4-5 stars. Maybe those people don't really like authentic mexican food. Well either way don't pay attention to the star rating... Just stop by and enjoy this amazing food. 

Cash only!!! Or there is an ATM at the smoke shop right next door. 

No picture today as I sat and inhaled my food today. Next time I'm here I'll post a picture.
