The grilled steak was on point since it was made to order. Seasoning was great, came out hot and dare I say best quality of meat for a fast food Mexican shop. Less mystery, more natural in texture and actually a desirable cut.

Wish the chicken had the same juiciness but I can imagine it to be hard to turn around rotisserie that quickly so it had to be pregrilled.  

Rice and beans were on the salty side but the pairing withy the tortilla allowed me to overlook that. Will be back!
