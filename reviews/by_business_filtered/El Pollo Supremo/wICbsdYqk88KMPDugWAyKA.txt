I'm a food purist.  Forget the atmosphere, forget the cash-only policy, forget everything but the taste of combining the right amount of salsa, steak, marinated onions on a tortilla and then taking as big a bite as I can fit.  

Having few offerings has allowed El Pollo Supremo to dominate supreme in what they do.  5 yums.
