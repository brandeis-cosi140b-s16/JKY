El Ranchero is a good staple of Mexican / Southwestern cooking. We were greeted oh s nicely, almost as if we were old friends (although it was our first time). The place is simple with excellent wall painting and as your eyes get to it there is all kinds of knickey knacky (are those good words - probably not is scrabble anyway) things all around the top of the room. The chips came in warm - very nice - and a trip of dipping stuff - two salsas and creamy beans. All very nice and tasty. We split the Triple color enchiladas and all were tasty and the sauces very good. This place could easily be a go to place for locals of Wickenburg
