A really great Mexican restaurant with original and traditional fare. Spotlessly clean and nicely appointed with efficient and friendly service. Modest prices in a strip mall conveniently located equals better than expectations and merited the coveted fifth star. I thoroughly enjoyed my Chile Rellenos  and the shrimp enchiladas special was great. Will return when in town.
