I took my kids to go hiking at the nature preserve and decided to stop for lunch somewhere in town. We stumbled upon El Ranchero and loved it! Our waitress was super nice and attentive and seemed to really love her job :-) The food was very good for the price and I will definitely be stopping in there again the next time we are over that way!
