We came into town late on a Sunday night and wanted to get something to eat.   The front desk person at the hotel recommended this place.   We were greeted as soon as we came into the place and barely had to wait before we were greeted at our table.   Staff was very friendly and food came quick.   All 3 dishes were very good and portions were large.   Definitely recommend.
