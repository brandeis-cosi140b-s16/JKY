On a road trip cross country my daughter& I stopped for a late lunch & were not disappointed!!  The tri colored enchiladas were outstanding!  Authentic with great flavor. We had very great service as well.  Happy hour was from 2-5pm on a Saturday. Strong & delicious margaritas...only $5 for a huge drink!!  Wish we lived closer!
