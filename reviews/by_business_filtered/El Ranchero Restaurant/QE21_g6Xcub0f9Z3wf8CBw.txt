Driving through on the way to Vegas and found this little gem of a mexican restaurant!  We had a DELICIOSO meal of flautas, awesome salsa and bean dip.  The service was friendly, prompt and most importantly the food was authentic.  The salsa even had a kick to it which is hit and miss w mexican restaurants.  I highly recommend this place, it truly was a great experience.  AND the price was more than reasonable.  Orale!
