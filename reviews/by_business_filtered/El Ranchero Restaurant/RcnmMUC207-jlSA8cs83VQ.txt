Looked for good restaurants in Wickenburg, AZ during a quick weekend trip. Picked this one off Yelp and was Overly Impressed with food, service and price. 
Waitress recommended the special, Chicharones, which was tender and full of flavor. Margaritas very good compliment. The whole experience was A+++.
