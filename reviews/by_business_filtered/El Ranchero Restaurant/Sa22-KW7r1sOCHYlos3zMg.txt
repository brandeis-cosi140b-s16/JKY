Thanks, Yelpers! We loved this place. On our way back from a week in Vegas, where we'd been eating expensive, tiny portions of unpronounceable gourmet fare, we were tired, thirsty, hot, and hungry.  No time to leave things to chance... Naturally, we turned to the collective wisdom of Yelp.  
This place was unassuming, with plastic over the tablecloths, folksy-western decor, and a "come on in, pick a seat" greeting style.  No velvet ropes, no snooty hosts eyeing your shoes to see if you're fit to spend your money in their lofty company... So nice. 
Christy was our server, and she was down-home friendly, chatty, and genuinely interested in making sure we were happy with our food. 
Chips were fresh and hot, and served with three sauces: fresh salsa, a fantastic hot sauce/salsa, and a thin & very authenticly beany bean dip.  We ate too much of this goodness. 
I had the #5, taco & tostada. The taco was an honest, legitimate fried Mexican taco, fantastically crunchy & full of juicy shredded beef, then laid on its side, covered in a flavorful red sauce, and then sprinkled with crumbly queso.  The tostada was mounded with the same shredded beef, crunchy cold lettuce, and crumbled queso.  It was served with rice & beans that I really didn't have room for. 
My #1 Sexy Husband Man, who is infinitely finicky, had the shredded beef Chimichanga and he was seriously very happy with it. 
Our drinks stayed full the entire time, the chit-chat was fun and friendly, and then as we wearily eyed the road outside and prepared to leave, Christy offered directions to the highway as well as two styrofoam to-go cups and sent us on our way with fresh soda-pop and a heartfelt inquiry as to whether we were satisfied.  
Yep... And here's the review to prove it.  
We'll be back next time we go to Vegas!
