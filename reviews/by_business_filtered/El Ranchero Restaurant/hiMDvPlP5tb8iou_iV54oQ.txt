One of the best Mexican Food restaurants I've ever been to. The food is great!  The service is warm, friendly and quick. After playing golf at Wickenburg Ranch we were looking for a place to eat. Found this place on Yelp. We are now looking for more reasons to make the drive from Scottsdale back to Wickenburg so that we can eat here again. We may just make the drive for the food. It is that good.
