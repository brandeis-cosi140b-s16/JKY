I and 8 other people got there at about 8:15 PM or so, so it was toward the end of their hours of operation.  The service was pretty good as was the food.  Good, but not outstanding.  I had the fajitas and they were good, but nothing to set them apart from anyone else's.   One woman, though, said her burrito was the best she had ever had.  I would definitely go back, as good restaurants in Wickenburg are hard to find.
