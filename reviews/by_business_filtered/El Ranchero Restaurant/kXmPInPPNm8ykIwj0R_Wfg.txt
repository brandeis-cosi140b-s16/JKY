My parents live down road and we were in town visiting them, I decided to look on Yelp for something new and different to take them for dinner. We got sat right down with very friendly service. I love older authentic home style places like this. The menu has lots of different offerings with some great choices. They serve warm chips and a couple kinds of salsas and dips (and Hot !). We all got a vast array of choices and the portions were good and tasted great. Everyone told me great choice on picking a new place and I said its all about Yelp! . They checked on us numerous times and kept the drinks full without asking . We always have gone to the other place in town but decided to change and we are very glad we did, If we lived in town we would eat here regularly !
