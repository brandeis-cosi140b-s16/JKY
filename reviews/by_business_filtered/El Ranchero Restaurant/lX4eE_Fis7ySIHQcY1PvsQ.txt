We stopped here on our way home to Phoenix from Las Vegas and thought everything was great.  The service was excellent, the food delicious and the $1 Margarita's between 2 pm and 6 pm, a great idea. ( All you have to do is purchase food of $7.25 or more)  We loved the hot chips served with 3 dips. My favorite was the bean dip but all 3 were so good we were afraid we would fill up on them before our food arrived.  I had the special of the day - shrimp enchiladas - which was very good and my husband had a shredded pork chimichanga - also delicious.  I paid a small upcharge for their special cilantro salad dressing on my salad, but it was outstanding!  My husband, who does not like cilantro, also thought it was delicious.  I would love the recipe!  We will go back to El Ranchero and bring our friends.
