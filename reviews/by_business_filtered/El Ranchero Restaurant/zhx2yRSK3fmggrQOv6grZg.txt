Luckily we checked Yelp as the main road bypasses 'old' Wickenburg.  We started with the fried bacon wrapped chiles stuffed with shrimp.  Very spicy but so delicious!  I didn't realize how big the appetizer was!  I was full after a bowl of their warm chips and the appetizer!  The chips were served with bean dip and two salsas (one which was on yummy fire)  I only was able to take a couple bites of my chile verde.  It was full of flavor!  It was delicious on my scrambled eggs then next morning.  Our server was friendly and attentive.
