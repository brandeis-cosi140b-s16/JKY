I'm a Las Vegas local and will go out of my way to come here. The food is always delicious. I tend to get the braised beef tacos and sometimes the Mexican crisp "pizza"  Service is generally good but sometimes spotty.  I don't like the fact that condiments such as ketchup have to be asked for several times. The prices are reasonable and you can use the Lettuce Entertainment card in order to get points for free food. This place is part of Strip Burger so you may order from both menus.
