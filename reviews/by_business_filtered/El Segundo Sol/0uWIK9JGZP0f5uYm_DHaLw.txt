My boyfriend and I came in recently for date night after hearing plenty about it from friends. Food was awesome and generously portioned. Full bar so I took advantage but my boyfriend doesn't drink so he ordered a virgin margarita.. absolutely delicious without that syrup-like taste that other places usually have. Showed up early for our reservation and were seated right away, definitely a plus considering that almost never happens on the strip. Staff was super nice and even though it was busy, we didn't feel rushed at all which was great. Overall an awesome experience. We'll be sure to come back again next time we're craving mexican food on date night :)
