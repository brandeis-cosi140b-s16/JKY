Was here with the wife and a dear friend. To be honest, I would have had a great evening at Taco Bell just because of the company.

Service was a bit slow, and they weren't that busy. Lots of options for tequila. I had a margarita with Don Julio Reposado, and it was exactly what I expected. They offer tableside guacamole (which really is just an expensive way of proving your guac didn't come from a Sysco container). The guac was good, but not spectacular. Chips were fresh, but not hot. I admit I am a snob when it comes to tortilla chips. The salsa options were all pretty bland.

My entree was forgettable. But my wife's tacos were really good. So I guess those are hit or miss. All in all, the experience could have been better. I think this is one of those places where if you find a dish you really like, you can have a consistently great experience. But it's just as likely you will be disappointed on your first visit.
