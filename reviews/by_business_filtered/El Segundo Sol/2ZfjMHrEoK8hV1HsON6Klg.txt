Not impressed! Just moved to town and work in the same mall and I won't go back.  Neglectful bartenders and so/so food.  Adding chicken to HH nachos was $1....we added steak and it was $7?  Watched a bartender run after a guest and accuse the guest of not paying the bill.  When his fellow bartender informed him in front of the guest that they had already paid, the bartender didn't apologize and was totally rude.  Then we watched him laugh about it when the offended guests had left.  Pretty tasteless.  Also, watched the bartenders drinking margaritas at the end of the bar while we waited with our credit card ready for check out.
