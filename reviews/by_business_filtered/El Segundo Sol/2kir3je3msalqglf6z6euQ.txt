I went here on Sunday before the Beatles Love show which was AMAZING but that's a whole other review. I'm giving it 4 stars though it does have some pros and cons. 

PROS: 
* It's a cool place, sort of a hectic vibe, and loud, but cool just the same 
* The margaritas are *$%#-ing amazing! You will want more than one, so just get the 32 oz up front.  I got 1 strawberry and 1 mango, both awesome.
* The guacamole is also stellar, a large portion and really good! 
*The food is good, not out of this world like the guac and margaritas but definitely good 
*I heard from another vegetarian that the veggie tacos, which is more like fajitas than tacos are super awesome. The best she said, EVER. 

CONS: 
* Chips and salsa are not complimentary, they cost 2.75 
* The service is SLLLOOOOW, it's busy so be prepared to wait. We waited over 45 mins for food at 8pm on a Sunday.
* My friend got the beef quesadilla, which was beef, cheese and jalapenos (WAY too spicy for her, she couldn't eat it) 
*It's fairly pricey, the large margarita is 21 or 22 bones. 
*LOUD, if you want a quiet place, this is not for you. 
*No burritos here, if you like burritos don't bother, they have zero 

All in all if you have the cash to spend and you're looking for a fun, upbeat vibe this would be perfect for you. It's on the strip, at the Fashion Show mall, easy walking distance from a lot of hotels. If you're in a small group and get the chips. salsa and quac I would suggest getting only apps.  The tacos look like a LOT of food, I could only eat part of the quesadilla after the guac.   I will definitely come back again when I don't have a time restraint.
