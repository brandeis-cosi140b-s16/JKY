Amazing service! We went here for my 26th birthday brunch and the food was so savory and tender. The bottomless chips and salsa is a great deal. Chris was a great waiter and very friendly to our group. I definitely recommend the beef torts and the quesadillas along with build your own taco! Amazing restaurant!
