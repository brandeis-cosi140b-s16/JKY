Mediocre food, at best, had chicken fajitas, mostly peppers and onions, not much chicken, rice and beans VERY bland, guacamole mostly salt, salsa boring and no heat. Anyone impressed with this place had too many margaritas or not much exposure to mexican food. LOTS of much better mex restaurants in town, and with better prices. NOT worth the price, or the hassle of the Strip.
