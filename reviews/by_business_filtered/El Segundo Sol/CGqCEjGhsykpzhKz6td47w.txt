A group of friends and I reserved space in their "Ventana Room" to celebrate a bachelor party.  We couldn't have had a better experience.  First and foremost, our event coordinator -- Dusty -- was absolutely amazing.  Her assistance was invaluable, as she helped us put together the perfect party (excellent tips for menu selection, adding personal touches to everything, etc.)  Food was solid (fish tacos and tableside guac were especially great), service was outstanding, and the margaritas were  killer.  Are there fancier and more lavish places on the strip?  Absolutely.  But for a fun atmosphere, and a great spot for a private group reservation, I highly recommend Segundo.
