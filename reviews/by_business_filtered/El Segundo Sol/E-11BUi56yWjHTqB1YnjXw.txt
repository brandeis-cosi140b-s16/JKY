Dj is super loud and pretty good.  Probably an awesome happy hour destination (I came a bit later in the night).  

Guacamole is awesome and takes some determination to finish with just two people but you can do it!  We ordered medium spice but there wasn't much kick to it.  If you want spicy I'd tell them extra spicy.  YOLO.  

Steak and fish fajitas were recommended over the chicken by the waiter and they were both pretty tasty.  Steak was very juicy.  The flavor leans a lot on the pico, salsa and guac.

Minus one star for a few small things.  The food was not too exceptional in any aspect other perhaps portion size, music made our ears bleed (just a little bit), and service was a bit on the slow side.  These could be pluses for others depending on what you're looking for.
