We started with chips and guac.  It was tops.  Warm freshly made chips cooked dark and with the right amount of salt.  Three salsa styles: rojo, tomatillo and fresca, all of which were well made.  Frozen machine margs were the right mix of sweet, tart, cold and plenty strong (unlike most machine margs).  The margs are what took it from 4 to 5 stars.  Fish tacos with house made corn tortillas, also tops.  Great tortillas, properly cooked and spiced grilled fish, nice sides and condiments.  Cold crab mini tostada appetizers were also good.  Great service and seating options.  I'm hard pressed to complain about any part of my experience at El Segudo Sol.
