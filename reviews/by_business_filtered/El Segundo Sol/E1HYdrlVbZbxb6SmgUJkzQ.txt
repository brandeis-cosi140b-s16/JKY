Anytime I'm in Las Vegas I make It a MUST to come here.. Amazing happy hour from 4pm-7pm (7 days a week). Their signature drink is THE BIG STICK, which is absolutely tasty and a MUST have. They also have $3 tacos (Baja lobster & Baja fish are really good). This is one of the safest bets in Las Vegas. Never had a bad experience here.
