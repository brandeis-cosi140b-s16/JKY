I'm somewhere between 3 and 4 stars for this spot, but we'll go with 4. It's a nice atmosphere, has great drinks, and I love the tacos.

This spot can get crowded and loud at times, but it's a nice place. I love all the lights and decor. The service can be spotty, but the servers are mostly attentive and quick to fix any errors.

The queso, enchiladas, etc. are all above average. However, it is the tacos that really shine here. Very delectable and with an upscale feel. You may get some initial sticker shock (though, not worse than most anywhere else on the Strip), but the presentation and taste make it worth it.

And the margaritas are fantastic. Quite possibly my fav spot in Vegas for a margarita. I especially love the frozen margarita with a float of red sangria. It's the perfect summer drink.
