Love this place! It's literally on the corner of Las Vegas Blvd and Fashion Show Dr. There is indoor and outside seating available. When I go here I usually sit outside. They have faux trees with cute lights and misters for the blazing summer days in Vegas. 

This is not the place to go to if your jonesin for authentic Mexican food. But the food is GOOD!  The fish tacos are tasty along with the fajitas. They have this yummy salsa platter that comes with 3 or 4 different types of salsa. Guacamole is pretty standard. I think the outdoor ambience is what keeps me going here lol. Yummy food, good drinks, great scenery, and if you have great company I'm sure you will feel the same.
