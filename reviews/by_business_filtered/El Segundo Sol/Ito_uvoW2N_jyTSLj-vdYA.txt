A couple of ways to describe the latest Mexican restaurant on the strip. Overpriced, Just OK food, Crappy Service & not local friendly. 

To start of, I LOVE me a good Rita but $12+ just ain't happening. "That better be the best Rita in the world with a refill" 

My girl & I sat at the bar hoping to get faster service than at a table,(nope). The bartender clearly just wanted to talk to her other tender or go home. With prices like what they charge, your service better be top notch.

FYI: You may be focusing on the tourist foot traffic crowd but if your locals don't like you..good luck trying to make it in a tough economy.
