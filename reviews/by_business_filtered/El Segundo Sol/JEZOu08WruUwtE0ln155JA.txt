We were looking for a good Mexican dinner during our stay in Vegas. We wanted to go to Diego's at the MGM, but just found out it closed. Last trip to Vegas, we went to Javier's at the Aria. It was good, but not good enough to warrant a return considering the many options available in Vegas. 

El Segundo Sol is definitely worth a return. It's casual with indoor/outdoor seating in the Fashion Show Place Mall.

For us, one of the big deals was that they had a HUGE gluten free menu. Tons upon tons of options, which is so important. And the server knew enough about their gluten free practices to make us feel comfortable.

We started with their very good guacamole. You are able to select mild, moderate, or spicy. It comes with endless chips and salsa. Honestly, this is pretty much all I needed to eat because it was so good and I was full when it was done!

Husband and I split a combination chicken and shrimp fajita platter. It was excellent. Everything was so tasty. It was seasoned just right and all of the sides included were fresh and added to the flavor.

The waitress was great too. She was very sweet and recommended good drinks (for us the blackberry margarita was a perfect choice).

Overall fantastic choice that was a nice cheat meal for my normally very clean diet. It's always a bummer when you take a cheat meal and it ends up being not worth it. This one, DEFINITELY worth it.
