Been here three times now and all three have been wonderful. Good service, good food, and nice environment. 

As far as cost is concerned much like the rest of Vegas prices are higher. But this is easily controlled by using a restaurant.com coupon.
 
Portion size is very reasonable and the table side guacamole is a big hit with us.
