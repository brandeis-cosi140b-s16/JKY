Food and drinks are the stars here.  Baja fish tacos where excellent, even the rice and beans stood out.  Cucmber mint margaritta was perfectly balanced, and called for a second.  A third would have been had if not for being so full from the food. Service could use a polish or a dose of professionalism.  3 stars for now, aspiring to be 4 stars.
