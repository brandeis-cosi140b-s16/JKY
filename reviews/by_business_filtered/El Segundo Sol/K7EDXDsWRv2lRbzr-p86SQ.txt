was looking for somewhere to sit & enjoy a nice happy hour while watching playoffs  decided on a decent mexican food restaurant that happen to be located on the strip in Vegas . Must say for a happy hour i left satisfied couldve done without the beef street tacos but id double back on the steak quesadillas
