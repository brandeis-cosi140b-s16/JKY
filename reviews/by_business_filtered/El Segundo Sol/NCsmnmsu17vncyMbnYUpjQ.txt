I was really excited to try a new mexican food restaurant being a mexican food fanatic, but I was not too impressed after my experience here.
Our waitress was not great- she was busy and kept forgetting our drink orders- (I mean come on- write it down already!)   It was also SO dark in there we could barely see the menu- this is not an exaggeration.  They charge $2.75 for chips and salsa as an appetizer- which is always surprising to me at mexican food restaurants.  The food was mediocre, the margarita primero was watered down (after the server had to be reminded that we ordered it twice).  They charged 18% gratuity for our large party which was an unfortunate way to end the night.
