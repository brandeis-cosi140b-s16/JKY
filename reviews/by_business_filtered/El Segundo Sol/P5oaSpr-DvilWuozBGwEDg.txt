No no no And no, am mexican And i don't expect that much about mexican restaurants in the states, but come on! In vegas strip, You can expect a little more. Parmessan in top of a flauta??? Naaaah! Service is very poor, they expect too much from a customer and they don't give good service, this mulate girl was my server last Tuesday (28) and the prices are not worthy, I'm gonna upload some pics so you can feel my disappointment thumbs down for this one
