Not my favorite joint... but conveniently located for me.  As often as I drop-by for random happy hours, the service tends to err a little on the slower side; half the time the servers aren't very friendly.  I will admit the food is pretty yummy and you can't beat the fun patio.. but, watch the wallets as you don't exactly get the bang for your buck.
