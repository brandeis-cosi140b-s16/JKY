Had the chicken fajita platter with a margarita - 

Was recommended by two people who have tried it in the past and the hotel staff who said everyone on the hotel staff has eaten their. 

Honestly the food here isnt worth the time/ price, I regret going here because when you travel you want to try new, highly recommend places in the area and this just happened to be located in front of my hotel which made for a quick easy dinner.

The chicken was dry, roasted and slightly charred, the veggies charred but under cooked. 
The rice was very bland.
The little sauce dishes  lacking in flavor and also had way too little, Probably a teaspoon of guac, sour cream, and tomato salsa... was way too little for the amount of chicken and flour.

The drink was standard, nothing mind blowing, actually it was a little too salty and not strong enough (imo).

Overall my suggestion is to pass.
There was a good lesson here... don't go just because the pace is convenient.
