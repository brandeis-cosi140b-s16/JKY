The guac and chips are amazing! I had shrimp tacos which were really good, wife had tortilla soup and she liked hers. We've heard the flan is incredible but didn't try it. We asked them about the guac and they emailed us the recipe! What restaurant does that? The service and atmosphere was fun, we had a good time and loved the food.
