Visiting Vegas from Bay Area. Giants playoffs! Where we gonna watch them? Walked into El Segundo Sol and they treated us so good. I had to leave for 20 minutes (the rest of the party stayed) and they insisted they would make  my Chile Rellano over when I returned! Great customer service and the food- tacos,huitlacoche quesadillas (wow), salsas, incredible tamale, even the mexican pizza was great.
so, the next day, we return to watch the Giants Playoffs. Well, 6 Hours, 18 innings later- the staff, the manager, the food--all still fresh, friendly, awesome! and Jalapeno cilantro margarita!
Whenever we return to Vegas, we will be eating there!
Thank you , El Segundo for making these Giants Fans Happy!!
