While in Vegas most recently we chose to support the lettuce restaurants because of their extraordinary quality and service. With that said we had their specialty frozen margaritas and crunchy tacos at El Segundo Sol. The best tacos we have ever eaten - please bring the crunchy tacos to Chicago!!!!
