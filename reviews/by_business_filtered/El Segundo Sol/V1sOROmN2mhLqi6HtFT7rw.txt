Honestly, I don't like Mexican food/faijitas......BUT for my aunts sake I was just going to give it a whirl......omg YUM! Their chicken fajitas were to die for....fresh and made to order! See! That's what I'm talking about! Food made to order and fresh! Oh. And their strawberry margarita is made fresh.....with fresh strawberries and is to die for. Ok I saved the best for last......their tres leche cake......one word.....heaven. omg yum! The best dessert I have ever ever had! Yes I said it! The best! Awesome service and amazing food! Whoa! I totally forgot....their guacamole.....to die for........I wish I can get on a plane right now! Lol!

Bonus for us women: right outside the mall! Lol 

Happy eating!
