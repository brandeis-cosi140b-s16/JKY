First and foresmost...Food was excellent which is why we all goout to eat anyways right? However, service was horrible. They sat us in a corner behind a tree and we had to seek out our server. Next, we ordered everything at once and never received our Chips and Salsa for the appertizer which we qucikly canceled when the food runner brought out our entrees. We were never asked if we wanted refills, never brought more water or asked for desert. We gave the server a restaurant.com gift certificate and he overcharged us signifcantly and we had to then seek out the manager who kindly fixed it. Overall...FOOD WAS GREAT AND SERVICE STUNK!
