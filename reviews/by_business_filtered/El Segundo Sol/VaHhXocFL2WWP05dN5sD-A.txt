The best thing about this place is the outdoor patio and that's about it. We went during happy hour and had 3 tacos and the nachos. It was absolutely gross and I actually had a huge stomach ache afterwards. Whether the tacos are $3 or 50 cents, it wasn't worth it given the small portions and the overall quality of the food. The service was really slow as well. It was just disappointing in general. Thank goodness we found a much better Mexican Place and I'll review that next.
