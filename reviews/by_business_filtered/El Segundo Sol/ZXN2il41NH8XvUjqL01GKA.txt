Fairly average Mexican food with below average service.

Sat in the bar area... couldn't get anyone to serve us so had to go up to the bar to order all our stuff. Even at the bar was ignored for a while with staff was taking care of putting beers in fridge, cleaning glasses, etc.

Food was ok... the salsa wasn't great, but the guacamole was good. I ordered fajitas and thought they were decent, well at least everything except the tortillas. Didn't give me option of corn or flour tortillas and I can't eat flour so ended up eating just the protein, since tracking someone down to ask to swap them was clearly not an option.

The only plus was ample people-watching of passerbys.
