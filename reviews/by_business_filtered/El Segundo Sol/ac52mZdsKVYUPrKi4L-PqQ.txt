This review is solely for the prickly pear margarita on the rocks - because that's all I got. 

My girlfriends were taking too long shopping at the adjacent mall, so I went over with a guy friend to grab some drinks. We sat at the outdoor bar, service was a little slow (big day for margaritas I'm guessing), but we eventually got our drinks - they were pretty, delicious and a bit strong (read perfect).

I would definitely go again, and maybe try some of their food.
