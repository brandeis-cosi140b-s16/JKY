This newer Mexican place absolutely exceeded all of my expectations. I found them on a website and my girlfriend and I decided to give them a chance last week while in Vegas. Our server was very friendly and had  a great understanding of the menu. We had the chips with their absolutely phenomenal guacamole! I mean this guacamole was the best I have ever tried in my life! 

We had chicken fajitas and I ate every last morsel off of my plate. All of the food was exceptional and I will certainly be returning there on my next trip to Vegas. Highly, highly recommend trying this place while in Vegas.
