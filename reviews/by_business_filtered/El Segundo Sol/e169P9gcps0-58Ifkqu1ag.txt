It is on The Strip so expect to pay more... However I expect better service and that is where the restaurant fell short. We waited a long time for drinks and our food and it was not that busy. Our endless chips we ended because the second round never arrived. The waiter was pleasant, however we felt forgotten.

The margaritas are pricy and if I returned I would only go if it was happy hour. We tried some different margaritas and we loved them all. The small is very small, and for the price it is not a deal. The large is very large!

Because I saved this draft to finish the review, I cannot remember what we ordered food wise,but it was all good. Overall, if I was at Fashion Show Mall, I would probably return, but not to make a special trip.
