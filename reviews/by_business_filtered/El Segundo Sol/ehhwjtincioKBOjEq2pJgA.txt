I went for dinner with a group of about 22 people in a reserved room. We had the fajita party option which is listed at $35 per person. Chips and salsa, guacamole, salad, chicken and beef fajitas, rice and black beans and two small deserts. There was enough to eat. I was not impressed with the beef. It was chewy to the point my jaw got tired. Overall the fajitas were not impressive. The guacamole was good however.

I'm not sure what drink option was purchased, but the private party package lists $25 per person for two hours for beer, Sangria and soft drinks and $35 per person for two hours to add well drinks and margaritas.

I would have to say the service was poor. They would bring in one course of the meal, then disappear. I arrived later than the rest and it was a struggle to get a beer. I think there were a couple people who's drinks were attended to, but the rest of us generally were ignored. And why wouldn't we be? It was in their best interest to not ask if someone would like another drink. Considering the poor service, run of the mill food and exorbitant prices, I would say this is likely to be the worst value in a restaurant I have been to.
