A little bit of normaly in Sin City. Located across from the Wynn this is a great spot to getsome good food at understandable prices and not have to wait all night for a seat. Went twice on a recent trip and both times enjoyed the meal. They also have great salsa (3 different styles) with the usual table chips and nice Margaritas (not too tart like most). As a vegetarian I found some choices besides the std veggie quesadilla. Would be a 5 with a little better service and broader menu but would for sure recommend and go back again.
