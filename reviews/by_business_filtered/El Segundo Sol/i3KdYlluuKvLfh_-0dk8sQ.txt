Excellent atmosphere for a margarita and some yummy tacos. Right across the street from the Wynn and Encore, this place is an easy stop on your way out of town. I stopped here after a long stay in Vegas before driving home to California and I was very full! Portion size is large and very filling. Ordered the bottomless chips for an appetizer. Came with pico de gallo, salsa verde and a delicious smokey chipotle salsa. The chips and dips had me full before my entree arrived. For lunch I had the baja shrimp taco platter. The dish comes with delicious cilantro rice and black beans. I really loved the rice, as I am a huge cilantro fan. The black beans were solid and also tasty. The corn tortillas were sweet and soft, the platter came with five small corn tortillas, a nice large portion of fried shrimp and a green avocado/lime sauce as well as a chipotle crema. My only complaint is that I wish the shrimp had not been fried...there was too much batter on the shrimp and it did not add anything to the dish. Just freshly sauteed lime shrimp would have been much nicer. My partner's salmon tacos were also delicious and our friend's chimichanga was very very large, so large, he was unable to finish it. This place is not going to win any food awards for being authentic mexican, however it was very good, prices were decent for the strip and portion sizes were large. Atmosphere was fun, we sat near the bar, outside, with plenty of people watching.
