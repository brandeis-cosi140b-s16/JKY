I'm really torn on this place. The food is good, the service needs improvement, and the setting is nice.

If I select '4-stars' it means, "Yay! I'm a fan!", which I am, but not with that much enthusiasm. I guess I'll have to stick with 3-stars and an 'A-OK' style. 

The food is your average mexican food, with nothing that blows me away. You either love or hate their rice -- which I happen to hate. They do offer a Gluten-Free menu which is beneficial to those who require it. 

They serve you water in a glass bottle that they clearly fill up from the sink. It is so tacky and seems really unsanitary. If you are going to bring a bottle of water, make it fancy or stick with the ice water in the cup. 

Bottom line: nothing special, but not horrible. It's great if you want decent mexican, but there are several other places that, for the same price, will be much better.
