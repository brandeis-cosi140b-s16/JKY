I went here with a few friends and I was expecting great service,  but instead I received really horrible service. Felipe was our server but he was also the bartender for the whole bar. Needless to say,  we got our drinks after 20 minutes of waiting. The appetizer didn't arrive until our food did which was 30 minutes later. I will not be back here. The food was really good, but because of the service I won't be back. If you go there make sure you're not very hungry so you won't mind the long wait.
