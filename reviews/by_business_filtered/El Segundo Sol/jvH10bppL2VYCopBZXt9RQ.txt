Very nice place, decent happy hour menu from a price standpoint. Everything on the happy hour menu is $5 or less and you can get a sangria pitcher for $15 bucks, so really good deals. 

My first impression wasn't good. We sat down and about three different waitresses spoke to us. One brought us a bottle of water and it was warm. She said she'd come back but never did. After a few other waitresses walked past, we hailed one and she went and got someone. Funniest thing, and the most disappointing thing was, we sat here for 20 minutes and had to ask to have our table wiped off. 

The white sangria here is really good. It's comparable to my favorite at Bahama Breeze, so that's a good thing. My wife had a pear margarita and gave it a thumbs up. She described it as stellar. I had a sip and I thought it was pretty good, but she chose to get salt, and I'm a sugar man when it comes to margarita. 

For food we order the steak quesadillas, and they had a really really nice flavor. Definitely a very high quality taste for the happy hour price. We also has the loaded nachos and they too we're delicious. The sad part was that as soon as we started eating, we noticed we didn't have napkins or silverware. 

So as the night comes to a close, I sit disappointed. Not once did our waitress come to our table to check in on us. Except to ask if we wanted another drink when we were just about done eating. 

I really enjoyed the drinks and the food. I give the kitchen/chef a 4-5. However, a bar/restaurant is a part of the services and hospitality business. When I choose to spend my earned dollars in an establishment their job is to provide me with good service and good food. I'd rather have average or poor food with great service than great food with poor service. Today, Segundo failed on the services part.
