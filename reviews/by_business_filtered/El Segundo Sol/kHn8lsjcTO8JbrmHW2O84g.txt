Service was great! We had the fresh-made guacamole appetizer with chips and salsa. It was spiced perfectly and served in a stone bowl. The portion size was excellent for sharing with 2-4. I had the Shrimp and Avocado Cocktail, and it was delightful - fresh and cold, perfect sized for lunch on a hot Vegas day. It was served with a side of chipotle-spiced popcorn for some light crunch. Extremely good! My husband had the grilled chicken salad, which was very tasty and perfect portion size. We would definitely recommend this to others or return again ourselves.
