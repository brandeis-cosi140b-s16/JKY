By far the best Mexican food I've ever had, anywhere. The portions look very basic but once you start eating it's obvious this establishment pays close attention to food preparation and ingredients. Everything's absolutely delicious.

A tip to spice lovers: ask for the white hot sauce. It's not on the menu - probably for a reason. Extremely hot but tasty. Most people won't be able to handle it! :)
