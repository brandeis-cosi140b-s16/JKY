Surprisingly it was not bad!  Being a sort of kitschy Mexican restaurant on the strip it really could've been worse.  (It's way better than that Japanese place next door for sure!)

Friend and I shared nachos and a mixed fajitas plate.  I also had a mango margarita.  It might've been because I had only slept 2 hours the night before or that I really haven't drank in like two years (was pregnant then nursing baby) but man that thing was strong!  I literally drank about a quarter of it I was starting to feel a bit...warm.  :)

The food:  B+
Nachos - Ok.  Can't really mess up nachos, right?  This one had the right ingredients.  I give it a B.  (Not sure nachos can ever really get above a B.  It's just stuff on top of chips.)

Fajitas - Steak was grilled perfectly.  Meat was tender and juicy.  Shrimp was large and tasty.  Grilled vegetables were yummy.  Liked that it wasn't just the typical mix of bell peppers and onions.  They also included grilled asparagus.  I give it an A-.

Service:  D
SLOW!  We went around 3pm.  After the lunch crowd and before the happy hour crowd.  Yet our waitress was hardly around and when she was she just seemed so disgruntled.  We literally had to get up and hunt someone down to pay our bill.

Ambiance/Decor: B+
Twinkly lights get me every time!  :)  But the mish mash of tables  on the patio are really crowded and hard to navigate (especially with a stroller).
