Came here for lunch because it was convenient.  It's a pretty restaurant.  With the openness and tree lights, etc.  Food was fine.  I liked the presentation of the chips and three types of salsa on a baking sheet.  I'm going to steal that idea.  I was happy they served sangria.  Service was very attentive.
