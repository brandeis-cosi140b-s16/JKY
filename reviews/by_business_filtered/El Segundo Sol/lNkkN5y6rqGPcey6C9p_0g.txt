The name of this place should be La Segunda Luna simply because of the fact that it felt like darkness had fallen on the restaurant and we were trapped in a solar eclipse. El Segundo Sol is located at the front of the Fashion Show Mall next to RA Sushi.

When we first walked it, there was a sign in the front to text a number to obtain drink and food specials. It is a scam to sign up for regular spam texts pertaining to this restaurant. We thought by texting that it would give us some sort of a discount. They should be upfront up with this instead of misleading the public.

They sat us in a booth but the service was really slow. It took them a long time to get to our table to order our food, bring out our food, and especially bring out our check. It wasn't really that busy so I wonder why they were so slow. I thought my chicken fajita platter was pretty good but overall I wasn't really impressed with the restaurant due to its service and ambiance.
