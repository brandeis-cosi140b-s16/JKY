Went for happy hour.  Had a $15 pitcher of Sangria and the $10 order of guacamole.  Both were FANTASTIC.  My wife urged me for a return visit each day of our trip.  We will certainly return!  Left off a star only since we were told you could not order off the happy hour menu outside of the bar area...which was packed.  We ended up sitting in a corner when we could have been much more comfortable in the dining area.
