Delish! 

This joint is located in the spot of the old Cafe Ba Ba Reeba... Welcome addition to Fashion Show - good food, great location, lively, inexpensive and casual. Beats the fast food joints in the mall or the slightly more formal environments of Maggiano's or Capital Grille. Made a reservations on OpenTable and went shopping prior so we were running late. The host held our table for nearly 20 minutes (I called to inform them we were late - kudos!!).

Food - Amazing! Started with a couple margaritas and guac along with the fried padron peppers. The peppers were off the hook! I need to find where they are sold in California and cook me up some. The guac had mucho sabor! Deep, pronounced flavors, very fresh and abundant. Well worth the $8 (beats any other Mexican restuarant's tableside prepped guac). For dinner, we had short rib tacos, shrimp/steak fajitas and chicken tacos. All arrived together and delish! Accompaniments galore including various salsas, guac, sour cream, cute tortillas.

Service - spot on! Our server was friendly and always there without being a hover-nag. The front end manager came by to check in on us and see how we were doing as well. Water was never empty. 

Deal - We snagged a $50 restaurant.com gift certificate (make sure you buy it when they are having a promo - got it for $4!). Needed to spend $100, inclusive of alcohol, so we had no problem. Gratuity is not automatically included, so remember to tip on the full amount. We left a solid 20%. 

Only reasons I shaved a star was margaritas were a bit pricey and small (should we come back and pay "full price") and the environment was just a couple decibles too loud. Other than that.. I'm a fan!!
