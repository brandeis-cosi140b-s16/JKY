Seemed a little expensive but that's to be expected in Vegas.

Really large selection of tequila if you're into that kinda thing...I'm not but I was a fan of the cucumber mint margaritas. 

Quesadilla appetizer was good, but small. Steak fajitas were really good. Totally a fan of the rice they give you with it. I think I did more picking at stuff than actual fajita assembling. 

You have to pay for chips which is kind of annoying since almost every other Mexican place I've ever been to gives you them for free. Probably worth it for a big group though since they're bottomless.
