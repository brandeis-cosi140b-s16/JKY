Searching for a place to eat that isn't stuck up, packed or smells like booze is not always easy in Vegas.
El Segundo Sol was the right place! Shade, outdoor atmosphere, friendly staff and great food hit the spot and let us relax during shopping at the Fashion Mall. A must visit. Especialy the grilled chilis .. oh yeahhhhhh
