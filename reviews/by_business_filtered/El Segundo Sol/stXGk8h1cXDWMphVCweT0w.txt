Food was okay - not great, but good - the real reason to be here is to eat outside and have great drinks with good service.  I had the fish taco's which were flavorful and served with soft tortilla's which was a nice touch - but the rice and beans were virtually tasteless.  Also - if you want chips and salsa, they dont give them too you  - you have to order - and when you order you get a mountain full of them with great variety of salsa - but not cheap if you just want a few chips....

All in all - decent place for meal, better place for some apps and drinks.... and great service....
