Very cool little space on the Las Vegas Blvd. side of Fashion Show Mall.  Indoor/Outdoor space with trees and patio lights make for a cute scene.

The fresh, made to order guacamole was some of the best I have ever had and the chips were warm, crispy and salty..mmm.  I also had the chicken tacos which were good but not amazing.  The chicken was a bit charred and I didn't care for the burnt edges--but an overall good taste nonetheless.

I had been on a four day bender and did not partake in the margaritas, but they sure looked good.  

El Segundo would be a welcome respite from shopping or gambling, although it is on the far end of the strip.
