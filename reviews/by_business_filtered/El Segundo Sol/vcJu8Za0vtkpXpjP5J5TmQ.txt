******* 3.5 stars *******

I stopped here last night with a coupon from the parent company Lettuce Entertain You.  I sat on the patio.  It was very pleasant with all the LP heaters around and it was fun watching the tourists walking on the Strip.

I started with a bowl of tortilla soup.  It was quite good and the service was different.  The bowl was placed on the table.  In it were tortilla strips, avocado cubes, some cilantro, queso fresco, and some pasilla chilis.  The server then poured the soup from a pitcher over the "dry" ingredients in the bowl.  The soup had a very nice flavor and was a good start to the meal.

The main dish was the carne asada tacos.  The server had asked how I wanted the steak cooked and it came out rare as ordered.  There were rice, beans, and the steak slices with 5 small soft tacos standing in a metal container.  The beef was good, but the rice and beans were a little bland.  Nothing a little Tapatio couldn't help!  

For dessert, I got the chocolate layer cake.  It was a circular chocolate layer cake coated in chocolate with some freshly made whipped cream.  Excellent!  You can tell from my photo that I didn't care for it at all.  I almost asked for a clean straw so I could snort the remaining crumbs.

Summary:  The meal was good but it is pricey and not somewhere I'd go without some coupon.  I give it an extra 1/2 star because my server, Tiffany, was absolutely top notch.  Pleasant, friendly, and attentive are good descriptors.  After eating 4 times in the last two weeks at Lettuce Entertain You restaurants in Las Vegas, she was the only person who asked if I was a member of their frequent diners' club.  I was not but I am now thanks to her.  Her level of service kicks my rating up.
