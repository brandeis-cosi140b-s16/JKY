It's tucked away at the corner of Fashion Show mall. I celebrated my friends birthday here and the atmosphere is perfect for outdoor patio seating. You can people watch, it's lively and fun. There are candid lights hung around the trees, picturesque, similar to a cozy backyard. The inside is dark with intricate woodwork. There are two bars in the restaurant, one outside and one inside. The staff were extremely friendly, especially the server. They were very hands on and interactive even though we were a large group. Since we were a large group we ordered individually and I got to try a little bit of everything. They served the best guacamole I've ever had! It's not made tableside but it's made fresh and so flavorful. You have the option of choosing the spiciness level. I also had the steak fajitas which were good but the Shrimp tacos were superstars!!! Not to mention, the margaritas are a must-order especially if you are in a festive mood. I recommend coming here for a fun night out with friends and sitting outside on a warm summer night. If you can catch their happy hour that's even better. Ultimately, it's a little more on the pricey side but worth the celebration.
