We ran out of all fast food choices as they closed at 9pm or so... and we just came out of La Reve show in Wynn.  We decided to go to this place and we all loved it.

We ordered the following:
Chicken Fajitas: Pretty good... one of the better tasting ones.
Veggie Quesadillas: My Mom liked them.
Chili Rellenos: My wife liked them.

The guacamole that quesedillas and fajitas came with (though very little quantity wise) was out of the world.

The rice that they gave with fajitas was awesome and the waiter was kind to give extra plate of rice for no charge.
