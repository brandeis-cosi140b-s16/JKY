The atmosphere here is quite nice. The service was good. They seemed busy but we had what we needed. They left the water pitchers on the table so that was nice. Too bad they don't give you ice for your water. The guacamole was good but expensive. $10 for the bowl but it is a big bowl. Kinda stupid that you have to pay an extra $4 for chips, so $14 total for chips and guacamole. I got the chicken tacos and there was nothing special about them. Quite bland actually. No flavor at all to the chicken. I was glad they put some cilantro on the side and had a bottle of Tapito in the table. If you have to add that to make the food taste, it's not good. I would not go back. The food was bland and way too expensive for what you get. The portions were not big for $16. Not recommended.
