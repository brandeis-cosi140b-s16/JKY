El Segundo is not what I typically look for in a Mexican restaurant, mostly due to location. However, almost every restaurant I've tried at Fashion Island has been great. In fact, they're connected with Strip Burger so if everyone in your group can't agree, you're able to order from either menu. I will admit, for Mexican food that this place is kinda pricey. The table side guacamole is great, and the slow cooked pork with pineapple is fantastic. Everything is served with fresh, hot corn tortillas and the service is always great.
