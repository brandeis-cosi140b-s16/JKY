My girlfriends brought me here for my birthday lunch.. Food was great.. Margarita's were even better! Especially the Skinny Margarita (which I added GrandMa too and it became a "somewhat thin" Margarita). Lori our bartender was very patient with us.. which was SO needed, as my GF's can be very High Maintenance! Great atmosphere.. we people watched -which is always fun in Vegas.  

Thanks for making my birthday lunch a fun time and Thanks Lori for being very attentive and giving us great service!
