Enjoyed a nice lunch on the patio with my guy. We didn't realize the exterior walkway and certain shops were undergoing construction so not much to look at except hard hats, scaffolds and of course Wynn across the street..  Anyway, the weather was perfect! We sat outside under a tree and got to see all the action. We ordered the braised beef taco platter and carne asada taco platter. It's a build your own setup on the plate.  I would have to say braised beef were quite juicy and our favorite. :)) We did the table side guacamole which was a bit oily but it definitely had a great taste! By the way, the chips were warm and had a nice crunch to them. Yummy!! I definitely love this place and would come back for happy hour hopefully the construction is finished before then.
