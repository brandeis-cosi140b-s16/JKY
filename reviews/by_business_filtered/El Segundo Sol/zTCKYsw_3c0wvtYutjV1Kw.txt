Every time I stay on the Strip, I make a trip to El Segundo Sol... It's in a great spot at Fashion Show Mall, so the people-watching is fun... They have an awesome patio and open-air space, and service has always been good here. The food is consistently great, the guacomole is to die for, and the margaritas are strong.

What more can you ask for?
