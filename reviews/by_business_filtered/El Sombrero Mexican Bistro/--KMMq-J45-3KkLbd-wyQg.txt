I'm very happy that this little place has reincarnated itself from what it once was (I never visited the "old" El Sombrero, but hardly anyone did). With this place still settling in, I think it will be quite an amazing finished product. The food is already fantastic, and you can definitely taste the care behind the preparation which is always such a pleasure. 

Came here close to closing around 3:20 in the afternoon, and we were the only one there and were told we had just missed the lunch rush. No one in the place doesn't worry me, walking in it had already seemed so charming and smelled great. 

There isn't a bar yet, but we were informed that by the end of April 2015 they will have expanded and by adding a bar and patio. 

The waiter was extremely friendly and very attentive! (As it should have been since we were the only two there) 

Ordered:



Chicken Taquitos $9 flavor profile 3.5/5 

This is an appetizer, but ordered as main meal. This was plenty for a lunch dish, and very tasty. The avocado cream was a great touch. 

Tacos $12 flavor profile 4/5

This was nice because you could choose any 3 tacos you'd like from the options and it was one fixed price. I order 1 fish and 3 shrimp. Both served grilled and you prepared the taco yourself. Presentation was nicely done with all of the toppings on the side. I don't like runny fish or shrimp tacos, so this was perfect for me. You could also order the whole taco deep fried, but I did not choose this option. 

Beers $5 corona light and modelo 

I can't wait to come back. It's even better that it's 2 blocks away from my apartment.
