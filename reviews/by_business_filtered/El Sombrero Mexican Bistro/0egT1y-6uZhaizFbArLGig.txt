I'm far from a food critic, however, I eat out with some frequency. I must say, my visit to this Mexican restaurant was an unexpected gem. Being from out of town, I relied on customer ratings to guide me into this little establishment. Stroke of genius!! The food, pure ambrosia - only exceeded by the knowledge, attentiveness and sincerity of the staff - from busser to owner! Go here, you'll forever remember the occasion.
