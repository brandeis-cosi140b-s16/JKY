The new incarnation of El Sombrero is not to be missed. I've been here 5 times since new ownership took over - and if I didn't travel so much for work I'd come at least 3 or 4 times a week, if not daily. 

The menu is elevated, well prepared, well conceived Mexican. The price points are reasonable or better (they've been favorably adjusted since opening). The menu comprises excellently executed traditional Mexican items, using very fresh, well-sourced ingredients. 

The 4-star review (I'd go 4.5 if possible on Yelp) is because of a few minor elements, that, together, add up to a half-point knockoff: the serviceware is great - though the deuce tables don't really accommodate its size well; the table salsa is delicious but often benefits from a bit of salt (this seems dependent on who makes it as this is not always the case); the guacamole is some of the best in the Valley  - thought it suffers from (sometimes) a lack of salt and it being served cold - it should be room temp. (It should be noted that the LV health department often has issues with room temp items so it could be that - the health department is as clueless as they think they're on.)

All told, these are fairly minor points. The service is consistently excellent; the sauces are delicious; the proteins (or the vegetarian options - and there are many) are wonderfully varied (don't miss the skirt steak, the vegetarian or meat enchiladas, among others), the chile relleno (vegetarian or with chicken or brisket). 

And don't miss the salads. Absolutely delicious salads (large enough for two to share). The piquillo pepper ap is a must as well. 

Summing up, El Sombrero should at the very least be a stop on your food travel  itinerary in Las Vegas. And, quite possibly, a regular go-to spot. It's become one of mine.
