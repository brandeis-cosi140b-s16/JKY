I am really surprised this place has so many stars. My friends and I ate here two weeks ago after seeing a show at the smith center.  There were a couple other tables but the place was not even half full. They only sell beer and wine, i.e., no margaritas or mental:( My husband ordered the tacos mixto because he was undecided and according to the menu it came with three meats, this way he'd be able to try each meat.  When it arrived there was only one meat so we inquired about the others, it was "explained" that was what he ordered...uh, ok.  It's a poor name for the dish if you only get one. 

I ordered the spicy calamari appetizer as my meal - everyone's meal came out ahead of mine, which is no big deal, but it took a long time to come out, I'd say at least 10 minutes. Then when it arrived I was disappointed.  It was supposed to be grilled and it wasn't and it was just the rings, like what you get at a pizza joint to dip in marinara.  I took a couple bites and didn't like it.  I don't remember the server asking how the meal was, when someone leaves a whole dish practically untouched, that should raise a question.  Our friends ordered the mole Santa and chile relleno. The group's overall consensus was meh, overpriced and nothing special.  Too bad:/
