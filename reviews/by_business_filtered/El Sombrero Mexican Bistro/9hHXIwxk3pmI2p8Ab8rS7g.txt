We are relatively new to Las Vegas. Based on the great reviews, we decided to try El Sombrero. The street, the are, the parking lot and outward appearance had us second guessing ourselves. Then we walked into a beautifully designed  cantina with unique and interesting decor details. We were warmly greeted and seated. We ordered the steak dinner for two which had 3 types of steak, creamed corn, rice and beans, tiny potatoes and 4 dipping sauces. I did not know that steak could be that tender. The flavors were divine, the potatoes were like tasty cloud puffs. My husband and I felt guilty for using a coupon. We felt like we underpaid! HIGHLY RECOMMEND.
