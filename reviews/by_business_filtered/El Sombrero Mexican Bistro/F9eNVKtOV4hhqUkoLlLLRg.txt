If you're looking to get away from the Strip for some great food in a relaxed atmosphere, you won't be disappointed. Small, intimate interior, attentive service, fresh food and great sangria. Yes, it is located in a sketchy area of town, so take a cab - and ask Jose to call one for you when you're ready to leave. We ordered the seafood paella, and it was awesome. Happy we took the time to check this place out!
