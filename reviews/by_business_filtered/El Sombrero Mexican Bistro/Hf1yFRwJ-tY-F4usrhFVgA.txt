Another local bookmark checked off, this time with my son in tow.

After reading Yelp friends' glowing reviews, this was a place I wanted to try pronto.  Located on Main St. between Bonneville and Charleston, I had made a reservation for 8:00pm last Saturday night.  I arrived first since Kiddo was just getting off of work and then he got there late.  Upon being seated by Jose, I was told that a private party of 30 would be coming in at 9:00pm.  I wasn't sure if I was being told to hurry up, order, and eat by 9:00pm or what, so I asked Jose to clarify the situation.  He reassured me that I wouldn't be rushed off, but that it was going to get noisy and people would be milling around just like at a party and if that was going to be alright with me.  I told him it was A-OK and we got moved to a corner table instead of being seated in the middle of the one-room establishment.

Despite the private party that did eventually arrive, we had great service and were checked on by three different staff members when we were there. 
 
-small room with 43 person capacity according to Official Capacity wall sign
-reservations are therefore a good idea for dinner, just in case; I used the Yelp app on my phone to do so
-housemade chips and salsa are so good that you can get full on these alone.  To quench my thirst while waiting for my tardy son, I ordered the refreshing Blanca (white) Sangria ($8), fruity and light.
-I had the tamal de pollo ($14) served with rice and charro beans--delicious!  The tamale was not dry at all, something that I've experienced too often at other Mexican restaurants.  
-Kiddo had the 3 taco plate ($12), with 2 chicken and 1 brisket taco.  The order actually comes out with the meats on a platter, plus three tortillas, salsa, guacamole, and a red sauce so you can do-it-yourself.  Other meat options are carnitas (they were sold out), camarones, fish, and chorizo carne asada. Hijo loved the brisket and said he should have ordered more of it versus the chicken.

This spot deserves the praise that it's received and I will be back for more soon with the b/f; he'll definitely love the chips.
