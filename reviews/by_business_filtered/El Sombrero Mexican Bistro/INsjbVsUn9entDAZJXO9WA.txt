We're on a family vacation and my daughter picked this place based on the great Yelp reviews.  If I could give this place more than 5 stars I would.  Our waiter Jose was excellent - he knew all the dishes, was very attentive and friendly.  In fact, if the food didn't make this place he would.  My suggestion would be to get here soon - this time next year you'll be waiting in line to get in.
