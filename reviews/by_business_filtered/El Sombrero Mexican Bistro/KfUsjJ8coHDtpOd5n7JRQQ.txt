On entering this small restaurant we directed to a small table and provided menus along with house made chips and fresh salsa.  We started off with glasses of a delicious red sangria with a pronounced flavor of cinnamon and fresh fruit that had must have been marinating for some time - excellent.  This was followed by a shared sandia citron salad (watermelon, caramelized pepitas, mixed greens and teardrop tomatoes with a citrus dressing) that proved to be refreshing.  My wife chose pollo enchiladas for an entree - braised seasoned pulled chicken with a roasted garlic, creamy tomatillo sauce accompanied by Mexican rice and frioles. I went vegetarian with the bistro chile relleno - a small roasted poblano pepper filled with butternut squash, onion, and potato that shared the plate with charro beans and Mexican rice. Both dishes proved to be very good
