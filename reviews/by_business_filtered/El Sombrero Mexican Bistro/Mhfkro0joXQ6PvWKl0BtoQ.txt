I ordered the Chille Relleno and Enchilada combination, well presentation is over done, food was bland, beans were reduced to a smear sauce, Enchilada was basically a tortilla rolled up with chicken and condiments were added on top  It lacks the Mexican authentic taste.  And for what they charge its simply not worth it, i would recommend taco bell instead.
