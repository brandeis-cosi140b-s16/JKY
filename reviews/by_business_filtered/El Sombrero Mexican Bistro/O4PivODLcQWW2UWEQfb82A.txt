I was very underwhelmed by the food here. What is everyone talking about?? The decor inside is very well done in black and white, nice wood flooring, etc. and the staff were all friendly, but the food was so mediocre, I am perplexed. The charbroiled calamari was decent enough tasting but not as special as I'd been led to believe by Brock Radke's newspaper review, and the carne tamale was so bland I didn't eat it. I had loved the tamale at Mundo, the owner's other restaurant, and had hoped it would be the same but alas, the old grandma that I was told makes these tamales does not measure up. The chile relleno was just ok as well. I was so excited for non-breaded chile relleno and non-fried calamari, but the reality was a disappointment. The prices would be fine if the quality was there, but totally not worth it as it stands currently. Too bad...
