No bueno. Jose failed completely as my waiter. And they weren't even busy, Jose felt it was more important to set tables rather than take my order. I ended up yelling his name to get his attention and he told me he would be with me in a moment as he continued to ignore me and finish setting tables. Major fail. Not returning.
