Another Yelp Winner!
Stopped off mid road trip for a bite to eat. 
Yelped local spots and found El Sombrero.
We were wondering where we were driving through sketchy downtown streets... Including a road closure with guns drawn (no lie), but when we pulled up we saw some decent cars that still had rims on them so we felt a bit better. 

The inside does NOT match the outside.
Food was yummy!

We had:
Vegetarian enchilada
Chicken Enchilada
Guacamole
Super secret spicy chili.

It was all great. Hit the spot.
Fresh and tasty.
No grease!
