This place is one of the oldest in Vegas and new owners have spruced up the restaurant. I like that it has a parking lot. Service was top notch and very experienced. Food was great, but with caveats. For one, we were offered guacamole, but weren't told it was an $8 up charge. I ordered the watermelon salad with Salmon, which I was charged for after substituting for shrimp. Total bill for two people was around $50, which is pretty steep for day to day dining. Definitely a special occasion place. Watch out for up charges.
