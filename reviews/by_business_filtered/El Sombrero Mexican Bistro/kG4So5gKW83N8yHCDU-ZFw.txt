I REALLY wanted this to be my new favorite go to restaurant in Downtown, but I'm not sure it's in the cards.  The first three to four times we went there, the food and customer service were great.  The last three times, the food has been served cold and the service very slow.  It's the little things; LONG wait times for our first order of sangria, refills on chips and stale tortillas with the hanger steak special, even when there is only one other couple in the restaurant.    

The guacamole is good, but overpriced for the amount you receive.  It should either be half the price or they should serve twice the amount.  We took some friends from our neighborhood and called before to see if they had a corkage fee for bringing your own wine and were told they did not.  The next time we took friends and brought our own wine, the corkage fee jumped from $0 to $20 per bottle.  When I inquired, we were told "that's what other properties on the strip charge".  Well, we are not on the strip.  Don't get me wrong, I don't mind a corkage fee, but $20 is a little outrageous, especially considering they only offer a few wines.  

Before writing this review, I tried to give them this feedback via a private email through their website, but never heard back.  I am hoping that by writing this review they will revisit their corkage fee and ramp up their customer service.  We live less than five miles away and would love for this to become our go to restaurant.
