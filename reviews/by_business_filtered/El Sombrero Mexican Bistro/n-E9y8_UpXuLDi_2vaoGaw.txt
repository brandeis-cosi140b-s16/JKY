Thank you for amazing food and impeccable service!  Jose was so prompt and courteous and explained everything in detail. His recommendations were so helpful and guided me towards the delicious sangria!  The fish tacos were out of this world!  Cannot wait to go back and try everything else and try to save room for dessert!
