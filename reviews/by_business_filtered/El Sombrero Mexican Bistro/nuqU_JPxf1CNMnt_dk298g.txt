This place is awesome. A little small, but that just adds to the intimacy.

Our group of 8 included 2 former Bouchon chefs, so I was a little concerned as I'd recommended the place based on reviews. I'd never been to the old ESC, and it's a pity it's still on Yelp after it closed - do not mistake it for the completely new El Sombrero Cafe. As for the 2 chefs at the table - they enjoyed their dishes, and both said they would definitely come back.

We all loved our food, from the Halibut La Plancha to the Short Ribs. Some classic Mexican dishes on the menu, but most dishes served up by Chef Oscar are contemporary, or a new twist on a classic.

The waitstaff was excellent - Jose took very good of our table, and added to our experience with his quick smile and sense of humor. Owners Irma Aguirre and James Campos are already offering their diners a great dining experience. Three cheers to these two former political operatives for coming out from the dark side to serve up some really good food.

Irma's own Red Sangria is incredible. One of the best I've had. I'm still looking for a Cava Sangria like Cafe-Ba-Ba-Reeba served (and I won't quit til I find one), but this is the best red sangria I've ever tasted. We all loved it, as well as the Watermelon Sangria.

I'm definitely going back again and again.
