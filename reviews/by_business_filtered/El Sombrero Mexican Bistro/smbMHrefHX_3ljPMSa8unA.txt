Gross. We tried to eat dinner here and both had the worst attempt at fancy mexican food ever. Next, know that they do not have margaritas. I ordered veggie enchiladas which ended up being tomato paste covered spinach inside of a corn tortilla. The rice tasted like cold tomato paste rice with a few old peas. My husband ordered chicken tacos. They ended up being fried tortillas with literally only chicken inside them. The menu does not actually tell you what they have, nor is the menu online the menu they have in the esrablishment. Do yourself a favor and skip it.
