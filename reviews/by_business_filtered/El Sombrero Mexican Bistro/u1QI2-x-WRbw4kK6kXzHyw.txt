I've been meaning to write this review for quite some time, but our Vegas time got away from us and now that we are back to normal life on the East Coast, I am going to get this done because if you visit Vegas, you must go off the strip and have a meal at this restaurant.  

Truth in lending, I served with one of the owners in the Army and when I found out he started a restaurant in Vegas, I expected nothing but the best because of how detail oriented he is.  

The location is near old Las Vegas / Fremont street, so it will be easy for you to make this a part of your Vegas event schedule.  

The restaurant itself is nicely decorated and the service was exceptional.  My wife and I had chips, salsa, and very good sangria to start.  We then shared chicken enchiladas which were very very good.  

Mexican is hard to screw up, but its also hard to make it exceptional.  They have a great staff and the food is much better than the run of the mill Mexican restaurant.  

Also, we engaged in a conversation with an older couple at the table next to us.  Interesting enough, they were from Summerlin which I guess is like 45-50 min from Vegas and they said this is the only Mexican restaurant they will go to and they will make the drive just to eat there.  

Highly recommend.
