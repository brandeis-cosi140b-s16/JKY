Went here for my birthday today and had a wonderful experience! The staff was excellent, very attentive and on top of everything. The food was great: I had the combination of a brisket beef taco and chicken enchilada with rice and beans. My husband had the el sombrero burrito and said it was also amazing. My daughters had the cheese quesadilla with guacamole and the chicken flautas and both aid they were delicious. We also love the chips and salsa as well as the guacamole. All the food was fresh and homemade! To top it off, they brought me a complimentary piece of their bread pudding that was perfection, sang happy birthday to me and it even had a little candle it. The ambience was intimate but still family friendly and the decor was modern. We highly recommend!
