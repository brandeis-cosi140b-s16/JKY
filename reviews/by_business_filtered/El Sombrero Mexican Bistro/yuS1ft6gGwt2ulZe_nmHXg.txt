El Sombrero is hands down the best Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas. The interior is perfectly appointed and intimate, only seating about 32 lucky souls. Service is first class, with waiters who understand and explain every ingredient. The chicken enchiladas are legendary, the sangria is delicious, and the spicy calamari is the best in town. Located in the heart of Las Vegas' growing arts district near downtown, El Sombrero is a must try!
