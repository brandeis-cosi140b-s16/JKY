We've been going to El Torito since I was a kid. Now I live 2,000 miles away in Ohio and only get my tasty shredded beef tacos once a year when I visit my family.  When it's freezing cold in Dayton and we have 3 feet of snow outside I crave the albondigas soup. My dad calls it "dirty dishwater soup" but looks are deceiving! It is a simple, tasty, satisfying soup. The salsa is awesome too with a good shake of salt. Some people might find the service abrupt, but I've always found the staff friendly, efficient and accommodating (even though we always show up with a big group and linger over our once-a-year whole-family El Torito excursion). 

For those of you knocking it: It's a small family place with tasty food and a devoted (and not trendy) following... if that's not good enough for you then feel free to take your business to one of those character-less chain food places with their corporate-mandated "friendliness"... it just means I'll get my table faster.
