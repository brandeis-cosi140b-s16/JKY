This place is definitely open. Not only that they have great food. The carnitas are perfect, very lean. Ground beef tacos also great. Carne azada tacos were not as good, a little chewy. Not much from the outside but clean on the inside and the food kept me coming back three times in one week.
I checked some of the bad reviews. Some mentioned the salad was not that good. I don't know about you but I don't go to a Mexican restaurant because of the salad. So based on the main dishes I've had and the great salsa and thin chips I gave them 5 stars and continue to frequent El Torito Cafe.
