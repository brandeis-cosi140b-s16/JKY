Anyone who knows me, knows Mexican food is like a second child to me. I just love it that much. Its rare I dislike a well cooked Mexican dish. Other than Lengua and intestines, I pretty much eat it all. I love hole in the wall spots such as this one, or fancy unique styles like Border Grill equally. EL Torito Cafe, welcome to my list of well loved mexican restaurants. 
My boyfriend talked of this place from his childhood that was almost to Boulder City way south on Boulder Highway. He figured it wasn't still there but we are the type of people to drive out there and find out. His very much astonished face answered my question if this was the same place. 
My go to dish always has and will be cheese enchiladas and albondigas soup. Ok the soup. Very different from what I expect albondigas to be. Its just broth, and rice filled meatballs. Where's the onions? Zucchini? Carrots? Potatoes? And all the cool garnishes like cilantro and red peppers?!
Although this broth and meatballs indeed was delicious, I could only imagine the potential with veggies. 
Now on to the best freakin cheese enchiladas ever devoured through this mouth!! I don't know that I will ever order anything else. My boyfriends wet chimichanga looked desiring but still. All I can think about ever, are these enchiladas. You have the option of ordering the spicy. (WHY DOESN'T EVERYWHERE HAVE THIS OPTION??) And the cheese inside is melted and high quality. Not like that get stuck in your throat cuz its half melted and too cheesy type. 
The customer service is great, regardless if the waitresses only know enough english to take your order. They work hard, and do a better job then most. They are closed Mondays. And it gets busy during lunch hour. 
You may get addicted. You've been warned.
