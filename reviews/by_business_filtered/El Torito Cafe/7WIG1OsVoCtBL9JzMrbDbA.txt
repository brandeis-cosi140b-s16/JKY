I'm not a huge Mexican fan really, I'm more Asian/Japanese fan myself but that's okay. I was happily surprised! This is the one and only place I found that I enjoy the "Shredded beef" I usually hate that shit because it taste weird, but here it was so flavorful like a soft beef jerky almost ; soo good! Lol  I came here with my friend Kenny as his going away dinner he is going to Elko for college so we went to see a movie and dinner.
I got-
Cheese enchilada- Cheesy it was okay, didn't know what to expect really. The red sauce was super flavorful.

Beef chimichanga This is where the shredded beef comes in, everything about this damn thing was good the outside was nice and crispy, cheese and red sauce melted over it mm mmm mmm is all I can say about this! 

Kenny got -
Pork chimichanga- he enjoyed it ate the whole damn thing, that little piggy!

Nachos granda- We got it without guacamole, we got this to share and ate it all almost. It came with chips, ground beef, sour cream, tomatoes, cheese, jalapenos, and other stuff we got without like olives.

Fries- He got fries to eat with everything and they were yummy nice and crispy.

Desert - We got fried iceccream! They had frosted flakes on it wich where a little chewy but good! :3 

The only downside to this place is I asked for no beans and rice, and they gave it to me anyway, it's okay next time I'll try to make it more clear. The thing I LOVE about this place is EVERYTHING is made fresh, nothing frozen.!
