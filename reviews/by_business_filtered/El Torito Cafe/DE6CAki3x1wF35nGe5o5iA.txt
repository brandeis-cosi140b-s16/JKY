I give this place a 5 star, we recently moved to the area to our new home, and being from Chicago where you can get the Worlds best food, I put this place on the Map. The Pork Green Hatch Chili is freakin amazing. Great taste great flavor savor savor... Walked in and just love the authentic traditional Mexican restaurant feel. My wife being from New Mexico and finding out the Owners originally where from Mexico then migrated to New Mexico and Then Henderson Nevada is amazing. My wife was so happy, she said "finally food from home" the great southwest. I got her the Pork green chili Al la carte platter and she just went to town on the food.


So glad to find this family ran traditional food for her and my Mexican food loving self. Lmao Being Puerto Rican sometimes it's hard to except food as good as Puerto Rican food. But this place is well worth the stop, whether your new to Vegas driving thru from the Az or heading out with the family. A great place to stop for Lunch or dinner. Pricing was very cheap for the greatness of quality of food you get. I pretty much got. Little bit of everything on the menu lol. This place is fire
