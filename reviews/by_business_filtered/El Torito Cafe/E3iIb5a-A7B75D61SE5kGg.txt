I recently went back to El Torito for lunch, I regret doing so. 
1: Salsa: When you make your salsa daily you can expect to have the occasional batch that goes wrong. But what they put on the table looked like a can of Hunt's tomato sauce with maybe a couple of jalapenos put in at best. It was tomato paste with extra water and it's wrong to call it salsa.  
2: They do know how to make real Pork Green Chile. That is the ONLY thing saving them from a 1 star review this time. 
3: Way, WAY overpriced. An enchilada, a taco, standard beans and rice and a soft drink came out to $14. Yep, I double checked the receipt. I felt like I got fleeced.  

At least the place is clean and the servers hustle, but you don't go here to stare at the walls or the server, you go to eat. And the food quality quite frankly isn't a good value anymore. Look elsewhere for your Mexican fix.
