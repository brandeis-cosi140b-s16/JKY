So I have to drive to by this place every day to go to work  and It is always PACKED. A majority of the time there is at least one cop car...WHICH IS  ALWAYS A GOOD SIGN lol. It is in the middle of nowhere, It is small, not the nicest of amenities but the food was good. I got their carnitas platter and let me tell you the quality of their food is GREAT...good meat and fresh veggies. A little pricey for just a family restaurant. But overall I would come back. CHIPS AND SALSA ARE YUMMS
