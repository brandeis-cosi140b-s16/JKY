Since moving to Vegas this was the first Mexican place we found that we've really liked. Service is a little slow, the place is at the end of Boulder Hwy and looks kinda rough on the outside...but inside, the food more than makes you forget about that. Being from Colorado we love green chili and they make it the way we're used to. Let's put it this way we ordered guacamole and they forgot to bring it out but the food was so good we forgot all about it until after we had got home and we raved about the place all the way home. I can write very hostile reviews, but not of this place. It's worth the time to check it out. Oh and my 17 month old grabbed a chip and started in on the salsa...and didn't want to stop. The salsa is very good.
