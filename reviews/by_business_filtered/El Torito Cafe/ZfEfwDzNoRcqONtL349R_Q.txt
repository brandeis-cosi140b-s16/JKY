I usually love this place but last night they were really off. We were there 2 hours and it never should have taken so long. We waited 20 minutes to be seated although the table we sat at was empty the entire time.  

The person seating was also in charge of taking orders and taking payments.  This is not acceptable. This was not the usual person there - maybe the usual person was off for the holiday weekend. Whatever the case, this person wasn't able to keep up.  It took forever to order. We were seated for nearly 20 minutes before someone took our order. Food took forever to come out.

The food was also off last night. Rice and beans didn't seem to taste quite the same. My taco crispy taco was soggy - presumably from the chicken they didn't drain before putting in it.

Normally I would give this place a solid 4 stars - not because of the ambiance or great setting, but because the food is usually so darn tasty. Last night they barely made 2 stars.
