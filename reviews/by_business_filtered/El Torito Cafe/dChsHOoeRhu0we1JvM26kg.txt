This place looks a little shabby but don't be fooled they have good food and it's nice and clean. This place has the best salsa-I normally don't enjoy the salsa some places bring out but El Torito is the one place I'll actually eat it. For lunch had the #10 Chimichanga with shredded beef and it was really good. My friend introduced me to this place and I'm glad she did-will be back again!
