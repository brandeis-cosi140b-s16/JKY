Finally I made it through the doors and I found you can NOT judge a book by its cover, which I have done for the past 8 years.  This place was awesome.  I planned a retirement luncheon for my friend with 7 of us and they did such a great job taking my reservation to having the table set up already and offering excellent customer service.  Oh, you want to know about the food? lol.  The chips were very fresh and salsa had a great flavor.  6 of us had the taco salad  which was very good.  Only complaint is it didn't include any beans - but we got passed that.  My friend ordered a burrito and she ate the whole thing.  I noticed they have a party room in the back and the place was decorated very nicely.  I will go back again.
