I'm hemmed and hawed about giving a 3 or 4 star. I'd probably do a 3.5 if I could but I thought they were at least good enough to round up and not down. 

I've been going to this place for many years. This is my family's favorite mexican restaurant in the area and they've been here for 20 years so when visiting we would wind up here at some point. I've been several times since I've moved back.

This place probably is some of the better mexican that I've had in this city, which I find odd that there doesn't seem to be as many local mexican restaurants as one would think. I can attest to the great service every time I've been here. It seems like the same girl is always working and she is super friendly and everything comes out quickly. 

I always get a margherita when I go and I honestly think they have one of the best around. So many times it seems like they are all mix but here they give a heavy handed pour, which always makes me smile. They are huge, as well as, tasty. Heck, just writing this makes me want to go there after I go to the gym tonight.

I've eaten several things here and always enjoyed the food. I wouldn't say that it was so great that I just crave it, but then again, I keep going back so it is pretty good. I've never had an overly greasy meal and get the impression that the place is fairly clean. The location is kinda remote, but at least there is plenty of parking and if all else fails you can go to the gun shop next door before or after.

I love that this place is locally owned and operated! It's good to know that my meals have a more direct impact on the local economy. My final vote is go. If you want good food, friendly service, and tasty margheritas then El Torito Cafe is the place for you.
