Ok. Normally I would give this a 4-5 stars. We had lunch there last Sunday and the children ordered the fried chicken fingers. To my surprise my son comes up to me and said that his chicken was not tasting good. After looking at the chicken I noticed that the chicken was still RAW. I had to monitor his stomach to make sure he wasn't going to get sick.
