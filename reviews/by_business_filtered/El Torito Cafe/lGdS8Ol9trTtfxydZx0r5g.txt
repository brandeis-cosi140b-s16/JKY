The place is literally on the way out of to towards Boulder City and in the middle of nowhere . Great Mexican food, wonderful Salsa and a pretty good full bar. One of the best Mexican restaurants in town and it's family owned. I go there often and never had language problems there and wait staff has always been friendly and efficient .
