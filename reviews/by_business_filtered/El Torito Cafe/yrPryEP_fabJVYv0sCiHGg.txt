Oh, El Torito you used to be so yummy and now you've dropped off. I've been to El Torito many times over the past 7 years, but in the past year or so it just isn't as good. 

The staff is always friendly and they are super quick even when they are slammed. The atmosphere is nothing to write home about. It's a simple place with some booths as well as tables and chairs. 

I'll give it to them I really enjoyed their chips and salsa. Great flavor to the salsa. It has a hint of spice without being overwhelming. On this recent visit I ordered the tamale with red sauce with a side of beans and rice. Joel ordered a shredded beef chimichanga with rice and beans. The tamale itself was ok, but the red sauce tasted dirty. It just had a seriously bad flavor. Ugh, the beans were super dry and stuck to the plate in a glob and the rice was just non edible. It was dry and had absolutely no taste. Joel's chimichanga looked good, but again lacked flavor. For the price we could have gone to Robertos and spent less and had a better product. 

I feel very sad to give them a 3 star review, but it just wasn't good. If El Torito could return to the old way of cooking they'd have a home run, but for now it's just sad, mediocre Mexican food. What a shame.
