I'm surprised to see El Zocalo only has a weighted average of 3 stars. My family and I had a most pleasant experience.

The venue does a wonderful job of creating a Rocky Point-esque kind of feel. 

When we walked in we were greeted immediateily, seated promptly, and tended to by our server Kyle right away.

The tortilla/dipping chips were fresh & thick, and the salsa was fresh also.

Negative: the space is set up in a way that it is easy to hear other people's conversations

We went on a Wednesday about 1 pm and it was moderately filled with patrons.

I ordered the taco/enchilada combo and enjoyed it, wasn't mind blowing, but certainly above average. My wife has a raspberry walnut salad (yummy dressing!). 

At one point my baby dropped his bottle and another server came over to pick it up,and he also picked up our check when he saw our payment was ready The venue feels has a very family/small restaurant owned kind of feel.

I would certainly recommend El Zocalo without hesitation.
