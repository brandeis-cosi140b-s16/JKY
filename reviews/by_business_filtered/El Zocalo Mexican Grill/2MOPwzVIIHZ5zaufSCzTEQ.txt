When I asked folks at my hotel for a recommendation for Mexican food, I should've been more specific and asked where Mexican people go for Mexican food. Instead, I was sent to El Zocalo, which was pretty to look at, but lacking in substance.  Hmm, kinda reminds me of home.  The food was downright bad.  My friend ordered the chicken fajitas, and the chicken was dry and way overcooked. The spices were bland.  I actually had better fajitas at Baja Fresh for half the price.  The only saving grace was the black beans.  

I had the chicken tostada salad.  The salad tasted like it came from a Fresh Express salad mix.  It was a blend of romaine and iceberg lettuce, carrots, and red cabbage.  The shredded chicken was ok, and there was a generous amount of avocados and sliced jalapenos (not fresh), but the flavors did not go well together.  

Portions are big, but the food was so disappointing that we didn't bother taking the leftovers to go. Service was slow, and the restaurant didn't seem too busy.  Our waiter never refilled my water glass, which was empty throughout the whole meal.  I think he felt bad about that because he gave me water in a to-go cup with the check.  That's a first.  

Go for the music and the atmosphere, but save your money and eat elsewhere.  The food is expensive for what it is.
