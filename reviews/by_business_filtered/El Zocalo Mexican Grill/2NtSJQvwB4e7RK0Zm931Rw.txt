We love this place! Great couples Mexican restaurant. The margaritas are worth the trip. You can tell that service is a priority. No matter who waits our table they are always polite and mindful that you're content through each step of the meal. Never had a good dessert here. The sopapia's and the flan are pretty weak. So we go for the great food, the service and the tasty margaritas. Pass on the dessert.
