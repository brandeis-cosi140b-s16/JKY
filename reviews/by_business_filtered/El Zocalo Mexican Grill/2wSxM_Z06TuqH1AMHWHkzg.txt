I first ate at El Zocalo in March 2013 while on a business trip and had the BEST chili relleno that I have ever had.  So much so when I was back in Phoenix in Sept 2014 I made a point of driving 20 minutes to have dinner here again.  The restaurant has a nice flow and feel to it.  Chili Relleno was just as good as I remembered.  Will come back the next time I am in Phoenix.
