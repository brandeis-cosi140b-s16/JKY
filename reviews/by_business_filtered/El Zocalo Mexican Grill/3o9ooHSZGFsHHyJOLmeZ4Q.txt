Ugh! Wanted to love this place, but from the get go, server "Bethany" was lacking. Spilled margarita on the husbands phone, never brought more napkins after half an attempt at apologizing. Guacamole came out with the meal- blamed on kitchen for the mistake. Apparently my sister ordered a burrito unbeknownst to her. After some confusion when food was delivered, Bethany came back out and using a snarky tone told my sister what she ordered and again half attempted to get what my sis really wanted. Instead of waiting another half hour for what she really wanted, her and my husband switched plates. Whatever we weren't going to argue. Long story short, my husband, sis and I have all previously been in service and the service here was definitely slow and lacking. Not worth the money for the experience we had. 2 stars was only given for food. Service was bad to say the least. Would hate to see what a busy night would be. We came on a Tuesday. Will not return
