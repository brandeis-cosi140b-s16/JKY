I ate here last night with my daughter and I was very impressed not only with the food, but also the atmosphere, and staff. I ordered the CHILE RELLENO and HOUSE MARGARITA and both were delish and served very promptly for a busy Saturday nite. I will be going back very soon and next time will opt for the outdoor seating...as it would bump it up another notch!
