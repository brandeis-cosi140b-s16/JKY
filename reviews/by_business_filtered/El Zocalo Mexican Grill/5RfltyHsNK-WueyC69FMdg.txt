Food wasn't so bad, but service wasn't great. We sat down waited about 10min for a sever. We ordered drinks and it took forever to get our drinks out. Once they came we order and our food came out immediately. During our dinner our drinks ran out and our sever didn't check back on us for drinks.  Our kids were thirsty and we had to wait and wait. Finally our sever came we ordered another round of drinks and it took 20min to get our order. We actually walked up to the bar and noticed our server hadn't picked up our drinks which were ready. Once we got the check it took even longer for them to pick up our check so we could high tail it out of here.
