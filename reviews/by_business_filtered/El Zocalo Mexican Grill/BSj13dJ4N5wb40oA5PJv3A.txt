Not many places you can order anything on the menu and it's all good. I highly recommend the mole de pollo, the best chicken mole dish I've eaten. Chew it slow and savor the flavor... Killer margarita's, fresh chips and salsa. Don't forget to top it off with their unique sopapilla's. Bring a wheelbarrow so they can push you to the car or just kick back and enjoy another margarita while taking in the music on weekends
