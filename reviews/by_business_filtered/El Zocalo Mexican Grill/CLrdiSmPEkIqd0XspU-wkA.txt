I love El Zocalo. I work across the street and get their lunch special every couple weeks. They have my all time favorite chips and salsa and a really cool patio. Food can be pricey, but if you stick to the specials you'll be fine. Margaritas are not my favorite, but are not bad by any means. 

As an FYI, I don't write long drawn out reviews. I do my best to manage my expectations, i.e. I do not expect Ritz Carlton quality service at every road side McDonalds. Feel free to take any of my reviews with a grain of salt, if this contradicts your own values.
