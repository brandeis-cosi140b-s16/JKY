We went here last Sunday for lunch and were incredibly pleased! The food in this restaurant is authentic and of high quality. You can really taste the fresh ingredients that they use as it brings the quality of their food to another level. I asked the server for recommendation and she told me that chicken cheese relleno and it was absolutely fantastic! Their pricing is a little bit higher than most restaurants Mexican out there; however, he really get what you pay for as you can tell as aforementioned that they use fresh ingredients.

They have a ton of tequilas for specialty margaritas as well. 

Now what really made it this Sunday morning/afternoon even that more enjoyable where the mariachis who were playing on their absolutely beautiful patio. These mariachis weren't the run of the mill musicians they were really talented. They created such a nice atmosphere for my wife, my mom and my daughter that we plan on going back again frequently. Here is a video of the mariachis on the patio: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaco5JB-yJI
