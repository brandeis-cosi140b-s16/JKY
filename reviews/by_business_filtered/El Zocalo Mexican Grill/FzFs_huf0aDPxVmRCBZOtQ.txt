Food was good but server and bartender really weren't.   Sign out front said try our Skinny no Sugar Margarita.   Bartender did squeeze the lime juice but then added a ton of Orange Liquor (tons of sugar and very sweet)  this is not a skinny Margarita,  not low carb and not sugar free.   Very  weak on the Tequila no where near worth the $13 each price tag and he sort of had an attitude when we questioned it.    Food came out wrong and even though all 4 of us heard the order our server still tried to question that we ordered it  right.   She also didn't do anything to make it right,  attitude like the bartender.   I doubt we will return.   Walk 4 doors down to DC Steakhouse,  great people,  great attitudes,  great value,  jump through hoops if anything isn't perfect.
