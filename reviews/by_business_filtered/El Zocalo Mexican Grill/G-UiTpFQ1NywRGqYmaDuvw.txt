I just got totally ripped off.  When I got the check I put half cash and my debit card thinking they would only charge the balance on my card..well They charged the whole bill on my card and said there was no cash in the binder!  When the manager came over he looked like a total idiot and all he could say was that the waiter was really good and couldn't have taken my money.  NEVER EVER going back there, total crooks!  Now I get to fight this through my bank..and the food really isn't that great....
