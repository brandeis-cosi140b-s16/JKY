First time visit and met some friends for dinner.  The place wasn't packed and our friends beat us there.  They had drinks and just  had some appetizer chip/dip dropped.  We sat for 25 minutes before a waiter asked us for our drink orders or to check on our friends.  He showed just in time because we were just voting on walking out an going somewhere else.  Again, the place wasn't overly busy, no excuse for delays.  We went ahead and ordered food at the same time as drinks since we had plenty of time to look at the menu.  Food came out in a fairly reasonable time after our order was placed.  It was very good, but not exactly worth the wait or poor service.  We had to flag down our guy for a refill on drinks and my wife never got her water, I gave her mine.  Needless to say we didn't order dessert.  I can excuse slow service on a full busy night especially if the food is outstanding.  Unfortunately, not the case for this place.  I probably will not be back since.  There are better Mexican experiences closer to home and better choices in the downtown Chandler area.
