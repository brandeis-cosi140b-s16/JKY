If you can get by the "not so dynamic" host at the door, you will have wonderful food and wonderful ambiance on the back patio! I highly recommend their fish tacos! I haven't had any others like this--in CA nor in Mexico! 

We have always had yummy food and this restaurant beats any chain Mexican restaurant out there! It is a MUST TRY!
