I have been here twice now, both times sitting inside. I need to see what their patio looks like though since everyone has been going on about it. In any event, I have enjoyed the food very much both times. The first time, I had the ahi tuna tacos and they were very tasty and I actually felt like I was eating something good for me which is rare when eating Mexican food. The second time, I ordered the vegetarian torta. Never having a torta before, I wasnt sure what to expect but after having it at El Zocalo, I will be having it more often. The bread was delicious, soft and warm. Even though there was no meat, there was plenty of avocado which made it filling. Their black beans are pretty good and their rice has a unique flavor to it which I enjoyed. Chips and salsa are great as well. I love the flavor of their salsa with just the right amount of kick. Also, the chips are made fresh and you can tell they are tortilla that has been deep fried in house. The service was great both times. My only complaints are that the prices are a bit higher than most other Mexican places, they make their drinks pretty strong (I am a wimp when it comes to strong drinks), and their bean dip was simply ok. It was good when you mixed it with salsa but if you didnt have salsa, it would need something more. In any event, this is a place I would return to if I was looking for light Mexican food though not often because of the price.
