Food was just like any other Mexican food but cost more. I've been to several restaurants and by far the worst service I've ever had! The server was not at all friendly and at the start before ordering we asked if we could split the bill and was told yes. Aside from refills on drinks we didn't see our server the entire time. When we did get the bill it was in one large bill. Then when he did split it her literally split the bill and when asked what he did his response was"I did exactly what you asked me to do." And handed the incorrect bill back. If there was a way to not have to pay the automatic gratuity we would have. The manager did nothing to apologize for his servers terrible service either. We will not be going back and will not recommend this place to anyone we know.
