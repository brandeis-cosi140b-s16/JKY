Have been several times and service and food has gone down hill each time. 

Went last night for dinner to enjoy the back patio... They had a special event so patio closed.  We sat inside it was so noisy we had to either yell to talk or just not speak.  Ordered steak fajitas and there was hardly any meat in them.  My husband ordered chili rellanos and lacked flavor and very unappealing to look at. 

I was bummed and wont return for dinner... Maybe drinks but only on the back patio

Big disappointment
