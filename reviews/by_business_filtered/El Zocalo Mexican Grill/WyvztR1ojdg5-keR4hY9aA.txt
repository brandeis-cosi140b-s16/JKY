The ensalada de zocalo was AMAZING!! Great healthy alternative at a great Mexican place! The atmosphere is cozy and very welcoming. Jaime was my server gave great recommendations!! Chips and salsa by far the BEST!! My friend had the chile verde burrito OMG this burrito is a MUST  HAVE!! Server informed me that they have  half off appetizers and drink specials! We will definitely be back!!
