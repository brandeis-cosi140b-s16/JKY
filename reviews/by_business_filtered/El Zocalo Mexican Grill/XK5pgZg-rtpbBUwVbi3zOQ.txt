I wanted to go here a couple times before giving a definitive review.  My initial gut reaction is that the place is a little pricey for Mexican food, but after going there a couple more times I think the atmosphere and quality definitely warrants the higher price range.

Speaking of atmosphere, this place is great!  That is probably why there is generally a wait on the big-ticket nights, but it's well worth hanging out in the bar for a few drinks.  If you can get a seat at the bar the bartenders will happily let you eat dinner there as well, which is a nice way to skip the wait.  Both times I've been there the live music was a great touch.  It's not uncommon to find a man playing guitar on the super-nice patio, or a full band playing in the main dining area.  Everyone around seems to generally be in a good mood, and the margaritas are definitely good.

I've had the tacos and the fajitas and both were excellent.  Tacos will run you in the $14/15 area, and fajitas are $17 but there was enough food including the beans and rice to take home some leftovers.

I would gladly head back to El Zocalo for grabbing a little Mexican food in a nice atmosphere.  Just don't make the mistake of wearing shorts and a t-shirt with sandals like I did because you'll stick out like a sore thumb!
