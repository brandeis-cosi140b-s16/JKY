We have been here a lot in the last year and this time was the worst experience we've had. We were told 15 minutes to be seated and it took 45. We waited 30 minutes to get the waitress to bring guacamole and take our meal order. It then took another 30 minutes to get fajitas to the table. When I asked to speak to the manager, it took him another 10 minutes to come to the table and he asked how our food was. He had no clue that everyone in that restaurant was also waiting forever for their food. I told him how long we had been waiting and he said that it only took 30 minutes to get our food and he was incredulous and rude when I said that we had been at the table for over 90 minutes. I thanked him for telling me that is now normal so I won't waste my (and the business groups I entertain) time. We won't be back.  Terrible.
