Hopped in here during a Wednesday night bar crawl. I guess Wednesday night isn't a happening night here. Perfect if you want a quiet place to talk to an old friend, have some drinks and not be bothered or let the atmosphere get in the way of your conversation. But we were four drunks on the road to nowhere and we each had one drink at the bar then decided the kitchen (where we could hear all the wild conversations going on through the door) was the most happening thing at this place so we voted to move on. Might come back if I need a quiet bar sometime. Noted. It's in the rectangular area between Buffalo Street and Boston Street and between San Marcos Place and North Arizona Place. Plenty of parking all over during a regular night. Weekends and during events, your mileage may vary.
