As you enter the restaurant a sign demands you enjoy the "award winning" patio.  Do as the sign says!  We were lead through the dinning area to a beautiful courtyard with lush trees and warm lighting.  Most tables were full but they are arranged in such a way that you can still enjoy a private conversation.  It reminded me of a Mexican version of Disney's Blue Bayou.  It was so enjoyable I did not mind at all paying the almost crazy prices for our meal and would return again.  I enjoyed good beans, excellent rice, passable chicken mole and a very well made drink.
