We've been in 3 times now and have had a great experience each time.  Everything we have ordered has been fresh and delicious. Last night I tried the Cadillac Margarita and it was honestly the BEST margarita I have ever had in my life.  This is a great spot to bring out of town guests due to the down town area.
Only downside, which is not the restaurant's fault, is the parking.  It can be a little tough to find a spot.
Highly recommend this place!
