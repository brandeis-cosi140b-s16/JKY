El Zocalo was the first place I ate after moving to Chandler. My expectations were so low that my original review was to high! I've eaten at Zocalo's three times since then. The only thing "exceptional" that I've had on the menu is the soup. And it is exceptional. Everything else I've tried was just "okay" including the salsa's. The steel patio type charis are uncomfortable and the service is slow. the last couple times i've been in the young male servers spend their time at the railing talking to the bartender looking bored and no one out helping customers. But again... i do love the soup!
