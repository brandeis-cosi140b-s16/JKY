Went here on Sunday for my brother's birthday. No one on the staff recognized the special occasion. The waiter that had our table looked pissed off the whole time he had us and was downright rude when we asked him to spit the check. Considering the restaurant was completely empty on a Sunday evening, so it's not like he had any other tables to attend to. Not to mention we had no choice but to pay a 20% auto gratuity because of our party size. A 20% tip for horrible service! Are you kidding me?!? When we asked for a manager to complain, he shrugged it off and was like oh well. Trust me go to Macayos or Garcia's instead. You'll get much better service, the same quality (if not better) food, and pay $4-5 a plate less.
