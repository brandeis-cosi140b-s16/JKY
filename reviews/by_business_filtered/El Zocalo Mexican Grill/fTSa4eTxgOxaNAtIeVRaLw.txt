A great spot for authentic Mexican food and a very cool atmosphere, especially if you sit out on the patio. We went on a Friday and it was hopping. Lot's of great margaritas on the menu but being a purist, I went for the Cadillac. Very tasty, especially as I got to number 3 & 4!
Started with the gucamole and it was excellent. Not too spicy with lot's of flavor. I had the carne asada and it was everything it was written up to be, cooked perfectly to medium rare, very tender & moist and a perfect portion. The chile verde was also excellent as was the verde chicken enchiladas and the chicken preparado. Right on track with flavors and portions perfect. For desert it was fried ice cream and sopaipillas that were close to the best I have ever had. 
We finished the night some excellent live  music while hoisting more beverages at the bar. It seriously was hard to find fault with anything here. Great fast service, even on a busy Friday night. It was a bit warm on the patio but very manageable with lot's of beverages. 
A must for locals and tourists alike.
