This is the second time I have eaten her and I am not impressed.  I decided to give it another try thinking it was possibly an off day, or maybe there was a new chef in the kitchen the first time I went.

No, sadly I had the same results.  The chips were good and seemed to be made from hand made tortillas (they were nice and thick with a good crunch).  And the re-fried beans were good.  The rest was very disappointing.  I ordered two shredded beef tacos and at first glance, they looked alright.  But what I bit into was not good at all.  The meat was so mushy, it was like what I could only think of as moist dog food out of a can.

The other plate had a taco and enchilada.  I did not try the enchilada, but was told it was not good either (coming from someone who loves and eats enchiladas all the time).

I know a lot of people love this place, but there is much better Mexican food to be had all over the Valley.
