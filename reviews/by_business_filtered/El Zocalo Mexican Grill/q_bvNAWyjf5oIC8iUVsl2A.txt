This place has a very nice patio. That being said their service is not that great. I may have seen my server twice the whole time I was there. There was a huge fan right behind my wife and I that was very loud making it hard to carry on a conversation. Their salsa is way too hot for me (it is very fresh though). The food is okay at best. I probably won't go there again due to the service.
