Great food with a really unique atmosphere. The patio in the back is a great place to enjoy a happy hour or semi private dinner. The arrangement of the tables gives the appearance of seclusion with strategically placed trees and plants. 
The service was great and its a fantastic place to enjoy authentic food in an outdoor atmosphere. Don't enjoy eating outside? No problem because the inside is just as enjoyable. You can't lose.
