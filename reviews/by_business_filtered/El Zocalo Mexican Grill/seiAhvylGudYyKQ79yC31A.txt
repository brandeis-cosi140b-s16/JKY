Really expensive for what it is. Nice looking place with really average food.

Would be awesome for a place to get this spot that had some really fine type of Mexican food like Dicks or Elote.

The service was quite bad also. Decent happy hour food but happy Margaritas at $8 is not exactly a great deal
