My boyfriend and I have been to El Zocalo a few times.  It is in downtown Chandler, and our fave spot is San Tan Brewery, but it is difficult to get into, and sometimes we just want a good margarita.  We are definitely fans of Tequila. 

If you have a chance, check out the patio, it is absolutely gorgeous out there when the weather is nice.  Its a nice large patio.  The night that we went we were hoping to get some good Happy Hour specials, and upon arrival (10-15min before 6) we were seated instantly, but I was kind of annoyed with the fact that it seemed to take the waiter awhile to get to us, which mankes me think they are hoping we miss  happy hour.  When we asked our waiter what was on special it was literally one drink, and an app. Kinda sucky for a Mexican place on a Friday night.  Needless to say that was disappointing. 

However, our margaritas were really good, he had a more "authentic" margarita, not too sweet which is what he prefers, and mine was perfect for me.  Complimentary chips with our drinks, and then we left.  I personally have never eaten  here, so I can't attest to their food, but everything I have seen looks good. 

Overall, cute atmosphere, and the margaritas are good, but can be pricey.  I hate when they don't put the price on their menu, I instantly think they are priced too high.
