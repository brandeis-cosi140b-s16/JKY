I have been to El Zocalo multiple times and alway experience very poor service. The last time I went we had a 30 minute wait, which is fine. After I saw 2 other couples get seated that arrived after us I inquired with the hostess. Her manager was standing there also and said he would seat us immediately. 10 minutes later I walked out of the restaurant and I won't be back!

The other times that i have eaten there, the food is so-so and overpriced.

There are definitely better Mexican food restaurants in Chandler. If you just want the downtown Chandler experience, I recommend one of the other restaurants.
