Awesome green beef. Spicy. 
This is like a real mom n pop mexican joint. Not much of a dine in experience - has a fast food feel to it. Genuine mexican food -- which i think i was taking for granted in the Phoenix area. But i would rate this better than others i tried in the area. 
The people are great -- they even let me taste a few of the meats before i chose my tacos. Will go again when i am in phx again.
