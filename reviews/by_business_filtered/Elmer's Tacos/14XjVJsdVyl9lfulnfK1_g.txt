I have heard a ton of good things about elmers. So I was expecting my first Elmers experience to be amazing. I got my food after a while of waiting, which was understandable due to the fact it was busy. I was not upset about this fact. What I was upset about was the fact that once I got my 2 mini chimichangas they were completely frozen in the middle. Not just cold, but frozen. The outer fried part was warm, and the inside tasted very well. But the fact that it was frozen makes me skeptical on going back again.
