Such a unique and tasty approach to Mexican/American style cuisine.  The Green chile tamale was sweet and tasty.  Never had a sweet tamale before.  The Machaca burrito was super good.  My girlfriend got a mini chimi that I thought would be super crunchy but it wasnt and was delicious.  However, the best part of the meal was the flavor in their refried beans.  The lady made a perfect Horchata with light ice,  New to the area, but this is my new spot.
