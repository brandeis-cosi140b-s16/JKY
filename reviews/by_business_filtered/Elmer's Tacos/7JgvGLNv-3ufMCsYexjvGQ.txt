I know I can't be the only one that thought of Elmer's glue when first seeing the name of this place.  Anywho, after a couple of visit to Elmer's, I have decided that Elmer's is a decent little joint.  I like it! 

Elmer's Taco's is a cozy fast food restaurant where you order up front, take a seat, and wait for your order number to be called.  The food they serve up here is Sonoran style.  Get your tamales, green chile mini burritos, bean and cheese burritos, machaca, and other delicious food here!  They also serve cheese and strips which are tortilla chips topped with freshly shredded cheese, not melted.  No matter what you order though, don't forget to get their salsa.  Brett B. had informed me that the horchata served here is powdered and that's why it's pretty gritty to drink.  That sucker leaves me more thirsty after drinking it.

Across the street is Chandler High so if you want to beat the rush, come in before 11:30AM or after 1:00PM. The lunchtime rush consists mainly of Chandler High students and boy is it a rush --- the line goes out the door!

So yes, come here for some decent eats!  Food is always hot, the staff are friendly and loud, and the tables are kind of small and cramped so you might want to take it home.  It's a hole-n-the-wall shop that delivers some good eats.

P.S. No glue is served here.  ;P
