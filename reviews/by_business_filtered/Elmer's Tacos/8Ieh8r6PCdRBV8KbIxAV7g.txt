I really don't know why this place gets so many good reviews. It is very dirty. Very old. It gets busy and the service is horribly slow. And honestly the food is just greasy and nasty.

The reviews say it's a great place for cheap good Mexican food. But it's not even cheap.

The salsa is not fresh. And the guacamole is pretty tasteless. When you order tortilla chips and salsa... They put package shredded cheese on and not melted.

I had a taco salad and I couldn't even finish eating it. 

If you like really quick and bad American Mexican food and then this is the place for you.
