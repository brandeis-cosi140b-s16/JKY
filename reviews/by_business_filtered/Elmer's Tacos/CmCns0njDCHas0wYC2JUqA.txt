Elmer's has always been a favorite stop for our visits to Arizona. We've been going there for years. On this trip we were very disappointed with the apparent changes. Maybe there is a new owner? The food quality has taken a dive. It was overly greasy and poorly prepared. Why did they have to change? I guess we'll have to cross Elmer's off our list and it pains me to do so. Also, no more tamarindo and jamaica.
