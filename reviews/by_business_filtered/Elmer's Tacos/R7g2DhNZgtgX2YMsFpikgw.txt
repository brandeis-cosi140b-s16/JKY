Love this little dive every time I stop in. Food is great, fast, and priced just right. I know it's been around for over 30 years and glad it also has student discounts for the local high schoolers. The usual ladies are friendly and know the locals and regulars. My fave is simple chips and heaps of cheese and ms well as taco combo.
