Came here with a coworker. Heard these guys had bomb food and I've been wanting a California carne asada burrito. Place was pretty small but didn't look too gross from the inside (i get grossed out easily when i see that a  restaurant doesnt keep their place clean and u can just tell if its dirty or not) 

Cashier was very nice and there weren't any lines (got there around 12:30pm on a Friday) Anyways, I bought a cali burrito no pico de gallo with French fries and sour cream for about $7. Wasn't too excited about it. Didn't Wow me at all.  I actually was expecting more from here especially with the good reviews. Maybe I just came on the wrong day or something. Burrito was medium sized. Del taco got bigger burritos for the same price. Anyways I won't be here anytime soon. 

It was ehhhh
