Definitely one of my all time fave mexi spots in AZ. Located directly across from Chandler High School, and somewhat of a small spot so if you aren't paying attention you can pass it right on up. 

I've never had any complaints on their food as it's always been fresh and tasty to the very last bite. I miss not living on that side of town in regards to missing out on good lil spots like this. North Scottsdale doesn't really have any good hole in the wall spots for mexi food, so it's a treat when I can make a stop by here
