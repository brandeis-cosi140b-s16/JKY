So worth the drive out of my way! Dining at Elmer's was a life changing experience. At first, the place is not much to look at, though I find many of my favorite spots are that way. I came here after I tried them out at the booth they had at Oktoberfest, where my daughter had an epic bean and cheese burrito. On this visit we had a mini chimmi and taco plate, as well as an enchilada plate, both came with beans and rice. Everything was so delicious.... Totally hit the spot, now I know why this place has been there forever. We will be back, can't wait for my next visit!!!!
