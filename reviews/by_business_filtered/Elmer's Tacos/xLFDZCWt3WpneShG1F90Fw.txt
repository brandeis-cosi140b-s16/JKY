Very impressed with the menu items I've tried so far.  Ranking at the top is their green chile burrito, which is beef, not pork, but that's ok.  The taste is there, and is every bit as good as El Zocalo's, just different.

Coming in a close second is their bean and cheese cone.  Yeah, I didn't know what to think when I saw it advertised on their wall, but since it was a 'dollar menu' item, I was down.  It surpassed my wildest expectations.  The 'cone' was a fantastic deep fried flour tortilla.  I got it for my grand daughter, but ended up eating half of it.  Bad Grandpa.

Pulling up in third place was their green chicken mini burro.  Just the right size, and tasted great.

Elmer's is now on my radar when I'm hankering for local Mexican fare.  And 'bean and cheese cone'... we will meet again, and again.
