Ok yelp nation if you read my review if The Round Corner Cantina, or Reyna Foods taco stand, then you know that I HATE HATE HATE fake Mexican food. Despite their commercials on TV with the offensive fake Mexican accent, the food here is crap. So is the service. And the decor.  Here is the story of my latest trip. 

We will start with the decor. It was bland and boring and just rang of some gringo's idea of what Mexico looks like based on a Speedy Gonzalez cartoon. Plus the tables are so small a party of four didn't have enough room for drinks and plates; we had to hijack a nearby empty table because the plates were so huge. 

On to the service now. One big note to good service: don't be strung out when working. Our server looked like she was going to dope nod at any minute at the table. She took her merry time getting drinks (15 minutes for 2 drafts) she checked in in us maybe once. The only upside was that the food came out quickly. 

The downside to food coming out quickly is that it was all reheated from a bag. I got the sampler platter figuring I could try a large variety of offerings. Big mistake. I should have gotten one crap meal instead about six. The chicken was dry and tough. The tamale corn was soggy and gritty. The tortillas were crap. The ground beef looked like Taco Bell beef. All of it was covered in a plasticky sauce that tasted like spicy nothing. The rice was hard. The refried beans were processes and pur√©ed to the point where they resembled something to exit a dysentery riddled newborn.  If they charged Taco Bell prices I wouldn't be as upset but this wasn't cheap either. 

To finish up Emiliano's is a stain on the name of Mexico. They know most Americans wouldn't know authentic Mexican cuisine if it walked up and punched them in the face. So they buy in a bunch of processed flavorless crap, microwave it, and send it out as "authentic". This place is crap. Steer clear.
