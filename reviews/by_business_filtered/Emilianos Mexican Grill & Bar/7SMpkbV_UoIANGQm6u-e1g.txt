I stopped in on the cold snap last January. i parked in front and was planning on going somewhere else, but it was so cold I didn't want to walk outside.

They serve totally standard Mexican fare. Don't expect a huge beer selection. There are free chips and salsa to start. The food I did order was pretty good and the margarita was good as well.

I will definitely keep it in mind to try again sometime!
