Mexican food may be my favorite.  There are a lot of options around the area, but I always seem to gravitate toward Emiliano's....because they are awesome!

The atmosphere is very fun, without being over the top.  I can hold a conversation with my fellow diners without having to lose my voice.  And the food is amazing too!

Every meal starts with chips and salsa.  I usually judge a Mexican restaurant on their salsa, and Emiliano's definitely hits the nail on the head.  Not to mention, the chips are warm when they bring them to your table.  Warm chips and salsa?  Sign me up!

I always get a margarita, on the rocks, no salt, with a coronita in it.  They are not too sweet, which is something that I often notice about restaurant margaritas (so much SUGAR).  When it comes times to order food, most recently I got Flautas.  There was MORE than enough food to feed my belly, and I had leftovers for the next day.  Emiliano's also makes a killer guacamole... Seriously, try it!
