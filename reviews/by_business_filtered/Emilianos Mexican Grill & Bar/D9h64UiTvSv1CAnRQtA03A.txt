I find this is a chili's with a different name. Don't get me wrong it's good Tex Mex but not true Mexican. The food is good and hits the spot but it's nothing special. That being said I enjoyed my Fajita Texana. That was loaded with onions and meat. My mojito was also good. The price is fair and the food is good. The best thing about the place is that they have outdoor seating and the sun shines on that side of the street until sunset, so on a nice day it's worth just going to sit outside with chips and a beer. Worth a try if your hungry and walking around south side and not in the mood for bar food.
