I have eaten here several times. I highly recommend looking for the "Emiliano's Specialties" which are marked on the menu and ordering one of those and skipping the standard Mexican Restaurant fare if you want something different or really authentic. 

Things like the cheese enchiladas and chicken fajitas are pretty pedestrian. I mean, they taste the same here as they did at most other restaurants - if that is what you are hungry for, you will be pleased. I have gotten both of those items and been completely satisfied with their quality because I haven't expected them to be better than all the others I have had. When a restaurant has a large menu, you can pretty much assume the basics aren't going to have a lot of extras going into them, you know?

If you're looking for something more authentic, the chili rellenos that are marked with the "house specialty" icon are really good. Their corn flour has a unique, sweet flavor that balances well with the pepper and cheese. If you're looking for something more TexMex the chicken with bacon and Monterrey Jack cheese fajitas are really tasty. The bacon is just an unexpected salty/smokey flavor that pairs well with the creamy cheese and roasted peppers and onions. 

I like their salsa, but if you don't like cilantro, you might not. I have gotten their chips warm and room temp, the warm ones were MUCH better. Also, I love that they refill the chips and salsa for free. If the first batch isn't warm, you have a second chance. 

My main reason for not giving the place 4 stars is the service, which is more hit and miss. I have gotten excellent service here when it's been packed and marginal (possibly untrained, hard to tell) service here when it's pretty empty. Last time we were there, all the tables around us received much better service because they had a different server.
