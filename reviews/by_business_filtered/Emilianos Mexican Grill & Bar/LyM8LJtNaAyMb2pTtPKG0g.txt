4 of us decided to stop here for lunch on Saturday.   We ordered cocktails and it took about 20 minutes to get them.  They were awful.  We ordered guac and never got it.  Finally, an hour later we got our food.  Mine looked nothing like the picture.  It was an egg on top of tortilla chips.  We won't be back.
