Yeeeeah. This place was okay. Unfortunately for them, I loooove Mexican food and this was my first fix in months. So from lack of delicious Mexican food, my standards had risen. Sure, they have free chips and salsa. That's standard, right? I though the service was a little slow once the check was dropped, but will say, for lunch, the price and quickness of the food was decent. It may have had something to do with the fact that there was only 2 other people in the place. I've had better, but don't know where in Pittsburgh. Anyone? Hello? Is this thing on?
