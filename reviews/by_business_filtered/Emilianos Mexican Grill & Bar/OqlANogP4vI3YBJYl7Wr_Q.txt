Emiliano's never ceases to amaze me with their portions in... everything! I got a pitcher of lime margarita on the rocks to split with my friend and it was enough to gracefully put, get you plastered gloriously. The food has always been quite yummy, although I do wish they do a little better job with their presentation. Overall, very happy with this place and would come back always! 

One small recommendation: I think it would be awesome to have some TVs put in the dining area showing Telemundo Spanish soap operas. I cannot get enough of the drama.
