My best friend used to work at the Emiliano's in the North Hills and didn't have great things to say about the place (namely that her paychecks repeatedly bounced) so I was sort of skeptical.  I ended up being pleasantly surprised.

There was no wait for a table for 2 at 6:00 on a Friday night.  Our waiter asked us for drinks, promptly brought them, and was great about refilling them throughout the meal.  The menu is pretty extensive, as is the drinks/dessert menu.  I was not feeling any of the vegetarian options (no cheese chiles rellenos :( ) so I did a Create Your Own Combo, as did my roommate.  I got 2 cheese enchiladas with rice and refritos ($8.49); he got a chicken burrito, a chicken enchilada, and a beef quesadilla with rice and refritos ($9.49).  We were both enjoying the free chips and salsa when the food arrived.  Almost too quickly - makes me wonder if it was pre-prepared and just microwaved.

At any rate, it was good.  There's not too much to say about cheese enchiladas, rice, and beans, but they were good.  My roommate enjoyed all his food as well.  We ordered a fried ice cream for dessert, which was very good.  Total before tip was about $28.

I really enjoyed this place - it wasn't crowded, service was really quick, and it seemed like a pretty good value.  I definitely wouldn't mind coming back.
