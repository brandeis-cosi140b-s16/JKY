All in all, it was pretty good. The service was good, the margaritas were good, but the food was just okay. Starting with the service - we were greeted immediately by a friendly hostess. The could have seated us immediately, but we choose to sit at the bar. The bartender was also very friendly and attentive. I ordered whichever margarita was on special, and although it was pre-mixed, it was delicious. The food on the other hand was a little disappointing. I thought my quesadillas were a bit bland, but my friend loved her carnitas nachos, so maybe it was an off-night for quasadillas.

I'll be back for more margaritas, and will update my review if I change my mind about the food.
