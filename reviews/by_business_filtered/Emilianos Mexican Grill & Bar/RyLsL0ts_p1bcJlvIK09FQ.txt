This isn't a gourmet mexican restaurant but I think the quality of food for the price is excellant. I live in the South Side and I stop by here for happy hour at least once a month. Even if you miss the happy hour bottles of wine are REALLLY reasonable ($20-25 for decent bottles)

Note: The food is ready in about 5 minutes no matter how busy it is which is a plus for me!
