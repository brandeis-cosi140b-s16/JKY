Great Mexican restaurant in Pittsburgh! First of all, you get free chips and salsa at lunch and dinner, which is a huge bonus and the chips are fresh/hot with a unique and flavorful salsa (unlimited refills).

I usually ordered the steak fajitas - the meat was grilled to perfection and very tender and the fajitas exactly how they should be with the right amount of seasoning, served piping hot and in a timely fashion.

Occasionally, the service could have been a little faster and the guacamole is slightly bland but overall this was my go-to spot for a good, sit down Mexican meal in Pittsburgh.
