Queso fundido (appetizer made at table-side on a super hot cast iron plate) and Pollo Mexicano was too much food for a 1-person lunch but EXCELLENTE!  They may have surpassed El Campesino as my favorite local Mexican place.  Very good service also.  I need to go to the gym multiple times after that lunch but I left with a smile on my face.  I have tried 3 different things on last 3 visits and all were excellent.  Who said you could not find good Mexican food in Pittsburgh?
