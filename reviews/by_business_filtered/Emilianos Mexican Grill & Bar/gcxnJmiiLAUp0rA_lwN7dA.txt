I received a gift card for here for Christmas and got to use it for lunch with my mom.  Despite the prices on most of the menu being more than $12, the lunch versions were very well priced, and comparable with much cheaper-tasting food and atmosphere (like Qdoba, around $8 a person including soft drink). We ended up not using the entirety of my $25 gift card, which was not what I was expecting.

We both had quesadillas, and were both extremely happy with their taste, as well as the freshly made free appetizer chips and salsa. The rice was cooked well, which is something that I've never encountered at a Mexican lower-priced restaurant before.

Our waiter was actually Mexican (authentic Mexican cuisine?), and very helpful and polite. Will definitely be going back for lunch some time.
