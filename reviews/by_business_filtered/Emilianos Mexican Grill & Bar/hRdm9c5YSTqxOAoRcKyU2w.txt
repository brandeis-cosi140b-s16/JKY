Table.  Side.  Guacamole.  Need I say more?

This is a tasty place to visit when you're in South Side Works.  Though their food is a little bland, maybe pre-made in some cases, it's a nice treat if you're looking to satisfy your hankering for fresh made tortilla chips or a tangy margarita.

I've been here a few times thus far.  Recently I ordered a taco salad, since the weather was H-O-T and I couldn't consume anything heavy.  It wasn't the typical taco salad with the sour cream, salsa, and plop of meat.  My grilled chicken was flavorful and it was topped with delicious veggies that my stomach greatly appreciated.  I was unsure about the salad dressing, cilantro lime, but the waiter urged me to try it.  Kudos to him for that recommendation!  Sweet, tart, and LIGHT!  All of that with a crisp and tasty shell, I left one happy girl. 

OH!  I forgot to mention my Sangria Margarita - or as I call it - the Sangarita.  What a perfect combination.  Sweet, tart, tangy, with a kick of tequila - a cool summer cocktail which I will enjoy all summer long.

I rate this a 3.5 - if the food was a bit more flavorful, it would be a solid 4.
