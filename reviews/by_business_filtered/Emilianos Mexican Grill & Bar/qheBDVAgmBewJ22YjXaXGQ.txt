I had just moved to Pittsburgh and was home sick for Mexican food, so my family and I decided to visit Emilianos. I ordered beef enchiladas, my son ordered beef tacos and we both got ground beef...yuk! The food is NOT authentic Mexican food at all. The Beans are not fresh, rice is not Mexican, no mexican ingredients! !  The service was horrible.  This is not a Mexican restaurant
Just because you free chips and salsa dont mean its good!
