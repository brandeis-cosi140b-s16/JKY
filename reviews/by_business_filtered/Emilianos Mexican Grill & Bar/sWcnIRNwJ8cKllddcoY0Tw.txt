All I have to say is--Chi-Chi's LIVES!
If you like middle-of-the-road Tex-Mex, prepared for the tastes of white people in
Northern Rust Belt cities (and I am not embarrassed to say that, once in a while, I do)...then this place is for you.  Just check your expectations before you enter...

It really reminded me of eating at Chi-Chi's back in the day.
I had some nachos with refried beans that tasted like the beans came right out of the Ortega can.  It was topped with shredded iceberg lettuce and the dish was lined with American cheese.  Like the kind that comes wrapped in plastic.  No queso Oaxaca or nopales here, but the chips were good and I ate it all.  And it was good.

I had fish tacos for my entree, which were OK as well, though the sauce was a little bland.  (I think it was French dressing).   The margaritas tasted like they came straight from some prepared bottled mix.

It was kinda what I was in the mood for....and judging by the Southside Works area, which is filled with crappy chain experiences of every shape and size, it is what I was expecting.
