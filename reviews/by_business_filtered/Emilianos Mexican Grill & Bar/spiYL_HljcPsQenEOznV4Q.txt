This place is fantastic! The margaritas are delicious. My favorite is the enchilada suiza. Also, the queso is to die for! Very creamy and cheesy. Best guac I've had in Pittsburgh so far. 

The restaurant itself is clean and they bring your food very quick. They always make sure you have plenty of chips and drinks!
