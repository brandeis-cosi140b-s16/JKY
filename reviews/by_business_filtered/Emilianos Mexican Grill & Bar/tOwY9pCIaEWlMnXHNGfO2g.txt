Every time I walk by this place, I see a huge crowd waiting to be seated. Out of curiosity once day I decided to give this place a try. I do love Mexican food. Emiliano's is pretty spacious inside and the service was great! They told us a 30 minute wait, but we were seated within 10 minutes. 

I started off with the Trio dip, which came with guacamole, white cheese sauce and pico de gallo. The chips were warm and crispy and the dips were fresh. For my main entr√©e, I ordered the Chimichanga with beef, which came with a side of rice and lettuce/pico. I wasn't very impressed with the chimichanga or the side of rice. It was pretty much pieces of beef inside a burrito that was tossed into the deep fryer. The meat was really dry and kind of lacking in flavors and spices. The side of rice was too mushy. 

Overall, I thought the food at Emiliano's was okay. I feel like I have had better Mexican food. Nothing I tasted here really captivated my taste buds. Prices are reasonable. I do have one major complaint though: SLIPPERY BATHROOM!
