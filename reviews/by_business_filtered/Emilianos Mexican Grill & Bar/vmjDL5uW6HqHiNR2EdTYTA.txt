I came here for lunch and was very happy with the menu. I liked the flavor of the salsa but I have had better chips. I ordered a small side of guacamole and it was good but too creamy. I am sure the table side order is much better and fresher. I then ordered the steak tacos. The portion was perfect! The meat was tender and bite size. I really liked the tomatillo salsa and the red was a little too hot for me. The refried beans were creamy and topped with cheese. I did not try the rice because I'm not a fan. The interior is colorful and inviting with lots of room for small or large parties. If I am back in town I will be coming here again!
