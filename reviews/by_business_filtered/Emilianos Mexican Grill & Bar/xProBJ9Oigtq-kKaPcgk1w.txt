I was pleasantly surprised with this place. We went for lunch. My son loved the complimentary chips and salsa. I ordered the chicken and rice soup for him but ended up eating it myself (he was more interested in the chips). The soup was awesome. I love the avocado, Spanish rice and tomatoes in it. For our meal, I ordered steak fajitas. It came with refried beans, lettuce, rice, tomato, and guacamole. All together it was a tasty meal  After having the soup, I took half of my meal home. Not a bad lunch for less than $10.
