Emiliano's is a place I can see myself going a lot. I needed a relatively cheap, laid-back restaurant to take my date, and it fit the criteria perfectly. 

The good: 

Free chips and salsa, keeps your mind off waiting for your food, and the fresh chips and salsa were excellent. 

Excellent service. My waiter was always bringing me more tea, without asking, and kept out chip basket filled. We also were just conversing about an unidentified yellow cube on my date's plate, and a passing waitress let us know that it was mango, asked us if we needed anything, and let us be again.

Portions were more than enough. I missed lunch, and between the chips and my entree I left stuffed, and I'm a bigger guy. Also, entrees are around $12-15, appetizers are about $4 for bean dip, cheese dip, or guacamole (which was very good) and $6-8 for other typical appetizers. The price was definitely fair, but I wouldn't say it was a steal either.

I had an excellent chicken and veggies over rice dish (something con pollo), and would recommend it. Very crisp vegetable tastes that still blended with the cheese sauce and sour cream. I loved every bite. My date got the appetizer quesadillas, and said they weren't anything special, and the bite I took of them confirmed this. 

The bad: 

The atmosphere is laid back, especially for the two seat tables. The booths looked cozy though. It's a nice place to take a girl if you're not looking for anything too serious, just a quick bite and a movie.

The menu seems kind of inaccessible, so if you're bringing a group or date that's not up to snuff on the cuisine terms, you'll have to do a bit of explaining.

The prices were right on, expect to get what to pay for, but not much more.

Overall a good place to grab a bite, and I'd recommend it to a friend, so it's gotten my nod of approval.
