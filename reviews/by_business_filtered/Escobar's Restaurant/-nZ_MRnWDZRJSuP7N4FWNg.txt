WOW!!!!!!

A great place for a fine dining evening. 

A couple friends and I went to Escobar's after reading some rave reviews. We entered the restaurant and the place was packed. It was about 6:30. We didn't have to wait long before they offered us a table in the bar room. The ambience was nice and the food was delicious.

Our wait staff was a little slow and it took them a while to come around to refill our water and our bread basket, but the entree and overall experience made up for it.

I ordered their white sangria. I must tell you that if you like sweet and fruity drinks, definitely order it it. It was so good that my friends decided to order it as their second drink.

For our food, we decided to start off with the Coconut-crusted shrimp with orange-jalape√±o dipping sauce. It was pretty good. The best part was the sauce.

My entree, I ordered the Phyllo-wrapped lamb loin filled with goat cheese, rosemary, and coriander, served with red-skin mashed potatoes and port reduction. It it a mouthful to say and I must say that it is worth every word. The lamb was cooked perfectly and all the sides were very complimentary. I would definitely order this dish again.

Overall, I give this place an A. I would definitely go back to try all the other dishes on their menu.
