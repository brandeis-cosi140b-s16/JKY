Great choices that are well prepared.  

I had the ceviche tonight followed by the pheasant and it was delicious.  Only complaint (and this is a bit snobbish) would be that there was a little much onion in the ceviche.  
Besides that the wait was fairly long (25min) for my entree despite the restaurant being almost empty but I have to say it was definitely coming straight out of the oven and the preparation of my pheasant did not leave anything to be desired.  Solid 4 stars.  If I was back in town I would come here again.
