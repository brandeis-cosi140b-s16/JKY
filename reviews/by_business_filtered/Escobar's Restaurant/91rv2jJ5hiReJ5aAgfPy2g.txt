Consistently excellent.  This is probably the best restaurant in Champaign County right now for quality of food and preparation.
The atmosphere is not wild, but the acoustics are great for a dinner conversation, the waitstaff is highly trained and professional, and the meals are works of art.
Great wines and good ingredients are used to make for wonderfully delicious tastes.
If you want to be sure that no one in your party is disappointed, this is the place to go.  I award it 5 stars because of service and presentation.
