Went Thursday night for a late dinner with my husband.  This was my first trip to escobar but middle son, who had been there before, refused to go because he claimed the atmosphere was too uninviting.  This was unusual for him to refuse to go out because he is a serious boy-about-town and never misses an opportunity to experience anything.
OK, i'm sorry to say the aesthetic sensibilities of my 12 year old are a bit more fine tuned than whoever designed the interior of this restaurant.  It's all hard surfaces so the feel is very cold and extremely loud.  I asked my husband twice throughout the meal if he would be mad at me if I asked the people at the table next to us to stop laughing in such an annoying pitch.  Since he reminded me that i am not Larry David and nobody would find it funny, i refrained.  
onto the food.  we had a spinach salad with mangos, shrimp, cucumbers, and red onions in a citrusy dressing.  this was good.  definitely fresh.  then we had a grouper over rice with veggies...eh, it was ok.  very large portions as in enough to feed 2 hungry adults, which worked well since we shared everything.  the fish was very fresh though so i give it 4 stars for that.  then we ordered coffee and bananas flambe.  the coffee had to be sent back because it was so weak and instead we ordered espressos.  i rarely ever send anything back probably because i hate wasting anything, but this was reeeeeeeeeeeeeally bad coffee.  Our waitress even agreed that she has to doctor her coffee when she drinks it here due to the weakness.  But the bananas and the caramel sauce...now that is worth 4 stars.  Would i go back?  No.  Should you try it?  Yes.  There seemed to be a lot of people there having a good time, laughing loudly.
