Me and a bunch of friends went there for Sunday Brunch and the food was really good! The service was a little mediocre, they brought us other tables orders and were a little slow but it was a busy day. The food is definitely more unique than other places I've been to on campus and it was refreshing to try something a little different. The presentation of the food was very good and overall everyone was pleased with the meal. I would definitely go back for brunch again.
