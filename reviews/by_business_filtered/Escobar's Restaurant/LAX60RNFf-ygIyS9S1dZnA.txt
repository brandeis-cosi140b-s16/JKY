I really enjoy going to Escobar's!  I've been a few times, most recently for their fish tacos on "taco tuesday."  Also, my boyfriend and I happened to get there a little early for the early-bird special from 5-6pm: fish tacos (or a couple other options), plus soup for only a $1 more.  We tried the red pepper gazpacho and some kind of pork stew; both were delicious.  Definitely recommend this place!
