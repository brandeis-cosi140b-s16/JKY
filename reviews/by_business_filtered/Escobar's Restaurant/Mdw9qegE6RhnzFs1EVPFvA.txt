A group of us went in and everyone found a dish suited to their tastes and prefrence.  Even though we were all somehow related we represent a diverse group.  My daughter was just back from Spain and other countries beyond.  She was thick into the land of authentic tapas. My oldest son is just expanding his pate a bit beyond McDonalds and my youngest son is up for most anything these days.  My 90 plus year old mother has allergies and is crazy food sensitive and really is not fond of much in the way of anything edible these days. I was wondering if she would turn her plate over and make a face. Thank goodness no childhood flash backs cropped up for her.  My brother in law is strictly carnivore.  I was impressed that everyone found a dish.  Well done Escobar.  Oh, and I recommend a mojito if the weather is warm or maybe if you just are wishin warm breezy thoughts.  Ha ..If somehow you find they don't have them available..go home and have one ..they make family time much more tolerable.
