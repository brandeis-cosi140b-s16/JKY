It's a couple blocks off the beaten path in downtown Champaign and a bit hidden. But well worth a visit. I had the hanger steak carne asada and my daughter the shrimp and scallop dinner. Best food I've had in Champaign/Urbana yet. Wait staff very pleasant and attentive as well. I highly recommend Escobars!
