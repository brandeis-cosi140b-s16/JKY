While the owners may be Guatemalan, Escobar is a swanky pan-Latino flavor fiesta.  It's on the higher end of the restaurants for Chambana, and it's nicely done without being too overdone.  I ordered the tilapia, which came in a delicious mixed sauce with sauteed vegetables.  YES.  'Twas wondrous.

After a great time chatting with fellow graduate students, professors, and a prospective student, it came time for dessert.  And they had bananas flambe.  Now two of my favourite things in life are desserts and unnecessary applications of fire.  And this bananas flambe was absolutely marvelous.  I was filled with happiness.  And BANANAS.

All in all, the service was extraordinarily friendly, the food was well-plated, nicely prepared, and delicious; and the ambiance was pitch perfect.  NICE.
