Seriously, what's so fancy about this place when the food and the atmosphere doesn't reflect anything close to fine-dining. I have eaten million times in fine-dining places from L.A. to Europe and this is DEFINITELY NOT the place to experience delicious fine dining. However the prices and portions does fit to the fine-dining definition unlike the taste, service and atmosphere.
