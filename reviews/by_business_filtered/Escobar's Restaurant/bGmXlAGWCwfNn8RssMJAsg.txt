I must admit it is taking a little while for this place to grow on me but mainly because I like simple food without all of the frou-frou fanfare.  But I thought it worth mentioning that I had a fantastic hangar steak and garlic mashed potatoes there recently.  Very simple, just meat and potatoes.  It was great.

And the restaurants is very nice inside as well, we like the bar area.
