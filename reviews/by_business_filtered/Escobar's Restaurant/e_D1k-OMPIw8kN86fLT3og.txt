This is a lovely, if noisy space, a beautiful rehab done on several contiguous buildings in the nascent loft district north of downtown.  Service here can be spotty, but I have been happy with the food for what it is.  It is not really what I would call Nuevo Latino or Latino fusion, such as a Cuatro in the South Loop in Chicago.  It is more Americanized, with some influences of Latino cuisine.  That said, I have had good steak and pork here, and the tres leches (three milk) cake is excellent.  I suggest eating in the bar area.  Quieter, full service, there are tables there as well.
