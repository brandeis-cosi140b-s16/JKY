They get points for presentation but that's pretty much where it ends. 

Service: Decent and attentive once we flagged someone down and asked to talk to someone about ordering! It took them about 5 minutes to get to that point.

Appetizer: We had the morrocan-style mussels; probably the only well-seasoned dish of the night. Tasty, but not the best I've ever had.

Entrees: The seafood paella is not a paella; its a bunch of seafood in a pot, with rice and sauce buried at the bottom. It was a beautiful presentation, and the seafood was cooked well but woefully underseasoned. None of the sauce touched the seafood, and the sauce was sub-par at best. It's Latin American food, right? Seasoning?!
The phylo-wrapped lamb is an inventive dish, and beautifully presented. I think their chef went to beauty school, not culinary school. Again, underseasoned and the glaze seemed to be missing something...salt probably. 

Drinks: The mango margarita tasted like it was laced with lighter fluid or nailpolish remover. Their wine selection was really good.
