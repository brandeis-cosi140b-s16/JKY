OUTSTANDING lunch.  I had the shrimp po boy and could go every week for lunch, my lunch buddy had the taco salad and it looked wonderful too.  My sandwich was a good size, sweet potato fries and a green salad, I thought it was a great value for 12 bucks. The only thing I would change is make it Coke instead of Pepsi
