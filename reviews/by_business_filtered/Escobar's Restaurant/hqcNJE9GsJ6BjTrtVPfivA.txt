Normally I just go to Escobar's for lunch, and it's a good lunch with decent service.  We decided to try dinner last Friday.  We got there before the dinner rush and there were several empty tables so we were seated qucikly.  The waiter came to our table right away and told us about the specials etc.  We ordered drinks and our dinner and still the resturant was not quite half full.  We waited for our meal as the resturant filled up.  We knew it would take a little longer than chain resturants as the food was cooked to order and that was ok, but 50 minutes late we were still waiting and realized that most people around us had their meal already. that was about the time the waiter came up to let us know the "computer had eaten our order and it had been so long since it took the order he forgot what we'd ordered"  We should have left at that point, but didn't, and re-ordered.  There was no rush placed on our dinners as people who we heard order at that time got their food just before we did.  In all we waited an hour and 20 minutes to get our food.  Before the waiter told us our order had been eaten the service was great and glasses were kept full, after that we only saw him when we got our food and check.  

I sort of expected them to discount the meal.  We'd put almost 2 hours on the meter (as the lot was full) and barely made it back before our time expired.  

I'll probably go back for lunch, but I doubt they will make the cut for dinner again :(
