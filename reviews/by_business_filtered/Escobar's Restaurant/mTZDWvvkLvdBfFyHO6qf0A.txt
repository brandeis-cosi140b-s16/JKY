Consistently, I have always had very good food here. Recently, we ate at the bar.  Hopefully, the owner or management will read this... THE LIGHTING IS HORRIBLE!
I've been in the hospitality business for over 35 years and I am a major "Foody".  Three things that can spoil my dining experience is bad food, bad service, and bad atmosphere/lighting.  At Escobar, the food and service is good and the atmosphere in the dining room is decent.  But the bar... I couldn't wait to leave. I experienced the very same thing at the sister restaurant Milos where the entire restaurant has horrible lighting.  The food and service was wonderful, but because of the atmosphere/lighting, I never wanted to return.
