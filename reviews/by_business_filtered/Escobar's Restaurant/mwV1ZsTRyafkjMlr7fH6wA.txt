Arguably the best restaurant in town for your buck, the menu at Escobars changes with the seasons. The chefs do a terrific job incorporating fresh ingredients with a Latin theme throughout their menu. 

The brunch is AWESOME. I recommend the eggs Benedict. For lunch, you can't go wrong with the Cuban sandwich. It's been a staple in my diet the past 4 years. The fish tacos are the bees knees and when they have the seafood paella on the menu it's arguably the best dish in town. I highly encourage you all to try the calamari as an appetizer- it's a huge appetizer. I'm craving a Cuban sandwich now, hats off to you Escobar's
