Traveling for business, I sat in the bar on a Sunday night. The restaurant wasn't very full and there were only two of us eating in the bar. I had a garden salad and pork chop for dinner. Both were far above average. The salad was full of mixed greens, not a piece of iceberg lettuce to be found. The Porkchop was tender and flavorful. I had the sauce served on the side just in case but ended up really enjoying the added flavors. This restaurant isn't inexpensive but it's certainly reasonably priced, especially compared to a similar menu in a larger city.
