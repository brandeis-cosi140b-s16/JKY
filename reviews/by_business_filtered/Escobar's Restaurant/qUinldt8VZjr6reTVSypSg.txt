Pricey but amazing. Everything I've ever had there is top-notch. And when you're there for brunch, you get bottomless MUFFINS! And they're amazing muffins. Try the pupusa if they still have it on the menu (I think the menu changes a lot). This place TROUNCES Radio Maria. Trounces. I can't believe more people don't go here. I suppose it may be due to its location, which is a bit lonely.
