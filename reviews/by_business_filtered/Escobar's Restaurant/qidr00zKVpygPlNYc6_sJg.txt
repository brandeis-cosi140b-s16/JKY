Stopped in for drink and an appetizer one evening.  We were greeted by a friendly (and beautiful) hostess.  Friendly seems a trait missing in most hostesses.  The great service continued with a friendly and efficient bartender, who can make a good martini (you'd think that was easy,it's not).   
We had the guacamole app and it was fantastic!  I will go back just for it.
The atmosphere in the lounge area was calm and quiet (no tv's or rowdy people).
Will go back for dinner soon.
