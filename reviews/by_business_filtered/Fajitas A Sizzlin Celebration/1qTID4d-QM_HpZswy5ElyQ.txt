Ahhhh! I've loved this place for years and it was such a treat to get to this side of town and have some wonderful fajitas. I'm a big fan of restaurants that concentrate on one thing and do it well, and this place does not waver from that. All the food is made in the middle of the restaurant so you can watch with your mouth watering as they freshly grill the tender meats and spicy onions for your meal. I always get the "Cadillac Fajitas" which is beef tenderloin--a little more expensive than the regular steak but worth every penny. And the tortillas (oh the tortillas!!!!!!) are so doughy, buttery, and just plain delicious! The service is always on point, and margaritas are strong...you just can't go wrong with this place!
