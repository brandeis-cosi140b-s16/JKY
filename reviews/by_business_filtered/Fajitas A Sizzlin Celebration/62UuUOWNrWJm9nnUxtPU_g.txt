I heard Fajitas was good if you like....you guessed it...fajitas. As I do indeed enjoy yummy fajitas we decided to check it out on Mother's Day. We had a party of six, so the less than 10 minute wait on a busy day like Mother's Day was impressive. 

The smell walking in though, funky. I'm not quite sure what it was, but it smelled strange in the place til we were seated next to someone that was just served the hot and steamy fajitas. It was much more pleasant then. 

We ordered, it's a lil pricey but not horrible and everything looked great. Their chips and salsa were decent, the service was decent and the fajitas were good. The homemade tortillas were definitely the best part. Even the kids noticed the difference. 

We did have a super yummy dessert. I'm not all that eager to go back, but I wouldn't be opposed to it if someone else wanted to go there. There are other Mexican restaurants I like better though.
