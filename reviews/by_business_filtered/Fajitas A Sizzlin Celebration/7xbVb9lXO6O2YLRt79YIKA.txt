I live in Southern California and whenever I'm in the PHX are, Fajitas is on my to do list.  Incredible fajitas, I've had the shrimp, chicken, steak and Cadillac (tenderloin filet).  All are incredible but the Shrimp is my favorite, I'm craving them just writing this review.  The seasoning they use is unlike any other I have tasted and the portions are huge.  They are so good, I ordered a half pound portion, ate that and ordered another half pound!  Now I always order the full pound with half shrimp and half either chicken or steak.  Limited beer selection but that's not a big deal.

Oh a reviewer below, Michael E. blasted Fajitas for being "an Americanized style of Mexican food" and noted that his GPS listed it under American food, not Mexican.

Mike, before you write, please know what you are writing about.  Fajitas are an American food, Tex-Mex to be exact. Your GPS is smarter than you.  They originated in Texas in the 30's and 40's by Mexican cowhands working on Texas ranches.  The American ranch owners would give the Mexican cowboys (vaqueros) the scraps of slaughtered cattle they thought were unusable, one of those scraps was the skirt steak that is still used today in Fajitas. 

Go to Mexico and try to order Fajitas at a restaurant, they will laugh at you.  But you are from Utah, how would you know that.
