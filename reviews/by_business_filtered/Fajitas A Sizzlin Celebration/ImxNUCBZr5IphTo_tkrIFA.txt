This was probably the first Mexican food restaurant that I ever ate at, and I was probably 5.  I think it is the reason I love Mexican food so much.  Now, I know that the specialize in fajitas, but seriously, when you get something right, why branch out.  First, lets talk about the tortillas.... AHHH!!!  I would die to have those tortillas every day of my life.. They are homemade, warm and probably the best thing about this place.  The smells are amazing.  Then there are the actual fajitas.  You get a lot of meat and peppers when they bring you your sizzling plate.  The sides, especially the guacamole compliment everything so well.  The only complaint I have is that it is so far away from me.
