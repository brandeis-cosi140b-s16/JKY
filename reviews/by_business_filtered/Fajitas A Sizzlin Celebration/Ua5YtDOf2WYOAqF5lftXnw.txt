I grew up going to Fajitas about twice a month and am still a big fan.  The food and service are amazing.  

There is no reason to get anything but fajitas at this spot.  We love the chicken and the Cadillac beef the best.  They tortillas are amazing.. They make them right there and are the best in town.
The service is always great and this is a good spot for large groups as well.

The only reason I gave them 4 stars vs 5 stars is because they need to update the dining room and restrooms.  The place is always clean, but the restrooms are in real need of a major renovation.
