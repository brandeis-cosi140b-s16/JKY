Wow, this place misses, by a loooooong shot.

Food wise, this place should be rated zero stars, but the server was SO nice and did such a great job, I had to bump it up. If I could rate service alone, I would give this place four stars.

Here's the breakdown.

I've been here probably over a dozen times over ten years, and it's pretty much always the same. Ambiance is ok, clean but dated. As others have mentioned, the only thing to order here is fajitas, and I did, preceded by a cheese crisp appetizer, which I read was great on Yelp.

In short, the simplest stuff at Fajitas is the problem. Their 'salsa' is literally tomato paste and maybe some powdered garlic? It is truly bland and tasteless, remarkably so. It's almost like jr. high cafeteria lady dropouts are making the salsa, it is just a train wreck. I asked our server if they had a hotter (read: flavorful) salsa, and he brought over some hot sauce.

The fajitas arrived and they were fair. Portions were good and tortillas were fresh-ish. For some reason the fajitas arrived with raw onions and a trace amount of bell peppers. Maybe i'm doing it wrong, but I was accustomed to grilled onions and peppers- and this wasn't that.

The service was the shining star at this spot. Our server was awesome, very attentive and kind, without being annoying. I took my nephew and nieces out to dinner, and there were tons of extra requests, and the server (Mike?) was just really great- so much so that I tipped 30% and let the manager on duty know they had a rock star working there.

If this place could just put some effort into the salsa, and a bit more attention to detail, it could be great, but for now I recommend you skip it, and hit up a Mom & Pop spot.
