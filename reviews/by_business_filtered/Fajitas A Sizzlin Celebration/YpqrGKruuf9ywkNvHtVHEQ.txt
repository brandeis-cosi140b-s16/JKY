I have been going here my entire life and make sure my entire family meets here on my birthday! I have never had anything bad here. I love it all! And the service is always so wonderful. 

My favorite is the Cadillac fajitas. It's hard to order anything else because it's so wonderful and the home made tortillas are to die for. 

This is by far my favorite restaurant! My boyfriend and I try to make it here at least 1 a month even though it's 45min away. Soooooo amazing! Highly recommend
