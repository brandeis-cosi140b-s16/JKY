I'm really glad I saw the Check Please! Arizona episode for this place. 

Upon entering the restaurant, you smell the cooking meat. Like you can open your mouth and chew the air. The kitchen is set up in the center of the restaurant. We weren't seated in a place to easily view it, but the cooking theater certainly creates a savory perfume that makes you want to float over like some Looney Tunes character.

Like any good Mexican place, they serve up tortilla chips and salsa. Both met our approval. My son is autistic and only eats tortilla chips and potato chips in restaurants, and he pretty much inhaled these things.

Then came the difficult decision: which fajitas? They offer chicken, beef, pork, Cadillac (which, to the disappointment of any visiting goats, is not car but beef tenderloin), shrimp, and vegetable. There are a lot of other options, too, and other vegetarian-friendly things, but we were there for MEAT.

We ordered 1/2 pound pork and 1/2 pound Cadillac-style. I asked for corn tortillas along with flour.

A short time later, our food was delivered. The full pound of meat was served upon a mound of grilled onions along with some red and green peppers and a chunk of lemon. On a side dish, they have add-ins like sour cream, lettuce, and pico de gallo.

Then there are the tortillas. Honestly? I'd come here just for the fresh tortillas. They are divine. The flour tortillas have perfect chewiness and can hold a lot of meat. The corn tortillas impressed me in an additional way--since they are fresh, they are flexible. None of that brittle, crack-in-half behavior like standard store ones.

There was much om-nom-nomming. The amount of food was just about perfect for us. The meat had flavor without being spicy; mind you, my husband like super-hot food with a kick, but he still enjoyed this. It's a place I could easily take my parents. 

And those tortillas. Good grief. If I am on my death bed and requesting deliciousness, those are on the top of my list.
