One word:

Queso

This is the valley's go-to establishment for unique and robust Fajitas. They arrive sizzlin' on a screaming, scorching hot iron griddle! It's a treat! 

For starters, the basket of chips/salsa arrives with your intro to the server. The cooks make the salsa in large containers on a daily basis and it's consistently good. The chips are usually cold but thin and lightly salted, which makes up for the lack of heat. They go quite well with the salsa making it easy to overindulge. 

My absolute favorite item on their menu is the simple, velvety soft chili con queso. Brian whips that amazingly perfect cheese dip up and the recipe is impossible to find.

Holy wonders of the world, it's unbelievably good. With the salted chips and the salsa...It's absolutely my favorite food on earth, the queso at Fajita's.

Ok, now for the Fajitas. The Cadillac Steak and Shrimp combo is by far the tastiest.  Get the bed of onions grilled (vs raw). The molcajetes come with shredded cheddar cheese; fresh pico-de-gallo; sour cream, and I always sub out one of those for their fresh, tart guacamole. 

The tortillas are literally home-made on the premises. There's always a smiling employee in the tortilla corner and you are welcome to converse and tip them while they dole out buttery, flour tortillas.  The corn torts are a fair but not home-made alternative.

The bar is situated surrounding the grill/cooking area which is smack dab in the middle of the restaurant. It's a pretty cool set-up since you can see your food from start to finish. 

Drinks are average to good, depending on the bartender. Peter is one of the last men standing and makes a killer top-shelf Margarita.

Despite everything I just shared, if you love queso with chips, DO NOT MISS THIS PLACE. 

Seriously, it's the best ever!
