Awesome, attentive service!  

Our family of four, plus my parents, met at Fajita's to celebrate my husband's birthday.  I emailed the restaurant a few days prior, to find out what accommodations they could provide, if any, for my mom who has a severe gluten allergy.  I received a prompt response from Mike S, one of the managers, who assured me that they could cook the corn tortillas in an area separate from the flour tortillas.  He told me to ask for a manager upon arrival, and they'd take these extra steps for my mom.

Sure enough, the (female) manager working tonight was on top of things, and made sure my mom's food was kept away from items containing flour.  

We all were very impressed with the quality of both the shrimp and the Cadillac steak fajitas.  Our kids even loved the proteins, and went back for seconds a few times.  The chips and salsa were pretty good as well.   

The best part of our visit was the attentive service.  Our server was absolutely fantastic--prompt with taking our order, with refills, and with removing our plates afterwards.  She was cheerful, polite and just an absolute pleasure all around.
