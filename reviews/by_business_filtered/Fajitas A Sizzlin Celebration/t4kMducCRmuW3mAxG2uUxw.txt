This was the first time we've been here and for some reason the waitress was just not happy about being our server. Very nice to everyone asking if everything was good offered to fill their drinks. I had to ask for more salsa and more water. When it was time for the check she was just passing by put the check on the table and said "here's your check". When signing my receipt I hear her ask the other table if they wanted dessert....hmmmm. Thank you Tiffany for showing us great customer service.
