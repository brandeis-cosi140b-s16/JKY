This is THE best place to get fajitas. Their tortillas are made there, one the spot. The salsa tastes so fresh. Any meat you get for the fajitas is always amazing. The service is so good, my family and I are in and out in no time. We live about 45 mins away but still drive here often for dinner. It is a great place to take the kids too! My favorite restaurant in the state.
