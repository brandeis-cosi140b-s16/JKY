Here's the deal, Fat Boy's is awesometacular. It is totally deserving of the 5 Star Rating it has here. 

It is incredibly close to my house, located in a strip mall off of Stewart and Lamb. Not the greatest location ever, but hey, it's close to me so that makes me happy (and afraid for my waist line). 

I arrived around 6 PM on a Friday night, there were two guys working behind the counter. I had already decided what I wanted before I got there so I had no need to look at the menu. I was taking my order to go so I gave one of the guys my order and he started cooking it up (YEP! they put the burger on the grill AFTER you order it). Then the other guy there rang me up and got me my drink cup.

I ordered: Guac BOYger, Chencho Fries, and a Soda - to go.

I am disappointed. My fries were not chencho fries, but the "fat fries". :( They were still good though, and the burger was pretty good too. Small, but had a great taste and was cooked perfectly. 

Not sure what happened, guess the guy I gave my order to just hear "fat fries" and not "chencho fries"? Oh well, I'll definitely be getting them the next time I go back, which I'm sure will be relatively soon. As for the GUAC boyger, I think I'll try a different burger next time. It was good, but I definitely saw the dude put the guac on my burger and it came out of a squirty bag thing. Soooo, not fresh guac here which is kinda disappointing. I'm kinda picky about my guac, so out-of-the-bag versions don't really sit well with me.

However, I do plan on return trips here. It's good food, it's made to order, and it's relatively cheap!
