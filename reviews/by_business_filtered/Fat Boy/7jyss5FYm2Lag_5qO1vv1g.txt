This place is awesome. Good food, great service. Don't be persuaded by those who left bad reviews...been to this place 2x, had the mild chicken fingers & pastrami sandwich...and everything was great. The speciality fries were awesome. Very reasonably priced. Don't pass up on this place you won't regret it.
