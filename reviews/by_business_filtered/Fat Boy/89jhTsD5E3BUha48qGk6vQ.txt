Well, not bad but just ok.  I'm continuing to find it hard to locate good pie in southwest - I'm sure there are good places for pizza but I just haven't found them yet.  Not a bad place though...but I should have tried the burger.  A few came out of the kitchen while we were waitin and they looked pretty solid.  I'd come again - but I'd pass on the pizza.
