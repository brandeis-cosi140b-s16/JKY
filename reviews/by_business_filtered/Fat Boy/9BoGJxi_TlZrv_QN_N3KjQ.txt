This place has been on my bookmark list for awhile. I actually used to work in this area 5 years ago and always passed it on Stewart but didn't try it. I was reassigned a different location for work on Nellis so it's pretty much on this side of town. Finally came in on my lunch break and I ordered the burger and fries. I ordered ahead of time since I only have 30 minutes. To be honest, I was underwhelmed. This burger tasted homemade and to me that's not a good thing if it's something I can make at home. There was nothing special about it at all? No special sauce, typical hamburger bun, shredded lettuce and tomato. Umm did I miss something from all the reviews on how awesome the food is here. Although maybe I should of tried the checo fries or burrito? But the pictures look underwhelming as well. The inside is definitely a mom and pop shop, so it can use some upgrades or if they had the budget for it a major facelift would be even better. I'm not sure if the family that owns this place was working but the woman who rang up my food was friendly. If I give them another chance I'll be sure to ask Melissa Y. what to order since her review raves about this place.
