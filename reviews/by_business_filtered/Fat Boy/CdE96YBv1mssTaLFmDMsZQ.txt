Good food and cheap prices? Sounds like a winner to me! I came here with my friend and shared chencho fries. She got a cheese boyger and I got a turkey boyger. 

Chencho fries: fries in salsa and cheese, we got an egg on top too. It was an interesting concept, different from anything I've tried. I thought these were alright. The person at the register said people like to put pastrami. I think it could have used some meat and maybe some sour cream

Turkey boyger: very flavorful and cheap! I really liked it. It was juicy and I enjoyed the sauce!

My friend seemed happy with her burger too. 

I think I'll come back and try the pastrami burger, it sounded interesting.
