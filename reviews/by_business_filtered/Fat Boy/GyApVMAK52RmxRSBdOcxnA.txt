I love Fat Boy.....I love that it's a Mom and Pop, I love that their meat tastes fresh and not frozen, I love that the bread gets all the same loving that everything else does. I don't love that they're so far away from me or that they have such a small indoor seating area. Whenever I'm in the near vicinity I stop by here. I've had their double cheeseburger and their Chencho fries. Both are addictingly delicious and fresh. I always want to try something new but my nature keeps me going back to my usual order.
