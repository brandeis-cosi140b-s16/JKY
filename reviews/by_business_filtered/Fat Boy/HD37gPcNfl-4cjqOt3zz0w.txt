Fatboy has such amazing food! Everything they serve is very delicious. I really love ordering their pastrami burgers. Best family business I've been too. Better than farmer boys and five guys!

Everyone there treats me like family especially the cashier.  They are always happy to see me and actually remember me and always crack jokes and we  catch up.

I highly recommend coming here! You wont regret it! Best food you'll have around!
