It was sooooo good. Chencho fries were bomb-not too spicy, which I like. Also had a cheeseBOYger w/bacon. All made fresh, with friendly staff, great prices, and free drink refills-what's not to like? Maybe the location, but if this place was anywhere fancy-the prices wouldn't be as low. Will definitely be back next time we are craving burgers!
