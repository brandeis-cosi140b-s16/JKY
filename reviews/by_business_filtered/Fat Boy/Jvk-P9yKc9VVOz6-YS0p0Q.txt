My first time in Vegas and the 40th for my boyfriend. We wanted to try something local. Frigg'n awesome pizza!! Manny and the young girl who took our order were nice and chatted us up. Definitely recommended!!! Oh and when were stuffing our faces Manny was making a burger that we wanted to attack but we were so full from the large pizza
