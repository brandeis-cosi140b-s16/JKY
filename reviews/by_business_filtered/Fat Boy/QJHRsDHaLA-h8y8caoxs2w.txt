I came here with my friend and was craving wings. I was a first timer and she's here  a couple of times. I got wings and fries with a soda. The fat fries are really good! They made everything to order. My friend got the chencho fries and they were really good! Different from just Carne Asada fries. 

Overall it was okay but the guys were super nice.

It was Hot in the restaurant so that kind of sucked.

Their menu was extensive and I wanted to try everything.

The wings weren't spicy and were pretty tiny.

I give it a five just because the guys were nice.

And I loved the fat fries.

TIP! get the chencho fries in a burrito! They'll special make it!
