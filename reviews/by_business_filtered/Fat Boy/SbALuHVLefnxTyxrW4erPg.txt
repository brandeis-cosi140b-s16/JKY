I went here yesterday mainly for my family. I for health reasons am on a strict vegetarian diet. They do have vegetarian options. My boyfriend and his daughter loved there sandwich and burger. I ordered the bean burrito and the Chinchilla fries. I didnt like either. But I was afraid to go with there vegetarian burger. Cause Ive had some that were so bad that I couldn't even eat them. Which is the case in most restaurants.  Also I am a very picky eater. My boyfriend and most of my family are chefs. So for us to give a good rating is a good thing. lol Anyways as I was leaving they gave me a vegetarian burger to try. I just ate it and I have to say that vegetarian burger was off the hook. I really should have ordered that and the regular fries. Anyways I am a fan now. That was the best vegetarian burger ive ever had. I will defiantly be back.:)
