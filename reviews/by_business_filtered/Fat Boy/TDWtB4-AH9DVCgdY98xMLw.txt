Another hidden treasure on the east side! #yes (I know, hashtags are pointless on here). Anyway, my boyfriend and I shared chencho fries, 8 wings (1/2 bbq 1/2 hot), and a pastrami boyger. Between 2 people this can really fill you up! 

Pastrami boyger: soooo so good. What I love most is you can taste the quality (no copyright infringement intended, in-n-out) because they use fresh foods & are made to order. 

Chencho fries: pretty yummy. I would recommend an add on or two. Their options are bacon, ham, or egg. Pastrami would probably be bomb on there. I'm still pretty satisfied with it though. 

Wings: I'm not crazy about their wings but I like that the hot sauce is actually hot & their bbq is pretty flavorful. At least you know there's no steroids in the chicken so that's always good.

Overall verdict: definitely worth the price & then some. One of the very few good food spots on east side Vegas :) Also! Bernie provided us the greatest customer service. So you're fortunate if he's working when you check this place out.
