After reading reviews, I thought I'd give Fat Boy a chance.  I arrived about 11:20 am and the place was empty except for the 2 workers that were sitting at a table and were eating.  I was not greeted or welcomed and I grabbed a menu and set down at a table to decide what I wanted.  I ordered a hamburger and skinney fries and the lady fixed my order while the male continued to eat.  I was given an empty cup and got my own drink from the drink dispenser, the food came at a reasonable time, and I ate my food.  The hamburger was thicker than what you get a most places with a nice slice of tomato and onion.  The fries were ok, nothing special.  I did not order the special fries, but  wished I had after eating.  I was told thank you by the lady as I was leaving but nothing was said to me while eating or was I ever acknowledged otherwise.  I was given a bottle of ketchup, but I did not see nor was I given a fork for my fries and did not see any anywhere.  There was no salt, condiments, or extra napkins on the table.  My burger was OK, but not anything special that would make me think this was a great place  If this review had any positive results, I would hope it would be that the owners see and read my review and see how important it would be to be friendlier, acknowledge their customers, and ask if everything is OK and do I need anything else....if they want me to return.  I also believe that every place needs to be given a chance and if you eat there and enjoy it...post it and when I see positive comments, I'll give them another try....It may have been an off day.
