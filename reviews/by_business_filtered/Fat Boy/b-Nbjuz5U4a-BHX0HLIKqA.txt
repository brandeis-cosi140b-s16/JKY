All these other burger spots getting love and I realized I've never reviewed Fat Boy. Four juicy solid stars. The only reason to drive to this side of town is for this damn burger and fries. Chencho Fries that is.

Location: Shit location in a shit part of town. I don't care. I think I'm tough even though I am a short white girl who cries at Kodak commercials. Get real. Any neighborhood could be bad at any given time of day. This place is JUST FINE. 

The burgers taste like a backyard burger straight off the grill done RIGHT. Perfectly seasoned and the patty is not smashed or too thick. Both my biggest complaints about a burger. They don't even call it a burger because it's so cool. They call it a Boyger. Yeah boyeee! It's really nothing fancy, but it's exactly and I mean exactly how I like my burger. Please don't come here if you are expecting fancy. This sure ain't no supper club.

The fries. I swear the Chencho fries deserve MAD love. Like Quentin Tarantino movie love. Uma could order them and be eating them and then BOOM a huge ass ninja fight! Or cowboy zombie fight! I don't care, but some fight with the fries and the green chile sauce and melted cheese flying through the air in slow motion. I wouldn't wait for Redbox for that shit. Do it proper if you order these. You have a choice: Thin or thick fries. I went with thin and asked for exra crispy to hold up with the toppings cuz that's how I roll. PROPER FUCKING FRIES, SON.

Okay, I'm done. Just make the drive because it's cheap, it's real and even though I only went once I have thought about going about 100 more times....
