Killer handmade burgers (boygers) that are always delicious and full of flavor, with crispity fries (fat or skinny) dashed with a seasoning. I recently had their pizza and that was awesome too and at a great price, different toppings to choose from and served hot and fresh (I could see steam coming through the sides of the pizza box). Chocolate shake was gooood. One of the few gems on the east side of Las Vegas, go there!
