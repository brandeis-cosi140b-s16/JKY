Wow, this place can make a burger! Fat Boy is located on the East side where I grew up. I can't believe I've never tried this place 'til now. I'd remembered Dyanna L's review of here and when my Dad wanted to go to lunch some place close to him I knew Fat Boy would be an excellent spot! 

We went around 12:30pm on a Sunday and wow they were packed. We were very lucky to get one table for two that we quickly converted for three. 

My husband and I both got the same thing, A Pastrami Boyger and their famous Chencho Fries. The burger was juicy and huge. It had a pile of pastrami and saut√©ed onions. What a great combo! When it came to the Chencho Fries we got them skinny, but for sure go with the fat fries next time. The fries were covered in a green chili sauce, little chunks of chicken, and jack cheese. All served with a fork. They were yummy. A very nice meld of flavors! 

My Dad got the 16 piece Hot Wings. He loves hot things and these had his eyes watering a little. He was very happy and said they were quite tasty. 

I love places like this. The only down side for me was that if you're eating in they have no public restroom. But that doesn't matter much because the food rocks! Forget chain burgers, Fat Boy is where you wanna be!
