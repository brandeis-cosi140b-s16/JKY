This place is right around the corner of my house. A friend and I went in and tried this place out. I had a double with cheese and bacon. Everything was fresh. My friend is a butcher. Even he says it was very fresh. Go in try a burger you won't be disappointed. There fries have not impressed me yet. I have not had a pizza yet. Soon I suppose. After I get burned out of these awesome burgers.
