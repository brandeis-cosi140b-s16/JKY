Now normally this is one of my fav spots....the burgers are soooo delicious and you have to try the Chencho Fries also, the owner is always super friendly and just a really nice guy.  But, they got a new cashier and she is HORRIBLE!!!! She NEVER smiles and always has an attitude.  Everytime i see her in front i know its going to be an additional 15 minute wait because she has no idea what she is doing and cannot multi task.  I am pretty sure she overcharged me today too.  Normally a 5 star worthy place but with this employee it brings down the whole business!
