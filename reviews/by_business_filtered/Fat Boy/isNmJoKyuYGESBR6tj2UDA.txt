Thanks to yelp we had a delicious lunch. Wonderful burgers and fries. Fresh and hot. Friendly service. A variety of foods on the menu. Good for those with heart appetites as they offer some family-sized deals. 

Quesadillas, burgers, chicken fingers, salads, burritos.  

And oh my gosh. How friendly. He remembered my name as he told me thanks after we dined. Love that!!
