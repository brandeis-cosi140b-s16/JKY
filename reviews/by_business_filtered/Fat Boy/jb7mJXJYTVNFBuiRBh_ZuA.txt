Went for lunch on 11-1-13 around 1:00 pm, no one inside. We all had different items on the menu to include the double cheese boyger, double monster cheese boyger, chicken wings (hot) and a wet burrito with red sauce. Chencho fries and regular fries. All items were good but the stand out here are the boygers made fresh to order and very tasty. The double monster is huge, had to share it to finish it. Staff was friendly and attentive even when they got busy after about 20 minutes. Don't pay $16-$20 on the strip for a burger that is not his good. Worth the trip but you will need a car. I will be back here.
