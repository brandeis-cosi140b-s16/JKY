Really like their food. I usually try to call in the order to save myself some time but quite often they don't answer. I assume they are really busy and that's why but when I get there they aren't. They also aren't the friendliest people. I would have probably given them a 4 star rating if they were a little friendlier. Green sauce is great, red sauce is ehhh.  Love the Nevada burrito!
