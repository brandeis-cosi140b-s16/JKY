This place is ALWAYS stuffed with customers; and it's because the food is great! It's authentic Mexican food (my fav) and it's fast! Not to mention the portions are big enough to fill AND have leftovers :). They also have a condiment bar with some delicious peppers and sauces to take your meal to the next level. The scene is pretty indicative of a fast food Mexican joint, people are always rushing in and out but I was surprised to see they have a TV in the back that usually has a game on.
