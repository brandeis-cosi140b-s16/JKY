I agree with a previous reviewer that when the food is on, it's amazing. But when the food is off, it's pretty gross. I probably would've given fausto's 4 stars if the lady at the front greeted and said she'd be right with me when I walked in. 

Fausto's is one of my favorite fast food Mexican places in Las Vegas. I had to go in when I visited a week ago. I just wish the service was better. My personal favorite location is the one on Stephanie and Warm Springs. 

Whatever you do, get the guacamole and chips as a side. And get their red salsa.
