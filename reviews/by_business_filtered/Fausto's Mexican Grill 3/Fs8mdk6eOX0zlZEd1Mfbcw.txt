Fausto's is a great place that serves up quality Mexican food. You can try to phone them up for a take out order, but your order is unlikely to be understood on the other end of the line, and when you show up to grab your goods you might have a little surprise waiting for you. Just being honest.

Fausto's is NOT a sit down type of Mexican restaurant. It's more of a taqueria. I suggest the flautas and the carne asada, personally.
