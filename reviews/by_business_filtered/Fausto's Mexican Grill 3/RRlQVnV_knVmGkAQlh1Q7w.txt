Have been a customer since opening! great food portions, the environment has much improved since opening as well, nice flat screen for tv viewing while you dine, the chairs and tables are nice and the restaurant is clean! the food is also very yummy i always get the steak tacos or breakfast burrito! the one thing that is a bummer is there sin;t enough seating :/ the place is always busy busy but never enough seating so there is always people standing and a few times people sat at the empty chairs at my table which made me feel a bit uncomfortable :/ other than that i give faustos a 5 star gold rating i dine here once every two weeks atleast! 

Thank you
