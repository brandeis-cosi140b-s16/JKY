I can't believe I've lived up here for almost 10 years and my first Fausto's visit was a few weeks ago.  Needless to say, I'm already a repeat customer.  I don't recall anything that would qualify as health food on the menu, so I wouldn't recommend stopping by when you want a lo-cal salad with clean protien.  But if you're looking for flavorful indulgent treats like nachos, rolled tacos, or churros you have come to the right place.  Their menu is pretty large for a walk up place, but you'll likely get plenty of time to peruse it.  On my three visits here the line was actually out the door.  They only have one cash register, so waiting to order can take some time.

Thus far we have been tempted by an assortment of items.  
Super Nachos with Steak $7.50 (tortilla chips, seasoned steak, guac, sour cream, cheese, jalape√±os) 5/5
Carne Asada fries $7.50 (fries, Carne Asada, guac, sour cream, cheese) 3/5. The nachos are superior IMO

#20 chicken burrito combo plate $6.75 (shredded chicken, onions, peppers, in a fantastic house made flour tortilla) this comes with rice and beans that can be passed on, in my opinion.  The rice was okay, but dry and the beans had no flavor. burrito 5/5, rice 2/5, bean 1/5.
5 rolled chicken taquitos with cream & cheese $4.25.  Crispy and delicious 5/5

Churros.  I was not prepared for them to have a filling.  Apple maybe?  I prefer plain, but they were okay. 3/5

The condiment bar has good stuff to grab whilst wating for your order to be prepared in Styrofoam containers :(   Cucumbers, carrots, peppers, salsa, limes, etc.
