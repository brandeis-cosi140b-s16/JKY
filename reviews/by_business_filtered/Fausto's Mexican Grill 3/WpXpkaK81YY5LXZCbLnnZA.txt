In the middle of my break between classes (life tip: NEVER take three 6 week summer courses. Unless you don't like sleeping ad want to be BFF's with coffee), my mom and I stopped by Fausto's from a referral from one of her coworkers. We saw some very hit or mss reviews, so we wanted to try the food out for ourselves. My mom and I were lucky enough to have arrived when there wasn't a long line because there is only one register. But, by the time we were eating, the line was out the door! I did notice that even though they were busy, food seemed to be ready and served fairly quickly.

Going in, you're immediately hit with the smell of cooking meat. There is a very wide selection of food, from tortas to tacos to nachos. After much deliberation, my mom got the chicken tacos in corn tortillas (around $8) and I opted for the al pastor taco combination with flour tortillas (same price). There is a soft drink fountain right to the side, along with a salsa bar that included some picked carrots, onions, etc.

I thought the prices were a bit expensive before I saw how big the portions were! My dish was only halfway finished before my stomach couldn't take anymore. The beans and rice were a bit bland for my taste, but the meat was to die for! My mom seemed to love her tacos, considering she finished all of them lol!

Although not truly authentic Mexican food, it is better than other Mexican restaurants, like Roberto's, by a long shot. I became a fan after the first bite and I can't wait to go again (which, by my cravings, seems like it'll be tomorrow). Be prepared though, because you'll leave smelling like the restaurant itself!
