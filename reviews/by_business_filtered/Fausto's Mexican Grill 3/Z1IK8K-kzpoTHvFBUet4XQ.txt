Not fancy, but oh so good and soooo cheap! My family of 4 usually gets out of there for right around twenty-five bucks, sometimes less.  

Carne asada is delicious and huge. The chile rellanos are so good. Burritos are giant and also delicious, and like another reviewer mentioned, the quesedillas are ginormous. BUT... what's really cool is that as busy as this joint is, the lovely lady that takes the orders remembers what my kids order better than I do!  And frequently we come with 2 families together, a total of 8 kids... she makes it so easy. She reminds me of my friend's son, "that one likes his carne asada plain."  Gotta love it!

Another reviewer noted great food but not that clean... we're frequent customers.. 3 to 4 times a month for the last 3 years...and we've never seen it dirty in the least. Don't mistake plain for dirty.
