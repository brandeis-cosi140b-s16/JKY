Oh Faustos... This place has some amazing food, from bean and cheese burritos to enchiladas to chili relleno to super nachos that truly are "super". The food is filling and well priced, with a salsa bar featuring spicy carrots and onions, cucumbers, a red and green salsa, and basket of limes. 

Beware, vegetarians, the beans do have lard in them. 

My favorite item is an Egg-Potato-Cheese breakfast burrito that will keep you full for breakfast AND lunch :)
