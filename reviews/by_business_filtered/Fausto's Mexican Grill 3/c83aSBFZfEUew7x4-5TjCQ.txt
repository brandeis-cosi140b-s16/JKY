My hubby and I wanted a good carne asada burrito like we often get in San Diego...thought we'd give Fausto's on College Drive in Henderson a try tonight.  We were very pleasantly surprised!  Very good carne, tender and with just the right kick! Will go back again- I want to try the camarones mojo de ajo......best part is that they are just down the street from our house!
