"Dirty" mexican food which hasn't made me sick in 4 years of once-a-month visiting.  I have had some bad bacon breakfast burritos there (ordering them in the evening is a terrible idea, they only have leftovers for bacon then) but otherwise the place is consistent.  I wouldn't call it "fast food"; it is greasy and terrible for you, but it is authentic Mexican food, not pre-frozen shrink-wrapped uniform garbage.  

I've never had any problems with communication; the employees generally don't speak English so well, but they can understand pretty damned well.  They've never screwed up my order (but I don't order complicated shit when I go to a cheap mexican joint, I just want a burrito with a lot of random stuff in it).  Even so, I hesitate to call my orders in for fear of them misunderstanding.  That might just be my own paranoia -- when something is wrong with my food it ruins my night.
