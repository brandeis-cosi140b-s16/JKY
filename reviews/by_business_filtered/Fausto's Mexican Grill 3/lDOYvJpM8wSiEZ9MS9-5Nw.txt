No matter what I have ordered, it's always been good. My family and I have been going to Fausto ' s for about 10years. We have never been dissapointed. 
I didn't give 5 stars because the place is pretty small and the line gets pretty long making it super crowded inside. 

I'm not a fan of cooked green bell peppers, so when I order Chicken Taco Salad, I order it plain chicken, they season it perfectly. Plus you get your fill of the carrots, cucumbers and limes. And the pin√£ drink is the best. 
I'm in my car writing this waiting for my son to bring out the goodies .Dear Lord, Hurry!!  My mouth is watering...my order is up, time to enjoy my food now.
