Meh, it's fine for what it is. A hole in the wall taqueria chain with cheap prices and lower quality food. I don't understand those who scoff at Roberto's, but act like Fausto's is some Michelin 3 star restaurant in comparison. They're practically identical in the crap they serve you. Carne Asada burrito is usually really dry unless you ask for it to be loaded up with guac and sour cream. Chicken enchiladas are edible, but I hate the taste of their tortilla and generally just extract the chicken and drench it in Cholula because it is always THAT dry. Also, if you're raving about carne asada fries...I mean what kind of culinary feat is throwing together bunch of fattening food and mixing it together. OF COURSE it's going to taste good. The lady working the front is cordial enough. The other night I asked her for a water cup while I wait for my food. She said they no longer offer courtesy cups because 95% of people lied and got soda. PROTECT YOUR SYRUP AT ALL COSTS.
