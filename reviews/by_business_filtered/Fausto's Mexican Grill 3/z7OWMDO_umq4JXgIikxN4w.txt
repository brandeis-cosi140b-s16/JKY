Love their nachos, since they are loaded with steak, guacamole, cheese, refried beans, etc. etc. They have all the good stuff and you can also share the portion since it's massive! Their stuffed "chiles" are delicious and so are their tortas ( I prefer steak, with refried beans, and all the trimmings to go along), topping it off with their horchata. A side bar of sliced fresh veggies is always there, offering you pickled carrots with onions and jalape√±os. I enjoy this place since its cheap and tasty!
