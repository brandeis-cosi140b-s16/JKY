I really feel the  need to write this review. My husband and I have been going here for 4 yrs. We   ate there once a week. We ordered our usual Im allergic to tomatoes My husband told them no tomatoes on my burrito. I pulled open a little piece of it, tomatoes. No big deal my husband got up told the owner of the mistake he said  in a very rude way no you didnt say no tomatoes!! My husband said yes I did he again corrected my husband. I didnt even take a bite out of it. He didnt offer to make me a new one. All he wanted was to be right. My husband threw out his and my lunch and we left. Never will we be back again. Hope it was worth losing loyal customers.
