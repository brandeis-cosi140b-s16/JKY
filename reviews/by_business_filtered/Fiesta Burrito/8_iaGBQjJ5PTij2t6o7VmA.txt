Little places like this are the best! If you didn't grow up in Arizona you may be freaked out by the actual building Fiesta Burrito is in, but as a native I know these are the best places! I ordered the plan bean and cheese burro for $3 and it was delicious! The service was so fast and the workers were very kind! My mom and I were in the area the next day and I told her she should stop and get a burro so we did! She loved hers too.
