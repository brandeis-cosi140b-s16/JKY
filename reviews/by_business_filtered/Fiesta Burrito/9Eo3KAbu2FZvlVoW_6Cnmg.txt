If you want good quality mexican fast food at a low price this is the place for you. I especially love their breakfast burritos, they are amazing! My two favorites are the Country burrito and the steak egg and cheese burrito. The carne asada nachos are also very good. The salsa bar is great also. I highly recommend this place! Trust me im Mexican :)
