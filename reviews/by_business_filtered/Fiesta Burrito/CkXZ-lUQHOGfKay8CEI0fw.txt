Was a big fan of fiasta burrito but when my sister and her gf (she happens to be African American) went in to get something to eat you can tell they felt uncomfortable and made us feel uneasy. They just kept giving altitude and rolling there eyes. At one point we can hear them comment in the back saying racial slurs in spanish since were mexican also. I just cant go back if they are prejudice and homophopic and if thats how they run business then we're jusy going to take our business else where.

Update-went again to get something to drink since it was hot and too see if they changed but guess not
So I talked about fiasta burrito before but damn man dont go at night for drinks. Just went to get a small horchata and a large and the guy end up giving me 2 large which isn't a big deal but then before I took off I noticed one was purple so I went back literally seconds later pretty much went around the restaurant still in there parking lot and the guy was like "what do you want"(really man) and I said "hey man I asked for 2 horchatas and he went on the offense and said "NO YOU SAID 1 HORCHATA AND 1 JAMAICA LOOK AT YOUR RECEIPT". then I went um no 1st I asked for 1 large and 1 small and you end giving me two large with no receipt which I dont mind but you didn't give two horchatas and then he went on by okay but I need to charge you and I said wth why i didn't ask for that order then he was like fine pull up and he end giving me my drink but with the craziest altitude. I was more shocked then mad like wtf man it was the easiest order ever and I didn't snap at him or get mad. Idk why he was so mad
