UPDATE: after my last experience with Fiesta Burrito I have to say I AM NEVER GOING BACK. Why? I asked for a California burrito with guacamole, got charged for the guacamole, but it was never in my burrito. The burrito seemed to shrink 10% more than the last time I thought it shrank. It was definitely not worth the price at all. I
 also got charged for an extra drink. When I went back to ask for my refund for the guacamole and the extra drink I was charged for the men just looked at me like I was crazy. He offered me a cup instead (which I didn't need I already had my drink) and I saw one man in the back filling up a tiny cup of guacamole (which I didn't need either because I had already eaten the tiny burrito) All I wanted was my $3.00 back for things I never received. 



this place is always my go-to place for fast late night Mexican Food (only when Tacos Jalisco is closed) cleaner also. I know I wont have to worry about cockroaches roaming my food. I love how theyre so fast, and the food comes out tasting decent.

what I am concerned about is how small their burritos have gotten over the years. don't get me wrong, theyre still beasts, but they have definitely shrank in width. i know regulars would agree. their customer service is a bit lacking, so don't feel bad if theyre not attentive and don't exactly cater to your needs. you have to tell them if you want any extras and other customizations. 


regardless, this is the place to go for super fast delicious Mexican food, that wont make you sick! PARTY burrito!
