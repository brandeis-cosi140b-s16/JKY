I'm from Southern California and I love burritos . Moved to arizona about a month ago and live right next to fiesta burrito . I love California burritos and they have a good one with good red and green salsa . 

Wish the burrito was alittle thicker and the fries not as moist but other than that I will be a regular there for as long as I live here .
