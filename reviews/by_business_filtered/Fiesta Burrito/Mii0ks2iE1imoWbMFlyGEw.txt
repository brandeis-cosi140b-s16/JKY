The 5 Rolled tacos (4 bucks) were better than normal, but they were skimpy with the guacamole and cheese on top. Very skimpy. Ordered a baby side of rice for 70 cents which was a nice since a normal side goes for a crazy 3 bucks. Scottsdale prices at a taco shop? The red sauce was the best part of the experience as it contained a good zing. How can rolled tacos be ready in 30 seconds at a drive through? I doubt these are fried up when I order - they must be sitting in a warmer somewhere. Might be best to get a burrito that they hopefully cook to order, but who knows at these kind of places. Few beers beforehand always helps the taste too.
