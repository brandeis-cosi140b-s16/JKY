OMG, seriously the best Carne Asada burrito I have ever ordered at a neighborhood Mexican food, drive thru style restaurant.  The meat is tender and not fatty, and the burrito is not greasy and heavy.  The portions are more than enough.  The breakfast burritos are also awesome.  In all honesty a $4.00 breakfast burrito will feed my husband and I.  So, if you are not big eater you can definitely share.
