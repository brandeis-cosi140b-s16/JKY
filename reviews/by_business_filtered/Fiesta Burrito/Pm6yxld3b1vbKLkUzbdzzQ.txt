Addictive and Amazing! My boyfriend loves hole-in-the-wall places that scare me. So I looked on yelp for places one day so I could find him a well reviewed one. The rest was history. My boyfriend lived in LA for 10 years (known for excellent food) and he is living there temporarily right now. He says the carne asada burrito is the best he has ever had anywhere. One day he flew back home and when I picked him up from the airport at 10pm he asked to go to Fiesta Burrito. The last time he came back he drove from LA and stopped at Fiesta before even coming to see me and I only see him two weekends per month!

I don't eat beef so my favorite is the adobada burrito. They also have the best refried beans I have had in many years. 

Be careful if you go - because you will want to go back again and again. I liked the guys review about running the marathon and wanting to stop. My boyfriend would have been right there with you!!!
