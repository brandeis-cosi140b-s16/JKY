Sub Par at best, Carne Asada plate two bland pieces of steak, tough and you have to chop it up yourself, the rice is bleh. I live down the street and I thought I would give this place a second chance due to construction on McDowell Rd, I'll continue going to LosBetos from now on. Even the photos on their drive thru menu look bland.
