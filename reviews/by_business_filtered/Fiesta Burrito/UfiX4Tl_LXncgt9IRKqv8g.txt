I was recommended to check this place out last week. I have now been here twice since then. I've had the Chimichanga and the California burrito. The orders came out quickly and I received great service during both visits. The food here is great, rice and beans were rice and beans. But the Chimichanga has a nice crispiness and the tortilla seemed fresh and the chicken was delicious. The California burrito was also a great burrito. I wasn't expecting meat of that quality in a burrito under $5, but it was a welcome surprise.
