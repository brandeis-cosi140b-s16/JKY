This is my favorite of similar type places by far. We used to Los Betos at the end of nights on the town & in a pinch when we didn't want to cook (as there is one quite near). At some point, the quality had dropped far enough that we hit Fiesta Burrito. My sister had been lauding this place for years.

Well, it is not only my favorite drive-thru/semi-fast Mexican food spot, it's one of my favorite value places in town. Cheap great food super quick. It's already kind of a stand by for me & the kids when the Mrs. does a girls night out. Also open quite late which is a major bonus (as both of my other cheap Mexican favorites have limited hours - Carolina's & Rito's).

Their food is excellent. Super tasty, reasonable, quick. Nice clean atmosphere, super friendly staff.

I typically go with the taco combination as they do the deep fried shredded beef tacos that are so yummy. Their carne asada is also brilliant. Great beans. They have a nice salsa bar as well. The Mrs. likes the green & red chile quite well too.

Can't miss with Fiesta Burrito.
