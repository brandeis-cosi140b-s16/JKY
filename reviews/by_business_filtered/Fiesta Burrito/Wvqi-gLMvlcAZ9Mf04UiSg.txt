I love Fiesta Burrito! The staff is friendly and welcoming, a real nice family owned joint. 
My favorite is the Country Burrito; eggs, potatoes & cheese to which I always add sour cream & jalepenos. 
My son loves the #20 - chimicangas, the #3 - 2 cheese enchies & 
the #4 - cheese enchie & tostada. The #4 is a favorite of all of us. My daughter is all about the California burrito, no pico add sour cream. This place knows our faces by now and I can't believe I haven't written a review yet! The lack of a fifth star is because once I found meat in my burrito...I don't eat meat. BUT, they are awesome and a no brainer when it's time to eat and no one can agree which place is best!
Yummy red sauce!
