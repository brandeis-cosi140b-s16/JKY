I'm giving it 4 stars purely for the Carne Asada burrito. it's so good!!! I've tried other items on the menu and was not impressed. The shredded chicken was greasy and just stuffed with too much cheese, and I couldn't even finish it. They also have a horrible drive thru. You have no idea what they are saying. I orderedsome rolled tacos with no cheese only guac, and they gave me rolled tacos with cheese and no gauc. I was so angry. I love guac! So check your food before leaving if going thru the drive thru.
