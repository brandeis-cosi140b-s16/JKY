This place is so authentic, I wouldn't drink the water...

I was introduced to this place via a friend of a friend, who enjoyed the late night delight of real Mexican food. Guess, they just call it food. "Pause for laughter" Anyways, I tried this place once...too authentic for me but it was good! Its one of those places I spoke about. The washed out pics (cause you don't need to see them: Main theme rice, beans, some kind of meat), original spanish names for the dish, and drive thru...yes the mexican food drive thru! I love it. This places gets 4 stars because it didn't pass the health inspection report, but I still eat there despite. That's good food.
