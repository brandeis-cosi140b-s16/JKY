We came here after a night of very heavy drinking, or I should say during. We took to the drive through and got some food to help us out. I ordered some sort of pork burrito and it was shear bliss. I love Mexican food and didn't think anywhere could top Southern CA for its Mexican. I was wrong. This place was even drive through and it was amazing. The flavors were plentiful and delicious. I wanted to go back so bad the next day but sadly it never happened. I know where I'll be going though for my drunk food fixes next time I visit!
