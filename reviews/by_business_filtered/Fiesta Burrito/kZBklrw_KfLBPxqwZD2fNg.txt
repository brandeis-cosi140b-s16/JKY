This was fantastic.  I had the country breakfast burrito (egg, potato, & cheese).  Everything was nice and fresh and not too greasy.  It honestly tasted like something I would make at home, but better because someone else cooked it.  Fast drive thru service and there was 4 cars behind me.  I am looking forward to trying some of the other goodies on the menu.
