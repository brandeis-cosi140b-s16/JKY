Not as good as I had hoped for. Not horrible, but I just moved over to this area from San Diego a week ago and was looking for a little mexican shop on par with everywhere in SD. Yes, I know I am not in SD anymore so I can't expect the same thing. If I were to have found this place there I would have rated it as a generous 2 stars.  But again overall I just had better expectations for a 4.0 rating with over 130 votes.
