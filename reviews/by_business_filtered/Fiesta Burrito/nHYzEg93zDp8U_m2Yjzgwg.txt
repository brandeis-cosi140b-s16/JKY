As other reviewers have pointed out, it's inexpensive authentic Mexican food. It's good stuff, the service is fast and polite and the restaurant is consistently clean - which is to say, all contributing factors to why I eat lunch there every workday.

My only complaint is that there isn't a vegetarian burrito on the menu - but the staff is more than accommodating if you ask for a specific dish.
