Fiesta is awesome.  For under $5.00 you can go in and get a delicious greasy burrito.  I find that often it is the only thing that satisfies my craving for food after hiking up to the top of Camelback.  I have gotten the Chorizo and Carne Asada burritos there and I would recommend both of them.  I have heard from friends that their plates are pretty good too.
