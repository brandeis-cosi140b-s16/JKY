This is my go to taqueria in Scottsdale, inexpensive and really good food.  

They have the best veggie burrito I have had in AZ, although can be inconsistent.  Sometimes you have to tell them what you want in it.  The 1st time I went there, they simply made me a veggie burrito with beans, rice, lettuce, etc and it was awesome.  On several other occasions, they ask me what I want in it.  On another occasion, the rice was left out altogether, so was not as good in my opinion.  This is a little odd, but no big deal.  Just be sure to tell them what you want in it.

Tacos and burritos are typical offerings, and all tasty.  I have had many items and was always pleased and satisfied.  

The service and portions are a somewhat inconsistent.  It is difficult to predict what experience you might have on any given day.  Some counter servers are nice.  Some are not so nice.  None are outright rude or anything like that. 

They have a drive thru that is pretty quick - I have used it at least 10 times.  The place gets very busy and parking lot is tiny.  I have seen the drive thru line to where you are in the street waiting to get into the parking lot.  And it is often tough to get a spot in the lot.  But you can always park a couple doors down at Bosa Donut and walk up to Fiesta, and then get an apple fritter for dessert ... bonus!
