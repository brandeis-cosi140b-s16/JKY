When I lived in Scottsdale this was my go-to Mexican spot. This, along with Los Favoritos, are hands-down the best taquerias Scottsdale has to offer. Whenever I visit these locales I am not looking for some exotic dish or specialties and typically stick to carne asada and breakfast burritos. Fiesta Burrito excels at both. Their beans, tortillas, and green sauce are pretty tasty as well. The rice is pretty standard and just okay. Whether you are looking to satisfy your Mexi-cravings or drunk as a mutha-fuckin' skunk, hit it up! They won't let you down.

Just a note: For all you whiteys (myself included) and transplants who praise the bland, sad-excuse-for-Sonoran-fare of Macayo's, Ajo Als, and the like or the valley's unfortunate taqueria staple, Filibertos, please try this place or Los Favs. You will thank me later.
