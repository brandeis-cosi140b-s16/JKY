Second visit here. The chips and salsa are very good. I filled up on them and they kept them and the salsa coming. Can't go wrong with the appetizer combo plate. I got it the first time I came here,  and got it again. It's big enough to fill you up. The food is yummy. 

My problem is with the music. Music should be subtle and ambient. I get that they are sticking to the Mexican theme with their music. But enough already do I really need to be rattled out of my seat by tubas, and squeeze box Oompa-Loompa bands? 

Turn the volume down let the music be in the back ground.  It's a restaurant, not a night club. I couldn't eat all my food the music was that loud and that bad, it turned my appetite.  I seriously wanted to walk outside and throw my body under a passing bus. 

Next time I'll order and eat it out on the curb on Dysart road, you can hear it from there but it's not blaring and you don't have to yell at your dinner date to be heard. 

Oompa, Loompa, doom-pa-dee-da!
