First time visit. Ordered Fajita burrito and it was horrible. The meat was tough, the red sauce tasted like marinara. Also order Enchilada Suizas and not good either. Green sauce was not good. Can't even explain what it tasted like. Never tasted Mexican food like this before. Just moved from CA and have yet to find good Mexican food in the west valley. The only good thing was chips, salsa and the beans. Will not be coming back. Way to expensive for bad Mexican food. Only giving 1 star since I can't chose 0 stars.
