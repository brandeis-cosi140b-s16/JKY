I eat here often. I'm very disappointed today. My wife always orders the Aguachile. Today it was so hot she didn't eat but a few shrimp. I tried to eat some and I couldn't. I get that it's supposed to be hot but its been ordered by us like 13 times before with no issues. That's not the big issue. Even tho that was a waste of money my shrimp cocktail was worse. I know shrimp cocktails. This presentation was good but the size of the shrimp was ridiculous. The rim of the glass had some good size shrimp as presentation. When you scooped the soup it had small nickle sized shrimp. I feel ripped off.
