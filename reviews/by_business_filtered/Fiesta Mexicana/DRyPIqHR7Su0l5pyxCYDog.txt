The Pros: DAVE!  Our server Dave was fantastic.  Honestly some of the best service I have received in a long time.  I hope I have his name right, I am 85% sure it was Dave...  Anyway, his level of attentiveness was perfect, in addition to his great attitude and ability to anticipate our needs.  

                The restaurant....was very nice and clean, all of the staff seems to take pride in what they do and greeted you with a smile.  Bathrooms = very nice and clean, looked brand-new.  Good happy hour deals 7days a week, and it looks like they have live entertainment quite often. Salsa is great, they offer it in three different "heat" levels. Chips = good.  The sopapilla(sp?)was excellent.

The Cons:  Although the quality of the food was fine and it was prepared perfectly....the flavor....  It was simply lacking any flavor that stood out..  Portion size was great, it just needs a little more seasoning...or something to kick the flavor up a notch..  And I do NOT mean just add more "heat".  Just simply a tad more flavor.
