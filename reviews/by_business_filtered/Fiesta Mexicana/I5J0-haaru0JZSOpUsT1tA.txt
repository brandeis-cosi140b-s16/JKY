My husband and I have been to this restaurant twice. Both times the food was very good, large portions, and an extensive menu. We were fortunate enough to have the same server on both visits.  Excellent service with a smile. We will be taking friends there this week. I think this is the best mexican restaurant in the west valley. It's nice to have a restaurant locally so you don't end up driving 20 miles to eat. Good job!
