Came in on a Friday night - not busy and seated right away by the friendly hostess.  The decor was colorful and festive - just how I imagine a Mexican restaurant to be!  But this place was clean, the furniture was maintained and it looked like they took the time to decorate!  They also had a mariachi!  You receive free chips and salsa.  They have a lot on their menu and we ordered a Dinner for 2 option (don't remember what it was called) but it was good and fulfilling.  

Don't forget to check-in to receive your free offer - I think it was a free desert - churro maybe?   :)
