This was our first visit and a very good one as well. The decor is fun and bright. We were seated promptly and ordered a big margarita which was better than most that I have had around town. The wait staff was very good and quick to make sure we had chips/salsa and our order. The salsa was pretty good and the food was delicious, anyone who says it's bland is being indifferent on purpose. Price was reasonable and we will be back soon.
