The food here is fantastic chili Verde is absolutely delicious I recently tried some other more expensive dinner plates mean my girlfriend went and split the skirt steak and shrimp dinner platter which was 1799 and we still had leftoversis a great place to have lunch or dinner if you're in the area The servers were nice and very attentive and the atmosphere was terrific
