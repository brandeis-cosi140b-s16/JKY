I went to this place with my girlfriends family after her brothers graduation. When we got there we asked our server for a quick minute to look at the menu. The server didn't return for 20 mins, she takes our order then gets my girlfriend's mother order incorrectly after we clearly stated and reiterated for her before she left. Food was okay but not worth it for the poor service we received
