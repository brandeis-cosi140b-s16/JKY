Yesterday we took out-of-town guests here and we all thought the food was very good.  I had chicken strips with mole and thought it was very good.  The food platters are large and I was not able to finish everything.  The salsa and chips were good and everything tasted fresh.  The place was a little noisy but we could have a good conversation so it wasn't too bad.  We will definitely eat there again.
