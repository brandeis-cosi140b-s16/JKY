My family and I ate here for the first time the other night. It was busy but not so busy that we had to wait for a seat. Once seated though it took awhile to get our drink order taken. Are waiter was very friendly and did his job well but with that being said it took a very long time for our food to arrive and the food was good. Not the best I've ever had and not the worst. It's kind of pricey compared to similar restaurants. Over all it was an okay experience.
