It is refreshing to see a restaurant make use of the small things to make a big impact.   Fiesta Mexicana has a large varied menu with above average food, great salsa but more important an atmosphere full of color and life.  The wait staff look sharp in their uniform attire, and our waiter was professional and attentive.  The surroundings were very clean, pleasing being artfully colorful and bright, without going overboard.  Music was pleasant without being too loud so we could also enjoy conversing with one another at the table.  My wife said her margarita was fantastic.  The food looked great and even the plates were nice!  Prices were maybe a bit higher than average, but when you want quality food, service and atmosphere you at least get more than you pay for at La Fiesta.
