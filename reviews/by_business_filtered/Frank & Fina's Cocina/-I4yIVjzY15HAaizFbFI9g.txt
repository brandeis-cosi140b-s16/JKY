Been a fan of this place since thier Charleston location (wish it was still open).  Food is great, service can be spotty though.   I don't like that fact that you get small scope of beans and rice in a tiny corn tortilla bowl.  I assume they do this because most poeple don't eat the beans and rice so it is more cost effective not to serve large amounts.
