I was looking for an alternative to my 3 favorite Vegas Mexican spots (Phat Phranks, El Sombrero, and Mundo) just to change things up. It's not really anywhere close to my house, but it's close enough to my office to justify an occasional lunch here. 

I can't say I was WOWed. Chips and salsa were complimentary, but just "meh". My enchilada had sour cream on top, which was a nice touch, but overall wasn't anything special.

I can say the space was nice and service was very quick. I'll give them another try because prices were fairly reasonable and there might be some hidden gems on the menu to seek out... In the meantime I'll stick with my go-to places for Mexican !
