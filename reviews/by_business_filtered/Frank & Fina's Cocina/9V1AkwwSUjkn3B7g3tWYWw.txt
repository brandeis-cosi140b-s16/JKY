If you're looking for good Mexican food in a nice atmosphere, with great service, try Frank and Fina's.  The staff is very friendly, the food is excellent, and the setting quaint. My favorite on the menu is the cheese enchilada combination. I also like the charbroiled chicken meals when I feel I want something more healthy.  Their chips and salsa is special too.
I've also ordered to go, and I like their service.
