This is a really cute place with tasty Mexican food and a cozy feel. My friend and I came in around 8 on a weeknight - it was still busy! That's a good sign, and when we were seated immediately, I knew it was going to be a good experience, and it was.

The salsa is yummy- not very spicy but a really good flavor. Our food came out pretty quickly - one of my tacos had cotija cheese on it, which I had asked them to replace with regular cheese, but our server took it away immediately and came back quickly with a replacement. I ordered a taco and an enchilada with rice and beans - the taco was good, but the enchilada was really delicious! Next time I'll probably just go with enchiladas only. I love their enchilada sauce. Their beans and rice were a little lacking in flavor, but were still good and I enjoyed my dinner. I was a little under the weather, and I really appreciated the good service we received - I was downing glasses of water quickly and the staff made sure I always had a full glass.

My friend ordered a taco al pastor and thought it was good, but was put off by pineapples in the taco. I'm not sure if it was specified in the menu, so if not, just be aware. 

I just moved back to Vegas and I'm trying everything out, but I could definitely see myself coming back to Frank and Fina's - the food and service were good, and I really enjoyed the atmosphere.
