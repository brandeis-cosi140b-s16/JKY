When they first opened, we came here for their charbroiled chicken.  It was good but not memorable.  It's been a few years and we've haven't thought about the restaurant.  But tonight I came back because I was curious about the sweet potato enchiladas.  

Wow, it was packed tonight.  We waiting 25 minutes for food and another 15 minutes before they took our order.  I ordered the sweet potato enchiladas and my hubby ordered the carnitas.   The sweet potato enchiladas were good but not out of this world great.  It must be all the vegetarians giving the great reviews for the sweet potato enchiladas. Don't get me wrong I love vegetarian food but this dish doesn't make me have that "ah" moment and "OMG" this so the best thing ever.    I would not order it again.  I would however order the carnitas.  I did my ninja move and sneak a fork full of yum yum roast pork from hubby's plate.  The pork was excellent.  It was tender and tasty.  I had some sour cream and salsa with the meat and made it into a 4 star dish.  

Con-  My hubby thought the portion size was too small but I disagree.  It was perfect for me.
