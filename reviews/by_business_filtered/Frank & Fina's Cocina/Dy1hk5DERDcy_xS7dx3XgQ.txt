I tried this place last night for a quick dinner.  I love great Mexican.  I really wanted something authentic.  I was seated quickly and greeted with a warm smile.  I had a Cadillac margarita with petron and grand mariner...  Pricey but good.  I ask the server for recommendations and he walked me through his menu favorites.  I wanted a good mole, and he said they have the best.  The Chef is from Puebla where the sauce originated and he brought out a sample for me to try.  It was delicious.  I ordered mole enchiladas from their specials section of the menu and it was fantastic.  Waaaaaay better than Lindo michocan.  Highly recommended will done again soon.
