I had high expectations going on other yelps reviews and a waitress at Tacos & Tequila also recommended going.

The house margarita was only $5.75 and had a nice portion of tequila.  But the food was only above average and the prices were rather high considering it's a neighborhood restaurant.  Maybe I am too picky.  For less money, I would rather go to Super Mex.
