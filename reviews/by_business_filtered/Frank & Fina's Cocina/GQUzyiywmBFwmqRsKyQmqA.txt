We love this place. Locally owned where the Frank of Frank & Finas  waits tables and ensures guests are happy with the food and service. We had a carne asada burrito and a chicken special. Both were delicious. The salsa has a very nice flavor and the chips are thin and crispy. Overall, a great meal and very affordable. Nice job!
