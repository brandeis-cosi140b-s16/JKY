Yes! A good margarita so close to home!  Came here for the first time on Mother's Day, was expecting a wait but since it was just 2 of us we only had to wait about 5 minutes.  We were seated and I've heard great things about the tamarind margaritas so we started with a round of that.  We were given chips and salsa and margaritas were served.  These tamarind margaritas were the best I've had.  I've had good margaritas and bad margaritas but this was my first tamarind margarita.  It was a perfect combination of sour, sweet and smokey.  I didn't know what to order for my entree so the server recommended the special of the day, chicken enchilada with creamy mushroom sauce.  I don't usually order enchiladas but I love mushrooms so I gave it a try.  When the food came out, my meal was delicious!  The creamy, rich mushroom sauce definitely made the meal and complimented everything else on the plate.  I will definitely come back for the drinks, food and friendly service.
