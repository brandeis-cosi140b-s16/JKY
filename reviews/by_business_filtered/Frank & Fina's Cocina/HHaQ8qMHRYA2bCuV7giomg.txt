Frank & Fina's Cocina remains a consistent dinner choice for me.  I've been branching out from my usual order, and trying to experience more of the menu.  I recently discovered a new favorite:

Machaca Burrito -  I didn't realize how insanely delicious Machaca was, and how fun it is to say....MACHAAAACAAA!!  It's marinated and shredded beef with eggs, and it wants to get to know you.  They do a great  Machaca here, keeping it tender and tasty.

This is the best Mexican cuisine in Spring Valley.

MACHAAAACCAAA!!
