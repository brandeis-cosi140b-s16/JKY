While Las Vegas has no shortage of Mexican restaurants, there aren't many worth visiting more than once.  Frank & Fina's Cocina is one of these delicious stops worth frequenting.  

The staff is friendly and happy to offer recommendations from the kitchen.  Prices are quite reasonable, and the variety on the menu is fantastic.

A few great dishes to try:  Homemade Pollo en Mole (chicken in a rich sauce made from cocoa, peppers, and love)  Carne Asada Tacos.

The dining room is dimly lit but not in a romantic way, and it is usually a bit drafty inside.  This is wonderful during those sweltering August days, but less favorable when the temperature drops.  

Frank & Fina's Cocina is an authentic experience at a fair price, don't miss it amigos.
