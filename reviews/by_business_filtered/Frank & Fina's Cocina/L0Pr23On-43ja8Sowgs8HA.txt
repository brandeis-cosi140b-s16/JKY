Went here for dinner Saturday night. Very nice place. We were greeted at the door, shown to our table. Within seconds we had salsa and chips. our server was great. Brought our drinks quickly. the salsa was a little to hot and spicy for me, the chips were fresh. We ordered bean dip which was very good. I liked the touch of the red onion. It was a small amount and not overwhelming. 
I ordered the charbroiled chicken. BF had the sweet potato enchilada. Both meals were excellent. 
We will be dining here again. Really enjoyed our meal.
