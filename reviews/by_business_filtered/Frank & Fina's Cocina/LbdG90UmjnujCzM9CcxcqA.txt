Went here after searching for a decent mexican restaurant on on this side of town, and decided to try this place....Service was good, fresh brewed iced tea was good, but that was it! The chicken enchiladas I ordered weren't good, chicken had no flavor, and the chicken tamale was gross, it didn't even taste like a mexican tamale.... Next time I will go to a hole in the wall place because that's where you will get a very great meal on the east side of town.
