My fiance and I have been here once and had a very good experience. 

We enjoyed the food and the atmosphere. I would feel comfortable here dressing up a bit on a date or just wearing jeans. The service is good and the food is delicious. 

It has been a few months since we ate here and so my memory as to what I ate exactly is a bit hazy. I do remember some delicious salsa--I place it among the best I have tasted.
