Quite possibly THE BEST Mexican Cuisine in Las Vegas! My favorite spot for sure! The staff is wonderful, the food comes out quick, hot, delicious, and AUTHENTIC. Being from Spanish decent, everything I have tried on the menu, so far, has impressed me!! Being from out of town, I always stop by this place when I'm in Vegas. See you tomorrow :)
