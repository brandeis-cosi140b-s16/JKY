After a long day of climbing at Red Rocks, me and Megan were in search of some Mexican food and some margaritas.  While pissing everyone behind us off driving down West Charleston at 25 mph trying to read every restaurant sign looking for someplace to fill our requirements, I finally saw this free-standing little place and we promptly u-turned and headed back.

Inside was a cozy little place, well-cooled and comfortable.  Our waiter (I'm assuming Frank) came over with chips, salsa, and menus right away.  A+ on the chips and salsa.  An extensive menu (with all-day breakfast... which won Megans heart immediately) made our mouths start watering.  After waffling back and forth over the seemingly better and better choices, Megan finally settled on chicken soup & ropa vieja & I got the al pastor.  We also ordered some guacamole &, of course, margaritas to pass the time.  The guac & soup came out with some supplemental chips and damn were they tasty. Megans soup had large chunks of vegetables floating in it, and our waiter was happy to identify them all for us.  The guacamole was creamy and fresh and hit the spot after a day of dragging 30 lbs of gear through hot canyons.  Our plates came out shortly after... the ropa vieja was juicy as promised, and the al pastor had a great bite to it that really lingered on  the palate.

Frank & Fina's is now our de facto mexican go to place in Vegas.  It's close to the scenic loop in Red Rock Canyon, and still way off the strip.  We're looking forward to our next climbing trip so we can kick back at a more leisurely pace here (we were on our way to the airport after the meal) and really take our time enjoying a great meal in a very  friendly & inviting location.
