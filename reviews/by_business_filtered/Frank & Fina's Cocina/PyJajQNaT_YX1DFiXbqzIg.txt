Frank & Fina's is a quaint family restaurant serving some really good Mexican cuisine.  I've dined here many times there is never a lack of consistent fresh ingredient flavor.  

Daily specials are good, but are always eerily similar to other dishes on the menu.  Service is good and friendly.  Definitely recommend a visit
