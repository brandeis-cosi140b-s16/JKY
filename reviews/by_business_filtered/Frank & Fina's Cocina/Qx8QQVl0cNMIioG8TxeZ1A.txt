Cucumber margarita-falls flat, really nothing special have had better 

Chips and salsa-good chips. wish they had more flavorful salsa

Mole enchiladas-pretty good. Nothing to special again 

Used to go to this place a long time ago and I remember it being a lot better than it is now. Sort of a bummer
