I am wavering between a 3 and 4 stars, but will default to 4 because the food really was fantastic. 
The wife and I ventured to Frank & Fina's at the recommendation of a vegan friend who noted their great vegetarian menu. 
The place is on the small side compared to most Mexican joints in town, but it was a clean, and decorated better than much of its competition. The prices were consistent with other top notch Mexican eateries, and the service was good noting how busy the place was. 
We started with chips and salsa. The chips were pretty standard, but the salsa was really good. Very fresh, and not too chunky, but definitely not watery. 
Every day that have different vegetarian specials, so this is really a shining star for us vegetarians that have to ask questions all the time to make sure we are good with the food.
I had the veggie enchiladas with both red and green sauce, the wife had a hard and soft veggie taco. Both entrees were really good and very flavorful. I liked how the potatoes (yes, potatoes)  and zucchini in both the tacos and enchiladas were cooked. I liked the red sauce more than the green, but that is almost universally the case for me. The black beans were very good, but really salty, and the rice was perfectly cooked, not watery, not slimy but firm and well seasoned. 
We also had mojitos, which were very tasty and pretty strong.  

My only complaint was that the food was super salty, and we could feel that during the rest of our evening. We will definitely be back to sample more of their veggie fare. Also, we noted that both dishes would have been amazing even without cheese, which is not the case for every Mexican place we eat.
