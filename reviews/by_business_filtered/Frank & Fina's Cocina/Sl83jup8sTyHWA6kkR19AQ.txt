Frank and Fina's has been one of my go to favorites for years!  I always suggest it for girly lunches with loads of chatty women and friends or casual dinners.  

It has a very neighborhood feel.  It is very affordable and delicious.  

Margaritas are $5  - try to find that elsewhere.  Sangria is $10 but is served in a little carafe that holds 2 glasses.  

I just dined the other day and everything was tasty and friendly as usual.  The chicken or steak and avocado salad is always a winner.  Lots of steak, sliced red onions, cucmbers, and big slices of fresh avocado all drizzled with house vinaigrette make it a mexican style salad you can sink your teeth into but not feel guilty about.

Their soups are excellent.  I am a big fan of the albondigas (meatball).  It tastes just like a sweet little grandma made it.  Hearty chunks of carrot, chayote, potato, and big flavorful meatballs all on a hot hot slurpable broth.  I usually do a bowl of that and 2 a la carte tacos for a perfect lunch!

They have other winners that I reccomend trying like the sweet potato enchiladas (yup!) and the chuletas - yummy pork chops tossed with copious amounts of blackend onions, served with tortillas and all the goods.

It isn't THE best Mexican you have ever had in your life....but it is very good, very affordable, and a nice place to sit and dine.
