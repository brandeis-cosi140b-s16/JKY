Went to Frank and Fina's and ordered huovous rancheros asked for a side of chili Verde with pork but didn't want a full order asked for asmall bowl which I was prepared to pay extra for. The waitress said she would ask theCook and returned to me know that they did not do that. I was very disappointed and certainly will rethink my choice of places-for Mexican breakfast in the future. I think it was very unaccommodating to me and I was very disappointed. By the wayThe breakfast was a three on a scale of 10. I would not recommend this place for all meal.
