Big glasses of tea.  Good multi chips & salsa. Nice decor & atmosphere.  Friendly quick service.  Tasty chunky guacamole.  Received food fast and hot.  Sweet potato enchiladas to die for.  Complex mole.  Black beans in crispy shell. Big chunks of pork in tamale with tasty verde sauce.  Husband got the ground beef  tacos (always) and loved them.   Big servings and quite reasonable for QUALITY.  In shopping center but easy to see signage.
