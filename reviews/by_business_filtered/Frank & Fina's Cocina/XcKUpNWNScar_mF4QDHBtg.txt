In a city with so many food choices it's nice to know the good ones.  It's a mom and pop type of place with quality food and service.  I've been there many times and the food is always fresh and the service is prompt.  The menu has a wide selection of dishes that range from classic Mexican items to house specialties.  It's defiantly more of a locals place as it off the strip, but if you're in the area check it out.  The fried ice cream is pretty good too.
