Seriously, what is with all the hype?!?!?
We got lousy service and our food was gross. I am not at all a picky eater but their mole tasted like somebody just mixed in yesterday's burnt coffee over some chicken and tortillas and called it a day. 
Keep searching yelpers, I'm sure there is better out their in Las Vegas.
