Chips & salsa were ok, nothing spectacular. I wanted a burrito a la carte and our waitress told us it was the same price as a "meal", no discount. Every Mexican joint I've ever been to has an a la carte menu, apparently they didn't get the news.
I had the carne asada burrito and the meat was way over salted. I also found a small bone in my meat and almost cracked a frickin' tooth, no good. My hunny had some vegetarian enchiladas that she liked but they didn't really stand out amongst the competition.
Service was pretty lame, our waitress never checked on us once throughout our meal which is unacceptable in my opinion. I don't think we'll be going back here.
