I cannot believe I have passed this restaurant for years and not seen it!  Four of us  went after a recommendation from a friend.  Service was excellent, as the waitress filled our water glasses, beverages before the were empty, as well as the salsa and chips.  Salsa was good, with a roasted flavor and spicy!  We ordered the pork mole special, chicken mole enchiladas, sweet potato enchiladas and chicken enchiladas.  All had a side of rice, fried plantains, and refried beans in a molded tortilla shell.  The pork and chicken were both extremely tender and the mole was flavorful and tangy.  The sweet potato enchiladas were unique and had great flavor.  My only disappointment is that I haven't discovered this hidden gem sooner!
Go!  You won't be disappointed!
