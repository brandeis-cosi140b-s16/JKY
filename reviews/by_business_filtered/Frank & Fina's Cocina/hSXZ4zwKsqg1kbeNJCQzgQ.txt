Been here a couple of times and have neglected to review until now (thanks, daily rehearsals!!).  Both visits resulted in happy tummies, assisted by friendly and helpful waitstaff.  All dishes sampled were tasty and flavourful without being greasy.  On my last visit, I enjoyed the huevos and chorizo (scrambled eggs and sausage) immensely -- spicy, filling, and yummy.  Portions are generous and the chips and salsa appetizer (gratis) help to stave hunger pangs while waiting for your meal.  The salsa could be a little bit spicier, but it tasted fresh and tomato-y.  

The decor has an intimate feel to it: dim lighting and understated wall art (nothing gaudy or over-the-top).  I would enjoy a dinner here on a date night.  :)
