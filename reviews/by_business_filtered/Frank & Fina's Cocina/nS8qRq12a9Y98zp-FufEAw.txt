Love Frank & Fina's.  I got my standard  combo #1, chicken tostada with cheese enchilada and my mom, her favorite, chicken enchiladas suizas.  I love the red sauce which is a bit more bitter than sweet - their salsa awesome as usual - not chunky, but with just enough kick.  I appreciate the allowance to substitute rice and bean with a side salad.  Their house dressing is awesome.  Always excellent customer service, and a homey environment yet traditional.
