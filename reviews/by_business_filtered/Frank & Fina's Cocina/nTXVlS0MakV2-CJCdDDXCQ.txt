I really really like this place.

Free chips and salsa
Cheap but delicious food
Friendly and attentive wait staff (our bus boy was helping out the waiter so we wouldn't be sitting there waiting)

The only things we didn't like was not enough chorizo in the queso fundido, it was still delicious. The horchata was from a powder mix (we had to stir it a bit more to get it mixed well enough). 

I got the pork chile verde, it comes with rice and beans. The rice is amazing, I love Mexican rice when it's done right. The beans were also really good and come in a little tostada cup. I really like that they do this because it keeps the beans from getting all over the food. The pork was delicious. Best I've had. 

For dessert we got the coconut flan. I have mixed feelings about it because I was expecting coconut flavored flan, this was regular flan with toasted coconut on top. Still good just not as good as I hoped.

Our server was an older man, such a sweetie. All in all for 2 adult plates, 1 kid's plate, 1 appetizer and 1 dessert and 3 drinks was about $50. Loved it!
