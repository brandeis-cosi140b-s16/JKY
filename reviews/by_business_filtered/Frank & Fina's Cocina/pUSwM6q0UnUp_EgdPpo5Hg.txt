Went here about 6 weeks ago, just getting around to posting a review.  Overall the food was pretty good.  Maybe nostalgic memories of them over on Charleston and Lindell are leaving me just a little dissatisfied.  I gotta wonder if the memory of food establishments from 20 years ago is really a good comparison for their current product offerings.
