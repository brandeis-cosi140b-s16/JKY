I went there for lunch to sample the food as I wanted to place a large order for my daughter's graduation party. My review is for the catering experience. For about $20.00 per person (including tax) we got a massive amount of food, 3 types of fajitas (including shrimp, which was incredibly tasty and plentiful) carnitas empanadas, spinach and cheese tamales, and the tastiest cheese enchiladas I ever had. They were so soft, they tasted like they were wrapped in pasta, not tortillas. All this plus rice, beans, guacamole salsa, lettuce, cheese and tortillas. Everybody was very impressed by the food. I was also VERY impressed by the personal service, the owners themselves brought the food and helped me set it up. Very nice people, and Fina, the lady who helped me with the order, was very helpful, professional and pleasant. I highly recommend this restaurant!
