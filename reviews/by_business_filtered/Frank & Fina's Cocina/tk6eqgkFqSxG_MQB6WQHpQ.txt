Every table filled at 8 pm on a Thursday should begin to tell you about this little hole in the wall Mexican Cocina. Reasonable prices and great service. Fresh chips and salsa was a great way to start. My husband ordered the ribeye and shrimp fajitas and I ordered the shrimp diavlo. Amazing! For dessert we shared a cream filled churro served with ice cream topped with caramel and chocolate sauce. We highly recommend and will be back again soon!
