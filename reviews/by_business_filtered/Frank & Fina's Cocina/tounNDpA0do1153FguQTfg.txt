I've been coming to Frank and Finas for years now. Used to go to the old location on Charleston too. I had to review because I am surprised at all the negative service comments. Every time I have had great service, always fast and super friendly. Frank and his daughter are always helpful and on top of everything. Love the vegetarian items but my heart belongs to the shredded beef tacos and chile rellanos. It's surprisingly hard to find good Mexican food in Vegas and this place is consistently good. Still miss my LA Mexican joints though!
