I've never been big on Mexican food and when I do, I'm very picky in what I eat so the restaurant should have a big menu.  F&F's had just that.  From the outside, it's a little unclear whether the place is still in business (only because so many businesses in that area go out so quickly). But upon entering F&F's you know right away that this is going to be a good experience. 
The atmosphere is friendly right from the beginning and decor is one that makes you really feel in the mood for Mexican food.  The waiters are very nice and prompt and help with any questions (i usually have a few).  The food came fast and tasted as good, if not better, than any Mexican food I've had.  
The prices are very reasonable and I can't wait to get in the mood for Mexican food again so I can go.
