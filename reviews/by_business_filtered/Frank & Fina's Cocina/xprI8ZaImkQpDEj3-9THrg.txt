My dad and I stopped in here one night after taking a cooking class nearby.  It looked interesting and had a good menu.  Besides, we are always up for Mexican food.  Having never heard of Frank and Fina's previously I had no expectations going in.  I leave feeling full but not fully satisfied.  To start, the chips and salsa were alright.  Crisp chips and generic salsa that tastes more of tomato than anything else.  Sure, I ate it by the bowl full but that does not mean it was an outstanding example of what can be a magical accomaniment to a chip.  For dinner I ordered a classic two item combo with a taco and tamale and the obligitory rice and beans.  The rice was good and the beans were refried.  I much prefer black beans to refried pintos but that is just me.  The taco I had was ipressive loaded with flavorful and tender meat.  It dripped half way down my arm towards my elbow.  That is the measure of a good taco.  As for the tamale, the flavor was alright and the ratio of meat to maza was fine.  it was the texture that threw me.  The maza was too smooth and seemed over processed.  I am used to a grittier form of maza.  I guess this isn't my favorite place to get Mexican food.
