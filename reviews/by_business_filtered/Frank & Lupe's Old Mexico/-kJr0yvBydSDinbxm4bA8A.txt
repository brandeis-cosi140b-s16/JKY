I love Frank and Lupe's. As a transplant from New Mexico, I can get my food fix here that feels like home. They also have a restaurant in Socorro New Mexico. I love their red chile. They have a huge bowl of chicken green chile stew that hits the spot when you are under the weather. I introduced a friend to Frank and Lupe's. She was missing New Mexico. It is her new go to place for comfort food. I think it must be time to go get enchildas!
