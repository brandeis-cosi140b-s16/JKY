There is a problem in the kitchen, the kitchen had a fire...not exactly sure what we heard, but hey, the food was good, so...  We both ordered the Carne Asada Burrito, Beans, and Rice special.  I loved the flavor of the rice, and the beans were pretty decent too.  The burrito, though it looked fairly plain, actually had very good flavor.  The chips and salsa at the beginning were tasty as well, although I have to admit, the taste of the chips far out did the taste of the salsa.  The only "complaint", and not really a complaint, was the service was kind of lacking in refilling drinks, etc...  otherwise, I thought, very worth the money spent.
