Went with another couple to get caught up over Christmas time.  Horrible service right from the start.  Had to ask for everything.  Loud obnoxious group there at the same time so forget being able to hear your own table if there's a crowd.  Took forever for our food to come.  Forever for the check, which was NOT worth the price. First and last experience there.  Too bad cause we're locals who love Mexican food.
