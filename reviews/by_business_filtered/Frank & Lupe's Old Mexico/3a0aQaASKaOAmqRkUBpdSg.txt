I've been to Frank & Lupes more times then I can count because of its close location and great food. Everything I've tried has been delicious especially the enchiladas and shredded beef tacos. Margaritas are nice and tasty too. Chips and Salsa are addictive but only the first bowl is free. Refills are $2. (Always get them on the come back...) 

The service however is lacking. More then one occasion, I would have to flag down a waiter for water, refills and even the bill. Sitting in the dining room versus the covered patio makes no difference in service. I have never been to the patio area out back. But if you are in the mood for good Mexican food and you are not in a hurry, this is a good place. (I have to disclose that I have only been here on Friday nights where service is extremely slow. I recently stopped by early Saturday Night and the service was attentive! So maybe it's just the staff on weeknights.)
