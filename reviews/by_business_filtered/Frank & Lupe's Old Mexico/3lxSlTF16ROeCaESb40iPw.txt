Looking for a very good Mexican Restaurant??....you found it here.  Homemade salsa had the perfect "kick" and the homemade chips were warm and perfectly salted.  We dined in the original "house" which was fun and historic.  So many margaritas to choose from, but we stuck with the original and they were tasty.  Carne adobada was perfectly spiced, service was good, and best part....they had Victoria Beer....great dining experience and great food!
