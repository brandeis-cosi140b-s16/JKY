Solid food!!  Best Mexican food I've had in a while - and it is my favorite type of food!  This has more of a New Mexico flare with just the right amount of spice and flavor in everything.  The salsa was very fresh and tasty, the main course was very filling and exploding with flavor, and to end it all were some delicious homemade sopapillas (which were included with our meal)!!  Service was great, kids meal choices were terrific for my 3 year old and price was right on!!  I will be back for sure.
