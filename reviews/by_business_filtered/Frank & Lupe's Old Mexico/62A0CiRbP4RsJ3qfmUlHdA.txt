Setting:  Nice place, feels very much like south of the border.  Nice decor.  The only thing is, you have to go outside and around the building to go to the restroom.

Food:  I had the tostada, and it was very good.  I'm surprised it doesn't come with sour cream...I had to ask for it on the side.  Adding some of the salsa that's given with the free chips (which were also very good btw) made it that much better.

Service:  Very nice waiter, very helpful.  However, I didn't like the fact that they didn't refill our appetizer chips and salsa.  There's a note up front that says "due to cutbacks...etc etc."  But we were a group of 6 and we should've gotten more, instead of what seemed like only for 3 or 4.  :(  Understandable tho, but unfortunate.
