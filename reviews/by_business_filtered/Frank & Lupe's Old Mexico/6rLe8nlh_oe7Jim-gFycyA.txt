I have been here numerous times... love the food and the margaritas.  The service sometimes is excellent and other times it is not so good.  I do however always come back so I guess I take my chances in order to enjoy their food.  I love the spinach cheese crisp and the rolled enchilada's plate.  Their chips and salsa are awesome!
