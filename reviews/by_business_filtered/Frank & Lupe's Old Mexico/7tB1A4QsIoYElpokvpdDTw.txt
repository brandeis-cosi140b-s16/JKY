This place is freaking awesome!  There's nothing like hanging out on a patio in 80 degree weather after a spring training game getting refreshed from one of the best margaritas in Scottsdale...nothing.  

Everything aside, the margaritas were freaking awesome.  My buddy Chris R and I conducted a skateboard margarita tour of Scottsdale one Saturday, and I've gotta say that Frank and Lupe's were definitely near the top.

Their patio is to die for.  I would rather wait for an outdoor table for an hour than be immediately seated inside.  

The food - as a previous reviewer said it's on par with similar "gringo" Mexican places; not bad but not what you target on a quest for authentic.

The service has been slow at times, but for the most part I've never had any issue.  I look forward to every opportunity to return to this refreshing break from the Scottsdale norm!!
