I was sooooo excited to see the stuffed sopapillas on the menu!  I can't find them anywhere.   Alas,  they weren't what I was expecting.  The sopapillas where small and flattened (a little like tortillas).  The beef and red chili was placed on top ( not stuffed).  The dish was tasty but disappointing.  At least the beer specials are good.  Of all the Mexican food places I've been to in the neighborhood so far...this one is the best.
