This is the place to go if your looking for a good Mexican restaurant in Old Town.  Frank & Lupe's has decent prices (not your typical Scottsdale prices) with very authentic Mexican food. There is also never a true crowd or wait but is always has a constant flow of people but be prepared on a Friday or Saturday night.  

The chicken enchiladas with poblano sauce was recommended to me once and I have never looked back, they are always on my order.  My last trip here I tried to beef tacos are are scrumptious, the taco shells are homemade -  yummm! This just brings me to the chips, which are also homemade and usually come to the table either warm or hot.  Salsa is different and adds a little kick.  Always have wanted to try a house margarita, everyone seems to order them so maybe give it a shot!
