This is a solid Mexican food restaurant in Old Town Scottsdale. Frank and Lupes is traditional, and a little off the beaten path of other "mexican restaurants" in the area. The food IS top notch. I have taken family members there many times and introduced them to the restaurant, everyone is always pleased. When the weather is nice, the back patio is an ideal place to sit. Their margaritas are great!
