Gorgeous day on Monday and nothing cures my hangover like Mexican beer. Husband and I headed over to Frank and Lupe's to sit on the patio and enjoy the sun. Their complimentary chips are delicious and they don't give too large a portion, so as to avoid not having room for the main dish. Little bit of a pet peeve is having chips down before the water, but drinks were quickly delivered following the drop. The waitress was terribly slow, but it was obvious she was busy and not neglectful. It did not affect service. Why? Sometime you realize the true hero of restaurants is the back server (aka the busboy). The back server took our drink orders and made sure we were o.k. whenever the waitress was not around (which was pretty often). 
I ordered the fish tacos and husband ordered the chimichanga. He was a huge fan of the meat, believing it to be of a higher quality than others he had at Mexican food restaurants. My fish tacos were delicious and gone in about two minutes. It was good to be reminded that this gem is close to home and should be added to the dining out rotation.
