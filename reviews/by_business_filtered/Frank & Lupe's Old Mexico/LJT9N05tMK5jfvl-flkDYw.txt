Probably one of the better chimichanga I've eaten.  On top of its decent size, it was packed full of beef!  I definitely got my money's worth with this item.

Although we got lucky, I can imagine the wait to eat here being extremely long.  The restaurant is pretty tiny and parking is kind of tough in the area.
