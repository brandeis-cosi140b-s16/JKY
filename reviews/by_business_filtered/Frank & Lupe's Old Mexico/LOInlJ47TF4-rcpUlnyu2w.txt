4 stars for charm, 2 stars for food and service. I have now been 3 times to Frank & Lupe's, each time hoping for it to be better. The place has been open for a long while, and it seems to attract the locals, so I am assuming something is done right. Not so much. First, the place is charming in an old fashioned sort of way. The patio is a lovely hideaway in the busy Old Town Scottsdale, the inside of the restaurant could use a little updating. I am mostly nervous about sitting in the room to the side of the entrance. The little room is packed with tables, the windows are barred and there does not appear to be an emergency exit. In case of fire in the main room I think you're screwed. Perhaps I'm paranoid but as a meeting planner I see these things. 

Now to the food and service. The place looks like grandma is in the kitchen whipping up delicious family recipes you can't get enough of. Sadly, each meal I have had has been soggy or dry and crusty, and either too spicy or lacking flavor. Grandma's authentic touch is definitely missing from the kitchen. 

The service is lacking too. The hostess or servers aren't welcoming and good luck getting a refill on anything. 

Need a place to hang out on the patio with a margarita and chips, this is it. For a great Mexican meal, not so much.
