My friend was in town helping her sister get settled at ASU and they were in the mood for some close to authentic Mexican food. It's kind of a hidden gem, I've passed by this place tons of times while in the area and never even noticed it. I joined everyone on the patio and we immediately ordered a round of margaritas. They had the misters and the fans going so surprisingly it was bearable on the patio. I loved the ambiance of the patio, it's not super chic or anything but it's comfortable and makes you feel like you're on vacay somewhere near a beach :-) 

The margaritas were tasty but this is where it started to go downhill for me...the service here is terrible, awful, slow, confusing, and a whole bunch of other words I'm not going to list. After we got our margs we sat with our menus in hand for a good 20 min! We didn't notice at first because we were chatting but after a while we were out of chips and salsa and noticed no one had come over to take our order. After we flagged down a server he took our orders, we asked for a refill on the chips and and salsa and water while we waited for our entrees and of course that never made it to our table. As we looked over to the bar area we noticed the servers and bartenders and servers chatting it up and watching the game, UNACCEPTABLE. 

Our food came out surprisingly fast! I ordered the shrimp enchiladas with half red and half greens sauce, it came with the standard rice and black beans. It was pretty yummy the sauces had a kick to them and mixed well with the cheeses. 

If I wasn't having such a great time with my friends I would have definitely asked to speak to a manger. I wanted to give this place at least 3 stars but the bad service completely overshadowed my experience at this restaurant.
