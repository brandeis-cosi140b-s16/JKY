I would like to give this place more stars bc the food was actually pretty good but there were def a few dings and one big negative for me. Like most everyone, if agree that service was pretty slow. Not as bad as some people but considering the number of staff I saw and the small place, not the most efficient. I ordered Franks Enchilada plate. Basically like a Mexican lasagna. Tortilla layered with beans, meat, sauce and then repeated two more times topped by a sunny side egg. Hence the warning about eating undercooked food next to it. 
On the menu I noticed meat was $2 extra so since it was already $10 I decided to go lite. When the waiter took my order, he asked if I wanted chicken or beef like it came with it and I just had to choose. Not "did I want to add it to my meal". Figuring I read the menu wrong I choose chicken. When the bill came, I saw that $2 charge. The waiter was nice enough but that left a bad taste in my mouth. 
As for the entree it was good though. The sopapillas that it comes with I thought were pretty lacking. It's flat pieces of dough that are fried. Normally fried anything is good but this was meh. I agree with one yelper, it should come out after the meal, not during.  And it should come out hot. It was cold fried dough served with bottle of honey. 
I would have normally rated this place with 2 stars bc of the not so honestness of the waiter but the 3rd star goes out to the bus woman who I think worked the hardest at customer service there. She was pleasant and helpful when we needed here. Since we didnt see our waiter that often, she made a difference. She's the one who took care of us better. Props to her!
