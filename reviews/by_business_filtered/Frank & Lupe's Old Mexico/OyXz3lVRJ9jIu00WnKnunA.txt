We go to Frank & Lupe's at least once a month. We always have a great meal. Their chips and salsa are very, very yummy. Margaritas are also very tasty. 

Service can be a bit slow sometimes, but given how busy they always are, it is understandable. We will always wait for good food. You should too.....
