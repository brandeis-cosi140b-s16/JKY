The stars I'm giving this place are for the food only. The chips and salsa were okay. I had their chicken poblano enchiladas and they were really ,really tasty. I went with my dad for his birthday because this is one of his favorite places to eat. I enjoyed the patio atmosphere also and hope the next time I'm in Arizona to eat here again. 

The only problem I have with  the place is that the service was awful. Seriously, the worst. I would give the service 1 star or LESS .The waiter acted as though he was distracted the whole time. He never re-filled our chips. It took over 20 minutes to bring us our drink order (diet soda and ice tea) and we never got re-fills on our drinks either. He barely made contact with us to take our order. Thankfully I didn't have any questions for him because I'm not sure he would have stopped to answer them if I had. They were busy but only with a Sunday crowd. We didn't go on a weekend night when I expect delays and distracted waiters. This was at 5:00 on a Sunday. Thankfully their food is good and the atmosphere is nice because otherwise I wouldn't recommend this place based on service alone.

I just saw on some other yelper's review that chips and salsa are only free the first round. REALLY?  Maybe I won't be back.
