We were looking for some great Mexican Food in old town and certainly didn't find it here.  The food was below average which was very disappointing.  The place looked like it was going to be great according to photos on the wall even Bobby Flay has met the owner I just hope he didn't taste the food.  The restrooms were located outside around the back of the building which sucked because our children had to go so that took considerable extra time.  The service was less than impressive as we had to beg for drink refills and table service.  They also forgot our desert.  Just an all around lame experience.
