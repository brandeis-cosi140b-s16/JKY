The only thing that must keep this place alive is a great outdoor patio and good location. The service is awful, as in it's painfully obvious the management has no commitment to serving the customer. Sat down on a less than busy Sunday evening, and waited 15 minutes before drink orders were taken. After emptying the first glass the food arrived, and the drinks were not refilled until 3/4 of the way through the meal. What server doesn't check in on drinks, especially when the food arrives? I also had to go to the bar to get my silverware. The food is at the lower end of the spectrum on quality, considering the multitude of options.  

I was angry when I paid the bill, and wish I had picked someplace else. With a lot of options, this place is a no go. Take Filberto's to the park, and the squirrels will likely service you better. Win -win. 

Plus, don't order an extra basket of chips, that will cost you. WTF.
