I was in this area due to a business trip. Our cab driver recommended our party of five to one of his favourite authentic Mexican restaurants. 

ENVIRONMENT: Very cute and quaint and located in oldtown Scottsdale. We got seated in the inside of one of their houses/buildings (Interesting setup). Great for groups. They also have a nice patio. 

SERVICE: Our waiter was very friendly and made some great recommendations to his favourite dish and drinks, the spicy level of dishes.

FOOD: I ordered a sangria $7 and fish tacos approx $12. I'm not very experienced in Mexican food but the fish tacos seemed quite authentic to me. There's 3 soft tacos. The fish, although fried, was not too oily for my taste, which I quite liked. It also comes with rice, beans, and pico de gallo (salsa). 

I'd come back again for drinks with friends - the ambience is lovely!
