I think that Frank and Lupe's must have had an off night when we got there... 

It started with a margarita and when they delivered it there was lipstick on a dirty glass.  I asked for another and when they made it I could see they just poured the old marg into a new glass.  I'm not picky, but thats just a tad bit unprofessional.  The chips and salsa were great and my food tasted really good.

So why the bad review?  Food Poisoning...  The next 24 hours of my life after visiting Frank and Lupe's was horrendous.  I don't want to disparage a local business but after the experience with the margarita and my time in the emergency room, I can say I will never go back.  I suggest the owners of Frank and Lupe's do a top to bottom inspection of their kitchen as I got really, really sick.  I looked up the last inspection of the restaurant and it confirms some of why this may have happened:
