This place gets 3 stars from most.  2 from me.  Nothing special except the patio atmosphere was nice.  Margarita nothing special but was $9.  Guac had no flavor.  
Food average at best.  Service was fast but unfriendly.  Have not been anywhere else for Mexican yet but I hope it can beat this.  In Arizona I hoped to get so really good authentic mexican.  This wasn't  it!
