My family and I came here on a Friday night in search of some authentic Mexican food in Scottsdale, where we were vacationing for the Giants Spring Training. I had heard about Frank and Lupe's through Yelp so I had some high expectations, but unfortunately I was disappointed. We showed up for dinner around 9:15 and decided to sit outside on their heated patio; which was the highlight of the evening. We waited about 10 minutes for our server to come by and take our drink order, and eventually our food order. We had also ordered an order of guacamole as fellow Yelp users raved about the guacamole, but we didn't get it before our dinner arrived, rather in the middle of it, when we had already gone through 2 baskets of chips (which cost $2 after the first basket!). I do have to say that their margaritas are really tasty; I ordered a Cazadores margarita on the rocks with salt, yum!; for dinner, I ordered the #8 I believe, the spinach and cheese enchiladas with verde sauce. The sauce on the enchiladas was really zesty, and the spinach added a much needed freshness to the dish; rice and beans were also good. Our bill came, and eventually the server came back to run through the credit card. My family and I left with high expectations not being met, and saying, "I probably wouldn't come back here again."
