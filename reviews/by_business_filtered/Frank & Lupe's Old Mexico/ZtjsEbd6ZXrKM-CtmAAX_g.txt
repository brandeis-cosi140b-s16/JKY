My experience was a mix of what others have said. I went at around 0730 and there were several open tables, I was greeted quickly and seated. The service was fast and friendly, I ordered the combo plate and was surprised how quickly it came out. Unfortunately the food itself wasn't very good. The taco's ground beef was too salty (and I generally like salty), the rest of the food was fairly bland and only luke warm to boot- the plate was hot, just not the food on it. After the food was delivered the service also disappeared, no refills or offers the entire time there.
Food- 2 stars
Service- 4 when seated, 1 after- so strange
Atmosphere- 3 stars
Value- 2 stars
