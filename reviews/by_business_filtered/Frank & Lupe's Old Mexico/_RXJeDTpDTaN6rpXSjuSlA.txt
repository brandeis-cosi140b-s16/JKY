Yum and Yum. I've lived here for 21 years and this is the first time to Frank & Lupe's. What a waste of the time I've missed. Great beans folks for starters - I mean great beans!! Typical Mexican fare off the menu but cooked perfectly without too much grease or fuss. Good chips and salsa, though you must ask for another basket. Attentive staff in a cozy space in Old Town. I can't wait to get back!
