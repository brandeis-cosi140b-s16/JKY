It's not my fave, but it's not awful.  A couple friends drug me here earlier today... I was wanting basic tacos and/or light apps and good margaritas, like what you'd find on a happy hour menu, but the girlfriend wanted "good mexican food" and didn't want to try a new spot fearing she might be left disappointed. They (she and her man) advised me if I hadn't had the cheese crisp and F & L's, i hadn't yet lived. A cheese crisp was ordered and they were correct in that it is not the crappy thin tortilla with burnt cheese that i've seen in other establishments. Its almost a crust and there is a nice amount of cheese, with a lil pico, shredded lettuce and sour cream to accompany. It was fairly spicy and tasted like jalapenos had been rubbed all over it, but it was a good spicy.  Much to my dismay, there was no happy hour on the weekend.  =/  I ordered a large house margarita. It wasn't great. I looooove margaritas and this one leaves you wanting to go somewhere for a good house margarita (like Cien Agave?)  For food, i had the chicken chimichanga with both red and green sauces (no fancy taco creations here folks, just traditional mexican food.) Red is spicy! Green is almost flavorless in comparison. The rice was decent and the beans were really good. They were the one thing I finished on my plate! I should also give props to the server as he was prompt and attentive!
F & L's is decent, but not my cup of tea. I'll stick to the taquerias from now on!
