The service on the back patio almost always sucks (1 server for about 15 tables), and their margaritas are the worst I've ever had (I think they make them with Lime-Aid or some crap like that)  But, we keep going back. And this is why--it's freakin hard to find good Mexican in Scottsdale.  And of all the options, F&L is one of the best (definitely #1 in its price range). The back patio has great atmosphere, the food is pretty decent and very reasonably priced, the salsa is pretty good, and their sopapillas are amazing.  As long as you're not in a rush, I highly recommend Frank & Lupe's.
