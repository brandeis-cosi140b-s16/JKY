Just returned to SD from AZ.  Yelped to find a mexican restaurant in Scottsdale.   This place had a good number of reviews, we decided to give it a try.   The food is wonderful!  The service was very slow, but once we received our entrees we were more forgiving.   The abodoba burrito had hunks of tender, savory beef, with cooked for hours flavor and the rolled enchiladas were wonderful too.   They offer green or red sauce and I went with the green, a nice change and so much flavor.  Two cheese and one shredded beef enchilada with rice and beans.  Everything was prepared from scratch and full of flavor.    They will charge for drink refills and the margaritas are very pricey.  Chips may cost extra for an additional basket.  We'd go back again, the food is really wonderful.
