I expected much better Mexican food from this place.  It was merely okay.  The salsa did not excite me, and the sauce on my green enchilada was just alright.  The service was rather.....Scottsdale (I was doing the server a favor by eating there).  It was clean and the vibe is fine, but I'm judging it solely on the food, and the plate gave me no yearning to go back again.
