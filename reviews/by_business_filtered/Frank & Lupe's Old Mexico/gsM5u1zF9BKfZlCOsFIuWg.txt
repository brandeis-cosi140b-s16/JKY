best Mexican food in town...hands down.  I love the enchilada plates (under Frank or Lupe) the sopapillas are so good it should be illegal.  The salsa is so good I want to drink it.  This is authentic Mexican food so if you are Americanized in your taste stick to Manuel's.  But if you are from the MidWest/Pacific NW/East Coast and don't have access to this fare, you should definitely come here!
