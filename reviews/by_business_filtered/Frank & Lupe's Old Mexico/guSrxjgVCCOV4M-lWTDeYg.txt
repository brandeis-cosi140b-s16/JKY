I love Frank & Lupe's... I had the Chile reyenos... It was so spicy... Mmmm!  

I also tasted the chimichangas. I wish it was a little crispier, but nonetheless, it was delicious... and when I upgraded the tequila and added Cointreau to my margarita, it was outstanding. 

They are having a party on their patio with a mariachi band on Friday. .. I will be there with my girls... Woohoo! 

Sorry - I know - i am a terrible speller... LOL  :  )
