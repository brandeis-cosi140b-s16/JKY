I'm back and forth on this place. On one hand, I've had superific wonderful delicious experiences filled with impeccable service and great food. On the other hand - there was today.

- No server for about 15 minutes

- No chips and salsa 'til we asked (then they took forever to bring the chips)

 - Ordered drinks that never arrived

- Ordered guacamole that never arrived

- Waiter was retarded and sucky, possibly just a random man who walked in and pretended to be a waiter as we would ask him for stuff and he would never deliver

- Random waitress stops by to find out if we ordered yet. We tell her "no." So she takes our order.

- While you are at it , sister: Where is our soda and chips and gauc??? She looks horrified and brings them promptly. Thank you waitress lady and no thank you to you sh*tty waiter #1

- Food takes billions of years. Possibly trillions.

- We ask where food is at, yo. 

- They find our food.

- It's a little dry (like, no sauce on the enchilada's bro)

- But otherwise food is good

But wait... there's more...

 - Where are our utensils???

- Waiter says we can have forks, but no knives. The knives are being washed right now.

???

- With one bite left, waiter brings newly washed knives

- Ice cream please

- Fried ice cream good 

So...today was notsogood for Frank & Lupe's. Normally this place is much better. I think this is a 4 star place that has a 1 star day. I'll be back soon hoping for a better day.
