Normally I like to order an item from a menu without making many changes to the dish - especially if I have not had it before. I like to try it as the chef intended. In this case I decided to add their mole sauce to my dish that was not supposed to come with it.  I was glad I did - the mole made the dish. It was great, and everything tasted fresh and homemade. What made my meal was the skinny margarita I had.  I never had a "skinny" margarita but I generally don't like how sweet regular margs are, so I gave it a try. It was amazing, and I have not had a better one since.  It was very expensive - so after I saw the price on the bill I was a bit shocked, but it was worth it.  It was quite strong too.
