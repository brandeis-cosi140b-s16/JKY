If your looking for Authentic True Mexican then this is it!  I have tried all the "fancy" places in oldtown, and this place blows them all out of the water!  The food is AMAZING!  Everything is great!  I just moved out of state and crave them on the daily.  everything is so fresh.  The service there is a hit or miss.  I've had both, but honestly the food is outstanding that I don't care!  They could neglect me all they want and I would still bring my whole family there!  Please open a Frank & Lupe's in San Diego!  I miss it terribly.
