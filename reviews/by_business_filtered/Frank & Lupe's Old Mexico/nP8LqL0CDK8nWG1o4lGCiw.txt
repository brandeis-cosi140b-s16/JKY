I love this place - it's yummy food - great old school service - love sitting outside. I'd say its my fav casual, cheap mexi food spot in AZ easily!  I also love that after dinner, we can go browse the art studios with our three year old in tow.  Inside is stuffy and loud - sit outside if you can!!!!
