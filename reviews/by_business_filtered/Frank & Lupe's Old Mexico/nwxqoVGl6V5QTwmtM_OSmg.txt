Three and a half stars. Frank and Lupe's is more authentic to me than it is tasty, though I have always found it to be very pleasant and accommodating. 

During the breakfast hour, I recommend the Huevos Rancheros. I have been fortunate enough to eat these in Mexico a number of times, and the F and L's version is the closest I have found on this side of the border. 

Chips and salsa are also to par, which is always a good barometer. The lunches I have had there have been good, but slightly disappointing after the impressive breakfast. 

A charming, comfortable spot, with good food and good service.
