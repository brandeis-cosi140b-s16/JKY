Sweet Jeebus, I miss this place. Dearly.

We were regulars at this awesome joint, and enjoyed sweet margaritas on the open patio in the back of the restaurant. This place definitely seems out of place when you first see it...right along the Scottsdale Art District, but you NEED to go in. 

I have many fond memories of this place, seeing as we moved back to Denver (and I can't seem to find a solid Mexican place here in CO that boasts both good food and ambiance), I dearly wish there was one here! Favorites of mine were the smothered burrito and the SOPAPILLAS with honey. 

There was an unusual time when there was some kind of Elvis impersonator singing on the back patio, but it made for truly a one-of-a-kind experience. I will cherish my many memories of Frank and Lupe's, and will count the days until I can once again sit on that patio  with a marg in hand, and a smile on my face.

This place has some serious charm, and isn't for the uptight. If you want to get some good, laid-back Mexican eats on a warm evening, you can't find anything better than dinner under the stringed-lights of the patio.
