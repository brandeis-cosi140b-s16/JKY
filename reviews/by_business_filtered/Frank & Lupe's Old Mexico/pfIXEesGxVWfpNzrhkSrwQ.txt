Fantastic Mexican food at very reasonable prices.  Service is stellar.  

Eat outside on the patio if at all possible because the tiny dining room is more of enclosed porch or something and it is not terribly comfortable and VERY loud.  If you're unfortunate enough to show up when a few children are in there -- look out.  It is a yelling contest.  Maybe they could add some different furniture (wooden tables and chairs and tile floors) to absorb some of the sound.  I don't know.  Either way, the food is worth it.  

Chicken enchiladas with poblano sauce is the BOMB 

CHIMICHANGAS are giant and delicious. 

Chips and salsa are fresh and fantastic.  

Margaritas will knock you on your a$$ literally.
