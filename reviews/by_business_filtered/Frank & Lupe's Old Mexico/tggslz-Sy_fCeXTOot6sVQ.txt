We were there for lunch on a gorgeous Saturday afternoon, and seated ourselves on the patio.  Unfortunately, there was one waitress serving about a half dozen tables  on the patio while tending the bar, so service was slow throughout our visit.  The salsa was a notch above taco sauce from a bottle, not a good start.  One of my favorite dishes is carne adovada, with it's rich, smoky, sometimes spicy flavor, so I went with the carne adovada plate.  Wow, was this one a disappointment!   The meat, usually moist and fall off the bone tender,  was dry and chewy.  The sauce was primarily tomato based, and lacked the kind of flavor that you find at Los Dos Molinos or Carlsbad Tavern.  And it was over salted.  The accompanying beans and rice were forgettable, the 2 sopapillas that came with the meal were OK.  For what it's worth, though, the table of visitors from Wisconsin next to ours seemed to be enjoying themselves.  Hasta la vista, Frank and Lupe.
