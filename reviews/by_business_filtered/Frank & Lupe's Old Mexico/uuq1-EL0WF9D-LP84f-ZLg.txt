The food was ok, not great.  The service was indifferent.  Yep, that is my word of the day, indifferent.  Maybe it just was not the servers finest day, but at least pretend like you want to serve your clientele.  

Oh, one of our diners had found ants climbing up and down her water glass.  The server replaced it but did not offer anything in the way of "I am sorry about that" or anything...just kind of swooped it away and put a fresh one in it's place.  So ah yeah, maybe that was not so appetizing.
