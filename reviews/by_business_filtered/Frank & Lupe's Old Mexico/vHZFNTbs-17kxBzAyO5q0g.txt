Came here based on a recommendation from a colleague.

Eh.  Honey, I've had better Mexican food in DC.  Yeah, that says a lot.  (The extra star is for the wonderful service.)

I had the combo platter, since I wasn't sure what to have.  The pork tamales was too thick and dried.  I make better tamales myself.  The cheese enchilada was a joke.  They were skimpy on the cheese both inside and outside the enchilda.  No taste/flavor at all.  The beef taco was a surprise.  I found myself savoring every bite of it.  The rice...so-so.

The waiters were attentive.  They did their best handing 20 of us.  Not an easy job but they made it!  So, they alone deserve a star.

Nonetheless, I wouldn't recommend this place to friends.
