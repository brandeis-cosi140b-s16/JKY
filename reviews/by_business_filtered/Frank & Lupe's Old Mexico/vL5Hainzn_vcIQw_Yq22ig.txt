This was the last stop on the pub crawl.  Time for some sustanence (and margaritas) for most of us.  Time to throw up in the pushes for the birthday boy (and for a commercial pilot don't you think he'd have a higher tolerance - aren't they always drinking and whoring around - kidding).  The baby mama and I split some very nice enchiladas and I still maintain that it was the margaritas here that put me over the edge.  Regardless of that useless gibberish, they have nice drinks (big pitchers), good food, and lots of patio seating.  Useless tidbit:  there was a drunk guy in the bathroom with the door wide open taking his sweet time putting his junk away, proudly announcing (to anyone who would listen) that he was proud of what he had.  Dinner and entertainment.
