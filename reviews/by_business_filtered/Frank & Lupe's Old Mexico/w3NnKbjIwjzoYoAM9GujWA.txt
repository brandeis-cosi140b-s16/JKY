I have traveled to the Phoenix area twice in the last couple of years and made it to Frank and Lupe's each time.  During my first visit, someone at a local jewelry store recommended this restaurant to me and decided to give it a go. 

The food was delicious and the service was prompt.  The fajitas were really good and the salsa was addicting.
