Part of the initial thrill was beating the rush. However, the waiter's control and pace of service let us savor the balmy November day, and the Mexican eats, on their fun patio. Salsa is unique and has great kick, served with homemade chips. Flautas and tacos were packed with shredded beef and served with perfect beans. Although customers were pouring in for lunch, the waiter never rushed us. WOW.  

Margarita menu was reasonable and tempting! Next time....soon.
