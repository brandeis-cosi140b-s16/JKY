Stopped at Frank & Lupes 2 weeks ago. Sat outside and they didn't have the musters on which was a bit strange. The margaritas were okay but the beer menu seemed a bit small. Nachos were yummy. But between the 3 orders for dinner, we had issues with all 3. They forgot our order, friend order shredded chicken but they said they didn't have shredded chicken (even though it says it on the menu), and they didn't bring the last persons sopapillas. Definitely would not go back.
