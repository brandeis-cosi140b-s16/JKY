Service was great. The staff is friendly and helpful. The chips and salsa are good. Unfortunately, the food was terrible. The refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland. There was nothing delicious on my plate (which had 3 different items on it). I left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day. I will not be eating there again.
