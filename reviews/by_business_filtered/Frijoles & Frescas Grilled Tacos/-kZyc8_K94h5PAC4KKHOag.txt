Very disappointing, they have all the elements needed for a legit mexican/american restaurant, but their execution was off in a big way. 

Visited Frijoles today with my wife, I ordered 2 chicken tacos with everything but sour cream, chip and guacamole, street corn w/ no mayo, only cheese butter and chilli powder, and an order of rice and beans and a coke. My wife ordered a tostada with no meat, only lettuce, avocado, pico and beans, street corn with only butter and lemon and a sprite. $28.00

We sat down, 10 minutes later they served my tacos, 5 minutes after that we get served our drinks, 5 minutes later we get our chips and guacamole, my wife's tostada and our corn. Then 5 minutes later we realize I never got my rice and beans, so I walked to the counter and reminded them and got that a few minutes afterwards. 

My chicken tacos were very good and very fresh tasting. Both of our corns were flavorless and mine wasn't served with chilli powder. My wife's meatless tostada was served covered in meat and had no pico, she sent it back and got it with no meat, but still no pico. I had to go to the counter again to get a side of pico for her. The tostada was soggy and she barely ate it. The chips and guacamole  were good, my rice and beans were great and my coke was amazing. She liked her sprite, she prefers 7-up.

I would go back, my wife is questionable on going back. I will admit, the staff is nice and pleasant, but are managed very poorly. 

They received a star for serving coke products, so read this as a 1 star review.
