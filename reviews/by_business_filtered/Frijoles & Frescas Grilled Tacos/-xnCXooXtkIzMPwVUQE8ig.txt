I have a mixed review. The food tastes good. The restaurant is clean and cute and the staff our friendly. But if your hungry be prepared to pay up. I ordered two mini tacos and they were $5?!! I'm used to other local Mexican places were I got way more food. That's all..And it takes way longer to get your food, but it's being prepared from scratch- so not so fast.
