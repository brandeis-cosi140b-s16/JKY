This is one of me and my boyfriends favorite places. They have delicious food and although you order at the counter they are kind enough to walk it to your table which I really appreciate! Their quasadillas are so filling and delicious! I always get a chicken quasadillas,  a cucumber water, and a mexican street corn. My boyfriend always gets something with lengua(sp?). Try the shrimp cocktail! It's worth the price it's amazing we always get it on celebration days. Lol.

I really appreciate the staff here. The manager Francisco is amazing. Always so accommodating and if by chance anything is not 100% with our meal he is always happy to help us & fix it! I also love that they is closed on Sundays to take care of their staff. So cool!! Will be back. Duh
