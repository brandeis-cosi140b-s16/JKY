The agua fresca's are to die for!!  Both times I went here I bought the spinach and was not disappointed. Tried a sip of the cactus and strawberry flavors and they are just as awesome.  My friends and I had the chance nay I say the privilege of meeting Greg and I dare say he is the most personable man in Las Vegas.    Needless to say the customer service at Frijoles is wonderful.  
If you are looking for a new Mexican food adventure then you and your friends definitely have to stop by Frijoles.  Whether you just came from going to the temple or playing a round of poker, it's time to make Frijoles Your new place to eat afterwards.
