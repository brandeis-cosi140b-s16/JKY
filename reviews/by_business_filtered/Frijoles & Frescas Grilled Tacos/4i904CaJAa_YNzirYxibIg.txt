Wow! This is our FAVORITE place for great tasting tacos and the most unique, refreshing juice drinks. Francisco and his staff were incredibly friendly. They gave us free samples of nearly 10+ fruit drinks. We loved the Sandia one the best. Go hungry - the food and service is awesome. This place is going to become the BEST place for delicious authentic Mexican food. Can't wait to go back. Yum!
