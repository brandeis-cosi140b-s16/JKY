The whole place is clean and comfortable. 
I like that you can see the food as it's being made. I ordered a carnitas burrito, it's sooo good and a great size. I'll have half now and savor the rest later. I wasn't going to get a drink but while I was waiting for my food, only about 6 minutes, the manager brought me samples of the fresh juices they have to offer. My mind was blown at these unexpected refreshing flavors! Each one is great and they are not too sweet.
