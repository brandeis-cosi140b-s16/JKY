I was VERY disappointed at this place. I was super hungry after a workout and on a low carb meal plan. It was rated at 4.5 stars and had decent reviews on Yelp.

Unfortunately, my experience tonight was disheartening. I ordered a carne asada salad without the beans and rice, requesting additional lettuce as a replacement.

When I got my order, it looked yummy! Then I go straight for the meat and the carne asada was bland, cold, and chewy. I realize that maybe serving the meat cold is a default here. I prefer my meat warm with my salad as I am accustomed to other Mexican places I frequent. I can be confident in saying I had better tasting carne asada around town.

Another point is that there was hardly any cheese at all. Most Mexican restaurants do not hold back on their cheese. I guess on the salad, cheese is used as a small amount of garnish instead of being part of the meal?

Overall, the staff and service were great. The restaurant was nice and clean. There is plenty of seating available when it gets busy. I may come around for a second visit and try their tacos for comparison to other Mexican eateries around town.
