SO GOOODDD... My husband and I have tried the Al Pastor taco, shrimp taco, carne asada burrito,taco,and nachos,  chicken burrito, the corn. .. you can't go wrong with anything here! The tacos are super filling.You can actually taste the smokiness on the meat  from the grill. My favorite was definitely the al pastor. Spicy.. sweet goodness. Everything is made fresh. .The only problem I ran into today was that they gave me the wrong drink and didn't give me my corn. (I had to wait in line, go to the counter and ask). Other than that,  they were great! One things for sure, I will NEVER go back to Robertos for my mexican fast food .
