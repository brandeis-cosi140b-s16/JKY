Almost $4.50 for a taco? No thanks... 

Ill make this quick and dirty. The place is clean but nothing special in terms of service, location and dining room. The food although good, was nothing better than a Los Taco or Tacos El Gordo and with Gordo being $2 this place is really bleh to me at more than double. I had the "street corn" as well and i tasted more the crap thats on the corn than the corn itself. And it was not the crips, fresh tasting corn as if it was recently prepared it was closer to mushy like it been cooked previous and then warmed and served. 

I really just do not see why people are making such a big deal of the place, and  are being real let down by Yelp hype these days. Id say the best thing they have going for them is the Yelp hype and their presentation from the pics since thats what sold me on coming here.
