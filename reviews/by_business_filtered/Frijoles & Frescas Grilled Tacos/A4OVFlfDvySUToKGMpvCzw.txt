I love Mexican food so I had to try this place out. So glad I did! Yummy. I had the chicken taco, it was excellent. Chicken was fresh with a great grill flavor, pico de gallo was awesome and the guacamole was freshly made. So good I wished I had ordered two! My husband had the street corn and said it was phenomenal. The fruit drinks are a refreshing add-on. My daughter loved the watermelon. We'll definitely be back.
