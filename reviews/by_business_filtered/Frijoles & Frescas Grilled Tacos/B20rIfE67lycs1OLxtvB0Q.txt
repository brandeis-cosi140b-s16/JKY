The lengua mini tacos were delicious!  We loved the presentation of the shrimp cocktail.  It comes in a cute little beer mug served with a side of chips and crackers.  Taste wise -it was refreshing and slightly sweet.  The street corn wasn't what I am used to(it was grilled), but it was still good nonetheless.  The carne asada fries were a bit on the soggy side.  The agua frescas were SO GOOD!  My friend chose a watermelon/mango mix and I chose a strawberry/pineapple mix.  Overall experience was good.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  I learned what agua frescas was thanks to the friendly cashier up front :) lol.  The cooks were also very friendly!
