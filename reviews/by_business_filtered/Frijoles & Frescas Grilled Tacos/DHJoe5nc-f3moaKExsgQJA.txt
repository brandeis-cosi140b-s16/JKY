So since there is no 1/2 stars I give this place a 5. Truly no place is 5 stars but this is close. I was In The mood for Mexican and open yelp. Love the reviews and pictures so I took the chance. It's closed on Sunday's but the reason I like. They take care of their employees. I stepped in and the place is immaculate. It's busy lot of people but the place is still clean. I did not wait long for my food and they suggested several items. I ended up getting a fully loaded burrito. I can not describe the way the burrito tasted. Let's just say. This is my new spot.
