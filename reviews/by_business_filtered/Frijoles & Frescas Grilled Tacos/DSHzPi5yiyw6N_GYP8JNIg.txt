This place  is ok.. Only been here a few times.. The chicken burrito tasted  burn.. Tasted mainly the beans.. Always busy.. I guess that's good for the business.. Last time I was here my order took 20 min before  it was delivered  to me.. And there wasn't many people  at that time.. Will see next time if I come back again
