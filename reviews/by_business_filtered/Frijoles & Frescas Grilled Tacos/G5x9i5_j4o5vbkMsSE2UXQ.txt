A much better Los Tacos! I especially loved cabeza taco, street corn, and the chia and watermelon drinks. The place is a fast food restaurant, but the decor is modern/Chipotle-esque and everything is spotless. The owner was a doll and apparently lets his staff keep their tips, unlike at Los Tacos. The only negative is that it is closed on Sundays, but I guess that is just another way they show appreciation to their staff.
