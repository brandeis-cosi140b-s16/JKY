FRIJOLES!! Let me start out by saying the second I took a bite of the food I texted several friends how great it was (with pictures included) 

I had to try three different mini tacos to see which I would like most, Al Pastor, Lengua, and Carnitas, each one was equally delicious. The freshness of the onions, cilantro, and salsa just added to the greatness of each meat. 

As a huge fan of burritos, I got the Carne Asada burrito with avocado, sour cream, pinto beans, pico, and cheese. It was packed with flavor and freshness. All the meat is grilled do don't expect the greasy norm!


The staff was impeccable. The lack of a self serve salsa bar won't stop you from getting what you want from any of helpful crew here.

 I will be back to enjoy more from Frijoles.
