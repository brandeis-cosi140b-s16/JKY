This place is so good! I'm half mexican, but don't enjoy mexican food as much as you would think. This place has made me change my mind. 

The street corn is great! The portion sizes are big and I'm always satisfied when I walk out. My favorite is the shrimp plate with the rice and beans. Their juices are to die for!
