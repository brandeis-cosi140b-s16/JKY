The food here is pretty good. What used to be a Pizza Hut is now a tasty taco joint. I had the cheese quesadilla and it was good. The tortilla had nice flavor. The watermelon drink here is the bomb. I liked the size of the carne asada burrito and the meat had good flavor but the meat was tough at times. The staff were friendly and inside was clean. It took some time to get the food once the order was placed however they are making it fresh so that's cool. you can call your order in for pick up too.
