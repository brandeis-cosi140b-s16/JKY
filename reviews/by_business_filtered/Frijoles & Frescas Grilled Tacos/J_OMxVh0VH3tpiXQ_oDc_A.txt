I think Frijoles is Robertos fancier cousin. I do love Robertos but Frijoles has a wide assortment of fresh juices that you can mix together . I also like the fact that I can enjoy my food in a restaurant instead of sitting in a gas station.

I've come here on two occasions both times I did get the Elote (Mexican corn) . It has mayo, hot spices, crumpled cheese rolled on the outside.  It sounds weird but it is good! It isn't good for you though. I also  had a carne asada quesadilla which is steak meat, Pico De Gallo , cheese , guacamole in a tortilla. It was flavorful! 

I usually only trust Robertos with my carne asada fries but Frijoles does a great job! I was worried at first because they make theirs with thick fries. Since they drain the grease from the fries really well you don't end up with big grease drenched fries. The fries are cooked to a golden brown. Then the fries are topped with meat, cheese , pico de gallo, sour cream and guacamole.  It's a meal within itself! 

If you are craving Frijoles on a Sunday you are out of luck because they are closed. You can savor the taste for Monday.
