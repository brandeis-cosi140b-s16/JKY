I love how fresh the shrimp taste in their shrimp burrito! Most times, I can only eat half of the burrito but if you're hungry, the big serving can definitely satisfy your growling stomach! 

And oh! This is the spot where I fell in love with agua fresca. My favorite is the spinach and pineapple mixed up together...delish!
