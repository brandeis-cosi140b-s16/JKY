My first experience here wasn't that great, the food was ok but my friends and I didn't feel great afterwards. I decided to come back and try it again, because being from San Diego I need my mexican food fix. This time I ordered a burrito and it is just ok once again. There isn't a lot of meat in the burrito and its a little plain. On the plus side both times I've been here the place is very clean and they also bring you the food. All and all its just ok, kind of reminds me of Chipotle.
