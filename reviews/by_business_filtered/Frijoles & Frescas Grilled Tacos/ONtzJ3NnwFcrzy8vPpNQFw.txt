Food is ok. The meat in the tacos (carne asada, pork, and chicken) lack seasoning. They seem cooked and not made fresh to order. The same applies for the tortilla. It's not home made.  The corn  was ok.  Nothing to scream about and say "wow".
I guess if you went to Tacos El Gordo, it's hard to compare it.
