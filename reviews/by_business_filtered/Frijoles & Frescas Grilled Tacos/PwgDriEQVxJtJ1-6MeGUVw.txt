Delicious!!!

Great food. The chicken and carne asada tacos are wonderful. The gooey melted cheese on a warm corn tortilla, with pico de gallo, guacamole, sour cream and beans. It's perfection!

I don't know how they cook their beans but they are AMAZING. Their bean and cheese burrito is the best I've ever had. So much flavor in such a simple burrito. Everything here is GREAT. It all tastes healthy and yummy. One of the best Mexican restaurants in the valley. I hope Frijoles expands and goes national!
