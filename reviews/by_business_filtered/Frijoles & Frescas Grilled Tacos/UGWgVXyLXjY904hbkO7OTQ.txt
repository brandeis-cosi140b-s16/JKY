SUPER pleased with this place. I was with a friend who recommended eating here. From the outside, I would never think to stop in. I'm so glad we did! The quality and freshness was inherently present. I had a carne asada quesadilla. While it lacked a bit in cheese for a quesadilla, it made up with loaded meat and guacamole. So many places charge extra for guac, but not this place! I can't wait to go back and try more menu items!
