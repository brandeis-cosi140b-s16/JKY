Frijoles & Frescas Grilled Tacos is nothing to get excited about. Yes, the beans are pretty good and my family got a kick out the staff's "How you bean?" t-shirts, but I was pretty underwhelmed with what Frijoles and Frescas had to offer.

VEGETARIAN BURRITO ($6.49): When I get a burrito at a legit Mexican joint, I'm expecting a humungous burrito with the tortilla struggling to keep the contents inside. Not so at Frijoles and Frescas. I could have ate two of those suckers. Taste wise, it was a-ok. 3/5

TACO ($4.49): Pretty expensive for one taco. My mom said the taco was good but that it's not worth paying $4 for. 3/5

CHIPS & SALSA ($2.00): Paying for chips and salsa is one of my pet peeves. It should be free, dammit!! My dad said he liked Chevy's chips better and I thought the salsa was unexpectedly sweet. I prefer spicy salsa, personally. 2/5

FRIES ($6.99): My husband really liked his loaded nacho fries! 4/5

HORCHATA ($2.50): With a dead serious face: The absolute WORST horchata I've ever had the displeasure of trying. I took one sip and was disgusted. It tasted like I was drinking sand. I must have gotten the absolute bottom of the barrel or something. They brought another horchata out but I didn't want any part of it. I was kind of irked they didn't apologize or offer to refund me. 1/5

VIBE: I did like the set up of Frijoles and Frescas and the customer service was great (as far as greeting customers and saying goodbye). I'd call it an upscale taco shop. It took about 15 - 20 minutes to get our food, and they brought the chips out after the food, so there was some disorganization. A steady stream of customers kept rolling in through the door.  3/5  

Worth a Return Visit?
At least I got to cross Frijoles and Frescas off my list of bookmarks. I won't be coming back, however. The taqueria down the street from my house is way better!
