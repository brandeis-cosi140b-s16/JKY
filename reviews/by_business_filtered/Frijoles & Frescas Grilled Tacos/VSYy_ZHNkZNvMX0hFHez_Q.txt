Frijoles is much more than beans!  I am always on the hunt for a good taco.  Vegas has 3 or 4 places that I really like, and some of the best mexican food in the US.  When I heard about Frijoles, and that it was near my office, I went to try it out.  

The inside is clean, bright, and fresh with plenty of seating.  The menu is simple, but still has a lot of selection.  I went for the tacos.  They came out fast, and with a smile.  The food was hot and put together the way it should be.  From the first bite, to the last I was impressed. I have been back 3 or 4 times since.  

Frijoles has found a place in my regular rotation.
