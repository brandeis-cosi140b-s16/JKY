So I heard a slight buzz around my friends so I had to try it for myself, me and my girlfriend can on a super empty stomach. We ordered a shrimp quesadilla, a carne asada burrito, 2 carne asada tacos, chicken nachos, a side of rice and beans and finally 2 aguas frescas both watermelon and mango. 

The shrimp quesadilla was amazing, honestly enough for just one, but my gf and I split it, while a tad bit greasy the grilled onions were amazing. The carne asada burrito was also great anddddd comes with guac what more do I need to say? It was good down to the tortilla. The tacos were very authentic in taste and a definite safe bet. Now for the nachos, they were indeed good, however I felt like they could have been better, perhaps the other meat options may have been a better choice, however overall still good. The rice and beans, definitely authentic, they had the home made taste. The aguas frescas were also good, mango was a tad thick almost like the Costco lagers mango, and the watermelon was fantastic, both great :)
