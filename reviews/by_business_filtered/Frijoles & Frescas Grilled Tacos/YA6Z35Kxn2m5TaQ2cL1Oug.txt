Love love love this place!! All the food is wonderful and it's cool how they'll mix agua frescas and horchatas. The staff is great except the one cashier lady is really rude but  I still won't mark anything less than a five star because the food is so good! The manager ( I think) have my sister and I free samples of multiple agua frescas and chicken tacos!
