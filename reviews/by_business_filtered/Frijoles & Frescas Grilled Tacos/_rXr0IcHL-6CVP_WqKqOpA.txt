My second time here, came about nine months ago and the experience was really good, now several months later, It's still pretty good.

Today my husband and I tried a few new things, a salad, a burrito and their version of ceviche. 

Salad was big with rice and beans, plenty of greens and salas, choice of meat, we tried the pork, tender chunks, moist and cripsy at the same time. 

Burrito was carne asada and also had rice and beans, generous portion and flavorable. 

The shrimp ceviche was a tall beer stein full of plenty of shrimp, chunks of guacamole, shreded cilantro all in spicy tomato juice. 

The menu offers many choices, the drinks look refreshing although we did not try some today, they're on the list for next time. The  food is fresh and tasty. Good experince and we'll be back!
