This restaurant is located at an old pizza hut restaurant. They have remodeled it and make it a bit more modern. However, they still left some of the red booths which are not the comfiest things. Either way, I could not stop comparing this place with Cafe Rio. I felt like they were trying to copy some of their dishes. For example the salad was delivered the same way as Cafe Rio. The food was good and perhaps a bit more typical. But I felt like the ingredients were lower in quality. For their "Carne Asada/Steak" they use flank steak which is one of the cheapest options. The dressing was good but you can tell they have watered it down. So for two dollars more you can get a huge salad at their competitors with a much higher quality. Overall, the food was good, and if i'm around I would like to come back and try their el pastor meat.
