Great food, reasonably priced and decent portions. So why only three starts?

Simple. The service is ca-ca. 

Way too slow and you are completely ignored. Slow service doesn't necessarily bother me, but being ignored does. If a customers is going to sit and wait forever (25 minutes for a to go order), you need to address it. Recognize and apologize for the delay. Show a little empathy. Do something. Anything! 

However, the lack of attention and long wait is somewhat offset by the Keystone Cop like performance that the staff puts on. They've got a ton of people behind the counter yelling, grabbing tickets, banging into each other, etc. It's a hoot! The entertainment, though unintentional I'm sure, does help.
