I don't know where to begin. I had the taco salad with fish, delish! My buddies had 2 different burritos on the menu and were both very expressive on how good they were. I can't imagine everything on the menu isn't that good. Pico that comes with the chips, very tasty! Can't forget the on table salsas, both had a little heat but great flavor. With Fresca being in the name you have to try them right ... oh yes! We all shared our 3 different flavors watermelon, strawberry, and pineapple wow, wow, wow. You might as well have just stuck a straw in the fruit and drank away, sooo refreshing! Annnddd, I can't pass up a churro and I hope you don't either, personally the best I've ever had! This was my first visit and I'm already planning my next trip with other friends and family, gotta share this exciting find!
