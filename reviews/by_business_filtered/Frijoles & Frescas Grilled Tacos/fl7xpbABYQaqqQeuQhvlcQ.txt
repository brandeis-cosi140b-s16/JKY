Good if not amazing choice if you're in the area. Used to be a pizza hut and now is a Mex place that keeps it simple with very few selections such as tacos, burritos and tostadas. I've been here twice and I enjoyed it both times although the first time they did get our order wrong and we didn't notice it until we got back home. We called and they were very nice about it and gave us a free meal when we returned. I liked the carne asada and my gf liked the regular taco and also the minis. Good value as far as portion size/price.
