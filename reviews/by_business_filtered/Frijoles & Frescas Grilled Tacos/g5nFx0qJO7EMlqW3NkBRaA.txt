I have great expectations,  but they let me down,  i order the carne asada salad, w beans,  rice, tomatoes letuce and steak, but the dressing is to watery,  too runny, the steak was blend and the rice mushy,  also get the guac and chips, the chips way to salty, and the guac was bland, need a little lime , cilantro onions or seasoning, just taste like a mash avocados, the staff was very friendly,  thats why i give the 5 stars, i hope you fix it all and for my next visit u will get the corn, (they didnt have it this time), good luck ...
