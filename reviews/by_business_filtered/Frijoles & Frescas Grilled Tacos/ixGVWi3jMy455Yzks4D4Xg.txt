Fresh! The menu includes authentic Mexican street food but in a nice restaurant. We tried some tacos and burritos. The al pastor pork was fantastic. I like cilantro and they put cilantro in their burritos. Excellent! You can't go wrong with the agua fresca drinks. Horchata-pineapple and horchata-strawberry were great combinations. The guacamole and chips were good and the guacamole was fresh. The owner was working when we came and the service was great. A very personable and outgoing guy.  Try this place out, there are a lot of choices to keep you coming back.
