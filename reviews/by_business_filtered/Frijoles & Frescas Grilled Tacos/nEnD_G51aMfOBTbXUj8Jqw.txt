I had very high expectations for Frijoles, and I think with a few changes they could turn things around.

The positives first.
Very clean and well decorated
Tacos had a layer of cheese that was a nice idea and tasted delicious
Great Guacamole
Good salsa
For some reason the fountain coke was really good
Very friendly staff

Down sides
Hard to figure out how to order, looks like a Chipolte when you walk in but you order at the opposite side where the register is.
No pictures to see what the food will look like.
Sneeze guard at head level makes it hard to communicate to staff.  (health dept thing not the restaurants' choice I'm sure.)
Very loud in dining room
Chips were passable but way too salty.  Possibly try less salt and a finer grain like popcorn salt since a little goes a long way.
Expensive for the portion size.
Carne tasted washed out like it was sitting in a pan and lost its caramelization.  Maybe I should order fresh off the grill next time?
Over all I have high hopes for Frijoles and think they could do very well with a few changes.  Good luck guys!
