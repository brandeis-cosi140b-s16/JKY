Frijoles is one of my favorite places to eat.  Service is great and friendly, the facility is clean and in order, and the food is MAGNIFICIENT.

We have bee going since they opened and try to go at least once a week.  Love the Carne Asada and the Shrimp Tostada.  The Cactus salad and guacamole are great.  Love Love Love this place.....you won't be sorry.
