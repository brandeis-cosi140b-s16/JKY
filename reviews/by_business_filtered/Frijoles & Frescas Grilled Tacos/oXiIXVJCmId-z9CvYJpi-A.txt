Just ate lunch here today and my husband and I were really blown away! I got a carne Asada taco and a carne Asada mini taco and the husband got two al pastor tacos. Just FYI the "mini tacos" are not mini, they're standard size street tacos and the "tacos" are huge and loaded with all the fixin's; whole seasoned pinto beans, tomatoes, guacamole, sour cream, etc. So good!!! I tried my husbands al pastor meat and it was addictively good! Sweet and rich in flavor. We also ordered aqua frescos (I think that's what they're called, the fruit juice drinks) and I've never had anything more refreshing! The manager Greg let me get two flavors so I had pineapple and mango! Amaaaaaazing!! Everyone was very friendly too. The manager even walked to our table and took the time to talk with us and was so kind and welcoming. Very incredible service, has a very family feel to it. Definitely plan to come back whenever I'm in Vegas and try their nachos, fries and maybe a burrito too and recommend you try this place.
