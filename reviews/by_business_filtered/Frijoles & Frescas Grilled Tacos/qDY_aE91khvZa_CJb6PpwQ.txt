So this place is seriously rad. The chia limeade drink is amazing, that one blew me away. This is the first good Mexican place on the west side.  I keep trying different stuff and so far I love the quesadilla  with Al Pastor meat the most. So I brought the whole family  (6 of us)  and it totally worked. I felt comfortable and got the real deal food.
So I also  tried their Mexican street corn. That stuff was amazing. If you haven't tried it just do it- so good, blow your mind good. You have to try it, now!
