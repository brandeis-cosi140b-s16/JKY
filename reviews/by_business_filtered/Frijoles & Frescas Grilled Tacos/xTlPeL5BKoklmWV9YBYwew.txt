Every time I drove by this restaurant, I'd think to myself....is this for real? It's a Mexican restaurant named Beans, with a kidney bean wearing a sombrero on its sign. I'd scoff at it and keep driving to work.  So when my friends asked if I wanted to try this place for dinner the other night, I was very very skeptical. I mean, in my mind, this had to be the most Americanized Mexican restaurant ever, right? 

WRONG. Frijoles & Frescas is actually really really good. The food itself is freshly made, and while not the best Mexican food in town (I hate to say, I prefer the greasy Roberto's carne asada fries), it's pretty decent. They give a good portion, and the carne asada fries are fried fresh. The carne asada itse;f was a little chewy, but had good flavor overall, and the guacamole was great! 

However, my favorite thing here are the Aguas Frescas. Seriously, they are soooo good! And you can mix the flavors! So far, my favorite is spinach & strawberry & cucumber. I will eventually get myself to order the chia seed flavor too...maybe mixed with mango? 

Tip: Refills of Agua Frescas are only $1 :) Soda refills are free. 

Also, I've heard (and seen) that the corn here is delicious....It was so good, my friends forgot to share with me :P
