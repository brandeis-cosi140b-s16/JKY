Only thing saving this from 1 star is the food actually tastes pretty good...they get that part right.

Have been here 3 or 4 times for the food, but consistently slow service.  There are lots of specials and coupons you can get for here, but lots of made up rules for example: I had like a $5 off coupon.  I ordered my regular priced meal which was $10+ after a drink, my friend ordered her meal off of the happy hour menu. They charged her full price + $3 to add like 2 little strips of chicken to her nachos (which she didn't tell us about until the bill came).

The server refused to split the bill even though my regular priced menu item way more than covered the value of the coupon...just terrible service consistenly.

Pros:
Taste of food

Cons:
Everything else
