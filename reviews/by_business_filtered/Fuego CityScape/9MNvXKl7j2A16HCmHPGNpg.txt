We ate here later on a Saturday night...we had the Jalapeño Margarita which was so unique!  We really liked it and I recommend it if you like jalapeños and want to try a margarita that is not as sweet as some.  We decided to split the Firecracker Shrimp and Green Chile Cornbread and both were excellent appetizers.  The cornbread could easily be a meal in itself it was amazing.  Then we split the Tour de Fuego with the pernil taco, regular empanada and meatloaf slider.  All were tasty although I was most excited about the empanada which wasn't as good as I'd hoped.  Next time I'll try the spicy empanada.  I enjoy the location.  I didn't love the inside, has the feeling of a fast food joint...but we sat on the small patio and really enjoyed the setting.  Plus it makes for great people watching on a Saturday night!
