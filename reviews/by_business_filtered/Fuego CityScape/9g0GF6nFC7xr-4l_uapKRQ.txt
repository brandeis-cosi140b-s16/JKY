Ordered the "tour de fuego" overall it was good. Cubano was "eh" pork taco was delicious and flavorful. Empanada was okay, I liked the spice and texture but it wasn't an overly flavorful and enjoyable experience. 

Rice and beans were cooked to perfection. Just not enough consistently delicious flavor. Friend had a Cubano with sweet potato fries. Said they were amazing.
