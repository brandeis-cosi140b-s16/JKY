If you've been to the Fuego on 7th st don't expect the same atmosphere, food, or service. My friend and I popped in because we were in a hurry before a show at Comerica. The speediness of the food was impressive and I liked our server. The atmosphere is cold and sterile. We were sat in a hallway and it felt suffocating. It was just really awkward. The food was good..I had mahi tacos served w/ Cuban rice and black beans. I would come here just for this rice, no joke it is amazing. Service was decent. It was a decent experience of You're in a slight hurry otherwise I would skip it or come just for the rice.
