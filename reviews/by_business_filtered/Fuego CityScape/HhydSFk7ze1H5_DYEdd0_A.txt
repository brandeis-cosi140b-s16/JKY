I had been wanting to try Fuego the last couple trips to Phoenix and finally made it in for take out and an adult beverage. Totally impressed!!!  The staff was super friendly and inviting. Matt, my super friendly waiter, suggested the red wine sangria, which was delicious!  Wasn't sure if I should try veggie or shrimp tacos and Matt, recommended one of each. They were each so tasty!!  Very flavorful and presented well even as takeout!!!  I also got the Fuego salad which was so filling yet healthy. I'm kind of sad I waited so long to try Fuego:/
