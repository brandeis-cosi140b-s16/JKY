Do not purchase a yelp deal for Fuego. 

I purchased my first one a few weeks back along with a few other coworkers.  Each deal had our name on it. 2 out of 3 of us went to get the orders that were each placed separately. It was a taller gentleman who tried to tell us that he would not accept our deals because not all 3 of us were there.  He ended up taking our deals, but was quite rude about it.  

A coworker and myself both each got another yelp deal today. Another coworker placed an order with no deal.  We get there and the dark haired shorter gentleman was rude off the bat.  He said you can not use a yelp deal on to go orders.  I explained we had not had this issue before.  He refused to accept our deals.  I paid for the non yelp deal order.  No where on the deal does it specify that you have to dine in. 

I could not believe how absolutely rude he was. Beyond rude.
