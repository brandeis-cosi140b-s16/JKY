I have been here twice and have not been disappointed. My first visit, we ordered the cornbread as an appetizer (at the servers suggestion) and it was delicious. My friend and I decided to do small plates off the happy hour menu, the empanadas are a must. On my second visit I decided to order the pernil burrito, the chipotle salsa was a perfect combination with the pernil and sweet cabbage. Now that I work downtown, I will be frequenting Fuego more!
