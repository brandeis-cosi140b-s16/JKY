Really mediocre.

I've been here half a dozen times.  I live downtown, so like to give every restaurant downtown a fair shake.  

They don't ruin anything.  Setting is just okay enough to not be terrible.  Service is poor, but they smile just enough to show that they are somehow trying, if misguided.  Food is just tasty enough that you finish your plate.

Basically, anything with Pernil Asado, their specialty dr. pepper slow stewed beef, is going to be good.

Pretty much everything else sucks.

Their nachos at 11 are small, weirdly not hot, and taste like I ordered them at an airport bar.

Their drinks and beer are okay, just expensive.

Basically, that is the bottom line.  If the food cost $2 bucks less per plate, it would be probably worth it as expectations would be lower.   So... eat here if you are downtown and nothing else seems to be open, but surely don't drive downtown for this place.   Lots of better options in Cityscape and around it.

They do have a pretty happening, cool patio on Friday and Saturday months during the cooler times, like mid Oct.
