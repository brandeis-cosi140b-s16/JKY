After an exciting day of hanging out with the most amazing people during a business conference, our team needed to refuel to keep us going. We were thinking about going somewhere else, but the line was so long that we ended up walking into Fuego, and had a table for our whole team within minutes!

We sat for a few minutes before we got our drink order, but that's only 'cause more people caught on to our genius idea of eating at Fuego and joined the party. 

We had plenty of time to look at the menu to know what we wanted; and once we ordered our food, it was out pretty quick. (I got the nachos with chicken... finger-licking good!) It's kinda neat 'cause you can actually see the kitchen staff preparing your food and it fills the entire restaurant with yummy smells, sure to get your mouth salivating for the amazing food that is going to be placed in front of you. 

I would definitely go here again, although I'd like to sit on the patio -- they offer menu items out there that aren't offered inside.
