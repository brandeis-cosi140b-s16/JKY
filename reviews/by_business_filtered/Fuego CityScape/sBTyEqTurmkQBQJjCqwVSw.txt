After a mini meal at potbelly, my ever so loving hubby ordered me pernil street tacos from fuego because he swears it was amazeballs the two times he had it.  It was in a to go container so I didn't get the initial visual wow factor though from yelp photos they plate very nicely.

The serving of meat was a notable size with cheese, guacamole, rice and beans on the side.

Now I admit the meat was very tasty. In fact,  a little too tasty. I found myself guzzling my potbelly shake to offset some of that saltiness. Even with all the other sides and corn tortilla, it was again, tasty but in a bit oversalted kind of way.

Overall I wouldnt mind this again, maybe just a ton more carbs to accompany it. Or maybe some booze. Yes booze.
