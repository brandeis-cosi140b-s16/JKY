We love Fuego Bistro and loved Fuego Tacos until it closed. Awesome arroz con gandules and Peasant Paella. So when we found ourselves downtown for an event last night, we decided to hoof it over for an 8:00 dinner. 

We spent 10 minutes exploring the menu, discussing what we were going to have and waiting for drinks. I was first to order, and asked for the Peasant Paella. The waiter replied, "We are out of rice". Wait, what? 75% of your menu includes rice or has arroz con gandules as a side. HOW CAN YOU BE OUT OF RICE?! More importantly, HOW CAN YOU NOT HAVE TOLD US THIS THE SECOND WE SAT DOWN AND STARTED TO PLAN OUR ORDERS. 

Very poorly handled, and they were so short-staffed that there was no one to complain to. Food we received was fine, but not at all what we wanted.
