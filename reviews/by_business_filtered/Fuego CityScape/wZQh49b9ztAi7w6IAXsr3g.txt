After a yelp event some fellow yelpers and myself landed at Fuego after receiving no service at all at two of its neighboring establishments.  I'm glad we did.  There was only one server working this particular night and she handled the sudden influx of hungry people with grace!  
I really enjoyed the chicken Fuego tacos and cubano sliders.  My iced tea was good too!  
I will be back.
