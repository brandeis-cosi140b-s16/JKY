Fun little dive of a place. I liked their fried potatoes. The price is reasonable and you get a lot of food but not too much, as is the problem with many Mexican places. The food is not great but not the worse either. More of a beach feel to the whole place. My only complaint, and it is a big one so listen up owners, is that the place was pretty dirty. I once read that you should never eat at a place that has a dirty bathroom. The bathroom was disgusting. Also the counters were very dirty. Even the creamers were left uniced and had stains on them. What's up with that? The restaurant was dead at the time we left so that did not make sense to me.
