Kind of disappointed was expecting something else I guess. the service is great, everyone is friendly.  Now let talk about the food, I ordered the spicy   pork burrito, it may have been alright if would heated everything up. The pork was little dry and cold , I think everything was served right out of the dish without  heating anything up, he'll the cheese was still cold.  My overall experience was okay I'm not sure if I would make the effort to stop and eat here again.
