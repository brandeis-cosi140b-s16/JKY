I was in town for the afternoon and was looking for some tacos.  And I ended up here.

I was greeted by Lily who was very kind and patient in explaining the menu to me.  I decided to go with a platter consisting of two chicken tacos, with the cilantro lime rice and the fried potatoes.  And I got the large souvenir cup (good for dollar refills on return visits).

The good:  The rice was fantastic and the potatoes were pretty good as well.
The bad: The tacos were mediocre.  I liked the garlic sauce, but could have done without everything else (for the record, I'm a corn tortilla, onions and cilantro taco guy).

I would consider stopping back the next time I'm town so that I can get some more of that rice.
