So this was my first lunch outing at my new job and this place was selected since it is the boss' favorite. I got the shredded beef tacos and they were pretty good. The beans and rice were just ok, though. Next time I'll order ala carte instead of getting the plate meal. Even with all that food it was pretty cheap, so that's a plus.
