Decided on a few tacos after having a few beers for Sunday afternoon football. This place had great reviews on Yelp, but turned out to be normal taco shop with nothing that stood out, except for the Borracho Beans, which were hearty and bold and tasted great. My other side dish was Fried Rice, which was simply Yellow rice with a few veggies tossed in. Moving on, the best taco of the two was the Tempura shrimp variety, but since every taco gets dressed with the same ingredients, all the tacos will eventually taste the same no matter what meat you choose. These are not gourmet tacos by any means and the shredded beef taco had a nice chunk of fatty meat inside causing some issues. Flour tortillas are the way to go here as the hard shell style is not the really crunchy Mexican shell, but the kind out of the grocery store box. Ordered salsa on the side, which was warm and costs $1.29, but you really don't need the salsa for the tacos and no chips are included, so the salsa will end up in your fridge for future use. It was about $7 for a combo, which seems normal, but hopefully they have $1 taco night because that is when I would return in the future.
