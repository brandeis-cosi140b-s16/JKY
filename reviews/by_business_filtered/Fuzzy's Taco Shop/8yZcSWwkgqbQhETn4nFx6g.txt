I don't understand the hype about this place.  I had their "jumbo" burrito but it was a regular sized burrito. I could get a better burrito at Chipotle or Taco Bell. If anyone really thinks this is authentic is very delusional and/or hasn't eaten good Mexican food. I've had their burritos a few times and the overall flavor is lacking.

The redeeming part about this place is their happy hour drinks. They serve huge margaritas for a good price and a good place to start off your buzz. I would come here for the drinks & chips, but prolly would pass on their food.
