Good stuff here! Cheap, good food, and always busy.  You know it must be good when every time you pass it, it's packed.  I think it's a nice change of pace from some of the other great places on Mill.  Also cool that you can order delivery of their food from a local delivery company. Overall, nice stuff. Only downside is getting through traffic to get there on busy nights.
