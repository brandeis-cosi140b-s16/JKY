I think this place is pretty good, compared to other 'fast' mill ave eateries. 
I like the flavor of the tacos, with the feta and garlic sauce stuff. It gives it an almost Greek taste, which I like. 

Also, the tacos are super cheap and pretty big. 

I can't really compare them to other Mexican food places, because I don't think they're typical 'Mexican', considering I'm an Az native...

All in all, I like them. I think they're unique!
