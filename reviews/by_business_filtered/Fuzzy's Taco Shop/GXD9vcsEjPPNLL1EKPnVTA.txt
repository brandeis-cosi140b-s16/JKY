I was showing my mom and dad around mill while they were here visiting, and after awhile we were hungry, and needed a break and a drink. ( hey it's hard work going In and out of all those stores!) So we were walking by, and decided to check it out. First of all, the beer served In the huge margarita glasses is an awesome Idea, even though I couldn't finish it. I got the soft chicken tacos, and my parents both got the shredded beef.  They both really liked theirs, and mine were great as well. Loved the cilantro and feta! Bartender was funny and we all really liked this place! I'll be back with friends after hittin up Urban Outfitters!
