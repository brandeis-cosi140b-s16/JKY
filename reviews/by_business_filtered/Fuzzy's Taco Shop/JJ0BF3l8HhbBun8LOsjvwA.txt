One of my roommates used to work here, and I had been told the food is above average and better than what you pay for. I'm here to call bulls***. I ordered the combo with shrimp enchiladas and need taco with sides of fried potatoes and borracho beans. The sauce was the enchilada was covered in was decent, but the filling was poor, particularly the shrimp. I understand you get what you pay for, but this shrimp had no flavor and a slimy texture and not even a slight outer crunch. Gross. Potatoes had good spices, but were lukewarm and not crispy. The beans tasted like beer, nothing else. Also, they were out silverware. Are you kidding me? How does a restaurant run out of silverware. The taco meat was decent, and the lettuce and tomatoes were fresh, but the shell was stale. The only good thing I can say is most people were drinking margaritas, and they looked damn good. I don't recommend this place unless you're looking to get drunk or already are drunk
