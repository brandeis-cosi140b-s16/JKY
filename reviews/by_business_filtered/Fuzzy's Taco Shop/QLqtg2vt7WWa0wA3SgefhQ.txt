Back for a few more tacos. The fajita chicken and the tempura shrimp are the real highlites. The Beans were still good, but were not placed in a separate container. The other side dish was the latin fried potatoes, which were well seasoned and full of flavor. Might be shrimp upcharge because it cost $1 more than the menu said.
