I think this place has the best tacos on the planet... If your drunk! Sober the taco's (tempura & grilled) are pretty good but not memorable! To be honest I've had better at Taco Bell! But I don't say this as a put down this is a good college town spot! Nothing more! They seem to have fantastic drink specials so that will keep people coming and the more of those specials you consume the better the food will get!
