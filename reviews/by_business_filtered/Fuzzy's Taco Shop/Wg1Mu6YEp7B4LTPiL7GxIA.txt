These are among some of the best tacos I've had in a while.  I ordered the grilled fish tacos, and I found them very delicious.   I went at 3 pm on a Tuesday, and I've only gone once, so I'm not sure if the food quality is different at different times.  I'll have to go again and find out.

Atmosphere was very College-esque, brightly colored and surprisingly quiet.  My food was ready moderately fast and of course the prices were excellent.  

My one qualm, however, would have to be the hard seating.  It wasn't comfortable sitting for more than 10 minutes in that booth, and I constantly had to move around to keep my butt from complaining.

Overall: good..inexpensive food, decent atmosphere...needs better seating.  I would go here again.
