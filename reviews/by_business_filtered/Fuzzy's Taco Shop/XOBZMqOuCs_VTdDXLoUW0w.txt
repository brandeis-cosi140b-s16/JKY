Fuzzy's just rocks. After the one in my local Albuquerque closed, we needed our fix on a recent road trip and stopped at the one in Tempe. Nom nom nom!

We went with the usual chicken tacos and the cashier recommended their special beef taco which was a good recommendation. Their chips and queso can't be beat. It's not spicy like I like it but it's full of flavor and the chips come with yummy Fuzzy's dust. 

Although putting feta on tacos sounds totally weird to some people, after Fuzzy's I practically can't imagine it without. We didn't have the cashier's specialty frozen margarita which looked amazing but it was cheap and people were ordering them like crazy. 

For cheap eats, good tacos and a super fun, casual atmosphere you can't beat Fuzzy's. I hope that they come back to Abq.

My faves on the menu- chicken soft tacos, chips & queso, and their fajita chicken salad. With any of those, you just can't go wrong.
