for the money, you can't get much cheaper! the drinks alone are worth this college style eating and drinking spot. 

i'm late for the train on the beer-rita thing, but i had a champagne-rita, and for 8 bucks, i got this enormous mug of delicious alcohol goodness, with a small champagne bottle stuck right in there!

i had the grilled veggie burrito and it was ok. wrapped in a flour tortilla, it was like something i make at home about once a week. my wife had a grilled fish and a grilled veggie taco. the grilled fish was actually minced and not very flavorful. 

they have some very decent happy hour specials, every day. today, our stop suited us for some drinks and cheap food but i wouldn't make it a "go-to" spot.
