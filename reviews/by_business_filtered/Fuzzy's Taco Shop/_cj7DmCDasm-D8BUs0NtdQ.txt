When this place first opened up it was ok. Today it's crap food. This place used to give you a descent taco but now they are straight shady. My shrimp tacos were not fully cooked, still raw. Not cool. They were two of the smallest shrimp the eye can see. What a ripoff. The salsa was cold, not hot. No thanks.
