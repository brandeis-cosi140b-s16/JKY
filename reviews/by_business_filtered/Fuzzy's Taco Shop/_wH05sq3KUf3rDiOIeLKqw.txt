This place has been a staple for my girlfriend and I since we moved here a little more than a year ago.

We admittedly only come on Taco Tuesday's but whatever.

$2 Large Goblets of PBR all day, everyday and $1.50 tacos, they are worth every penny even at  full price of $2.49. 

Nice atmosphere and everyone working is usually pretty friendly. The only compliant I would have is that the front counter girls are a bit too nice. There is no reason for the entire line to be held up so someone can call their friend (via cellphone) from the patio to bring her ID up so the other on can buy more than one beer. Send that mess to to back of the line, really.

As for the tacos:
Steak, YES
Fish, YES
Shrimp, YES
Pork, YES

That's all you need to know.
