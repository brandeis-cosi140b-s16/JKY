I haven't had a shrimp enchilada like this in 15 years.  So heavenly, mouth-watering, and touch me in all the right spots.  I felt like I was on cloud nine.  The shrimp taco was fun to eat.  The black bean soup was not really a soup but a lot of black beans in a rich tasty sauce.  It was so much to eat.  I had expected more liquids and sipping on the broth but nope, not here.  There is no broth to be sipping on.  Seems to be a predominant college crowd here.

I've been here a few times.  Was unimpressed with the fish burritos the first couple of times I came.
