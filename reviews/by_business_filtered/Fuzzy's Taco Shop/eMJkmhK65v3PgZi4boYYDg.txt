If you've read my previous review, I have a friend that lives out of town that visits.  I have been trying to find the best mexican for him to eat.  This last visit, we decided on Fuzzy's, honestly because the name is so hilarious.  They were advertising a new queso jalapeno cheese covered burrito.

Best big ass chicken burrito I've ever had!  I am one that can't handle much spice, but this was perfect.  Just a tiny bit of heat from the cheese, the burrito actually had taste and was thick.  I felt I didn't have enough guacamole after I had already paid and sat down to eat.  I went to the front to pay for extra guacamole (only $1.25 compared to Amados nasty crap for over $2), but only had my debit card.  The girl that helped me said not to worry about it and used her OWN tip money to pay for it!!!  I was willing to order more sour cream or something, but she said it wasn't a problem.  I was so impressed!  

Now because this is only the 2nd authentic burrito I've had since living in Phoenix, Fuzzy's is getting 5 stars.  Half way through my burrito I was full, but it tasted sooooo good, I ate the whole thing.  I felt like I needed to be rolled out of there.

There are Fuzzy's in the St. Louis area (to my St. Louis friends) so I recommend you visit, and try to tell me I'm wrong about the food!
