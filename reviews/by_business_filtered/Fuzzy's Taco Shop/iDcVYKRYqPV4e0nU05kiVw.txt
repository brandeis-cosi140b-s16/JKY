Im a fan.

My friend and I met for lunch here last week. The service was great and our food came out relatively quickly.

I had a chicken and a steak fajita taco. Delicious. I loved the use of feta (which Im not a fan of on its own) instead of shredded cheddar. It was much more melty. I wasnt so much a fan of their salsa, but then again I like Pace (gimme a break, Im not from here! ;) ).

An all around good experience. Ill definitely go back.
