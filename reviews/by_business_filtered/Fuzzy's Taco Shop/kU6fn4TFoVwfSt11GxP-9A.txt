Styled like Dos Gringos with bright colors and the whole random stuff stuck to different surfaces - you walk in and get in the cattle drive line with a perfect view of the menu plastered to the wall. Great, easy enough. Their menu has all the basics, and the main reason to visit, SUPER CHEAP BEER!!!! 

Our visit we had to wait 15 long minutes because the girl taking orders and pouring beer broke a glass into the rest of the glasses, having to cease all beer orders for what felt like forever.  I get it, shit happens, you drop stuff, but hello attitude. I even gave her a tip because I felt bad and tried to laugh it off with her, but to no avail. They never brought the beer over once it was all situated and had to hunt down someone to give us our much needed Friday fix. The food was "eh" - not a fan of the sauce on the shrimp tacos. Overall, I would go just to drink cheap beer - just don't make the girl behind the counter angry - then you'll never see your beer.

***NOTE, the gal working behind the counter sent me an apology and what can I say, other than she is pretty awesome for doing that, I will come back to drown my sorrows in that pimp glass anyday!****
