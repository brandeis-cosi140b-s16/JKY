This place is very near my work, and I enjoy their food. 

However, the service is another story. While their food consistency remain high. The service consistency is a crap shoot at best. I don't eat feta. It comes on all of their tacos and salads, so I always ask for "no feta". They get this simple request right about 60% of the time. Even though the order receipt clearly shows what I asked for. Kitchen staff clearly do not read each order as it comes through the system, instead focusing on the big picture, and missing the little details, like "NO EFFING FETA".

The other problem I frequently run into is the single cashier, which causes long lines. As long as things are moving forward, I'm fine with waiting a little longer. However, their demeanor is sometimes a little too friendly, encouraging conversations that slow the entire process down by 2-3 times. They have 2 registers at the front. I've seen them both used maybe once in my 12 or so visits. 

If they could improve order accuracy, and speed at the register, I'd gladly  go 4 or 5 stars on this place. Yes, the tacos are that good (sans feta).
