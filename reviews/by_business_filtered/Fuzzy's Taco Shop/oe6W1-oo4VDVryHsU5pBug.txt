If you're coming here for anything other than tacos or queso and chips you're doing it wrong. I've tried the shredded pork burrito and shredded beef salad and been disappointed both times. 

On taco tuesdays though, Fuzzys is a great deal with $1.50 tacos and $7 beer-ritas. The tacos are pretty good but they do come with a garlic sauce that usually ask them to hold. As for the beer-ritas the ironman is my favorite, try it if you like your drinks a bit sweeter. 

Tip: Don't come here too hungry because you're almost always going to have a long wait. If you're waiting in line though you can download the Fuzzy's app which gets you a free drink when you download it.
