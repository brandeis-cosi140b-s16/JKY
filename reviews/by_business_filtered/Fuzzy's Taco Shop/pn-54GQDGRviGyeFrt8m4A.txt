This place has a laid back college vibe which might appeal to some. I ordered the chicken taco plate with black beans and the fried rice. Unfortunately I did not care much for the meal. The black beans were alright, the rice a little less than that, and the chicken tacos were super dry. The hot sauce was too heavy on the vinegar to lessen the dryness without offense either. 

If you're into cheap college food with space to sit around, then you may dig this place, but I thought it was pretty bad. I did give it a chance though, despite the bad reviews.
