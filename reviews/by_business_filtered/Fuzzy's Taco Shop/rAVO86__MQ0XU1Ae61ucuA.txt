you ever had your taste buds slap you in the face and ask you. "I am not sure what you are feeding me? but don't you stop!"

Fuzzy's is my all time favorite taco joint, everything from the margaritas to the SOFT SHELL tacos!, don't do the hard shells. the taco sauce is so good, you could drink it. 

If i could eat here every day i absolutely would, worth it! eat here!
