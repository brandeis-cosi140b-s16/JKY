Easily one of my favorite places to eat in the Tempe area. The staff are awesome, the tacos are amazing (I always get the grilled shrimp soft tacos, the sauce is absolutely tdelicious and they have some of the best shrimp tacos I have ever had), and they have an impressive selection of drinks to choose from. By far the most appealing aspect for me are the beeritas, which are basically blended margaritas with a bottle of beer mixed in for added flavor and kick. If you are looking for a new taco shop to check out, or a more laid back place to have a few drinks on Mill Ave, then this place is definitely worth checking out.
