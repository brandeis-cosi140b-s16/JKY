I'm a very picky person when it comes to fish tacos, so I'm going to try and review this place as fairly as possible.

PROS:
-I went here for Taco Tuesday--which has deals that are difficult to beat.
-The staff were very friendly and efficient.
-You have an option to get these tacos "crispy" or soft.

CONS:
-The fish tacos were very good.  I can't say much about the chicken taco I had.
-Crispy isn't what I thought it was--instead it's just a hard shell, and I'm not a fan of that.
-The hot sauce is not hot enough.

FOUR STAR!!!
