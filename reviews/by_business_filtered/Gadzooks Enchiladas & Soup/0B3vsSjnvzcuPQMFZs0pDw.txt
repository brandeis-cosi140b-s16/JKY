This is now going to be one of my favorite places to go for lunch or dinner. Unique enchiladas for sure! They are in a perfect spot on 7th Street facing Starbucks! The place is very easy to spot , and there are plenty of space for parking. I had the Spicy cornbread enchilada with different sauces and avocado. It was tasty, filling and delicious! Next time, I'm going to try it with an egg. I'm so glad they opened it in this location since I'm in this neighborhood all the time.
