Love this place! The staff is really friendly and there are vegan/raw options. I ordered the spinach and mushroom enchiladas (no cheese) and I was impressed!  It's hard to make enchiladas taste good without cheese, but the house-made salsas and guacamole did the trick.  I'm glad to find another cool local restaurant, I will totally come back.
