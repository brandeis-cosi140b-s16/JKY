Been wanting to try this place for awhile and finally got here for a 2pm lunch last week. This is usually the time staff is eating, etc and it was just the case on this day as well. The food is well priced and served up in big portions. The short rib was extra cooked from probably sitting in the bin for awhile, but luckily I enjoy extra cooked and slightly dry beef so it worked out well for me. The chicken was a runner-up to the beef, but I should have tried the cornbread. If you go crazy with toppings and sauces (which you will on your first visit like I did) then everything gets lost under all the different flavors. I would skip the half flour and half corn and go for the corn tortilla and be gentle on the sauces, but this is a place I will return too at some point if I"m in the area.
