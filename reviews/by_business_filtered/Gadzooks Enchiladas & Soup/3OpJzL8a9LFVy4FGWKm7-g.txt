Oh my DELICIOUS!....Last night my son and I went there for dinner. I had the tortilla soup....it was so delicious that I bought 2 to take home for my daughter and her boyfriend.....so yummy.  My son had a burrito and loved that you could pick what meat and HEAT for the sauce....he loves HOT! I know I will be stopping there EVERYTIME I pass by....yum!
