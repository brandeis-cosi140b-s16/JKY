Gadzooks, for me, was somewhat boring. 

I was taken to Gadzooks for lunch, with a couple of friends. We had heard that the food was great, so we decided to test it out.

The menu was/is confusing, too many sauces. Choosing the right combo seemed just like an unlikely happening..

Overall my food was bland and unimpressive. We all almost left half of our food on our plates.

Staff was great, friendly. Helpful and knowledgeable. 

3 stars just for the fact that the staff was pretty much the highlight. I probably won't return. I just really wanted to like this place.
