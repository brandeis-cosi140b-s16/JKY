The service was astoundingly friendly and upbeat, but my food was too greasy...just wasn't fresh or healthy-minded enough for me (and I ordered a salad, too). I suppose this is an okay place if you're into border-line Mexican fast food. 

I've only been here once, but unfortunately for Gadzook's (and fortunately for the well-being of my stomach) I don't anticipate ever coming back.
