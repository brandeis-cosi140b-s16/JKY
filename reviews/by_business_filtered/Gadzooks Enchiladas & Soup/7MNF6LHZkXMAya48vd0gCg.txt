Best place for me right now.  I'm exhausted,  little sleep,  but knew I needed to eat before heading to an AirBnB after a shitty hotel. So that's my mood and I came here,  overwhelmed by choices.  They were so friendly and walked me through the process to order two enchiladas.  I ended up with the flour mixture tortilla,  with cornbread and chicken in one,  and short ribs and something else yummy in the other.  A side of the slaw set it off perfectly with a bit of sour crunch.  What could make this any better?  White sangria. They let you sample the food,  the sangria and margaritas.  Owned by a young guy in his 20s. His mom fresh bakes the cookies everyday.  Mmmmmm.  Pumpkin.  I can't believe I almost got a sandwich from Walgreens.  Glad I work in the area,  I'll be back.
