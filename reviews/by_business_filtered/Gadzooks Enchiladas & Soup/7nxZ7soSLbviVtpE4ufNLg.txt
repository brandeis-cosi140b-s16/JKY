I was just driving around looking for somewhere to eat and saw gadzooks. I remembered saving it to my bookmarks of places to try. Realistically I rarely ever get around to this list, so I had to take this opportunity to try it. First impressions upon walking in, it was loud (lots of people there) and I just assumed it was a cafeteria type line. I was right! Thankfully I was right. The menu is written up high. Take your time to go over it cause there are lots of choices. 

The first guy was nice and could tell I was new to the establishment. He directed me on the process and what you can do for the enchiladas. 

I love the 50/50 tortillas. They are a little thicker and are in between a tortilla and pita in density. I thought it was perfect. I heard you could mix the fillings too but I just stayed pretty standard. I got the braised short rib and green chili pork. The pork was moist and tender. Short rib was tender but a little dry. Their guacamole is okay, habanero salsa is good, the heat doesn't kick you right away. Wouldn't say it is unbearable either (especially for being habanero). 

All in all go down the line and get what you think sounds and looks good. I wish I had a chance to try everything. Next time I plan on getting the works done to my enchiladas and a necessary fried egg ontop. I'm sad I didn't get one this time. Pretty sure I will be here later this week.
