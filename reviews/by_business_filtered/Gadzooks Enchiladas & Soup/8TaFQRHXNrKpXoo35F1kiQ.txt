I certainty like the concept, Modern, logical, centralized!  But it comes down to what us Latinos and Mexicans call "Sazon"!  Flavor, and the flavor of the sauces is just not there, at least not yet.  I tried the red and the green sauces and to me that  I been eating awesome enchiladas all my life, they taste is just to bland, not balanced, you get notes of spices but not put together in the right syntax! They should get a legitimate south Mexican Mom of Grandma to prepare them a couple of killer sauces and duplicate them.  Also the place could use some art pieces inside to make the decor intimate and it would draw even more people and it will duplicate the richness of the Mexican Culture, which they are trying to highlight through their food!  I like the entrepreneurial spirit of the owner that's responsible for the place!
