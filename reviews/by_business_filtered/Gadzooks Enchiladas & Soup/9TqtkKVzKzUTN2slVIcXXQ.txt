This is the second time I've visited. The first time was lunch during the week and the line was out the door. After waiting for a while with three tired kids we decided to try it again some other time. I'm so glad we came back. The food is great. I tried the enchiladas- you pick your meat and they have several veggie options. I picked the short rib for one and spinach and mushroom for the other. I picked the green sauce and the salsa verde to top it off.  I don't get the fried egg, but the option intrigues me. It was love at first bite- so much flavor. I can't wait to try more combinations. The only downside for me was that the kids quesadilla was served in a really hot dish (not great for little fingers) and the guacamole served with the chips and guac is very small
