Decided to stop here after being severely disappointed by Americas taco shop down the street .. Let me just say this place took the cake simply amazing to say the least. Everything tasted fresh and was bursting with flavor yet they has the speed of a chipotle .. We have been left in utter disbelief this is our new goto enchilada joint .. Step aside nana you have competition...
