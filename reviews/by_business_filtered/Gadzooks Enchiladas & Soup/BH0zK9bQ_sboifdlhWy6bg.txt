My classmate and I decided to come here, just to try.. So we walked in, ordered the chicken and short rib enchilada with Christmas sauce (red & green). I also ordered sweet & spicy corn on the side because it looked good. The people behind the counter were nice. It was like a chipotle style, you pick what you want on your enchilada. So I picked the home made sour cream, pico de gallo and cotija cheese and then they put it inside the brick oven. The enchiladas were okay, I expected a wet juicy enchiladas.. But it was dry. The meat also needs flavoring and it was also dry. Oh and the sweet & spicy corn was really spicy.
