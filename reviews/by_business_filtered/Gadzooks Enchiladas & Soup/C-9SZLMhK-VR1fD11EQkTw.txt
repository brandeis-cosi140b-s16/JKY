I finally took my first trip to Gadzooks and I will be back for sure! My sister recommended going early to avoid crowds, but I thought she was nuts because when we got there it was empty. By the time we left, the line was out the door! This place gets busy and the friendly, efficient staff is more than prepared to handle it. 

We were greeted and the girl behind the counter explained the process to us - yes, just like Chipotle. Our pause was more just because there are so many choices! I went with 50/50 tortillas for my pork tacos, a little pico and sour cream and it was delicious. I wasn't hungry for a good 9 hours after that! Can't wait to try other varieties and of course, the enchiladas.
