In a nutshell, Gadzooks is to Enchiladas, what Chipotle is to Burritos... except the food at Gadzooks is better. 

The first time I came here it was a -- let's test out how stressed Jon can get before passing out event. It was super loud, lots of people and I've never been a fan of the whole cafeteria line, create your own type of ordering systems... so there was that. 

Confused and anxiety ridden, we shouted our order at the mostly friendly folks on the other side of the sneeze guard. They could surely tell we were newbs and taking into account how busy it was, they handled it nicely. 

Frustrated, we made it down to the check out spot where the magic happened. They have the Coolest twine tying thingy (I'm pretty sure that's the manufacture name) that ties up your to-go order. It's so bad ass. That put a smile on my face after, to this point, an overwhelming experience. 

We left thinking we may not go back again because the stress just wasn't worth it. Then we got home with our bounty and pretty much after the first bite knew that was a premature ruling. The place does good enchilada. 

I'm no expert, in fact, I never ate much Mexican style food until moving to Phoenix a year ago, but these were top 10 in my world. Especially taking into account that it's fast-casual. Not too fancy, just good food. 

We've been back a couple of times since our first visit and the ordering process gets easier as you get use to it. The food has been great each time, and the twine tying thingy never ceases to delight.
