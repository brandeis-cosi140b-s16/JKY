First time ever going to Gadzooks and it was awesome. The people were cool and friendly. Ambience cool. Loved the whole set-up. Sunshine wonderful. Patio great. Oh, and that sangria is most definitely on point; so delicious. I loved the enchiladas and the tortilla soup! I have not one bad thing to say. Will so be going back. 

Also, I am a Gluten Free Chic ( mandatory, not by choice) and I had not one problem with the food. So two jigs on that one : ) 

If you have not been here @ least try it once. The food is very flavorful.
