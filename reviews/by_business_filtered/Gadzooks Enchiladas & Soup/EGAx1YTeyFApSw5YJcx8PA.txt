Service is rough. Went there today around 1pm with a coworker and there were only 3 people in line but we were in there 30 min (and our order was to go!). I didn't get anything because they were out if chicken, from what I overheard they run out certain food items often. Anyways, no one greeted us. We stood in front of two people making tortillas for 5 min and they didn't even acknowledge us. I understand if this is your role but one could at least smile and greet us. 

When my coworker was trying to pay, a staff member opened the cash register to exchange their tip money and made us wait while they counted their tips before cashing us out.  Afterwards the cashier wrapped up my coworker's  food that had just been sitting there for a few min, meanwhile other staff continued to stand around and act like they hated their lives. They also kept asking my coworker "is this your food?" When you basically only serve enchiladas its hard to tell the plates apart, you think they would pay attention to whose food is whose.
