I'd really like to give 2 stars but I'm hoping someone reads the reviews and fixes some of the problems.  So we have been waiting patiently for this place to open...very excited to finally try it.  We get to the counter and it's very confusing and no one offers any help...except another CUSTOMER.  The employees behind the counter acted like they really didn't want to be there and how on earth could we NOT know the order process.  Felt a little irritated by that.  

Anyway, the food was actually really good.  I had two enchiladas, one potato and the other spinach.  The man had a rib taco and green chile enchilada.  I tried all the sauces.  I liked my choices but I loooooved the man's even better.  Next time I go I am definitely carnivoring it up.  They were out of bison which I really wanted to try.  So next time I will know HOW to order, WHAT to order and hopefully have a more pleasant experience.
