So good! 
I resisted going here for a long time (I don't like enchiladas or soup) but finally was convinced my husband to try it---it was great!
It's kind of like chipotle but so much better, and it's not just enchiladas and soup. I love their chopped salad with short rib. My husband tried enchiladas and loved them as well.
Service is fast & friendly, so much so that we stopped here (second visit) for a turbo lunch on my way to catch a flight for which I was already cutting in close.
They sell beer even during lunch. 
Convenient location.
Will go back
