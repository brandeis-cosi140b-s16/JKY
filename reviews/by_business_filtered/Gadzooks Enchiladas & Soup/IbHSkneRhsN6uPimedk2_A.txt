Went for lunch and had one cheese and one chicken enchilada with red sauce.  When I got into them, I found the center of each to be luke warm and the chicken dry.  Sat outside because it was very noisy plus weather was great. For $7.95 it was a little better than big chain fast food, but I don't think I'll be returning.
