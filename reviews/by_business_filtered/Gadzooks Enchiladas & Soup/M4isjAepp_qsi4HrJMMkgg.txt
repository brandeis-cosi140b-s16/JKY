Though I am neither a vegetarian nor gluten-intolerant, I do have family and friends that are. While neither of those specific family or friends were with me on this particular evening, the person in line infornt of me was gluten-intolerant and the person in line behind me was a vegetarian.
I was very impressed how when they each explained their dietary restrictions to the person helping them that each staff member knew exactly what that customer could and could not have and explained their menu items and what was in each, down to which items were made with chicken stock (which I've noticed some people don't seem to realize that just because there are no chunks of meat in something, that if made with an animal stock is NOT vegetarian).
It's nice to see a business properly and thoroughly train their employees about their food beyond the information needed to be provided the majority of its customer base. Gadzooks realizes that the majority is not the entire customer base and has accomodated those with other dietary needs with a place to go and eat at with the assurance that they are infact able to enjoy their food without fear that the person helping them gave them false information.
