Decided to check this place out because of how cool the actual building looks when you pass by... lol. I went with two friends for a girls luncheon and enjoyed the food! As most of the reviews state, the staff was less than pleasant. It was as if we annoyed them by being there. It took an act of Congress to get her to smile or even look like she enjoyed her job. Coming up to the counter was all business so know your order. The short rib choice was SUPER oily... one of my friends was sick for the rest of the day. But the Chicken and spicy cornbread mix was AWESOME! 

I would recommend trying it because the food is good but if you are looking for great attitudes from the staff... skip it.
