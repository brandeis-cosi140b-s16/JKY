Now that enchiladas have become my preferred regional dish, when I read about this place I knew I had to try it ASAP. Gadzooks has a very lively vibe about it, from the cool layout of the building to the enthusiasm of the staff. I tried two of their enchiladas: guajillo braised short ribs and sauteed spinach mushroom, with "Christmas" style sauces (red and green sauces), topped with asadero and chihuahua cheeses and a side of pico salsa. Both enchiladas were excellent, especially the short ribs one - so good I wish I got an extra one. And I could have (you could "add a lada" for 2 bucks more), but it turns out it's a good thing I didn't because I also ordered Linda's homemade tortilla soup - it was really tasty, and I had it topped with potatoes and crema. The soup was so hearty that it could be a light meal by itself; no wonder it was listed as a main dish and not a side. I would suggest to them, though, that they serve the soup in a bowl rather than in the tall cup that they use. I wish the folks here well and hope for their success. This is a very welcome addition to the central corridor of the city.
