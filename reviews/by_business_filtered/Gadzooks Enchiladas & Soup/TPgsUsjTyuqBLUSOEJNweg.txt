This place is delicious. Lots of variety and sitting. I ordered 2 Enchiladas 1green chili pork and 1 potato. They covered it with Jack cheese and then placed it in a pizza oven so it would get hot and bubbly. Then I dressed it with lettuce, pico, sour cream, and guac. Got a side of chips too. The chips are like the good ones you would get freshly made from a Mexican supermarket almost. Everything was yummy. Well priced around $8-$10 a person. Only down fall was the line out the door.
