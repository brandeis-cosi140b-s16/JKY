Gadzooks is definitely an interesting concept ... like Chipotle, except with enchiladas! We read some reviews and decided to check them out for dinner. They seemed to be having a little bit of an off night as they were out of the containers that they heat up the enchiladas in. I'm not sure if it was a result of that or not but the staff was not friendly & seemed really frazzled. We said it was okay if they made our food in to-go containers after they had told us it would take just a little bit longer. They weren't much help when I asked for recommendations so I suggest coming prepared by asking someone who's been here before, reading reviews, etc.

As far as the food goes - it was good. I got the two enchiladas combo with roasted tomatillo chicken, green sauce, cheese, salsa verde, crema, and slaw. After only the first bite, I wished I hadn't gotten the green sauce on top because everything else was so flavorful it really wasn't necessary. The green sauce just made everything spicy which is unfortunate because I'm not a huge fan of a lot of spice. I'd definitely get it without next time. My date got the spinach & mushroom filling one with the potatoes and it was delicious! We both thought the salsas were good and the crema seem to bring everything together. Definitely get that on top!

Like I said, I think they were having an off night with service, but I think we'd come back to give them another chance since the food was good.
