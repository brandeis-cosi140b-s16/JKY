This place is my JAM!!  

This is place is so different from anything else.  Sure, they make enchiladas and tacos but it's a whole different style than anything else I've ever had.  I like the salad or enchiladas.  I personally prefer short rib with cornbread filling because it gives it a tamale taste.  I know that sounds weird to get cornbread in a salad or enchilada but trust me, I'd eat my weight in that stuff.  It's super moist and extra spicy.  

Everything is very fresh (including the handmade guacamole.  YES PLEASE!)  The staff is fast and are quick to make whatever changed you want to your meal.  You can sample all the meats before you order (and again, try the cornbread).  The owner is a great guy and I hope they build new locations soon.  

The sitting area and parking get absolutely crazy during lunchtime, especially as word spreads of how good this place is, so be prepared to park somewhere else or try to hit it up later in the day.
