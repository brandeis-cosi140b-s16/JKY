My family enjoyed a really yummy dinner here!  The tortillas are delicious, the rib meat stuffing was great and my dad's favorite.  My daughter loved the pork.  I had the rib meat, yum, and loved the mild red sauce.  I'm quite a wimp and appreciated that this had flavor without frying my tongue.  A little fresh crema and cheese mellowed it out perfectly.  

In an odd twist, they had pumpkin spice cookies with brown sugar frosting on the counter.  At first I thought, what an odd choice after enchiladas.  Turns out they were insanely good and very good after enchiladas!

Apparently I am old and I say things like "it's too noisy in here"... because it was a bit.  The only menu is up way high so I just got a general idea of what I wanted and asked a lot of questions.  The staff was great and didn't seem to mind.  

Everyone in the family really did enjoy the meal - we were the clean plate club.  Next visit, I am getting my own spinach and mushroom enchiladas.  And, I must confess, another cookie :-)
