This place is definitely the highlight of my trips to Phoenix! The concept is kind of like a Chipotle with enchiladas, except unlike Chipotle the flavors at Gadzooks are EXCEPTIONAL! First timers should definitely get the tomatillo chicken (I usually hate shredded chicken, but this was a major WOW for me) and the tortilla soup topped with the cornbread filling. The atmosphere is great with thoughtful minimal design details (they converted it from a gas station!) and their staff is super helpful -- everyone is very much on top of their game to make it a streamlined ordering process. My only complaint is that they don't have a location in California... yet! I can see this restaurant expanding and being very successful at anything they set their minds to. Kudos!!
