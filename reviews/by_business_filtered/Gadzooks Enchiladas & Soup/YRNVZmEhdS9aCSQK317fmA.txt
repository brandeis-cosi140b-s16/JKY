This place never disappoints! My husband and I love their enchiladas (try the cornbread one for something a little different and delicious). The soup is great and I can never leave without one of their pumpkin cookies (they are year around). 

One bad thing: Can be very busy during lunch rush hour -- but well worth the wait if you have the time.
