Hubby drives all over the Valley everyday and he kept seeing how busy Gadzooks was so on his day off we went.  Mmmmmm, glad we did.  He had ribs and spinach mushroom enchiladas and I had green chili pork.  I have been back with my sister and when our cousin comes down at the end of this month we are taking her there!  Good food, spicy but not heartburn spicy.  Lots of sauce and topping choices too.
