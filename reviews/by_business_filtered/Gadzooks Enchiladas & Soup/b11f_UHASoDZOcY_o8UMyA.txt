This place is the bomb! Don't waste your time with mediocre food, bad service , and terrible music across the street at Taco Guild. You'll spend half the money and double your pleasure. I gave Taco Guild three tries, before giving up. Came to Gadzooks today for the first time , and was super impressed. Great concept . I'll definitely be back.
