I've been meaning to try this place for a while and finally stopped in and I'm glad I did. The food was delicious and even as a big Chipotle fan there's so many options I feel like I could eat here multiple times a week and not get tired of it which sometimes happens for me at Chipotle.
I gave 3 stars for 2 reasons. One -as a first timer its a little awkward to navigate their line. The menu is so high up on a portion that extends above your head so you have to repeatedly step back to complete your order. Also the staff was not very helpful considering they are a newer place and there's so many options. Even when I go to Chipotle or Texas Roadhouse or Grimaldi's the first thing they ask is something along the lines of have you been here before etc. I noticed the same treatment towards the other customers in line as well, maybe it was a bad shift but that definitely turned me off a little. I'll be back for hopefully an experience as good as the food.
