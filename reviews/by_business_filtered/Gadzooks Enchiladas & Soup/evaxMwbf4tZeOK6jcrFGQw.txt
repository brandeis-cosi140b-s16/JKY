Sometimes people ignore the food and review dumb things like chairs or noise level... we are here to EAT. Stay home if you can't handle being out in public, troll.

Anyway, food was prepared quickly, affordable, and filling. The salsa was good, the meat was not dry or over seasoned.

You really won't find food this good for the price point and speed. I went a little crazy with the extras on the guac and Bison meat but it was worth the 2 bucks.
