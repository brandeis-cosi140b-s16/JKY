Holy enchiladas Batman! 

This is a nifty location, a funky idea, and yummy eats all thrown into a clay dish and roasted over a fire. 

The menu is fun, great selection but controlled enough to do what they do exceptionally well. Menu-drawn in chalk, not a unique idea I know but boy does it just fit this place. 

You walk to the counter... Kinda like chipotle. Pick your stuff, they cook it in the dish... In the fire.... Right in front of you. 

I had a chicken burrito with green chili and a side of con bread.... Oh sorry I'm from the south... Corn bread. 
Man it was good. Just a cool experience with a helpful staff and good food. 

Nuff respect. You should try it at least once. Cuz cuz cuz I said so. What's the worst that could happen? I'm mean really. 

An I'm out....s
