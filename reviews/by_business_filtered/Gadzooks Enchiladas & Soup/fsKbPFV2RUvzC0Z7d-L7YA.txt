I wanted a casual, easy dinner yesterday and met up with my brothers to try this place.  It's an interesting concept, similar to other fast-casual concepts in that there are a multitude of options for constructing a personalized meal  

We all opted for enchiladas.  Mine were on the 50/50 tortillas, a combo of corn and flour.  One was filled with cheese and the other was filled with a spicy cornbread mixture recommended by my brother...it was amazing in flavor and texture!!  I opted for a topping of sour cream and onions gastrique, which gave a nice cooling contrast to the red sauce .  We also had some refreshing citrus drinks along with chips and salsa.

The price is very fair and the food is good.  The staff is very nice.  Give this place a try...you won't go wrong :)
