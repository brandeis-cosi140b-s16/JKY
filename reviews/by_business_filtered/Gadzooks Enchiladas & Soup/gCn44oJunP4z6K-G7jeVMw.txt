I'm a pretty big fan of this place.  Yes the ordering can be a little time consuming, but when you consider that by the time you reach the end of the line, you are handed over a freshly baked casserole chocked full of yummy goodness, it sort of makes up for it all.

So there are a few things you should know when ordering.  1) You can get nachos.  They're not on the board, but they will make them up and they are delish (and big).  2) The soup is awesome.  I wish they offered more than one size but it is tasty and built to your tastes, just like everything else.  3) The spicy cornbread filling should be nominated for its own food group.  This is seriously the best thing that I have tasted in a really long time.  4) The grapefruit margarita is fantastic.  Perfectly crisp and refreshing for our super-hot summer days, do yourself a favor and get one or two (or three).  5) The pumpkin cookies with touch of caramel frosting is a must have.  It is the optimal ending for the meal and since it's not heavy, it's a great topper.

The staff is friendly.  The space is clean.  The food is fantastic.  Yep, I'm a pretty big fan!
