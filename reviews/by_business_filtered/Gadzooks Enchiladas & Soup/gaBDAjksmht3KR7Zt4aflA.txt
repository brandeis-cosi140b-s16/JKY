Seriously, how have you lived your life so far in the Valley without knowing about this place??? Best. Stuff. EVER. 

My mouth is watering now as I'm starting to write this... Those enchiladas... yum... After we discovered it, we've been religiously visiting it whenever we can get a day off, early in the morning and you really need to get in as soon as they open, because the place gets packed and line forms around 11.30... which is 30 minutes after opening. Whatever special they have going on for the day, it's gone by 12... Soooo, yeah, get in early :D You won't make a mistake with whatever you try! The ingredients that they use and have to offer are just great and fresh all the way. And you can see them right there in front of you!

Do yourself a favor and get to it whenever you can!
