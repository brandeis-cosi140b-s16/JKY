Never been impressed with the food, been here a few times, will never go back. And there's a girl behind the counter that talks LOUDER than anyone I have ever encountered. Now whenever we hear a loud person we say 'The Gadzooks girl must be here". Someone needs to tell her to stop screaming "PICO DE GALLO?!?!!" before she scares off more customers.
