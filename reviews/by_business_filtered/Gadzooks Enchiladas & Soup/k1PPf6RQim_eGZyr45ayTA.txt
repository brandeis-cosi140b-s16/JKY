This is my favorite place in the world. I'm talking about the best -- seriously, the very best -- enchiladas you will ever eat. Made just the way you like them. Smothered in good stuff, like wonderful pickled onions and some great cheeses. All of it is lip smacking good. And the idea for the place, the "make your own" kind of deal stolen from Subway, this is just really creative. Good job, congratulations to the owner. Someday I am going to stand out front with a big sign that says "You will love this food. Try it" because I think someone has to let the world know about the magnificence of Gadzooks. Read my reviews. I'm a very critical restaurant reviewer. I do not put up with slackers. This place rocks. [To the owner, my only suggestion is to put the "ear lady" in the back and not up front -- you'll attract more business.]
