Chipotle meets enchiladas! What a great idea.  I was so excited to try this place and I'm glad Amy H convinced me to get out of the office for lunch! My food was pretty good, but I don't think I picked the right combination... and I definitely didn't pick the right salsa... it was smoking hot and I had poured all over my enchiladas which made the tops of them virtually inedibile.  I'm definitely going to go back and hope to upgrade it 4 stars with better combinations. Something to keep in mind, I am not a big eater, but I feel like the portions were really small. My giant would have been starving, and could easily eat a double order.  Maybe it was because I'm a vegetarian.... Also, if you go at lunch... parking is tricky!!
