I didn't know what to expect, went in with an open mind, and I was pleasantly surprised. The meats are cooked extremely well, you can choose what else you want with your dish, the staff are very patient and very informative, they really know what and how the items are executed. It is clean and a true great experience with a very reasonable price. A great place!! Definitely will come back....
