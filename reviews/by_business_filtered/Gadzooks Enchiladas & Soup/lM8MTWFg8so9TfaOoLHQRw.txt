This place is really really good. I was blown away with how much I liked this place. I wish I would have known about this place before. The quality and all the toppings make this place so unique. Pickled onions, slaw, 3 different salsas all fresh. Very clean restaurant and kitchen. I wish the built another location closer to my house. If you going with a baby I'll let you know that there are only 2 high chairs and last night I had to wait for one.
