My coworkers had been raving about this place, so I was excited try it, especially after they said it was a "chipotle" style place.

So we get there and i just found everything to be so disorganized. Theres all sorts of stuff sitting there and they expect you to know how it all works. Anyway, I don't know even how to describe the process and the food. It was just flat out not good. It was too sour and just didn't do it for me. 

Maybe I didn't order the right thing. I do plan on giving it another chance because i saw them put all that stuffing into a green chili and I wanted to try it. 
I am hoping it will be better the second time around.

I still love chipotle. Much better.
