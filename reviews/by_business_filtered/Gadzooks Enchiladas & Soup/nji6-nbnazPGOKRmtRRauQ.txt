This is a great little place offering an interesting take on the enchilada. Ordering is pretty much Chipotle-style, where you pick out your ingredients and toppings. However, the quality of the food far surpasses Chipotle, Cafe Rio or other similar places. 

There are several ways to customize your enchilada, meats, sauces, cheeses and vegetarian fillings. You can also order a Poblano pepper stuffed with anything you want and served up enchilada style - absolutely delicious. They even have the option of throwing a fried egg on top, which is a must if you're looking for an authentic Southwest enchilada.
