Hello, would you like to know the secret of life? If you worship at the temple of the almighty carb (which I am wont to do and really need to stop making a habit of), here you go:

Mashed potatoes. Inside an enchilada.

I could basically stop there, because what the hell else do you need to know?! But some more deets:

I ordered 2 enchiladas in their 100% corn tortillas (pressed in front of our own eyeballs!), one filled with the mushroom/spinach mixture, one with the godly mashed potato filling.

I picked "Christmas style" (both red and green sauces) because WHY NOT! Although I am an avid verde lover, so I think I'll go full on green sauce next time.

Asadero cheese.

Pico. Picked red onion.

HEAVEN.

We split some chips/salsa/gaucamole on the side, because you might as well go all out. The food was stupid, in the best way possible. I like a little golden to my cheese (all pizzas/cheese-topped foods in my house get a 30 broiler blast at the last cooking minute), and was pleasantly surprised when my little 'lada bowl came out of their oven just like that. Perfect! The mixture of toppings was superb.

The only recommendation I can give is to perhaps put a label of what's what on the front see-through guard as people order. There are a lot of fillings/toppings/salsas/extras and it was a little awkward to have to step back and look immediately above my head and strain to see all the details of what I could order. If anything, it could make the employees' lives easier.

Last word: Pumpkin cookies. Get them. See how life changes for the better.
