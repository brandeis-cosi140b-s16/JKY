Arrgh, just when I kicked my Chipotle habit, this place comes along.  Some great tortilla soup, custom made enchiladas that come out of the oven piping hot.  Why didn't some one come up with this earlier?  My biggest gripe is the parking lot, not the easiest to negotiate a little parking lot on 7th street during prime rush hour but worth it.  Oh they have great snickerdoodle and Mexican wedding cookies for purchase right at the counter!
