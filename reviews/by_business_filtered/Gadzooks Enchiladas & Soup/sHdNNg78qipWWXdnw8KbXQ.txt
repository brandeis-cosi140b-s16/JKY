Just had the most amazingly delicious Party with a capital P, in my mouth! First time here, but not my last! Had the 50/50 tortillas, one pork, one chicken, green sauce, baked and bubbling to perfection, out of the oven drizzled with fresh scratch made crema, crumbled cotija cheese, and vinaigrette slaw topping it all off. Side of hand-smashed guacamole made it complete. Can't wait to try some secret menu items, I was made aware of tonight! Thanks Eric! ;-)
