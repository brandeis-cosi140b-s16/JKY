Meah. Food was ok. Great environment, tons of people. I got the bison tacos. I've only had bison a handful of times & it was gamy but not here, so that's a positive. I give them 5 stars for authenticity & making bison meat taste as good as it possibly could... But it's still bison meat. Really not that great. 
If they have beef I will try that next time. I won't give up on this place for the simple fact that it's authentic with a Chipotle flare.
