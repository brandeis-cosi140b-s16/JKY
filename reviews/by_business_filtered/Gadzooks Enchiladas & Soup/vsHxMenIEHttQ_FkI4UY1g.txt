I work across the street from Gadzooks and waited for it to open for what seemed like forever. I just got a chance to try it today. The staff greeted me right away and could tell I had never been (i assume) they explained how everything worked to make my 1st time easy. The process was not hard at all unless you can't make up your mind what you like. They do have many choices which can seem overwhelming, but I was brave and decided quickly. I got the braised ribs and green chille pork enchiladas with the christmas sauce and tried a little of all of the cheeses. They topped everything and melted it together in the wood oven. I have to say that I very much enjoyed it and was a great experience. The food was very good and the place is very nice and clean. Will be going back for sure.
