The enchiladas are simply delicious, served in a ceramic bowl that goes in the oven as the enchiladas are made to order. Really unique concept and great value: this is fast Tex-Mex counter service that tastes upscale without breaking the bank. The assembly line concept from Chipotle but done absolutely right. The atmosphere is about the same as Chipotle's but you won't care. They must know the menu is a neck-breaker, and like me, anyone going for the first time won't know how to order. If recommend getting the menu on a postcard before you get in line to order.
