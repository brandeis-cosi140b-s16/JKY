Came here with the bf on a tip from our airbnb host, this place did not disappoint. Chipotle style setup with enchiladas, such a genius idea! I tried the 50/50 tortillas, chile verde, braised short ribs, the xmas sauce, pickled onion, guacamole, fried egg... I'm sure I'm missing something. It was very delicious. Great flavors, great concept, great food. Coming from LA I definitely have high expectations for Mexican food and I'll be back for sure!
