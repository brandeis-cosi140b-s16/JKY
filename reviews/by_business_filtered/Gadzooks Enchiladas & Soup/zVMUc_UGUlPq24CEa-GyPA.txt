Everything is already hot, but still put into an oven for a minute or so just to melt the cheese. Since my soup was in a stoneware bowl it took a week to cool down. Afterward it tasted pretty damn good. However the tortilla soup is full of jalape√±os. This is not listed anywhere I saw. It is so hot it was difficult for me to differentiate the tastes. A little hot pepper goes a long way. The amount used here is ridiculous. But I will be back to try again.
