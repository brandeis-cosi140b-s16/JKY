Gallo Blanco Cafe has amazing food, however the service needs a lot of help.  My first visit was one of the worst customer service nightmares I've ever had dining out.  My second visit was much better, however I think our waiter must have been high on drugs.  During my second visit my friend and I ordered the fried manchego cheese appetizer and it arrived after our main entree.  Really???  I wish this place would get it's act together.  I'm very fearful in recommending Gallo to my friends and clients.  I've vowed to give Gallo one more shot and if it's not at least a good experience, I won't be back.  I work too hard for my money to throw it away in an establishment I don't believe in.
