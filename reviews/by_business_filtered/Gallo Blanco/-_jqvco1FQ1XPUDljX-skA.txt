I was so excited to hear that Doug Robson (I'm a fan of his from LGO) was opening an authentic Mexico City mexican food restaurant!  I have spent some time in Mexico City and love all the flavors of the food, the people and the culture!
Doug hit in on the head with Gallo Blanco.  My family is a huge critique when it comes to guacamole and margaritas.  Everyone gave it two thumbs up and if they had 3 thumbs, they would have put the third up too!  The guac has oranges in it . . . something i never would have thought of, might even scoffed at but truly loved!  the portion is quite big so makes it great for a full table of hungry eaters!

The sangria is perfect and I heard the margaritas are better then anything my native phoenician family has had in Phoenix!  A reason to go back.  

The pork tacos are divine as is their presentation and $2 price tag!  Way to keep it cheap, Doug!  I also loved the elote.  I didn't think i could eat the whole ear when it arrived at my place, but apparently, my eyes are too small for my stomach!  So yummy.
