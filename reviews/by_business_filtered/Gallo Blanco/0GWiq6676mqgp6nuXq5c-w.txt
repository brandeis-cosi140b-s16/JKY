My wife and I ate here twice in our brief trip to Phoenix.  The food was excellent!  The service was great the first time, although not the best the second time (different personalities in the wait staff).

The menu is very creative, and everything I had was very fresh.  My only suggestion (and perhaps they had it and I missed it?) is that they offer the option to make your burrito mojado (wet, or "smothered")...   Their smokey Arbol salsa was awesome!

Definitely worth eating here; never had food this good in a restaurant attached to a hotel!
