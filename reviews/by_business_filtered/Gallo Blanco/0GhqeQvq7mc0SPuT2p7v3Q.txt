Had chilaquiles verdes (chicken/sunnyside up eggs), shrimp ceviche, and chips n salsa n pico de gallo... All yum!! 3 others had their plate of cheeseburger, 1/2 pollo asodo, and fish taco  & some salmon plate- can't recall the name. All were very satisfied, I highly recommend if u like yummy food, good atmosphere, very helpful/friendly and  knowledgeable staff!!!
