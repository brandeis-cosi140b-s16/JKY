Went here for happy hour which they do from 3-6 M-Thurs. Our table ordered $5 margaritas and the sangria, which were both very good.  Ordered the chips and salsa which came with pico and a nice chipotle salsa. 
We tried about 4 varieties of tacos and we liked the shrimp and veggie tacos the best. The corn on the cob with cotija cheese was almost decadent, as well as the ensalada cortada which was such a delicious and interesting salad with all its' textural components. Our friend ordered the pork quesadilla as well which she said was seasoned nicely. 
We finished our meal with the postres de chocolate. 
The service was great. Prompt and although we had a main waitress, we had multiple people filling our water and bringing our food out. We never felt neglected or forgotten. Cute decor too in the old Clarendon Hotel!
