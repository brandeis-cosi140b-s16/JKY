I saw Adrien Grenier there which was awesome and got me drooling a bit. But seeing my man crush made me forget that the hostess is a dumb bimbo who doesn't know how to do her job. if you go to this place and ask the hostess for a reservation, she will most certainly mess it up and leave you with the feeling of wanting to yell at her. 

I'd recommend Joyride Tacos in Central Phoenix (there are less hippies there as well)
