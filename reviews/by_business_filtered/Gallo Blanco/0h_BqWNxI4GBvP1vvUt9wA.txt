Been here many times and love the food and find the prices quite reasonable.    I bring friends and family here too.  The guacamole and the elote are a must have each time I come.  There isn't a bad item on the menu and the ingredients very fresh, however....

The only thing we Tapatios cannot figure out is why no little botanas like chips and salsa while you are waiting for your meal.  We came for Sunday breakfast and the chorizo and eggs came with three tiny tortillas.  Though delicious, a little stingy, no?  A little more Mexican hospitality, which is what we are best known for, does not cost much.
