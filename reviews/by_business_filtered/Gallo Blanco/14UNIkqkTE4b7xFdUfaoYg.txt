Gallo is very close to where I live, and after reading all the great reviews, I had to try it. There's plenty of parking on the street with a short walking distance. The restaurant is nicely decorated but a little cramped. The staff is friendly but I thought our server could have been a little more helpful.

We had the queso with vegetables - fantastic. I really like that they give you chips and tortillas to use for dipping.

The carne asada tacos are so delicious. The beef is tender, with great flavor, and the simple cilantro and lime topping is perfect. The huevos rancheros are also very good. It's a big portion size, which I happily took home as leftovers. The two sauces they give you are fresh, spicy, and delicious. I could eat the tomatillo sauce all day, every day.

Happy hour is 3 - 6, and includes several menu items being marked $1 less from the listed price. Great deal!

I can't wait to go back.
