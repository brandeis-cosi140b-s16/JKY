Fun little place in the classic Clarendon Hotel. Fresh local ingredients, good food, and some nice cocktails. The guacamole is some of the best I have ever had. The added orange wedges bring some nice citrus to the heavy avocado, and the fresh made chips pair quite well with it. The Naco Torta should be an automatic. Smokey grilled ribeye with a slightly spicy salsa and two over easy eggs on a delicious griddled telera roll.

The breakfast items are deliciously fresh. The ingredients are local and well put together to create a wonderful blend of traditional Mexican items.

The hidden surprise here though are the desserts. Especially the postre de chocolate, but I am a sucker for s'mores.

Just a great little gem off the beaten path a little that offers great food.
