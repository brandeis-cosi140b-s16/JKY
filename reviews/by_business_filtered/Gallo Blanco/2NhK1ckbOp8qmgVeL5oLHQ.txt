I have heard such rave reviews that I was really looking forward to going.

The place was loud, hot and well.. loud.

It was unfortunate that I was there for a meeting. I only heard about 2/3 of the conversation at my table.

The service was great and they kept my water filled (which was great considering how warm I thought it was inside the space). The food was timely. Not exactly an authentic Mexican treat, but good... except the huge hunks of citrus in the guacamole.. smaller pieces of citrus would have been much more prefered as the taste was interesting enough to eat.

The cochinita torta I had was good, the meat was tasty though extremely soggy. Good thing they wrap the torta up in paper!

Someone at the table had the chicharron de queso, which came out like a huge tower but I find that the price they asked for melted cheese with a hipster presentation was a bit much. It was OK, though chicharron is not a name I would give it.

Someone at the table ordered ceviche, which I did not taste, but looked like run of the mill gringo ceviche to me.

Will I be back? I would only suggest it if I needed to be with a bunch of people I don't want to listen to.
