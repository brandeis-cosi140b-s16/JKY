One of the only places in the Valley that makes me curse after nearly every bite - that's how GOOD my food experiences have been here. Cochinita and carne asada beef tacos cannot be any better and are my favorites. Fish tacos are good, and can be a little spicy. I could drink the hot sauces they provide in the squeeze bottles. I've resisted, to maintain some decorum, licking the bowl clean of the chunky guacamole. Save room for dessert, because the Orange Cake and new Lime Tart are worth it!

Service? Can be hit or miss, but always friendly.

Atmosphere?? Last visit, between the deafening, thumping music, the baby at the table across the way screeching regularly at the very top of its tiny lungs - compelling about a dozen patrons to do a simultaneous quick turn of the head to see where it was coming from, combined with the crashing of dishes to the floor in the kitchen area made me feel like I was part of a Saturday Night Live skit. 

No matter. Those darn tacos, guacamole, and desserts will have me keep coming back for more !
