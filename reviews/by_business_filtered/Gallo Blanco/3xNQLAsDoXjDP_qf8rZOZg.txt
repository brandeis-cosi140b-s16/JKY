Good mexican food in a hotel?

Yes.

It's a limited menu, no combo platters for $9.95 here. Mostly tortas, street tacos, and side items. But they are delicious, none-the-less. Really fresh ingredients. And their sangria really hit the spot, ifyouknowwhatImean (no skimping on the alcohol). 

But the main reason I eat here: chicharron aka DEEP FRIED CHEESE WALL. It's like a grilled cheese without that pesky bread.
