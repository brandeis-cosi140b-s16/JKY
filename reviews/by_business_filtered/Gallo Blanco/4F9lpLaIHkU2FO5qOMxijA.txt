Ok... 4 stars, but really 4.5 stars. I went here for lunch today with my Dad and it was pretty fabulous. I have been wanting to try this place for awhile as it gets favorable yelp reviews, and after my Dad and I went through every type of food out there (want sandwiches? no. Thai? no. Chinese? no. and on and on) I suggested this place. I'm glad I did. So we got there around 1 pm and we had to wait about 10 minutes to get a table. Once we were seated, it took quite awhile for anyone to come help us. So that's kind of where the points were taken off. That and there were no chips to go with their fabulous salsa unless you get guac (which we ended up getting). So initially we ordered the elote (corn on the cob covered in cheese and paprika.....much better than I though it would be.... although I have no reason to think it wouldn't be good.... hmmm), two pork tacos, and a carne asada torta. The tacos were good, but I hate to say, if I wanted to get a taco just like that I may go to America's Tacos, just for convenience because they are priced similarly and sized similarly. The torta, however, was very delicious. The meat was tasty, the roasted tomato tasted very nice, and if you put the tomatillo salsa on it.... wow it's delicious. Plus the bread was nice and soft, but not soggy. So we also ended up getting guac (just a side dish of it, so 3$ instead of 7$) at the extreme recommendation of our server, and it was good, but not the best guac I've ever had. I wish it were spicy... that would improve it a great deal. Overall, the food was excellent and well priced. For everything, we payed 22$. Not bad.
