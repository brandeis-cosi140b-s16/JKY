So this is why I never liked tex-mex and Mexican food. Becasue I have never been here!! Seriously, f*ckig amazing tacos. The tortillas are obviously handmade and fresh. The ingredients are soo fresh and well flavored. We got eight different tacos and the bill was only 26 dollars or so. You need to go and redefine what you think tacos are.
