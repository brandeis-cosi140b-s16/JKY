A fantastic place!

Tuesday night was a 15 minute wait to be seated, but I sipped a pint of local beer and watched the end of the all star game from the bar until, the hostess kindly dropped me off at the best four top in the house.

Tuesday is happy hour all day. I had 4 Baja-quality grilled fish tacos (2 halibut and 2 local pork/cochinita), the best elote I've had north of the border and another beer for less than $25. Loco!

On top of honest, delicious food the service is impeccable and your feel like your eating with friends. 

They're even open for breakfast!

I'll be back!
