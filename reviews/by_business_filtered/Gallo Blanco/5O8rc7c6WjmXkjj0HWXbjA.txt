Offering slight twists to traditional Mexican street cuisine via a menu that concentrates on fresh ingredients, Gallo Blanco definitely delivers in the flavor department: time and again reminding me why it's one of my favorite eateries in Phoenix. Literally everything that I've ever eaten there has been a tasty treat (not something that I can say about too many restaurants) with a few of my favorites being the Elote Callejero (grilled corn-on-the-cob covered with Cotija cheese and smoked paprika), the made-to-order Guacamole (probably my favorite in town), and the Chicharron de Queso (a cheese crisp tower served with an Aji aioli)! The seasonal vegetable tortas and tacos are also excellent... And though I can't personally comment on the dishes containing meat, I can say this... I had taken my brother and sister-in-law (both foodies and carnivores) to Gallo Blanco during one of their previous visits to Phoenix. They now specifically request going there whenever they visit me although they are coming from the Mecca of awesome cuisine that is the San Francisco Bay Area. High praise in my book!

Usually when you think of restaurants located inside hotels, you don't generally think of terms like cool, really tasty, affordable or locals hangout. Yet somehow, Gallo Blanco (located within the Clarendon Hotel in Central Phoenix) manages to pull off all of these things with an inviting atmosphere, great food for a very fair price (a great lunch for $10), and a recurring local customer base (i.e. me).
