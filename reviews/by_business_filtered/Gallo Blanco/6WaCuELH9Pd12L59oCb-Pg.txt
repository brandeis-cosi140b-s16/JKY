Atmosphere: Fun, hip, relaxed.

Food: Great.  Best menu items are the tacos, verde enchiladas, and carne asada burrito. 

Biggest complaint: Their to-go order process.  When you arrive for pickup, the hostess says she needs to go "find your waiter".  They assign a different waiter to every order, which makes the process inefficient.  After she hunts down your waiter, they come find you then see if your order is ready for pickup (which is never the case).  Bottom line is the process takes 10 minutes where it should only take a couple.
