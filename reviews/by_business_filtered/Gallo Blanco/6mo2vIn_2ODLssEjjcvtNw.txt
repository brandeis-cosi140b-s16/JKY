Open, bright and clean are what come to mind first.. extremely friendly staff and plenty of parking were a huge plus! I wish I hadn't eaten 5 of my moms homemade tacos before I ventured here. Their menu had so many delicious options! First of all, I never thought to douse corn on the cob with cheese and paprika and I'm kind of pissed it took this long to find a place that has because, omfg it's the most amazingly delicious simple culinary treat. This is what I started with and I seriously could have eaten a whole maze of it. TRY IT. Next came the veggie torta, which I shared. I could marry that bread. So fluffy and yummy and the veggies had a wonderful flavor too. . At this point I had reached stomach capacity, so onto the bourbon! They did had some interesting drink options, but I was just in the mood for the usual. I am excited to go back and try more dishes, which have gotten rave reviews, then possibly take a plunge in the Clarendon pool which is apparently open to the public! Free towels & lotions included. Score!
