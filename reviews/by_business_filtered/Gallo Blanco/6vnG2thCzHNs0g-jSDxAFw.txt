I had to update my review to share a very important finding since my first review.  Gallo Blanco has the best guacamole you'll ever taste.  Bet on it.  There's more going on here than you're standard guac but it's still familiar enough to bring to mind all your favorite onion, cilantro, lime and guacamole memories.  Now add orange - or what I think was orange but somehow much, much better than you can possibly imagine.  My continuous improvement suggest for GB is that all guacamole orders come with a privacy screen.  It's just too good not to dive in without abandon, making a complete and utter fool of yourself.  This chef has a deft touch and a very refined sense of balance with flavors.  Do not pass up the guac!
