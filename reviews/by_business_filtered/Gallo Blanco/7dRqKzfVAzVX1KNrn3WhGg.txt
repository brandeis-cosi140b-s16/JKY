Avid yelpers....My husband and I saw the 844 averaged 4 star reviews and tried this place out. Yelp led us astray. It was absolutely terrible. TERRIBLE! We had the ceviche which was OK...then everything got progressively worse. I had the tacos- crane asada and pork. The carne asada was inedible- I literally had to keep spitting out bits of meat because they were so chewy. The pork was so dry I could barely choke it down. Handmade corn tortillas didn't help- so dry. Cheese quesadilla was bland and served cold. My husband ordered the torta- terrible quality bread- most of his meat was in edible and lacking in flavor. We were hopefully but this was The worst $50 we have ever spent. Spare yourself!
