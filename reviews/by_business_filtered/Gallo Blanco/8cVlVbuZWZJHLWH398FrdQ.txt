It was my first time visiting Gallo Blanco today. I manage 3 apartment communities within walking distance and I'm thrilled to have discovered this gem! The house salad is absolutely fantastic with a non-traditional style and a flavor that flew off the charts! By recommendation, I also had the shrimp taco. Bravo! The overall feel, decor, art and vibe paired with locally grown produce and fantastic service from Darlene will have me coming back regularly along with my business contacts and friends!
