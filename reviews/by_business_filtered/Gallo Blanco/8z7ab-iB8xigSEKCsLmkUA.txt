This Place is amazinggggggg. I used to come here every Wednesday night for Flamenco Wednesdays with Flamenco Por Vida.
The restaurant is divided into two parts and I have sat and enjoyed both sides. However I prefer being as close to the stage as possible.
Their steak tacos are to die for. Although they are small the marinade is just delicious, the meat is always tender, juicy and full of flavor, no cheese, sourcream, salsa, or lime is necessary.
Their Steak Torta is also amazing the bread/bollilos is always perfectly toasted with butter and fresh. Their burritos are decent, but are nothing compared to their steak tacos and tortas.
Also I can't believe I am saying this, but their salad Zamorano is amazing as well. I would have never thought of making a salad with corn nuts, lime, grilled Zamorano cheese, but it somehow it works, beautifully.
