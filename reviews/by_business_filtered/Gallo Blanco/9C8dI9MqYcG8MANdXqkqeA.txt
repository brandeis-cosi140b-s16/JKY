I've been back. Many times. The past four times have been for breakfast. Usually, I'm not a fan of breakfast, but Gallo Blanco's breakfast is a perfect meal. I always order the Huevos Rancheros, sunny side up. It is my perfect breakfast. I've brought a new friend each time, and they always come to the same conclusion as me.

Let me tell you about my breakfast. On bottom, you've got two corn tortilla quesadillas, each with just the right amount of cheese. Enough so that the tortillas aren't dry, but not so much that you're overwhelmed by the quesadilla. It is not the star of this meal, and the cook who made it knows it. On top of the quesadillas are two perfectly cooked eggs. The bottoms of these sunny eggs are still white - they're that perfect. Plus, they taste so wonderful and fresh that I think a chicken laid 'em that morning. Over the eggs is possibly one of the best salsas in the valley (that's right I said it, and yes, I know I live in a salsa-rich city). But don't fear, the salsa isn't drenching it's bottom components, it's baby-bear (just right). A little cilantro sprinkled on top with a side of beans (complete with crumbled cheese) and I call this the ticket to a happy stomach. 

Eat it or anything on the breakfast menu. Enjoy it. 

(PS: on weekend mornings, I have NEVER encountered any poor service. I've always found the restaurant to be extremely welcoming.)
