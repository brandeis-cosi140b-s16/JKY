Great ambiance. Love the colorful artwork. Started out with the guacamole...it was delicious. I've never had guac with oranges in it, which may not sound that appealing, but it's awesome. The fish tacos were great too. They look small, but two were enough to fill me up. They pack a lot of fish into those little tacos. Great flavors and love the hot salsa.
