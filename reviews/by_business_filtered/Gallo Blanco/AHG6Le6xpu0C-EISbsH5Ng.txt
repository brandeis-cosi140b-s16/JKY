5 Stars if the place would stand up anywhere. It would. 

1- It "melds" well with the funky-hip urban "vibe" of the Clarendon Hotel - something prior entrepreneurs didn't do as effectively. 

2- Both the chef and the "bottle hunter" are experts who live and breathe what they love - cooking and curating alcohol. It shows. 

For instance: There was a Scottish whiskey I fell in love with during the '90s I haven't seen in a while -single malt aged in charred port casks, wonderfully smooth and india-ink black in color- and mis-remembered its label - ordering that label at Gallo Blanco. When I protested and described the scotch I had hoped for, the bottle hunter came over to apologize [for my own ignorance?-unnecssary but wonderfully gracious of him] and explain the whiskey I wanted stopped production over a decade ago because it's color never found market acceptance. How many people would have that at their fingertips? 

What to eat? Anything! It's all locally-sourced prepared by food artists! My own obsessive choice is Chilaquiles Verdes - heavenly green chile sauce poured over free-range perfectly roasted chicken topped with delicious shredded cheese and free-range eggs sunnyside up - a breakfast they serve all day and night. I hit that my 5th visit and it's kept me from sampling the entire menu so far...but I've nibbled on my companions' choices. 

...And then there's the rooftop lounge. But that's for another night.
