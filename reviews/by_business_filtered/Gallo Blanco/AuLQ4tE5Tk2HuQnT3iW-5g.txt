So I was turned onto Gallo Blanco by colleague and fellow Yelper Marcus D. and was very impressed. 

I went there last Friday for lunch with a colleague of mine. Now when I first arrived I was a little skeptical because it is located inside a remodeled apartment complex turned hotel. Now when we got inside I was surprised how packed it was. We were forced to sit at the bar which actually turned out better because we got to chat with the staff and get the low down on the menu. 

Ok so now to the food. Before I get to that I need to paint you a picture. So my colleague and I are not fat kids by any means but we are also not 110 Emo skater kids who don't eat. So when we asked our server how many tacos he usually eats and he recommended four we were shocked so we went with three....well we should have gone with 8 each. The tacos are served street style, hence why they are only two bucks each. 

The thing is we probably could have eaten 8 each not only because of the size but because of how good these tacos were. I had the pork and carna asada tacos. Both were amazing. The salsas they give you to add were also fantastic. The only thing we tried that I wouldn't recommend is the fried cheese crisp as an app. It is basically fried cheese they give you in a cool presentation with a queso dip. It was just too much cheese, next time I would pass. 

All in all I would highly recommend this place. Don't let the outside fool you, this is not only a great restaurant but a pretty cool pool area at the hotel as well. If you are craving good tacos make it to Gallo Blanco.
