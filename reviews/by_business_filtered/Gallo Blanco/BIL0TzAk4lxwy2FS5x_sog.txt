Visited Phoenix for business and wanted to find a nice place for a good burrito.  Since this place was a block from my meeting location, I though I would give it a try.  Walked into a lively place with people at every table.  i sat outside on the patio and enjoyed the sunshine.  The service was quick and friendly.  Ordered the carne asada burrito and was very pleased.  The ribeye meat used was cooked perfectly with great flavors.  They seasoned it perfectly with just the right amount of heat.  I can't wait to visit again and try some of the other delectable treats.
