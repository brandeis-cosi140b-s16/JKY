Do not go alone! Food prep takes forever (28 min for 3 street tacos) making for an awkward lunch. The waiter I started with was inattentive and unhelpful. This was interesting because there were 5 customers and 4 waiters when I got there. A waitress ended up performing the first waiter's job.

I was fairly hungry, so the food part of the meal should have won me over easily. It didn't. The fish taco was the best and it was only okay (try la santisma for better). You can get better carne asada and pork tacos at any one of the 1000 taquerias in Phoenix.

By the time I was done inhaling my food (nearly late for work), I went to pay my bill at the front because nobody was around to get a bill to my table. The original waiter came to the register and said "We got busy."  I am sorry you had to cover 5 tables instead of two sir. I hope my tip went to the waitress that was actually able to serve me food (I left a note with that instruction).

I know one bad review won't change the public perception on the restaurant, but I do hope that Gallo Blanco can take note of a couple gaps in their operations. Time to create a better working staff organization model that is not so overwhelming to the waiters and cooks.
