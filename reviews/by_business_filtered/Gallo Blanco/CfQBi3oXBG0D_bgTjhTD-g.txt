So I've just moved to the area from Seattle and my quest for Mexican/Southwest cuisine has begun. My dh and I popped over for a late lunch on a Saturday based on Yelp reviews. I wasn't sure if I wanted bfast or lunch so this place fit the bill for choices. Waited a bit for a table even though it wasn't very busy. The room is very loud even after a couple of acoustic panels look to have been installed. I can't imagine what it would be like on a crowded day or night so if you're looking for a small quiet place, this might not be it. We were lucky to have a great waitress who answered all our questions, made good suggestions and was sure to check in often. I had the torta with steak and fried egg. It was good, egg cooked very well, meat a bit overdone but tasty. Hubby had a pork carnita torta which was just okay. Also had the guac - yum-oh! And posole, quite good, too. Parking was easy, the hotel is a bit kooky if not interesting. I'll definitely be heading back soon.
