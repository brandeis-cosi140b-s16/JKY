I have been here once before and was impressed with everything about it but when I brought my fianc√© here, it was terrible. We were seated right away and our drink order was taken and brought quickly and then we waited another 15 minutes before getting up and walking out. It wasn't busy, 4 other tables were sat and already had their food. We watched as the 2 male servers passed by us multiple times barely glancing at us and going to chat with the tables who already had their food. The last straw that made us walk out was that another man came in and was sat and brought a menu and the waiter waited right there at his table to take his order then immediately went to punch his order into the computer. The only thing that kept me from asking for a manager was the fact that they didn't make us pay or the coffees we ordered AFTER the fact that we announced that no one ever came to take our order.
