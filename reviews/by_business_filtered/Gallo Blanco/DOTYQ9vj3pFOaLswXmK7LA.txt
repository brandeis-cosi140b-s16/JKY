Absolutely my favorite Mexican Food place in the Valley.  

Get the Guacamole!  My favorite meal is the carne asada burrito.  The carne asada is delicious marinated rib eye steak.  I eat it with the green salsa they provide.  It's amazing.  Great prices here too...definite go to when in the neighborhood.
