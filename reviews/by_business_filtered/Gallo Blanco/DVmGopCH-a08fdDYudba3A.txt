I've been here multiple times, and I've never been disappointed.  The last time I went here was after a particularly disastrous outing at The Tuck Shop after they gave our table away.  I went here as my dependable backup, but that in no way should impugn the food.  The food is always great.  Favorites of mine include the pica rica burger, and their tacos.  I always finish off the meal with a key lime tart as it is absolutely heavely here.  I've converted a few people from key lime haters to lovers with its magical powers.  Add in the fact that they've got great drinks for alkys (Guerra Blanca) or tea tottlers alike, and this place is a home run.  Add in the great, romantic atmosphere at the pool or up on the roof deck, and this place is a grand slam.  To overuse my weird baseball thing, I'd double time it back here anytime.  Love you Gallo blanco, you're forever in my heart.
