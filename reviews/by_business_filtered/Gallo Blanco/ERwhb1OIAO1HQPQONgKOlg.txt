I really liked the food and atmosphere but I couldn't shake the feeling that this place might not be the cleanliest. The first coffee cup I was given had lipstick marks all over it. It happens. No biggie. But then I watch the server grab a new cup and when I get it, it also has lipstick marks all over it. Hoping it was just a fluke.
