Last night was my first time there.  I had heard a few good things about it so I decided to go.  We sat on the patio which was great and it only got better from there!  Through some conversation with our server, Dre, I found out that not only was she a big time foodie like myself, however she was VEEY passionate about this establishment....... So, I closed my menu and asked her to choose for me as everything on the menu looked great.  Well, no surprise, I was not disappointed.  I had the chicken and my friend had tacos... UNBELIEVABLE and did I mention the guacamole and roasted corn???.... OFF THE HOOK!  ... Not to mention great character... A FABULOUS evening!
