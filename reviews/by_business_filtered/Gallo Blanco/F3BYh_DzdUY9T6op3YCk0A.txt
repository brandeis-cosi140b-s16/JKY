The food here is amazing-- the service? Not so much. You're pretty much going to get some hipster server who behaves like it's an inconvenience to serve you. But that doesn't really matter because the food is so amazing. The guacamole? I never ate it before I had Gallo's, now I can't get enough. Their carne asada burrito? I have dreams about it's deliciousness. If you're in Phoenix and haven't been, go. Like right now.
