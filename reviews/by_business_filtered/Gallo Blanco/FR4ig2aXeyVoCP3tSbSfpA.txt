Between the three of us, we ordered quite a few things off the menu, with the intention of having leftovers: four tacos, guacamole, ceviche, a side of chorizo, chilaquiles, and the naco torta.  There were no leftovers to be had.  The star of the meal were the chilaquiles.  The green chile sauce that comes on top is simply delicious, with just the right amount of kick that complimented the rich yolk of the sunny side up eggs and the tender chicken and gooey cheese.

Our server was friendly and helpful.  While we were waiting for our food, I spilled my sangria.  Not only did he bring me a refill at no charge, he brought me a plate full of the booze-soaked fruit as well.  My toddler had a hard time understanding that she couldn't eat any of it, so we had to order an additional side of (booze-free) fruit for her.  Problem solved.

The total for our bill was just shy of $80.  For all that food, and four alcoholic beverages, we all felt it was a very reasonable price.  

I enjoyed looking at all the artwork that adorned the walls, and my dad and husband got a kick out of the urinals shaped like lips in the men's room.

I'm a big fan of eating local, and they're not shy about letting people know which local vendors their foods come from.  They use a number of the same vendors that I buy from frequently: Schreiner's sausage, pork from the Meat shop, produce from Maya's Farm.  They just do a far better job of putting it all together :)

All in all, we had a fantastic experience and are looking forward to visiting again in the very near future.
