This is such a cool restaurant. Very fun and lively, you can tell everyone at all of the tables is having a great time. I loved the staff and i think the menu is just so unique and awesome. All the meals that were ordered at my table were prepared to perfection and i have never been to another mexican food restaurant that is so unique and exciting to be at. I will recommend this place to everyone and it makes for a great night out. Also, the margarita's are so perfect. They have a little bit of kick to each sip and it was a great drink with my meals. 

I LOVE THIS PLACE
