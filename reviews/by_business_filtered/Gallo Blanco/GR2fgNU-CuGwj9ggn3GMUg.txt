nothing bad to say about gallo blanco. nada. 

guacamole is fresh, fruity and oh-so-excellent.
both white and red sangrias are yummy, and their mixed drinks are delish.
steak, chicken, fish and veggie tacos are four perfect bites of flavorful goodness, and they're cheap, too!
salsa sauces provided with the tacos are tasty and abundant.

the servers are sometimes neglectful in a airy kind of way, but the food and ambiance is so good it doesn't really matter unless you're late for another engagement. either way, if you want fast service, just ask for it.

go in a tee shirt or a formal gown. you'll fit right in.

ciao.
