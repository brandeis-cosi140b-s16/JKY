I'll just relay back what everyone else is saying.

The food is absolutely kickass.

The service makes me never want to come here again.

Seriously, 539 reviews? You know what you guys are getting yourself into. Don't expect to be taken care of by the servers, but come hungry and get the tacos, for Crissake!!!
