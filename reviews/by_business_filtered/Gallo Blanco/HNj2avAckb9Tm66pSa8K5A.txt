I arranged a group dinner for approximately 20 people for a local conference and we had a great time.  The food was outstanding and my team of all out of towners really enjoyed everything.  The staff was super attentive and was able to accommodate people who came later.  We took advantage of a private room immediately off the main restaurant which was much quieter than the main space.  The only reason I'm not leaving five stars is that I wish the ambiance of the private room was less like a conference room and more like a restaurant.

All in all, a very successful dinner with good memories for all.
