went there tonight - great GREAT Carne Asada tacos!! Guac. was pretty tasty - different tho with pineapple.  Waiter was awesome, friendly service and prompt.  I'd go back and try the corn on the cob and have more carne asada !  It has a nice atmosphere although it's inside a hotel - it still feels like it's own place.
