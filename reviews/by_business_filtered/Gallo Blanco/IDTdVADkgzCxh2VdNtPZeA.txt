If by some strange happenstance, I were to try veggie tacos that were somehow better than Gallo Blanco's, my head might explode.  I could write love poems to Gallo Blanco's veggie tacos.  So sooo good.  And cheap!

I won't rhapsodize about the guac and elote, but they are also delicious. And the drink menu is good enough that this place could stand alone as a bar.

The best part about this place, though, is the variety of ways to enjoy it:  You can get tacos and drinks while lounging in the super-comfy pool area, or stake out a spot near the bar on Flamenco Wednesdays, or grab a spot on the patio on cool fall evenings.  Or you could go the traditional route and get a table in the restaurant's lovely and modern and chic interior.  

I can't say enough good things about this place.  5 stars.
