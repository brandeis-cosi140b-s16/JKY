Upgrading Gallo Blanco to 5 stars as it is now one of our favorite places to eat downtown.

Even after switching to eating vegan, Gallo Blanco still rocks for us! 

I'd recommend:
Chips & guacamole with no cheese (some of THE best guac in town)
A couple veggie tacos (these come with no cheese by default)

Other options:
side of jasmine rice with green tomatillo salsa
side of beans with no cheese
+ more

Both their red & green spicy sauces are vegan and delicious (ask for them!!).

My previous qualms about their beer selection have been resolved. They have a tasty craft-brewed amber or pale ale on tap almost every time that we visit.
