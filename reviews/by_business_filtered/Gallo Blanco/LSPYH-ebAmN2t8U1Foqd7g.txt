Visiting from Boston, I was excited to try some Southwestern food out in the Southwest. This place did not disappoint!

Located in the Clarendon Hotel, the restaurant has the same loud, hip vibe. Drinks are fantastic and reasonably priced. I had each of the tacos in the taqueria menu- fish, pork, carne asada and veggie. Mmmm mmmm good! The fish was fresh and light, the pork melted in my mouth, the carne asada had a heavenly marinade, and the veggies were so fresh!

This place was so fantastic I've come back two more time in a 36 hour span! The second time around, I tried the guacamole- truly the best I've ever had. The last time I went, I had the salad. You should know that you can ask for any meat on the salad, even though it's not listed that way on the menu. Phenomenal salad- one of the best I've had (I know I've said that a lot but for this place it's not hyperbole). 

Already looking forward to my fourth visit tomorrow!
