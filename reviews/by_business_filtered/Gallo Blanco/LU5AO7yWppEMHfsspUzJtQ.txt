No reflection on the kitchen at all, good food every time I've been here so far.
But! Service, is seriously lacking from a few foh members. From the hostess tonight who  wasn't very helpful, to bartenders who took 11minutes to pour 3beers when they're not busy at all, to sitting amidst an un bussed table full of empty glasses and elbow sticking booze residue for over an hour! Are you kidding me.
Some foh staff seem more concerned with how trendy their outfits are than looking out for their clientele.
Seriously Gallo, get your foh as good as the kitchen and 2 star reviews won't happen.
