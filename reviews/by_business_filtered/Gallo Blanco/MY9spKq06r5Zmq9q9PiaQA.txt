Considering that this place is supposed to be a high class Mexican restaurant I was pretty disappointed. Not many places have chilaquiles on their menu. This place has it but it's nowhere near any authentic chilaquiles I've had. The food is very fancy, but it lacked in flavor and authenticity. The guacamole was not completely disappointing but I wouldn't come back to have it again. The agua fresca is definitely also better at Ranch Market. My niece ordered quesadillas from the kids menu and she got two small corn tortillas with cheese in it and was still hungry afterwards.
