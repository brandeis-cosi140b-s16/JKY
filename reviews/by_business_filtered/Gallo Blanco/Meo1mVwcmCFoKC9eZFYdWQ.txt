Great breakfast. A friend of mine is a pancake connoisseur and says they have the best pancake he has ever had. I will say I've had better chilaquiles, but their other Mexican food is great! Excellent lunches. They let you mix and match tacos so you can try a lot of different things. All the beverages Ive tried, from tea, to coffee (which they get from a local roaster), to cocktails like margaritas are very tasty. The only real negative is how popular the place is. Parking is limited so it can be a challenge to actually get in.
