So I've only been here once, but DEFINITELY plan on coming back soon! I came to the Clarendon on NYE for their big party. I got to the hotel early I could enjoy dinner with a couple friends.
I unfortunately got their a bit late so I missed the queso cicherone and guac which I heard were amazing. I had some sangria to drink and it was great. It was like drinking punch. We split some soft tacos which we intended to have as appetizers, but they were sssoooo good we ordered many more and had them as our meal. 
We first ordered a few each of the pork belly, carnitas and carne asada tacos. They were so good but our favorite was definitely the carne asada. Perfectly seasoned and cooked they needed nothing more than a dab of their spiciest salsa for a little extra oomph. I could have eaten them all day, but alas we had some partying to do.
Another important aspect to any meal is the quality of service and the service here was definitely great!
I can't wait to come back
