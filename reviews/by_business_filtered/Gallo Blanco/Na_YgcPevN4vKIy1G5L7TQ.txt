Came for breakfast. Have to say, the bloody Mary's are very flavorful! Citrus with a good amount of flavor spice, and not too thick/filling; served with jicama, olive, celery, lemon, and lime. Probably one of our favorite bloody Mary's. We had a 10am reservation, and we were seated around 10:15. The restaurant was quite busy. We placed our order around 10:30. Food came around 11. The meals were well prepared. The chilaquiles were my favorite! Very savory with chicken, vegetables, and an egg over easy on top. Torta bread was fluffy and delicious. Tortillas were great. All the produce was very fresh. Presentation for some of our meals (burritos, chorizo breakfast) was a little lacking,  but that doesn't take away from the flavor. In the end, everyone in our 7 person party was happy!
