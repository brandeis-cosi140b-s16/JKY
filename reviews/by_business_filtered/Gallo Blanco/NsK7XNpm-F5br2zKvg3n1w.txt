I just discovered this place today and it was really nice.  Very comfortable, and relaxed.  My friends and I sat and talked for 3 hours and it was very homey with cute couches and chairs.  The art was unique, and same with the decor.  

I had the Margaretta, and I could easily tell it was fresh, with pulp in the drink.  Fantastic and only $5 with happy hour.  The guacamole was great quality, and very fresh.  

I had the ahi tuna, shrimp and carne astada tacos, and they reminded me of this great place I found in Rocky Point.  

I got a glimpse of the pool area and it looks very trendy and fun, I will be going back when the weather warms up.

Definitely a great place to go, relax, and eat quality food.
