This restaurant scares me. I lost 45 pounds and i can see it coming back real fast. LOl. I used to live right across the street and am so glad I don't anymore-hahahaha. i have eaten here twice and all the things I have eaten are the bomb! What stands out is the corn app, the guacamole is the  best I have had in a restaurant, and the Carne Aasda taquitas and torta! i also loved the platano crepes. The restaurant itself is kind of ugly and was dirty the first time i went and the service is a bit lacking but the food is not! Enjoy!
