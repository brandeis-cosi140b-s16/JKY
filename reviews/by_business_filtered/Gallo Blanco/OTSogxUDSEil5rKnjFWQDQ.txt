Came here after work with friends for happy hour.  Specials were good.. but the drinks were kind of weak.  The agua fresca alcoholic drink was not consistent (and I'm not a fan), and the sangria was not the best I've had.  I did taste an horchata alcoholic drink that was tasty.

The carne asada tacos were not carne asada.  Seems like they tried to make korean beef tacos and marinated it with too much soy sauce.  The octopus taco special was cooked well, but lacked a bit of seasoning and could've had more filling in the taco.  The pork was actually pretty good (first on the menu).  Also had the pork quesadillas - would recommend a try.  The guacamole was interesting (had pieces of fruit in it). 

All in all, I think I'd go back for the happy hour.  The specials are nice, I just have to find a good drink in there..
