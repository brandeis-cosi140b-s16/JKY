Hands down, this place has the best fish tacos to ever cross my lips when I was not within spitting distance of the ocean.  Grilled, fresh fish, with a really tasteful guacamole, sauce, and just the right amount of cabbage.

Tortas are pretty good, too - their vegetarian torta is actually good - stuffed to the brim with a variety of veggies, instead of the usual lechuga-aguacate-tomate nightmare.

GB's french fries, surprisingly, are incredible.  You get a big plate of fresh fries, with a delectable garlic aioli.  Aioli seems to be one of those things these days - like the panini a few years ago - where people try to pretend they are classy by throwing some garlic in some mayo and calling it aioli, but this aioli actually kicks.

Ditto for the quesadillas.  Perfection!

Horchata here is housemade (I believe), and isn't the sugar-water that so many of us love from Rancho or Filly B's - it's good, but if you want something sweet to swig, go for one of their smoothies, instead, which are fresh and delicious.
