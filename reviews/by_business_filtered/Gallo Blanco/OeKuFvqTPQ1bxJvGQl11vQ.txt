Went for the first time last night with another couple and all four of us just LOVED the food - was delicious! The Carne Asado is outstanding!  We had excellent service and the decor is very fun and hip. Will definitely be going back and hopefully sooner than later.  Probably the best Mexican food in town with some very unique flavors and and dishes. Would strongly recommend.
