I am obsessed with this place. I'm not sure if it's the amazing food, the cool vibe or the history of the Don Bolles incident....or a combination of all three.  I love the guacamole and street tacos.  The Micheladas are bomb too!  I love GB ! My only complaint is the last couple times I've been the wait was over 45 minutes - I've been going to GB for years and never had to wait!
