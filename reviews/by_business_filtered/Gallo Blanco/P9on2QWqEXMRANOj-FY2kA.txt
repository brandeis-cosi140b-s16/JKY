I ate here two nights in a row while staying at the Clarendon Hotel.  The first night I enjoyed the sea bass tacos, which were filled with fresh fish, avocado and lime.  Simple and delicious.  The service at the bar was a little underwhelming - nice, but slow, however I think they were slammed unexpectedly on a Tuesday night. 

The next night service was much more on track, with a very helpful waitress.   I tried their other tacos: Cohinita (pork), carne asada beef, and shrimp.  Of the three, the shrimp might have been my favorite, but I'm a sucker for marinated and grilled shrimp.  The Cochinita was tasty but not the most tender.  The beef was better than the pork, with plenty of tender shredded beef.  

A house margarita made with fresh lime juice was the perfect accompaniment to them, and the tres leche cake was the perfect ending.
