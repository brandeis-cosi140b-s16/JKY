Naco Torta +  Kale Salad = Satisfaction Guaranteed. This is more than enough for 2 people.  This place is one of the best values in central Phoenix. 

Service can be a bit slow, and lack luster, but the food gets a solid 5 stars

Gallo also comes to the rescue on Wednesday nights with free Flamenco entertainment. It's pretty special...
