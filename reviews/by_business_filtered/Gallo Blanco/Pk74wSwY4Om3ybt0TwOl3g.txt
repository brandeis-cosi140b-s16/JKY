I've been coming here for 2.5 years or so and now regularly eat there 1-2 times a week (sometimes more). I'm not a huge active Yelp-er but thought that I should finally give this place a review since it's well past due.

First off, their guacamole is amazing. They make it with orange instead of the usual lime, which is the first time I've even heard that people do that. Delicious. Don't think I've ever gone here once without ordering at least 1 bowl of guacamole.

I usually try to stop by around happy hour. They have great deals and their tacos are usually $1.50-2.50 each and are absolutely delicious. Love the carne asada and cochinitas tacos the best, although their ahi tuna ones are great as well.

However, if you don't want tacos they have great tortas, chilaquiles and especially their carne asada burrito.

I kind of want to go there again tonight (even though I was there last night). :)
