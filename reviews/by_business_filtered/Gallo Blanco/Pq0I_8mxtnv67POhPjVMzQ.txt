yay, way cool happy hour. first off, very cool outdoor decor. i really like the Clarendon hotel. 

we went specifically for the taco's, but wound up with much more. after 3 tacos each-around 1.50-2.50(one veggie, one shrimp, one fish), we decided to munch on some chips and delicious salsa-3 bucks. then my girl got the salad-6 bucks, and i got the goddam corn on the cob with cheese and paprika-4 bucks. i could've eaten a dozen of these suckers.

we topped it off with the chocolate pudding, fluff, and graham cracker desert and a margarita. does any of this stuff go together? not in the order we ate it, but it was delicious. there are lots of meat options as well and their regular menu looked downright superb...even have shrimp and grits! mmm....love me some grits.

great happy hour, great atmosphere, and great service!
