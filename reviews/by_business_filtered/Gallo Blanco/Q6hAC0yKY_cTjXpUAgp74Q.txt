This place is pretty tasty. The menu has a modern twist on your traditional Mexican food, but in a good way.  It was a Saturday at about 2PM, and we noticed a lot of people were eating breakfast (served all day), which made us think maybe that was their specialty, but we were in the mood for lunch. We started off with chips and guacamole.  They added mandarin oranges (or tangerines, not quite sure) to the standard mix... it was excellent, probably the best guac I have ever tasted!  I had the veggie tacos and mashed pinto beans.  The veggies were seasoned and marinated perfectly, and the beans were pretty good but a little dry.   My Bf had the Carne Asada burrito and he was in heaven.  The restaurant is actually located in a hotel lobby, which I wasn't expecting, so we passed it twice! The menu isn't huge and the atmosphere is casual and just so, so, but the food was fantastic.  We will definitely go back, next time we're in the neighborhood... and maybe give the breakfast a shot!
