After a year I thought I would try to see if anything got better.... I did NOT. My food was cold. I had to get my own chili sauce since the waiters were doing nothing,  cause it wasn't even that busy. Took forever to just get my sprite in the first place too.  Won't return. Horrible service and cold meat.
