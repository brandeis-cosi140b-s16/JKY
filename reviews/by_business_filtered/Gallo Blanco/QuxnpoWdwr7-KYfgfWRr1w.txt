I joined a group of friends last night for dinner at Gallo Blanco, this being the first time for a few of us. When we first arrived, we were told it would be a 35-40 minute wait for a table of 6. We were totally fine getting a drink from the bar and chillin by the pool. However, after 1.5 hours of waiting we began to get a little impatient and when checking on our table status, the hostess informed us that there were only 2 tables in the restaurant that could seat 6 people and they were just waiting on a party to leave.
As we waited for another 30 minutes and were debating on going somewhere else, the hostess came over and told us there was a table open and it would be just a few minutes. It took about another 15 minutes to get seated as they had figured out they could combine a table of 4 with a table of 2.
We quickly ordered our food and I had ordered 1 shrimp taco and a side of guacamole and chips. After our table had received our order, I had still not gotten my side of guac and chips. When I asked about it, the server asked me if I was sure I had ordered it because they had delivered guac and chips to the table once - which my friends had ordered. Several more minutes go by and our waitress came to check in and I asked about my guac and chips again. After a lengthy conversation of clarifying what I had ordered, a side of guacamole was delivered to me, without chips. It took another few minutes to get the chips to go with my guacamole.
The service was extremely frustrating which definitely spoiled my experience. However, I have nothing bad to say about the food - it was excellent.
