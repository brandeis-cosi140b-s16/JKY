So I finally got a chance to check out Gallo Blanco. I live in the area, but there's SOOOO many good places to eat around here I just hadn't made it in yet. Sad, yes I know.

I read a piece in the newspaper today about the Pollo Asado and was thinking about that all day, but ended up going with the torta with pork, chiles and avocado. What a great torta, one of my favorites!  I wish the bread was toasted, but that's probably a personal taste.  I also ordered the Elote and a green cantaloupe agua fresca, which were both great. I thought the elote was a bit steep at 4 bucks, but it was very very good. Overall, I got a good takeout meal for about 17 bucks (with tax and tip). I'm excited to have such high caliber tortas this close to my house.
