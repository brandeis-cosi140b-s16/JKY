Busy for a Sunday evening out so that was a good sign. Hip vibe but not pretentious or "too cool" vibe. Note, you can order to go and take your meal to the rooftop of the hotel to which it's attached. We had a friendly server but did get lost in the shuffle towards the end of our meal. However, it got slammed when we were wrapping up our meal and do not begrudge the servers for that. The food was excellent. 

The guac was chunky with a more citrus flavor. Tacos were a great spin on street tacos. I had a fish, a shrimp and a carne asada. The carne was crisp and then chewy. The shrimp had just enough kick. The fish was tilapia that night and that was citrisuy and had a bit of avocado for a refreshing flavor. The elote as an app was deliciously bad for you as it should be. Our party of three shared the elote as we just wanted a taste, but this is easily edible for one hungry person. Our friend had the chicken burrito which was ginormous. If we had room, I would've stayed to try dessert. Good for parties up to 8 people.
