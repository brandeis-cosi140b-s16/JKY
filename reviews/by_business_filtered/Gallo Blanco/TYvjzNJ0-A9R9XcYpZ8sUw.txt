Came here yet again for happy hour and to check out some flamenco dancing (they offer it every Wednesday evening) and it was beyond amazing. The sangria was so-so ... a little too sweet for my taste. 

I stuck to my jack and cokes... and was truly moved by the flamenco performances. The place was packed - so if you want to check out the dancing come around 630 or so. Made me proud to live in the southwest. Ole!!!!
