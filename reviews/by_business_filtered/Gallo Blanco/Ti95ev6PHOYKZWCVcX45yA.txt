Really happy we decided to try this place for dinner tonight. We're staying at the Clarendon, so when we were told it was a 20 minute wait we went up to the room and they texted us when our table was ready, which I thought was super convenient. 

Guacamole was great, as we expected. The shrimp tacos were out of this world.. Very delicious. I would come back just for those. They were out of flan so we got an ice cream brownie for dessert which was okay. All the servers were really nice. 
Overall a pleasant experience.
