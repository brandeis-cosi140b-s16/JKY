Really solid.  I got the fruit / jicama salad with lime and chile, which was excellent; 2 tacos (shrimp and carne assada) which was also really good; and a small bowl of pozole, which was... you guessed it... super yum.  Fresh, local, everything made there.  

Good service, and the Margarita was good too.
