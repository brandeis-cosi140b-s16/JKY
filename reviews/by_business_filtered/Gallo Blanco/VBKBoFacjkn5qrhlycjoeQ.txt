A very disappointing experience. We walked in to find no hostess or wait staff in sight. After walking around and finding no hostess station, we eventually sat ourselves at the only open (dirty) table.

A waiter told us we shouldn't have sat down and might have to move, but then later allowed us to remain there. I then ordered a Michelada and he "corrected" my pronunciation (naturally, he was pronouncing it incorrectly). The drink was great though.

Ordering dinner, I asked for the chilaquiles and he said, "what?" When I pointed to it on the menu, he again wrongly "corrected" my pronounciation, adding, "nice try though." Again, he gave a strange gringo pronunciation that doesn't exist in Spanish and walked off. 

We got guacamole, assorted tacos, cheely-keelies (as he called them), all of which were good, but not great. Drinks weren't re-filled and another server tried to clear my place while my plate was still half-full. We were thinking about ordering dessert when our waiter dropped off the check. Since they were in such a hurry to turn tables, I obliged them.

Whew. Gotta do better than that Gallo Blanco.
