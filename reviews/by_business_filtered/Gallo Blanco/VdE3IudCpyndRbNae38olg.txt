Gallo Blanco is one of my favorite spots in Phoenix.  Where to begin.  The guacamole is to die for.  It has little chunks of citrus in it, and while I initially thought, "that doesn't sound very good," Gallo Blanco's version is on my top five list of favorite guacamole recipes.  It is delicious!  

I have been for lunch and dinner, trying the yummy tacos and the huge bowl of posole, which is amazing.  But, my favorite time to visit Gallo was for breakfast.  The chicken chilaquilles are fantastic, and the steak and eggs are amazing.  The food is extremely consistent, and if you love sangria, you definitely need to give it a try.  

The only reason that I did not give this five stars is because the service (for me) has been hit or miss.  Most of the time, it is amazing, but there have been times where I have walked out somewhat disappointed with the service (and I am not a high maintenance, demanding customer, so it takes a lot to bother me).  But, it never prevented me from going back again and again and again....
