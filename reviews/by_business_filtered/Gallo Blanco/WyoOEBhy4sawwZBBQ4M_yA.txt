Waaaay overdue to visit this place. Stopped by on a way to a show at the Phoenix Theater, and had a short but tasty time.

Sipped a margarita and devoured a bowl of their guacamole to start things off, then moved to some chicken chilaquiles. Was NOT expecting it to be that big, and sadly left a bunch of them behind. Not for lack of trying, however.

All fresh ingredients and a fun atmosphere in the always entertaining Hotel Claremont. Service was also exceptional, and had a fun chat with all of the very attentive people who took care of us. Will definitely return soon.
