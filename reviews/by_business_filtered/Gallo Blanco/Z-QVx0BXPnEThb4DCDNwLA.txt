I was never expecting to enjoy this place so much when I stayed at the Clarendon Hotel. Every time I visited phoenix, I had to stop here for breakfast before I went out and did anything. EVERYDAY. Not kidding. Really nice servers, and the prices are decent. Not to mention, every time I have ordered, nothing tasted pre-made or not fresh. I am a big fan, and I support Gallo Blanco and tell all my friends to try it for brunch if they are in phoenix. I put the verde salsa on everything! ha ha.
