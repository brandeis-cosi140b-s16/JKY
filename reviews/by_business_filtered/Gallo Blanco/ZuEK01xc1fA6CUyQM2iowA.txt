Ooh my goodness! The food? Delicious. The service? Fantastic. Sangria? Yes please!

I ate here with the family for my mom's birthday. We all had a bunch of items from the happy hour menu and were stuffed. 

The only thing that could be improved is if they let the sangria soak a bit more. The fruit tasted like it could have used a couple more hours in the mix. 

Other than that, I can't say anything bad about it.
