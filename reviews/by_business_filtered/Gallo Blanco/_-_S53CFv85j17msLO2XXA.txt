I almost started giving up on finding healthy options in Phoenix, until I found this place. The fish is flown in daily, the vegetables are locally sourced and organic. The Yelp category is Mexican but this is not your usual "Tex-Mex" cuisine  - menu is filled with Tortas, grilled fish, and other Mexican dishes not typically found on a menu of a typical Mexican restaurant in US. 

The restaurant is located at the end of a non-descript street facing a parking lot, but don't let that sway you. Inside, it felt modern (concrete) and the wait staff extremely friendly.

I'm definitely coming back here!!
