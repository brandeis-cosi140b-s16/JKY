So, I got together with some friends on Friday for a LONG overdue catchup....there were 3 of us and the joint was jumpin at 6pm.  My buddy Debbie is a huge fan of the french fries and ordered them for starters.  Steve and I shared the fried cheese...this stuff is so good, I am still talking about it!  Later, we had tacos and pollo...I didn't taste their food but both of my tacos were really delicious.  I think shrimp is my favorite and am excited about trying it again.  The evening was enhanced by the addition of a beer/bloody mary combo.  I like this place a lot but would suggest the hostess get some training in working with impatient crowds...they were kind of a bummer, but nothing unforgiveable. (OUR waiter was fabulous!)  Can't wait to sit outside when it's cool enough!
