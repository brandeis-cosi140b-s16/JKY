Ahh yeah, the White Rooster is soo good. I've been here a few times now and love it. Visited tonight and brought some family and friends, everyone loved it. Let me see if I can remember some of the drinks and dishes that were ordered. 

I'll start with me, I had to have the grilled corn appetizer, which I absolutely love (grilled corn on the cob with mexican cheese and smoked paprika) and a few tacos, carne asada and orange marinated pork - pretty freekin good. My husband ordered the chilaquiles, he thought they tasted really fresh and light. There was also an ahi tuna that looked good, some sort of mexican hamburger and a carne asada torta - reported as being pretty tasty. There were also four salsas to choose from, a good variety of spiciness and flavors, all fresh.

We also had a few drinks, started with the fresh squeezed margarita (yay) and then moved on to the paloma: tequila, grapefruit, soda and fresh lime. I don't usually like grapefruit, but this was fresh and delicious! 

We ended with the flaaaaaaan, caramel, oh yeah, with a single cute birthday candle in it. 

Love the interior, rustic and cool, everyone got a kick out of the mens urinals and Dyson hand dryers. The only problem is it's noisy, I noticed this last few times I was there and tonight with 10 people it was even harder to hear, even a foot away, luckily we are a loud bunch. 

Overall, fresh, tasty and we also got good service. Thanks Gallo!
