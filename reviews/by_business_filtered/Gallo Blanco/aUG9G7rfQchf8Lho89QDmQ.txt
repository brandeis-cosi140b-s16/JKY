I went to Gallo Blanco Cafe for lunch and the food was amazing! They have five kinds of tacos and I tried all of them.  They were all healthy and delicious!  My favorite one was shrimp.  The shrimp tasted really fresh and it was grilled just right.  I also tried their freshly squeezed lemonade. It was pretty tart and I liked it a lot.  The pricing was reasonable as well. 

I would definitely go back again!
