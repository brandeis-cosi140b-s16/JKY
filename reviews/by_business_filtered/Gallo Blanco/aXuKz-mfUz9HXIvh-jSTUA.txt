Gallo Blanco is one of my favorite places in Phoenix. Great food, drinks, atmosphere and service. Plus they have Flamenco dancers on Wednesday nights, which is so fun to watch. I haven't had anything I didn't like here, but would definitely recommend the roasted chicken, the chilequiles and the tacos. Also, start out with the citrus guacamole! For drinks, go for the salty dog or screwdriver, they used fresh squeezed juice and its so good. I don't have a single bad thing to say about Gallo Blanco, except that I wish it was closer to my house!
