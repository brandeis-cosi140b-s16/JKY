Great Service, Excellent Food, Good Beer, Great Coffee, and its falling distance from where I live. Its hard not to just love the hell out of this place so I don't.

Walked in for lunch and was greeted warmly and quickly. Asked for recommendations and the Tacos came my way with Chips and Guacamole. The beer was deliciousness and I see that Cartel provides the coffee.
