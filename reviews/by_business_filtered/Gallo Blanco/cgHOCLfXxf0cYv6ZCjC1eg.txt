So, got a tip from a friend that I really needed to check this place out, so we headed over for dinner with friends after Ignite Phoenix. I kind of wanted to go some place else and wound up being S glad my friend picked this place :)

When we pulled up I thought "oh Im so not in the mood for "nice" (ie expensive hotel restaurant" (its inside the Clarendon), I was tired and not dressed for it. I was pleasantly surprised that the place looked very nice but has a really comfortable, super low key vibe. The service was really good, our waiter was very friendly and he didn't make fun of me when I tried order the side of corn (Elote Callejero. yeah, you say it). Anyway, the food was awesome- they do breakfast all day so I got huevos rancheros which were really good. The side of refried beans was ok, about what you'd expect, but. the. corn. Oh my. It was heavenly- its an ear of grilled corn sprinkled with paprika and piled high with coija cheese. It was sooo good. 

We finished the meal with the Crepas, or banana crepes, which were really nice, the crepes were very good! Everything right down to the chips and salsa were very good, and we will definitely be back. By the way, the price was very reasonable, before the tip, we paid about $35 for our half of the appetizer, 2 meals, a soda, 2 beers, 2 side dished and dessert. do it.
