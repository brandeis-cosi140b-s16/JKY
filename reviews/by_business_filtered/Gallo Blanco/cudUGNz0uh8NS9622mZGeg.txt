The pancakes would be a 5, but the breakfast burrio would be a 3 and the breakfast torta a 4 so I averaged it out to a 4 star.  A very cute little place and you have to try the pancakes for breakfast.  You can order just 1 if you want, perfect for those of you with something else in mind but still have to try the 5 star highly recommended pancakes!!!!
