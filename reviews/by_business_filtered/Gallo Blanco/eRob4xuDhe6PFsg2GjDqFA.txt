I stopped by here to grab a bite and to geek out on the computer with the famous Dallas Gold.

The first thing that catches you about the Clarendon Hotel is that it doesn't strike you as a posh place so your expectations are immediately pulled down to the level where you're hoping the lobby has at least one light bulb in it.

Once you step into the place and wander over to the Gallo Blanco Cafe, you quickly realize that this place is the bee's knees, the cat's pajamas, the morning pee, the end of the year bonus, the first drink of happy hour, the first night your newborn sleeps all the way through the night...  it's so wonderful, it makes you want to go outside and share with complete strangers the near-orgasmic experience you just had eating in the cafe...

I started off with a fresh cantaloupe fruit drink and I immediately thought to myself - WHY DON'T I DRINK THIS ALL THE TIME??  Orange juice is soooo... just orange juice!  

Then the sandwich came.  I have to be honest, I didn't put much thought into ordering and nonchalantly ordered the Naco Torta because it was the first thing listed under the sandwich section of the one page menu.  I was pleasantly surprised.  

The bread was wondeful.  Soft but not so soft the bread flpped back over itself.  Beveled a bit too so it was easy to take the first bite.  The meat was cut up into small pieces to ease the dining experience and the combination of flavors of the avocado slices, the egg, the beef, the whatever else was in my sandwich was unbelievable.  

The service was uber helpful and various waiters/waitresses swung by the table to see if we were ok.  

Overall, a very cool place to check out if you're near Indian School and 4th ave.  Do yourself and your friends a favor and swing on by to grab a bite.
