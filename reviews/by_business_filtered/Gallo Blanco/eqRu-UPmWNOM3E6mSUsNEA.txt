Strike the background music by the Commodores, "Three Times a Lady"..."yes, you're once, twice, THREE times a laaaady. And I loooove youuuuu!" Yep. After C4. After The Clarendon Kitchen. We now have Gallo Blanco. And I am muy happy about this. The carne asada tacos are heavenly! Perfectly seasoned and served in the cutest taco rack. I'm now combing every William Sonoma to find these puppies. Our mango fresco juice beverage thingie was so refreshing I wanted to jump right in! Rickie said the roasted chicken was succulent. Ok. So he didn't say succulent. I think yummy was the word. The decor is modern and comfortable. I love how they really opened up the room. It is light, airy and has great views. Including our bedroom window...ooops...maybe I shouldn't have mentioned that. OMG. We just confirmed our trip to Disney World! Gotta go! Oh. Eat here. NOW!
