The highlight was definitely the Picoso (a muddled cocktail with pineapple infused reposed, lime and jalape√±o -- like holy wow my face off, yeah? It was hard not to order them one right after another, but I was responsible and cut it off after the first one :)

Decent food -- the guac seemed fresh, my carna asada taco and cochinita taco were pretty yummy and my husband's chicken bowl was decent.

 The wait was about 30 min for lunch. Service was pretty slow, apparently the kitchen was backed up.
