It was really good. Kinda expensive for lunch cost me $31 for two people including tip and tax.  All we drank was water.  I wish that chips and salsa were free $3.50 kinda disappointing and the sandwiches/tortas don't come with any sides.  Fun hip place I scored brownie points with the wife on this one.
