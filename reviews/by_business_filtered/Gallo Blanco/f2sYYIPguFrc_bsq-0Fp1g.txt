3.5 stars. 

My biggest gripe about Gallo Blanco is the service. It's been incredibly slow and inattentive each time I've eaten here. I just end up grabbing more plates/utensils/napkins from the service bar myself because we're rarely checked on. We also wait forever after being seated for orders to be taken, long enough to be irritated and flag down bussers (who are awesome) to find our servers. 

HOWEVER, I like the atmosphere of this place. It's cozy, casual, and fun. There's a neat patio on the roof that should be utilized more...they can pack your food in plastic trays to bring up. The food items are hit or miss. These are not the best tacos in the world. I find most of the meats too dry. Shrimp is the way to go but you'll ask yourself, "Where's all the shrimp?" when it arrives. Gauc is pretty good and they have some interesting mixed drinks to try.
