Have not been here for quite a while, still very busy for lunch. The restaurant part is very nice but the hotel is kind if sketchy. Favorite items are the Naco Torta, Carna Asado Street Taco and the Guacomole with chips. Don't remember the grilled ribeye on the Naco Torta being sliced up so small, I prefer it in larger strips as before. Still one my favorite places to eat and take out of town guest for something with the unique taste of AZ. Not the normal Mexican Food, has a lot more character.
