Had dinner here recently and already can't wait to go back. We had the guacamole and queso with chorizo and both were good. I usually love the guacamole but tonight  (it was last Thursday) it was a little too chunky. It was also missing the usual tang from the fruit. It was still great, but I've had better (yes, that's what she said). 

We then ordered an assortment of tacos which were all delicious. My favorite was the pork and I am literally salivating at the thought of them. The were perfect with just a hint of sweet. Pure heaven! Plus the margaritas were spot on and the service was friendly.
