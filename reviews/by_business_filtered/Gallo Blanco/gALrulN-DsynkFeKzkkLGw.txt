I went to Gallo Blanco for lunch durinig a meeting. LOVED IT. We walked from Central and Clarendon, it wasn't bad, just down Clarendon and you won't miss it. 

The food AMAZING. I got a Carne torta and the special of the day was a 1/2 torta and a salad. YUMMY. We also got Chips and Guac. So So good. 

I can't wait to take my dad there tonight :-)
