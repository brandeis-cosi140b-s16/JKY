headed to Gallo Blanco today after church for lunch. Horchata -- yummy. Great beers on draft. Had ahi taco (good) and carne asada taco (to DIE for --- had another) while waiting for conchinita torta. The torta was totally outstanding with smoky, spicy meat with citrus action, interesting salsa and creamy avocado. had the crepas with bananas and cajeta for lunch. service was friendly and well-paced but the food, oh the food...we will be back soon.
