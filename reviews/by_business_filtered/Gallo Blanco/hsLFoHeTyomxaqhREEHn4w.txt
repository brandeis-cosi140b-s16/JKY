Love, LOVE this restaurant. From the fact that they use local growers and meats, healthy ingredients, and recycled materials to decorate... to the nitty gritty: the taste of the food... this is for the price, hands down the best Mexican in Phoenix.

Try the Naco Torta with a margarita. Absolutely divine. The carne asada has a sweet finish that melds so well with the hot salsa, you'll be having dreams about it.  Also deserving honorable mention is the ceviche. I have tried ceviche at every well-reviewed restaurant in Phoenix, and El Gallo's consistently comes out on top. The shrimp is uber fresh and perfectly seasoned - just the right amount of fresh lime and garlic. Huge chunks of crunch and fresh avocado - outstanding. 

The guacamole is also fantastic. I like to squirt a drop of El Gallo's home made table salsas on each scoop for an extra bang. But it's not needed as this guac is bursting with flavor.

I've had excellent service on several occasions at El Gallo - some of the wait staff are truly top shelf, have the menu and all ingredients fully committed to memory, and care enough to describe and recommend. It's like getting 5 star service for a meal that will cost you less than $30 - ridiculous! Don't waste your time with other Mexican food in the valley - this is the ONE.
