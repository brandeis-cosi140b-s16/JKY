Their tacos are delicious ! This is a good place for some really good tacos for lunch and cocktails for dinner. I take away one star because this place can get very loud and the fact that they do not have many options for chicken dishes (for the wifey). On the pricier side. Their shrimp tacos and their fish tacos are delicious !
