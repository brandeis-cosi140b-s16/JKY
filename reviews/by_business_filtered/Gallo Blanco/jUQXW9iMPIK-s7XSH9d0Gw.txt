Very kitschy cool. Perhaps too cool for itself at times. But the food was awesome! We went for a late dinner on a recent Friday night. The place was still crowded with a 30-45 minute wait for a table. Not a problem- we got some well mixed cocktails, did some people watching, and checked out the art on the walls. We got all of the tacos on the regular menu, and then two more off the daily specials. The low point was the halibut that just didn't work for me, the high point was the special of the day- an octopus taco that was just fabulous! The waiter was mostly attentive, but he was running ragged- at one point I was pretty sure I saw him plating food in the kitchen. We will definitely be back.
