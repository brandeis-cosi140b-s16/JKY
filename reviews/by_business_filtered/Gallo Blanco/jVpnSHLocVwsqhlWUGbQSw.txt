Wow, I am amazed at how such an amazing, chic, cute, and inviting place like this can be in downtown Phoenix, no offense. The Phoenix area continues to surprise me with these little gems that are full of delicious food, yummy drinks, pretty people, chic decor, and for this one, an amazing pool and deck! 

So, my co-organizer called in to make reservations for my East Coast Foodies group the day before for their Sunday happy hour. I walked in earlier than the rest of the group, the girl found our reservations and went to prepare our table. As she did that I walked outside to the amazing pool and people watched. As the rest of the party arrived, so did the waitress with our menus in hand waiting to direct us to our pretty table on the patio!

I am impressed! Everyone was professional, funny, prompt, and informative when it came to my questions about drinks and food! Their happy hour prices were very wallet/purse friendly.

The drinks were refreshing, cheap (during happy hour), and quite strong. I love love love love love this place and may make it my after church on Sunday event at least twice a month.

The tacos, grilled corn covered in delish Mexican topping, cilantro rice, etc. were all delectable.

I only thing that annoyed us were the flies that were trying to share our meals.

Go here, do a little dance, drink several drinks, and eat their citrus shredded pork, or shrimp tacos, and think of me!

Cheers
