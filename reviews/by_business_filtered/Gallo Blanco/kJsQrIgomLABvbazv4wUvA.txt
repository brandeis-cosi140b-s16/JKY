Carne asada tacos were nasty. I had to spit out chunks of fat numerous times.  Also, waitress was awful.   Overcharged our table, rolled eyes at our table, and manager acted like he cared, but seemed in on the crappy waitresses bs.  My friends and I will not return to this restaurant again due to overcharging us for crappy food and drinks, as well as the way they treated us.
