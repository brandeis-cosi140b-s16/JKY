Maybe it's that we showed up on a Sunday night, but I thought the food was lackluster. However highlights include the many salsas that arrived at the table, and the house made tortilla chips. The pork was dry/overcooked. The Shrimp and grits came highly recommend, but was just... Okay. They do sell pitchers of beer though!
