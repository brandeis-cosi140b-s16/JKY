Whenever there's a special occasion worth celebrating, we always default to this place. Why? That's because it feels like we're splurging even though we're really not. (Okay, okay, maybe "payday" isn't that special, but you get the idea.) All their specials are always delicious, there's nothing bad that we've ever had, and just the layering of flavors and the presentation is mouth-watering. We always get whatever fish taco they're having for that day, and maybe a torta, and always our staple elote corn and the guacamole. Price-wise, it's just right, and for what you get, it's quite the smoking deal. Love this place, and one of our go-to favorites.
