I took the fam here based off the photos other yelpers posted. Getting there was quick n easy considering its downtown, walked in to a 20 min wait, place was packed, so we had a couple drinks from the bar, bloody mary is what did me right, so good i had 2. finally sat down to eat, ordered the roasted corn, some guac with the chips, had all five of the tacos they serve, (pork one was my fav) enjoyed all of em even the veggie. my kids had a carne asada burrito each, they were nice sized burritos, mostly, a burrito is 90% tortilla n 9% of filling. yuck, not the white rooster, they hooked it up. after tasting the food. it was no wonder the place was packed on a tuesday nite, not to mention all day happy hour on tuesdays, woot!! this place is my new favorite place to chow n entertain taco-doodle doo!
