Came here after reading some positive reviews on Yelp.  This, without a doubt, was the worst experience I've encountered at a restaurant in ages. Nobody in charge of this place, server completely inexperienced and no support from anyone else, had to get up 3 times to get water for our table from bar, after chip bowls emptied, it was 15 min for refill, two of our guests had enchiladas (after asking if they were spicy and told "no, totally mild" they were unbearable to eat.  Server said "that's  unusual" and after we had to ask to just get a plain quesadilla (we had been here over an hour w no food) it took another 15 min for cheese quesadilla. They charged us for the full meals (even though we ended up w a $2.00 appetizer) and server sends manager over to table who responds to our question of why are we being charged for meals we never ate with "you have a problem?...that's how they come". Unreal.  Would never return to this place.  It's one thing to have an inexperienced server but it is inexcusable to have the manager who takes the attitude that is absolutely not Customer focused.
