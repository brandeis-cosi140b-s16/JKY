Glad we drove over from the PHX airport for dinner. The place is located next to/inside the Clarendon hotel. Upscale Mexican fare, very nice hip ambiance with a fantastic live band tonight. The food is very fresh and looks like is also locally sourced. 

Drinks: The margaritas are not super strong but still very delicious. I got the AZ margarita, and could taste the prickly pear in there. Usually not a big fan of margaritas due to it usually being too acidic for me; but these were just the right balance of sweet and sour. Husband got a dark beer, also solid. 

Food: we got the cotija corn and guacamole for apps. The corn was BOMB, I tell you. It was the star of this meal, not to be missed. A simple dish that we will probably make for at home bbqs in the future, but nonetheless exquisitely executed here at gallo blanco. The guacamole was good and fresh but nothing too special. 
For mains i got the carnitas, carne, and tilapia tacos. All very good but carnitas were me favourite. Nice smokey flavor and very tender and juicy. Carne Assad was a close second, also packed with flavor. Husband got pollo asado, which was also very flavorful and fall off the bone tender. 

Overall the dining experience here was fantastic. Our server was also humorous and just the right amount of attentiveness. Would definitely come again if in the Phoenix area.
