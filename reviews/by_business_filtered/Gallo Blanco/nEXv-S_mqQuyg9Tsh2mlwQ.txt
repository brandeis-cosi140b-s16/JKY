I convinced my family to eat at this place (before trying it) when we drove to Phoenix to visit my cousin, so felt a weird sort of pressure eating here... 


***disclaimer: vegetarian rating***




Ingredients are fresh, and it's nice that they make a conscious effort to support local farms.  I ordered the vegetable taco, grilled corn, and an order of fries.  The way that the tacos are brought out was a little awkward, as multiple tacos are tightly fitted in a silver taco tray, and the wait staff have you pluck out your choice as it's brought around.  Mine seemed to have been stuck in the tray somehow, and I ended up leaving a heap of the fillings behind before I finally got it into my plate, but anyway, it was fine... I'm not big on certain grilled vegetables (zucchini, squash, chunks of corn), and wished that it had been a simple traditional taco with beans instead of meat, but still... it was light and the seasonings were good.  The corn on the cob was really good, and something I'd like to eat again, as were the fries, which came with a really great dipping sauce.

I also ordered the agua fresco, which was honeydew, I believe.  Very, very nice.  Refreshing.  

All things considered, I'd give this place a 3.  Not my favorite Mexican eatery, by any means, but probably better if I ordered something with meat.
