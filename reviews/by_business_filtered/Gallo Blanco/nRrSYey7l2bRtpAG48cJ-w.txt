The tacos are awesome, and quite reasonable during happy hour. I prefer the beef and the veggie. I've had the shrimp a couple times and they are usually overcooked and a little rubbery. I like the pork, my friends didn't like them as much as I did. The fish tacos change with the fish that's currently available. A MUST try is the guacamole. Its a little pricey at $8 but only $5 during happy I think.
