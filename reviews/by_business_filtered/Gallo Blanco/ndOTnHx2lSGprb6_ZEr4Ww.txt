staying at the Clarendon, so came here for brekkie & happy hour.

no vegan options on the menu, but they will work with you... and without the heavy sigh or eyerolling.  had a perfectly delicious breakfast burrito that they whipped up.

drinks are delish.

I thought the service was good.

this place is a scene.  don your hippest attire, please :)
