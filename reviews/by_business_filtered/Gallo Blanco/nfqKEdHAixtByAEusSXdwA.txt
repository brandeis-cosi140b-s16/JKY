I had doubts... I mean c'mon, how good can it be? After a brunch with friends on a Sunday, I am a fan. 

We started with the chips and Guac. Pretty good! I could not decide on what to have - I saw the Chilaquiles Verdes go by on a plate and def had to have it. I also ordered the Steak and Eggs. When I finished ordering, the server looked at me and warned me that I had ordered alot of food... I smiled and said I was not scared.

Drinks - had a mediocre mimosa, but a great cup of coffee! 

The Chilaquiles Verdes (Chicken) was this 2 layers of crispy corn tortilla, the bottom with chicken, A rich green chili sauce an queso. The next layer with more queso and chili and an over easy egg! Delicious! 

The Steak and eggs were good too with the eggs over easy and a 5 oz sirloin steak cooked to order. Pretty plain if it did not have the Beens and Tortilas made fresh sop up the sweet green ranchero suace and cheese. It comes with beans, but I only eat gmas. 

I will order The Chilaquiles Verdes again for sure. But maybe get one of their taco or grilled items. 

Service - our server was OK, she got the food out but had to ask her a few times for water and refills. 

Atmosphere was pretty good. Good people watching... They had the patio doors open so the flies were a pain, but once someone near had food, they moved to them. 

Yes I will be back!
