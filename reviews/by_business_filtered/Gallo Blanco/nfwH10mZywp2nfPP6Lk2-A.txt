Attention, foodies!  This may be the best find I have ever made in Phoenix!  Dinner there last night was made from fresh, locally raised produce and meats.  The restaurant is inside the Hotel Clarendon just west of Central north of downtown.  We ate tapas and it included the best guacamole outside of my kitchen, corn on the cob with a steak knife to take the corn off the cob with, beef street tacos and more.  The menu is somewhat eclectic and that's what makes it so fun to try the chef's various dishes.  The seasonings and spices are nothing short of perfection.  I can't wait to take friends there!
