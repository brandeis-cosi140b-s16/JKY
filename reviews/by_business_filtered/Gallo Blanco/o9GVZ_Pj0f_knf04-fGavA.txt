I love how this restaurant uses local sources.  The menu however is very limited.  I really wished that there were more chicken items offered on the menu.  I did try the fish tacos and the arroz verde...very delicious!  The Madre, an orange vodka drink, was very refreshing and I could drink these all day!!!
