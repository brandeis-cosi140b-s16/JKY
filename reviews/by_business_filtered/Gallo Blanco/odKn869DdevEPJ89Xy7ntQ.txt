My friend introduced me to this place the other day and we happened to be there during happy hour. We both got margaritas - they were delicious! They are made with fresh squeezed juice and only cost $5! We also got chips with pico de gallo and guacamole. The guacamole was addicting...I couldn't stop eating it!  Who knew that adding mandarin orange segments to it could make it taste so good??
