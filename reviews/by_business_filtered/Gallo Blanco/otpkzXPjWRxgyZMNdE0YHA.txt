Gallo Blanco is a winner and the reviews below say as much. What I didn't see and wish to comment upon;

Pros-Amazingly tasty sangria, maybe the best in town; really fresh ingredients; prices that won't break the bank and special food.

Cons-the tacos are great but is there any sort of labeling you could do to designate which tacos are which? And service...please don't pull the chips off the table when we're still drinking our second sangria, especially if the restaurant is not full and no one is waiting for our table...the place is LOUD, concrete floors and windows don't help, maybe a bit of sound dampening via wall hangings or something?
