I LOVE this place. And that's a big deal for this girl because mexican food has never been my favorite. The first time my boyfriend and I ate here I was pleasantly surprised and happy.

The service has always been top notch! Their happy hour menu is amazing and the portions are ginormous. My man and I are light eaters so we usually order a cocktail and share a few small random food items. I ordered their white sangria and it was very flavorful as well as refreshing. My man ordered their margarita and liked it so much he snagged another one before happy hour ended. Their chips and guacamole are easily the best I've ever had. That guacamole may have changed my foodie life. Seriously. We also ordered their Verduras de Temporada (the larger portion) and loved every bite. Its plenty big and was enough for my boyfriend and I to share along with the guacamole.

I'm already looking forward to our next trip.
