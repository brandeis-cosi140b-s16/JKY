I love love love this place! The food is fresh and much is grown or obtained locally. The vibe and overall ambiance is amazing. Great drinks. Really good guac(oranges!!!) I love the chicharron  de queso, its different but soooo good. The tacos are amazing and you can mix and match because they are cheap. The corn on the cob reminds me of fun times in Mexico. The rice and beans-so-so, but who cares. This place is awesome. I told my Mom we should stay at The Clarendon for my upcoming birthday/Dbacks game instead of downtown just so I can have breakfast there. The Clarendon is cool, but this place is AMAZING!!! I cant wait to do breakfast there.The owner does a great job making sure you feel welcome. I have seen him there every time I visit and he goes out of his way for every guest to make sure they are happy. BRAVO!
