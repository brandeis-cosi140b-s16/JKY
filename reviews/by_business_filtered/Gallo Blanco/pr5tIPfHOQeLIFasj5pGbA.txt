Wow the Gallo Blanco Cafe is my new favorite place to hang in Phoenix.

The name of the game is Carne Asada.  The two dollar Carne Asada are the best food value in phoenix period, so much flavor and sooo yummy!  Not only that but the drinks here are generous and delicious both.

Ambiance is modern bright and cheery and the staff is friendly and attentive.  Two thumbs up from me!
