Okay. I love Gallo Blanco, particularly for breakfast. It's different but familiar, if that makes any sense.

We usually order the breakfast burrito (unbelievable) and the flap jacks (best I've ever had). They serve local coffee, have awesome drinks, and usually pretty good service (probably the only complaint I've ever had was being ignored for a little bit during happy hour, for which we got some free chips and salsa as an apology). 

I just need to come here for tacos. It's really a shame I haven't been.

If you like midtown, it's an awesome location in the Clarendon hotel. Hipster in a good way. I doubt you'd be disappointed with anything you ordered here; it's all fresh and made in house where possible. Also, prices are very reasonable.
