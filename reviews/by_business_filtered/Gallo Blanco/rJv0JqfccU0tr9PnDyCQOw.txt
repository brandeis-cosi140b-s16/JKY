Just went here for another afternoon drink. It's a part of The Clarendon Hotel. I've been here a few times in the past, and the atmosphere is always very similar--low key but welcoming. Gallo has a unique flare about them, that ranges from their staff, to their food, to their drinks. They have a prickly pear margarita that'll give you a taste of a valley favorite for $8. Today I had a Bloody Mary ($5 on happy hour). Instead of the typical horseradish, they use habanero to season and spice it-- but not too much to freak your taste buds out. Garnished with jicama and the usual olive, lemon, lime, celery. I enjoy the mini tacos they have during happy hour, though they can sometimes be a tad spicy. While I've had better food and drink before, I do thoroughly enjoy coming to this place as it's laid back and got a unique style to it. There is enough ambience and flavor to keep me coming back.
