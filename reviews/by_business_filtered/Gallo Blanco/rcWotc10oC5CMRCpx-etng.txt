Had to try this place after reading the reviews. This is a very different type of Mexican restaurant. It is all very fresh, not greasy or covered in cheese.  Started with corn with mayo, cotinga and paprika. Absolutely delish. We then had three different tacos, pork, fish, shrimp. All of them were very tasty. Guacamole was fresh, little onions and orange segments. Sunds weird but it was good. BF had naco torte, which was beef on sandwich role. It was excellent. Worth a trip. Service was excellent
