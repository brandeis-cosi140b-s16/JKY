If Phoenix had a true city life, Gallo Blanco would probably be one of the most popular spots in the valley.  Instead, it's a pretty randomly located restaurant in the lobby of a pretty randomly located hotel, in a pretty random part of town.

The Saturday night wait was expectedly long, but it allows you take advantage of the beauty of the Claredon hotel.  It's a pretty hipster hotel along the lines of the W in old town, but with a lot more space and not surrounded by all the trendy restaurants and bars.  The pool is pretty cool surrounded with "waterfall windows" and lights that change color.  There is also a lounge area on the roof of the building which offers a surprisingly pleasant view of the valley.  Grab a drink from Gallo's bar, give the hostess your phone number so they'll call you when your table is ready, and enjoy.

The fare is gourmet mexican street food.  That usually means smaller portions at bigger prices, but Gallo gives you your money's worth.  The chips and salsa are excellent.  You could fill yourself up on those long before your entree makes it to the table.  The chips were fresh, hot, and not greasy.  The salsa was also fresh and delicious.  If you need some heat, ask for the bottles.

Service was great.  The waitress did a great job selling the food on the menu.  There was always some one coming by to refill waters, grab a finished plate, or bring us more chips.  My only major complaint is a need for a few more heaters on their patio.  We were seated outside, which didn't sound so bad when we arrived at 7:30, but after waiting a little more than a half hour to be seated, it sure got chilly in the corner where our table was.

And for some added entertainment.  Hit up the men's room.  Trust me.  You'll have a quick a laugh once you see it.
