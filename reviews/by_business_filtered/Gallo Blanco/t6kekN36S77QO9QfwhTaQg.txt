Living in Arizona there is obviously no shortage of amazing Mexican restaurants but I have to say... this is one of my favorites. I had the shrimp burrito and it was probably the best burrito I've ever had. The service was slow considering the place was practically empty but it was worth the wait. I will definitely be heading back here next time I'm in Phoenix and will do my best to order something else... no promises though.
