Seriously - $2 steak tacos?!!?? Awesome! 

We've now been there twice in the last couple of weeks and each time have loved it. The Guac is by far my favorite part. The citrus/oranges twist is an amazing complement to the traditional pepper/onions fare. The other aspect that I loved was that it isn't grinded into a pulp. Turns out I really lie the chunky aspects of this guac. One twist that we did was ask for tortillas, vs. chips, and it turns out that they cook their own tortillas on site, so we got fresh tortillas - simply tasty.

I've tried all 4 tacos and definitely lean towards the steak (best) and pork (good second). I chased these with the watermelon-lime fresca the second time and the Periquitas ($5 red wine) the first time. Was pleasantly surprised each time.

Although I'm not a fan of frijoles (soupy beans), the beans here were as if you had some refried beans, with some whole beans, sprinkled with cotija cheese. They were very flavorful, almost a little smoky/earthy, which was a nice change from the regular old bland stuff you get at other places.
