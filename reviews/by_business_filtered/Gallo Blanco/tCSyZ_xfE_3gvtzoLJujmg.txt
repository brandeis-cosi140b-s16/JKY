Two dollar tacos?  Yes, please!  Two dollar tacos with great flavor and ingredients.  I'm all in!  I've only been here for lunch, since it's not too far of a skip from downtown.  Service hasn't been an issue for me, but I know it has for others.  I found parking to be a pain, try to find street parking if you can, but good luck.

The tacos are small, so you'll need around three.  Order a side of beans and rice and you have an awesome meal.  I love the carne asada and pork tacos.  

I say stick with two dollar tacos during lunch and you'll leave happy!
