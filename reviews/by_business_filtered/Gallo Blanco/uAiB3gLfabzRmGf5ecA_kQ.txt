The only thing I disliked about this place was the HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. It felt like the server just didn't want to serve us, or maybe it was her last table and she was done for the day. We sat down she brought us our drinks and we never saw her again. We waited finally 30 min to ask someone else if we could order. We could also see our original waiter sitting down chatting and counting her tips. The food was amazing and the pork belly tacos are a MUST try. I've worked as a server before so I tried not to get too angry. I would try this place again but if service is this bad I will just ask for it togo.
