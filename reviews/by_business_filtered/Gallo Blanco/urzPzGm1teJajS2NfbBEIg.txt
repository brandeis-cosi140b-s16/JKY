This site makes you give a star- but I would like everyone to know that I am giving ZERO stars.. DO NOT book a reservation at all with Gallo Blanco- they can not handle it....I booked a birthday party for 24 (with two months notice)... and they dropped the ball, BIG TIME!!!
~Service...slow to non existent and our server was RUDE! 
~Food... sparse and WAY overpriced for a sit down meal...
~Bar...is it a hassle to order a drink?  It is at Gallo Blanco...we bought bottles of wine 

1. Our food was over an hour and a half late (reservations at 7:30pm and food was still coming out at 9:45pm!!!....it's tacos folks.....and there was not enough food for everyone!!!
2. We had NO water, (we were seated outside!!!!!)
3. Impossible to get drinks or water at bar...

* When reporting problems to the owner, Denise, she sent me an email offering no apologies or acknowledgement that guests were upset...  Rather, she sent me a copy of the order to the kitchen, which just proved that the kitchen and staff were wrong in regards to amount of food to be served!!!!  
The most disgusting part of the whole ordeal was her closing to her email, which said:
"At this point, and will all due respect, we are done."  

GALLO BLANCO HAS ZERO CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

P.S. The Clarendon is not affiliated with Gallo Blanco.....is just houses the restaurant unfortunately.
