Joined @SMUNCHPhoenix at @GalloBlanco.

For my first breakfast at Gallo, I ordered Chilaquiles Verde, and my girlfriend had the Chorizo and Eggs.

We were both very happy with our choices!

The chilaquiles was delicious, with the crispy corn tortillas providing a nice contrast.

The chorizo and eggs were definitely in line with what I consider to be authentic.

I am definitely a fan of Gallo, and will return as often as time and money allow.
