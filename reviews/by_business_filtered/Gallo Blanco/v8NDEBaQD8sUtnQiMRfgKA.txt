gallo blanco makes me a saaaaaaaaaaaaaad panda.

 seriously whats up, dude? the service lately has been pretty crappy. way disappointed. i keep hoping it's an off night but that's turned into a pattern so i can't excuse it any longer. 

the food is still good, but it takes forever. and the worst part, the last two times i ordered cochinita tacos they were dry and one was just grissle. what the heck are yall doin back there? 

i want the old gallo back.
