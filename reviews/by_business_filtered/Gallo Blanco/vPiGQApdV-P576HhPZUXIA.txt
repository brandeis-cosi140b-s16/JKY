I love this place. The tacos are spectacular, especially the vegetable tacos. The guacamole is unrivaled (sorry Barrio, yours is great, Gallo's is better). They have real masa chips, not cheap tortilla chips. The place is also beautiful, great views of downtown and it's nestled by the lobby of the hip Clarendon hotel. The service is typically very good. I can't complain, they get it all right. I haven't tried their breakfast yet, but that's on my to-do list.
