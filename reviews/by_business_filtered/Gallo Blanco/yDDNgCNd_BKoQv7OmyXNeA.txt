I'll keep it quick since this place has no shortage of real reviews.  The carne asada torta, for just a simple sandwich, was mind blowing.  There was so much flavor packed into a little wrapped sandwich that looked lonely on an oversized plate, I didn't take a drink of water for a few minutes after I finished, just enjoying the aftertaste.
