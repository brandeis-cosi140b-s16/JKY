I wished I had meals to eat here. Unfortunately I only had time for the guacamole...and I ate the whole thing!!! I sat outdoors and that was okay just off the street. I had the advantage of also purchasing this snack at happy hour....a dollar off! Super deal, now have to get back for a meal sometime.
