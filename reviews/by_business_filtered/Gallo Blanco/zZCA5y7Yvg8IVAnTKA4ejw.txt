A quaint little New Mexican spot joined to the lobby of the Clarendon hotel - we enjoyed this spot for dinner one night and breakfast the next!  The food is great and I especially enjoy their house-made horchata! Dinner seemed pricey for the small amount you receive, but breakfast was quite generous. I recommend their tacos, horchata and their huevos rancheros for breakfast. The only improvements I'd make were the wait times (I saw waitresses standing around a lot and it often took a while to get refills on drinks and it took forever to get our ticket - I think the waitress we had left and had someone else take over for her - we had to ask for the bill at least twice...) - the wait times seemed unreasonable and unjustified.
The other improvement would for them to make a better attempt to have t-shirts in stock to sell to tourists - the hubs really wanted one and they were all out!  When we are in AZ again, we will most likely visit this spot at least once during our time there!
