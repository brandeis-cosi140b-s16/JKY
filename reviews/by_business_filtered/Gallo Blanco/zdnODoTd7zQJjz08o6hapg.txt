Gallo Blanco is among my faves in dt Phoenix. It's inside The Clarendon Hotel and great for a date or a night out with friends. The drinks are delicious (try the prickly pear margarita!!) and the food is just as good. The fish and carne asada street tacos are to die for, as are burritos. The atmosphere is trendy but casual, making for a fun night out. There are a few seats outdoors if you're lucky enough to snag one. 

Overall, try Gallo Blanco if you're in the mood for a trendy twist on Mexican cuisine.
