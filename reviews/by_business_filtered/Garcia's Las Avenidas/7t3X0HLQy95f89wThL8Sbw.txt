Grew up this spot!!! Everytime my childhood buddy comes in from NY we all get together here. Food is amazing !!! Came here last week for my birthday with a party of 18 and the waitress was on top of everything. This is the only Garcias that we go to as this one is still family owned and not Franchised as the others.
