This is it. When it comes to rating great Mexican restaurants, this is the one I use as a measuring stick. The food is outstanding, the menu extensive, the atmosphere festive and the service more like eating at a friend's home than a large restaurant. I recommend everything, but have a particular fondness for their tamales. Whenever I am in Phoenix, whether for business or pleasure, it's a sure bet I'll eat at least once at The Original Garcia's. All my friends who live there love it, and friends and family who I've taken there do, too.
