The hotel staff at Comfort Inn recommended Garcias. This restaurant is very large.There's so much space. Very comfortable. The decor is eye catching. It makes you want to wonder and browse! The food portions are very large. The chips are salsas are good: they have two different ones. I had chicken enchiladas & I thought they were very good. I will definitely come back here the next time I am in Phoenix.
