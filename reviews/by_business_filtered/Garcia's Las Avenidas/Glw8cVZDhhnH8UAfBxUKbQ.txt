I go here almost weekly for lunch with co-workers. It's everything you want in a Mexican restaurant: bottomless fresh chips and salsa before your food comes, enormous portions of delicious Mexican dishes, and a very attentive and polite staff. I've tried every lunch special on the menu and they will all leave you satisfies and ready for a siesta.
