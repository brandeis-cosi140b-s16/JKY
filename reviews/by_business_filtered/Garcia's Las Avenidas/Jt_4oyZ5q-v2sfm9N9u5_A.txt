I honestly expected more authentic Mexican food coming to the original location. Unfortunately that is not what I got. The food was very greasy and the taste was bland. The salsa was not good which I think can make a restaurant. The salsa is important this reminded me of the bottled Paste salsa.

I'm only giving 2 stars due to the service. And the Bloody Mary I drank which was good. Other than that the food was mediocre. Will not be coming back.
