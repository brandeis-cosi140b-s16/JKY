The best Mexican food I've ever had!! The salsa and chips are unlimited and amazing.  I always order the pollo fundido with a side of guacamole. The entrees come with a side of beans and rice.  I love coming here, because this is the original Garcias & not part of the chain restaurants.  The food never changes, always amazing, and comes out so fast.  I've never had to wait more than 15 minutes! (usually close to 10 min)
