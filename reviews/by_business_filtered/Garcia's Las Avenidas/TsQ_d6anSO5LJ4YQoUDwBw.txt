This is my favorite restaurant. I've eaten here for 40 years at its different locations on 35th Ave. 

The restaurant is ok, but chaotic at times. If you go at a busy time, you can wait 20 minutes. The best, however, is the takeout building. Cheaper prices, and quicker service. I love the #9 green burro special. I don't like the tostada, so just get another beef taco, which is great. I love their hot sauce. Get the eat in chips special. 

Drive through times can be a bit slow. So, you may wait 5 or more minutes. The fried ice cream is really good. 

Do not confuse this location with the chain versions. Different worlds.
