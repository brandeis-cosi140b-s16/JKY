I am just not a fan. One time we ordered food for a staff party and many staff members got sick. I have eaten here several times before over the years and before Yelping became standard and once again last week for our, "last day of school eat out tradition."  While I can't say anything bad about the service the food is just not very good. I do have to say the Gaucamole I ordered was really nasty.

I know, I know I am picky about Mexican food but I wanted to eat with my "Peeps." However, I will probably not eat here ever again. 

Another thing that keeps going around in my mind is that I worked at a Garcia's when I first graduated college and I was treated very poorly.
