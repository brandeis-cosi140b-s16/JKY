I had high hopes for the the famed "Original Garcia's"... perhaps my hopes were too high. I walked in and felt comfortable. The decor was just beautiful, and the service was absolutely wonderful. Each attentive employee that I interacted with made me feel like a guest.
Things however took a terrible turn when I received my food. I ordered one of my favorites, Red Menudo with flour tortillas. The tortillas were not fresh, they tasted like the thick grocery store shelved tortillas that I try to avoid. The menudo meat was disappointing as well. It had not been cut well, and my bowl had a couple of VERY large chucks of fatty meat. 
Sadly, the food did not live up to all that I had heard...
