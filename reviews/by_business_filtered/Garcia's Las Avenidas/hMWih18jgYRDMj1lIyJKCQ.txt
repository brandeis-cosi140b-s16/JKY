We loved it! The food was delicious,the service was wonderful,very patient waiter.Next time we will ask to be seated away from a large family party,so that room was very loud,but that was something we should have asked for in the beginning. I cannot wait to eat there again.Oh yeah,the portions are so big,we split meals.Good thing,there are 7 of us,so it turned out to be reasonably priced. Loved the feel of Mexico there.
