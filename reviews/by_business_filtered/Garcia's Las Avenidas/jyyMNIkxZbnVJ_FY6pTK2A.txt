Was looking for a good Mexican Restaurant and based off the Yelp reviews thought we would try the Original Garcia's.

First, we are seated and given chips and salsa and menus and are the only people in our area of the restaurant (it was only 4:00pm). As we sat there others were placed around us so there were about six tables full. A waiter comes out and starts taking everyone's order around us but not ours and we were the first ones there and now have been waiting about 15 minutes. I get upset but decide that he just didn't know the order we arrived and is confused so I wait. He disappears and doesn't show back up and everyone else has had their order taken but we still have not. I see the chip gal walking by and say "can you please get our waiter?" and she says "she is running late and isn't here yet". I'm like...what the hell are you talking about?  All of a sudden we see a woman in a Garcia's shirt come running by with her purse and goes into the back and puts it down and comes back to our table and says "sorry, I was running late". Are you kidding me? They sat me in a section and the waitress wasn't at work yet and let us sit there for 30 minutes getting pissed off and didn't take our order?

Was also disappointed in the meal as there wasn't much flavor in any dish we had and would not drive the 40 minutes again to get to this place. The salsa had no spice to it and was very unimpressed with the entire meal.

To make it worse I get out in the parking lot and some idiot has his car parked two inches from the drivers side door of my car which I don't know how he did without hitting my car. I had to enter my car through the passenger side and so much wanted to find the guy and curse him out for being an idiot but thought better of it when I remembered what neighborhood I was in.

There are better Mexican Restaurants closer to home and certainly wouldn't travel all the way to Maryvale again just to eat here.
