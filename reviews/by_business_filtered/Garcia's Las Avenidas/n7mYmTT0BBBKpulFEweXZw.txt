Been eating here before they expanded into this huge restaurant with a separate take out drive thru.

Chips and salsa are always great and plentiful but don't eat too much before your meal arrives. 

One of my favorites are the Pollo Fundido which are square shaped deep fried chicken chimichangas with a jalape√±o sour cream on top.

The machaca chimichangas wet or dry with guacamole are awesome and prepared to perfection. 

During the week day for lunch it is always packed and difficult to find a parking space but they get you in and out quickly. 

We just went on a Saturday and found plenty of parking however the service was very slow and they seemed to be under staffed which was surprised and disappointing. 

I don't know how many times I have been here and this was the first time the service was this way.

Regardless will certainly be back. Keep in mind this is the original Garcias and not the chain.
