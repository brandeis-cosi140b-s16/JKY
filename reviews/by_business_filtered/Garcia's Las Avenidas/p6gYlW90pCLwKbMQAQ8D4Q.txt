This place is...... ok. The enchilada sauce is pretty nasty if I am being honest. I don't ever want to come to Garcia's, but if the rest of the lunch bunch does I only order tostadas. Stay away from anything with that enchilada sauce..... trust me. The staff is friendly and its a pretty quick lunch. If you are with a large group keep your eyes open when they bring the drinks! I have seen a co-worker or two wear their drink home! lol
