What? Only a 4 star average for this place? And only 27 reviews? Come on Phoenix!

I admit, If all I care about is the food, I'm heading to Carolina's.

However- you can't really relax at Carolina's. No one waits on you, no matter how transcendant the food is you're always hearing someone yell "Number 27!" "Number 28!". God help you if it's summer.

Garcia's, although still in the ghetto, is somewhere you can go, relax, be waited on, enjoy free chips and salsa before the meal, and enjoy a pleasant conversation friendly environment. 

As for the food- I've never had a bad meal here. The rice is the best in the city. It's really moist without being wet, there are chunks of real tomatoes in it. They have dishes that you can't get just everywhere like fish dishes and my favorite, chili con carne- very similar to how my mom makes it, but they have a green version as well as a red version.  

I've taken my boss from out of town here, dates... (well, escorts.. same thing...), and friends here (again... escorts, but...  )  and everyone of them were like in a happy daze afterwards. Blissed out like heroin junkies.. 

I think two of them were on heroin.. but still it's really really good food. 

I love you Garcias Las Avenidas! Only 2 more months till my 1 year ban is lifted!

(you all know I kid.. right?)
