My grandmother worked here like a hundred years ago before it moved to the current location on 35th Ave. So...I have been eating here since the beginning of time, which was, of course, the day i was born.  The food is always good.  I love love the salsa.  The hot sauce is not my favorite but whatev.  If you do not speak spanish you might also have trouble with the staff and sometimes they are not the friendliest but thats ok with me becuase the food is always good. : )
