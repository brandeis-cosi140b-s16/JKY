Best ground beef enchiladas in the valley.  The red sauce is to die for and they are not affiliated with the chain Garcia's so no disgusting food drowning in oil here.  

I have been coming here since the 90's and sometimes drive out of my way from Tempe to get their enchiladas.  

They also have another building on the same property that has a drive through serving the same food as the restaurant.
