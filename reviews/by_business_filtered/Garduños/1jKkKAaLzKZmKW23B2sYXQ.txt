Ok the 2 best things about this place 1) whole wheat tortillas for you healthy eaters and 2) their salsa bar that also includes MANGO salsa. Makes me happy :)

It was good enough, again I'm a Mexican food aficionado, so you really have to pull something amazing for me to be wow'ed.

Chicken tacos was pretty good, meat was tender and juicy, as well as, all white.

So you can eat healthy here!!!
