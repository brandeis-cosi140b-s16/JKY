I've been here 5 times, because I always stay at The Pams....everytime it's just OK....they do have some rpetty hot salsa fresca, tho, which is a plus!

THE ORDER:

Chicken Chimichanga: 3 stars....all around deep-friend yumminess. You have the option of grilled or fried, but who the hell orders a grilled chimichanga? The Rice was a bit on the dry side...beans were good, tho.

Carne Asada Burrito: 2 stars....tasted like overall junk...nothing amazing or  a standout....kinda sucked.

Hard Chicken Tacos: 3 stars....crsipy sheel....flavorful meat...

Chicken Salad: 2 stars...Overall bland....


THE SERVICE: 2 stars
just slow and unattentive...
the hostess really needs to communicate with the waitstaff is they move our table...we werent greeted by a server for a LONG time.....after we had our orders taken, things did get a little better...


BASICALLY, if your SHITFACED drunk, this place is good....
