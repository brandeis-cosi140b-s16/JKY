I've only been here once for Sunday brunch after hearing great things about the spread and the endless margaritas. Our party expected a line so we hit The Palms as soon as Gardu√±os opened. We were probably third in line so we were seated immediately. Needless to say, all the food was fresh and the margaritas arrived without delay. The food was fairly run-of-the-mill Tex Mex, but not bad by any stretch. We enjoyed several pitchers of margs while enjoying the views of the pool outside. Definitely worth the money and was a great way to start another day in Vegas. I'd definitely go back for the brunch.
