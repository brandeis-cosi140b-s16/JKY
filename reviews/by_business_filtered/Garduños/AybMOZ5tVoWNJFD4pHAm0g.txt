Came here with friends from outta town since they wanted to try this gardunos and compare it with the others they've tried. Food was really good got the Los Colores lunch platter and I have to say the chicken is amazing. But the service was very slow. Had to ask for water refills a few times and other things that should have been routine. Other then that it was a pleasant outting.
