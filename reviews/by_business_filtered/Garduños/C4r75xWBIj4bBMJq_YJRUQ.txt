Return visit this past Sunday for the brunch and it still remains as one of my favs.  Ok first let me start out by saying that this time around the all u can drink margaritas were stronger than ever and ever.  I had 3 or 4, sorry lost track and I was tore back.  The food items were awesome too, I discovered the omelet station this time around.  But my hands down favorite is the pozole, so good and hearty, I had everyone at the table trying it.  The salsa bar is pretty dang awesome too especially the warm bean dip with delicious chips, no tostitos here!  They also had eggs with chorizo that was pretty darn good.  The variety and quality is good.
Oh but the highlight of the day was the Mariachi's.  I just had to sing so I requested 3 songs, El Rey ( for EB's sake), Para Siempre (for Ya√±ez sake) and Te Sigo Amando (for grandma's sake)!  I was in Mexican heaven.  Oh you must try this place if you happen to be in Vegas on a Sunday afternoon, you will not be disappointed.
