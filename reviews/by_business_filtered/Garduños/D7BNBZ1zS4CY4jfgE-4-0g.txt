I'd come here with a group of acquaintances from a convention across the street.  The majority of them had chosen Gardunos because they don't have many Mexican restaurants where they come from.  

The restaurant is a typical Mexican establishment, although I question its authenticity as a Mexican establishment when they list two versions of Fettuccini Alfredo in their chef's specials.  

My acquaintances ordered the tableside guacamole, which I've always found to be a rip-off in any restaurant, especially because it's not like a teppan show when they're mixing the ingredients up.  Sure enough, the guacamole mixer was rather uninspired, as were the ingredients she brought with her.

I had the Stuffed Sopaipillas, mainly because I love sopaipillas.  You include sopaipillas in your menu, I will try them.  And they were... OK.  In the end, it might as well have been a burrito I'd had.

My friends may have thought they were someplace serving pretty good Mexican food.  Considering they made some banal choices (cheese enchiladas, chicken burrito, etc.), there was nothing to complain about save for the service from an over-worked waitress.    In the end, I'd had comparable food at some of the fast-food Mexican places in my area.  Better than Taco Bell, but not worth the effort for a sit-down place.
