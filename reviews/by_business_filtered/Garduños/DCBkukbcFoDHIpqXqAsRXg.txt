I went to Garduno's as part of a large group for a birthday.  At first, I was skeptical because the Palm Casino is full of people to cool for school and I thought Garduno's may be an extension of that scene.  All style, no substance.

I was wrong.

I found the menu to be inspired, the service friendly and unobtrusive and the prices fairly reasonable.  Save for hole-in-the-wall Mexican food cooked by old mamacitas straight from the old country which are the best, this place held a candle to most Mexican restaurants I have ever been to.  

I noticed some reviewers said it was "Chevy's-esque" but not so.  On the menu, I found a number of tasty and hard to find Mexican regional specials like Carne Adovado and Hatch Green Chile's.  In fact, I was so excited to see the Carne Adovado that I ordered it.  A fantastic choice it proved to be.  Simmered in a rich chile marinade and served with roasted potatoes and ranchero beans, I was in a little bit of heaven.  On second thought, I might have been in heaven because of the delicious giant fishbowl Margarita that had over 6 shots of Tequila in it.

Also worthy of note, the chips and salsa provided are top notch with the salsa being a butt-kicker.  I think Im still sweating.  Prices were around 15 bucks an entree.  The giant Margarits clocked in at $26 bucks a pop, but when you consider you dont need another drink the rest of the night, it comes across as a decent deal.  Especially at the Palms.

Garduno's is worth a visit.  An oasis in the mischegoss known as the Palms.
