I will admit it from the get go!  I am emotionally attached to Garduno's.  So I may be more forgiving in some areas.  I lived in Albuquerque, NM for 4 years and fell in love with them when it was Pa Pa Felipes.  In later years it became Garduno's.  When I walked into the Palms years ago, and saw Garduno's I was smitten!  

The best part is the Sunday brunch served by the pool with unlimited house margaritas.  Hello?????  

The bad news, is that nationwide they have had to claim bankruptcy and rumor has it the Palms will kick them out.  As a local......B I G mistake.  Garduno's is the only reason my husband plays at the Palms.  Once Gardunos is gone, so will we.  :(
