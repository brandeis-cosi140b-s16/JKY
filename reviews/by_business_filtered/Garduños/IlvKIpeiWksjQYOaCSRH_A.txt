The awesome clam/green chile chowder has now turned into a mess of a cheesy chowder with a few green chiles thrown in. Too bad, as it used to be the highlight of the menu. Chile Rellonos are still good, as is the Red Chile Colorado.  Nice vibe, nice time, but I sure wish they would bring the green chiles back to the green chile chowder. :-(
