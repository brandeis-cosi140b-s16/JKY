I went for the Mariachi Brunch and what a deal.  For $15 you get all you can drink Margaritas and all the breakfast and mexican food you can think of.  The made to order french toast and omelettes were very good.  I also love that they had pozole, one of my favorites.  Oh and since I love mariachis it was just the perfect Sunday morning.  This place is a must do if you're staying in or around the Palms, by the way that casino is nice too.
