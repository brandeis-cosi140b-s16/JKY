Service was terrible! Miguel had way to many tables. Our food wasn't hot! I had to bug the food runner for everything because I never saw my server! I informed the manager my service and food was terrible and my bill wasn't even discounted! Let's say my birthday dinner was terrible! The management was terrible!  My e- mail is whitj0426@aol.com if management would like to contact me as if now I will not be returning and will share how terrible my birthday dinner was!!!!
