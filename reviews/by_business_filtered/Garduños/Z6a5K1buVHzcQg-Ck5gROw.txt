My boss wanted to go somewhere different for lunch, but still wanted to be able to get his Friday margarita. It was a lovely day so we ended up poolside at Garduños at the Palms. The patio was great for people watching. 

I started out with a coconut margarita. This thing kinda blew my mind! The glass was rimmed with honey and shaved coconut and it was so deliciously sweet, but still packed a punch. 

Sadly, the drink was the highlight of my meal. I had a taco salad with chicken, which came with cheese, avocado, tomato, olives and pico de gallo. I don't know if it was the dressing, the seasoning on the chicken or what... but the salad just didn't do much for my taste buds at all. I ate MAYBE half of it.

Apparently if you ask you can have some free sopapillas for dessert. I didn't know, so I didn't ask, but I wish I would have! 

I wasn't super impressed with the food at Garduños, but I'd still go back a second time to try something different. That margarita alone is worth a second visit!!
