I agree that the service is definitely lacking. And not worth going out of your way to get to, but if you are staying at the Palms or plan to be over there than its a decent meal. Nothing is spectacular, but haven't had one bad meal yet. I do particularly enjoy their green chile clam chowder, and the salsa bar has some good options. Its also great for people watching once it gets late enough and the night clubs open.
