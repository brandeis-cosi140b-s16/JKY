This place isn't for everyone, so I won't call it the best buffet in Las Vegas (referring to the Sunday Mexican brunch buffet), but for me, it is the best. Chilaquiles, tacos, tortillas, chorizo, o my! Enough to get a gal hungry just typing about it! Vegas?! Plus, the unlimited margaritas never hurt anyone (except, of course, those who go to meetings and are trying to abstain...).
