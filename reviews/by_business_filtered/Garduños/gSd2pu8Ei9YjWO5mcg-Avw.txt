Let me start by saying...I don't drink tequila.  I haven't in about 2 years.  However, my husband and I came to dinner and we each had a margarita.  I used to come here in college to have margaritas.  Remembering how awesome they are, I had to break my tequila sabbatical to have one!  And it was well worth it!  They are so delicious!  

Love the salsa bar!  Love the food!  Everything I've ever tried has been wonderful.  Haven't had bad servers to date.  And the prices aren't outrageous either.  Best part...Sopapillas!  Ask your server for them with a bottle of honey....it's complimentary (and delicious)!  

Will we be back?!  Heck yeah!
