Worst Tex-Mex ever!  Probably the worst meal I've had in Vegas! Horribly slow service.  At one point a guy at the table next to us went back to the kitchen to refill his drink himself.  The margaritas were disgusting. We ordered the premium with "fresh lime."  It came loaded with bad tequila and thick sour mix.  The food was terrible and overpriced.  

Save your money and go somewhere else.  Pink Taco at Hard Rock is a much better choice if you want Mexican at a Casino.
