Posole, carne adovada, enchiladas...all food things that make me happy (and hungry) just thinking about them.  The pleasantly earthy smells and colorful flavors which make the tongue celebrate it's ability to taste, these are dishes which make this cuisine one of the most sought after in our culture.  I understand this, and I seek out these fine flavors from every corner of every town I visit....I even test my own chops in the kitchen, trying to imitate the better experiences I have had in restaurants and kitchens everywhere I have visited.  So it is with great appreciation of food and extensive culinary curiosity that I write this review of Gardu√±os at the Palms.  
Put simply, the 'food' here is absolute rubbish, an insult to the fine culinary traditions of its alleged roots.  The Posole was a salty, rotting mess...the worst EVER.  The adovada was more salt/vinegar flavored leather bits than food.  The enchiladas, well, if soggy tortillas drowned in sour cream, hardened cheese crust and surrounded in crunchy rice is your idea of an enchilada, you're in luck.  We went here starving, ate more than we should have of the slop they served (the shot of tequila added to the hunger pains, probably should have been avoided for that reason alone), and suffered the stomach pains and cold sweats all night and through this morning as a result.  Never again, never again.  McDonalds in the lobby would have been a better option, and I haven't done that in over 10 years.
