Let's face it, there's a TON of places to eat in Vegas, and I'd be hard pressed to go somewhere twice unless it was good.  Ate here a few months ago, and haven't had the chance to go back yet, but damn, I would totally do so next time I'm in Vegas.

For the type of Mexican restaurant[0] that they are, Gardunos does pretty well.  Fairly large selection of dishes, including both the usual favorites (enchiladas, tamales, tacos, etc.), some less common yet definitely Mexican dishes, and a handful of fusion/Southwestern stuff.  Everything we had was solid to actually pretty damn good, and this is coming from Arizona and California natives, respectively, who have since seen what bad Mexican tastes like after moving to the East Coast.  There's not much I can say about the food that hasn't already been said, save for the fact that the tortilla soup was one of the best ones I've ever had, and they do NOT screw around with the salsa.  

Where they really stand out though, as you damn well should in Vegas, is the drinks.  The signature drinks, the margaritas, all of it, were amazing.  That especially includes the drink that, among other things, is served in a margarita glass rimmed with honey and roasted coconut.  I don't remember what was in it, and am a little embarrassed to admit that I loved a girl drink so much, but holy hell, I don't care. Give me a couple of those and a plate of the chile verde, and I do believe I'd be set for the night.

Seriously, though, it's not quite worth the trip exclusively here from the Strip, but if you're already at the Palms or across the street at Rio, make your way here.  I didn't have a single bad thing, and would happily go back.

[0] I rank Mexican into: taqueria/roach coach, bare bones authentic with full menu, place you'd take your family to that may or may not be fully authentic, high end gourmet (yes, these exist).  There's also the not-really-Mexican category.  This place falls into the family sort of place.
