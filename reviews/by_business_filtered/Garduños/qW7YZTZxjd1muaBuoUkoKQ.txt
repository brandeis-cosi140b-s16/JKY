We chose Gardunos for dinner because it was in the Palms near our final destination for the evening, the prices seemed relatively reasonable, and it was one of the highest rated Mexican restaurants in Vegas.  The chips and salsa were good, usually an effective indicator of quality.  The margaritas were tasty, probably not worth $12 a pop but it's Vegas, baby.  My friends ordered the fajitas, steak and shrimp and they were excellent!  Great seasoning on the meat, we're going to try and replicate it at home!  I ordered the stuffed rellenos which sounded good but was pretty much a cheese slick with some chicken and machacas mixed in.  I few bites in I was stuffed and had a slight queasy feeling for about an hour afterward.  Not impressed at all!  My local taqueria kicks this places ass with it's hands tied behind it's back!
