Poor Gardunos. This place used to be really yummy but (I think because they will be closing soon) the cooking staff must not care because the food has really slipped.

One of my girlfriends used to spend a lot of time at the Palms, so Gardunos was a perennial favorite. Plus as an added bonus, all meals here, including the most recent one, were comped for us. Until recently the food was great so I never had any complaints. 

I came here a few days ago for a quick lunch with the girls. There were maybe a grand total of 5 patrons in the restaurant (not including us). We opted to sit outside on the patio which overlooks the pool. We ordered our usual to share:

-guacamole
-shrimp cocktail
-salad
-combo of enchilada and a taco

The first offering of guacamole brought to our table was brown. BROWN. I have made home-made guacamole hundreds of times and I know that if you let it sit out for a day or so (even wrapped in the fridge with a pit and lime juice) it starts to turn color. This first offering of guacamole must have been at least two days old. Hardly "fresh, made to order."

The waiter saw our faces and immediately took it back. The second offering was made fresh, so he said, and it in fact was the correct color at least (green). However, the taste of it was off and we didn't eat more than a bite each.

That's how the meal started and everything went down hill from there. The beans were dried up, almost crunchy, the salad was wilted and the majority of the meal was over-salted.

Our waiter was very apologetic and I'm giving Gardunos two stars simply because the staff/service was very good.
