Being from Texas and being used to amazing Mexican food did not help this place. First their salsa was essentially canned rotell, chunky and flavorless. The queso was made from the giant cans of cheese you can find at Walmart. I had chicken tacos and the meat was so dry it took me awhile to chew each bite. Rice and beans were bland and tasted worst than canned. 

The waiter told us this place was closing. I feel bad cause he was very nice and a good waiter but based on the quality of food and skills of the kitchen staff, I understAnd why they are closing

Avoid this place at all costs
