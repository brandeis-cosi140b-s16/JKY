After Christmas shopping one night I decided to stop by this restaurant.  I pass by there on a daily basis and it is always crowded.  When I arrived I noticed it was an awfully busy place.  I even asked one of the customers about this restaurant she said they are regulars, so I felt pretty confident in her opinion not having been there before. The staff appeared friendly, and the customers were being seated promptly.  I did order my food to go.  When I arrived home my family and I sat down to eat our food.  I noticed their salsa was very sweet, the pico de gallo was dried out, the tomatoes were shriveled.  I ordered a green chili chimichanga with pork and beans, which I was charged extra for the beans, and the meat since it wasn't shredded.  As I was finishing my chimi something in it looked awfully weird.  As I picked this foreign object apart I realized that there was a paper of some sort, it resembled a half sheet of a paper towel.  I immediately phoned the restaurant.  I spoke with the manager who was really nice offered me a credit towards my next meal. I opted out and wanted my money back. I had to again go to the restaurant to receive my credit  for only the chimi.  I was discouraged that my whole order was not credited since my whole family was grossed out at that point.  Unfortunately with that kind of an experience I will not be returning.  I actually took a picture of this foreign object. I would post the picture if I knew how to attach it.
