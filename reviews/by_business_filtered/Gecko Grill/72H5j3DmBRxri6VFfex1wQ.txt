I love this place, I mean it rocks the taste.  My gripe is the bean sauce (which is extremely addictive) so no issues there either.  So this review is really about the bean dip.  OK, so they charge .99 cents for each additional refill in the small cup, what bothers me is that you can place an order (that would come with bean dip in the dining area) but will not give you ANY bean dip if your order is to go.  I find this a bit cheap on their part and was given no real explanation as to why.  So I spend the same amount of money but no bean dip.  Kind of feel like I am being penalized for taking an order to go.
I will go back, the food is awesome but I will not spend any money on orders to go as I do not like lack of accommodation with my full combination meal.  They know who I am and I love them all to death but this is a bit of a letdown.   I bordered on a 3 star review but opted for the four.
