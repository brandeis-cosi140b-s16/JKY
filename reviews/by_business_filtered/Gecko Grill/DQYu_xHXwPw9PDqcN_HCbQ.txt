We had been sitting here on this beautiful patio for at least 20 minutes when my boyfriend, who has a booming radio DJ voice, yelled across other diners to someone else's waitperson like a Wall Street trader doing a long shot purchase "EXCUSE ME, WE ARE READY TO ORDER!" 

The salsa could use some heat and waaaaay less salt. They didn't bring little plates for the chips and salsa and they have those wrought iron mesh tables that you can see through, so of course the salsa is falling through the table onto our legs! All they had were these tiny cheap napkins! 

We overheard the family next to us as they were eating their shrimp cocktails say "we don't have time to wait for our meals could you please cancel our order?" They had obviously been waiting to place their order as long or longer than we had.

Our order finally came and while the food was good it was extremely bland.  I asked if they had a spicier hot sauce or salsa and she said yes and brought me something equally as bland as the first two. So if you're looking for a nice atmosphere bland food and the worst service ever this is the place for you!
