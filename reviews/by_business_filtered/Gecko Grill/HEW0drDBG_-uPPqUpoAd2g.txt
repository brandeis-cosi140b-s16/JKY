My daughter and I were heading to another place for lunch when I spotted this little gem in a mostly empty strip mall. The name sounded familiar, so we decided to stop here instead. There were a few other patrons waiting for tables inside so we opted to sit on the patio where we could be seated right away. The whole restaurant is really clean and the patio is no exception (although once a large party with multiple kids who were sitting on the patio left, it took them awhile to clean up). Once we were seated I quickly looked up what other yelpers had to say and it looks like this location is pretty new.

I ordered a simple bean and cheese burrito, enchilada style and and iced tea for myself, and my daughter got the kids chicken strips with fries and a chocolate milk. The food came out pretty quickly. As we were waiting, the server who was bringing out the food came to our table a couple times to ask if other orders were ours. I also noticed that a couple of the servers were unsure of who another table belonged to so it seems like there might not be a system for the patio yet. This didn't bother me, but the ladies at the table next to us were annoyed because they were in a rush.

My burrito was alright, great tortilla, filling was hot and stayed warm, but the enchilada sauce was a little too thin for my liking. The chicken strips were warm but not steaming lava hot like they always seem to be everywhere else (this is a good thing because they were for a starving five year old). My daughter said the chocolate milk wasn't chocolatey and asked for water instead. My iced tea was okay but tasted a little dirty.

The price was okay...our bill came to just over $14. I don't have much of an incentive to come back (Dos Gringos is across the street and kids eat free all the time there), but the place is cute and since they are new, I would give them another shot.
