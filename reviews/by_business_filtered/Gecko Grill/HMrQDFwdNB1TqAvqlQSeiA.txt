Food was below par and service was below par. Had a chimichanga for my main course. Wasn't outright bad but not great. Chips and salsa were slow to refill and salsa containers were small and difficult to dip into unless it was right in front of you. Had a margarita which again was not bad but great.The outdoor courtyard was nice but in itself not enough to bring me back when there are much better options in the area.
