We came here on a very strong recommendation of a friend and loved it!  The chips came with two salsas and a bean dip, all were very good.  I ordered the fish taco plate, one battered, the other grilled, both fresh and flavorful.  My husband ordered the tamales, one corn and one beef and loved them both.  The rice and beans were no nonsense and very tasty too.  Friendly service and the prices were more than reasonable.  Will return for sure.
