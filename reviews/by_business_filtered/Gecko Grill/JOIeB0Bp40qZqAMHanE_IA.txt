I've only tried a very few items here at the Gecko Grill.  But I usually personally rate a authentic Mexican Restaurant on trying these few items.  Depending if they turn out great determines whether I try something new next time.  So here it goes!

I usually first always get the Chimichanga at any new Mexican restaurant that I try.  And theirs is pretty amazing!  I always get shredded beef Chimichanga's usually on the first order of any restaurant and theirs top the list.  It's just what it should be deep fried, large amount, and delicious.  It's nice if you can get a side of their Jalapeno Cream Cheese to go with it!  It is too die for!

Next their refried beans are crap!  They taste like they came out of a can.  Bland!  Don't waste your time and so that means their refried bean burritos are not going to be any better.

Their Burro Grand and Gecko Burro are ok.  And the only thing that makes the Bean Mini Chimis ok is the jalapeno cream cheese.

I've never been one to mix Seafood with Mexican Food.  Disgusting!  Yuk!  It never seems authentic Mexican Food when I see fish tacos and the such on a Mexican Food Menu.

So I believe your best bet would be to get the Chimichanga any way you want it with a side Jalapeno Cream Cheese.  And this would be a very safe bet and delicious!
