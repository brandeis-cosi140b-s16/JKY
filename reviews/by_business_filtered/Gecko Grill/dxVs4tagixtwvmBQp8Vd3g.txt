I absolutely love gecko grill. Their chips with bean dip and choice of salsas are amazing. I had the enchiladas (one chicken, one pork) with the green sauce and was very impressed. Our server was charming and funny and kept the chips coming. Every employee who walked by checked on us (Not always talking to us, but clearly checking to see if we were in need). I will be a regular here.
