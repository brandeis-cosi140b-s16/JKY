Our family loves this place. Some of our favorites are the chicken enchiladas with green sauce and the chicken fajita burrito. I'm not a seafood person but my husband will often order the shrimp tacos. He loves the mango salsa they put on it. We love that you get chips, red salsa, green salsa and bean dip when you are seated. They replenish the chips and salsa no charge but if you want more bean dip you have to pay. I wish they would give you a little more to start with - that is my daughter's favorite part so it goes quickly. Most of the time service is great! We love that the weather is getting nicer so we can sit outside and enjoy their outdoor patio area. This place always seems to hit the spot when we want Mexican food.
