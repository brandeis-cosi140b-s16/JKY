The food was good but the service was not that great. I cannot decide whether I like it or not. I will give it another try eventually but if the service sucks again I would give it two stars instead of three. It took a while for someone to bring our drinks and take our order. We were served chips with two types of salsa and a bean dip. When they refilled our chips and salsa they did not give us bean dip. When I asked for more bean dip I was told it would be an additional 99 cents. WTF over! Unbelievable.
