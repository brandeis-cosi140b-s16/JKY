Genuinely the best authentic taste profile for Mexican food at an affordable price in the East Valley. Humble environment where the owner still comes out to greet its Patrons. Nice decor, clean and quality minded Staff.
Traditional tasting food that reminds me of my mom cooking dinner (that Good).
Nice portions and they will even cook a variation of there Menu for you. I have egg Sopes every Saturday with Enchilada Sauce on top!
