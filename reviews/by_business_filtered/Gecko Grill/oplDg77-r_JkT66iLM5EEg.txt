First visit to Gecko Grill was quite pleasing to the tummy. I saw this place en route to another highly Yelp rated business (Two Wheel Jones).

My wife had the Chicken Sopes combination platter with rice and refried beans. She enjoyed the flavors of the Sopes and the refried beans. I had the Taco and Burrito combination with Carne Asada. The thing that struck me was that the Carne Asada was cut quite small but I could taste the flavors.  

The other thing is how attentive the staff is. There was one waitress (Heidi) who went to each customer to ensure they were satisfied. For us, that spoke volumes. Our server, Halee, was also attentive and professional.  No doubt that we will return.
