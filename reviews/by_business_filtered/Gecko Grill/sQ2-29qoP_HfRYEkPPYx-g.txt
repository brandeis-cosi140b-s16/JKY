Tried Gecko for the first time today. Yelp info informed us it was not waiter service, but really was. The outside area was nice,roomy & shady. We were a little confused as to why a party of 10 or 12 was being seated for us ( a party of two ). The server seemed a little in la la land. We asked for a beer list... And he responded with... "Uhh what's that?".. You know a list of beers that you guys carry. We kind of laughed it off tho. They seemed to be a bit new as they didn't know which tables had been care of already or not. We had 3 people at our table at one pt. ..Frank ( who wasn't our server ) refilled our drinks & checked on us, was a great help & was very friendly. The food was so so but prices were very inexpensive. Free chips / salsa & bean dip & good horchata!
