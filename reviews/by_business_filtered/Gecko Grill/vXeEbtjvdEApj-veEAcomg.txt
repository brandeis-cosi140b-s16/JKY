I come to this place all the time and I do love the food. The service however, could use some work. My friend and I walked in and stood there for a little while before being told to wait. There was no greeting at all. They have a lot of employees, but I feel as though some are not well trained. I always have a very different experience every time I go. I will continue to come here, but I hope they do a better job next time.
