My husband and I went on a friday night ...busy wait was 15 minutes not bad. We both already knew what we wanted reviewed the menu while waiting. The waitress was nice. Very busy place ...long wait for food. Ordered chimichangas and street tacos plate. My tacos were so salty one taco was cold wierd !  Although the food wasnt perfect i probably wont return due to not feeling well after eating here!
