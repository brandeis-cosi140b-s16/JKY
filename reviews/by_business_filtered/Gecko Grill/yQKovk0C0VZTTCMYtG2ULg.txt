Love this place! Gecko Grill is one of our favorite places to eat. Love the salsa and bean dip. The Crabby burrito covered with the southwest cheese sauce....is the best!! Must try! Also try the salmon enchiladas. Very good. Oh can't forget about the menudo. You better be hungry when you order the big bowl.
