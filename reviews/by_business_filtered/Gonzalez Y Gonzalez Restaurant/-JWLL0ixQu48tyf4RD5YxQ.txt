This is about 7 months overdue, but somehow I lost this review. After my initial review, I was contacted by a manager, who apologized for my and my family's experience, and she told me to please let her know when we were in Vegas next, and she would make sure we had a better experience.

My parents ended up in Vegas a few months later with two friends, and since they were with me on our first visit, and they paid for it, I figured they should be able to enjoy the free visit. They called and let the management know they were coming before a show, and were treated to a completely free meal, including drinks. 

From all accounts, the meal they had was great. The manager gave them what she considered her "best" server, who my parents agreed was attentive, charming and responsive. My parents and their friends enjoyed an appetizer, entrees and plentiful drinks, and had no complaints. My father even ordered a seafood dish and said it really surpassed his expectations. 

If this had been the only time we'd been to this restaurant, it obviously would be a 5 star review. However, it was pretty clear that the amazing service my family received was due to our previously bad experience, so I have to take that into account. Also, although they were treated to their drinks, they retail price for margaritas was nearly $16 dollars each, which is a pretty pricey margarita. They were pretty good, but definitely not the best we've had, and certainly not worth their normal price tag. I'm not sure we would come back immediately, since our two experiences obviously differ wildly, but if we were coming for appetizers only, I might consider it again. Their willingness to correct their mistakes, especially in a town where repeat customers are not always a realistic goal, make me more inclined to visit again in the future.
