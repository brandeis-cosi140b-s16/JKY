It was a mediocre experience. My husband and I stopped in for dinner before Sur Du Soleil. I ordered the Pork Milanesa Salad and my husband the ground beef enchiladas. The pork for my salad, thankfully, was served on the side. It was cooked through but came coated in oil rendering it inedible. The salad was missing the pumpkin seeds and though the avocado dressing was very good the salad was overdressed. 

The beef in the enchiladas was seasoned and maybe from the disappointment from my salad, I only thought they were okay. The beef was a little sweet for my liking.

It felt since we didn't order alcoholic drinks we were not important. Once we placed our order we didn't see our server, Jet, until the very end. I explained about the pork, the server didn't offer to correct my meal or apologize. We were not offered refills on our drinks.
