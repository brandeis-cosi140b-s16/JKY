So I was craving some Mexican food while in Vegas and looked for somewhere that was nearby that had great reviews ... I found Gonzalez Y Gonzalez.  

Imagine my surprise though when I discovered that this place is in the New York New York hotel.  "Isn't hotel food usually sub par?", I thought to myself.  "Hmm, let's find out!"  Yes .. I have conversations with myself ... any who ... 

So we were seated and the waiter came out immediately.  The down side, you have to pay for chips and salsa here, it's not free like back home.  Ok, no problem.  The salsa was VERY good so I was glad that we ordered it and the chips.  

I ordered the grilled fish tacos and a skinny margarita ... OMG the fish tacos were probably the best I have EVER had!!  The skinny rita was good, too, and I again was pleasantly surprised that it actually gave me a buzz because they usually do not at other places.  

My daughter had the margarita with red bull it in ... meh, tasted like red bull, which is fine for staying up and being buzzed, but not sure about having it with a margarita.  LOL. 

Overall, good food, good service, and easy access to my hotel!  If ever in Vegas again, which I will be next year, I'll definitely stop in!!
