This restaurant is inside NYNY a cute little place to stop at, while enjoying looking around at the NY decorations. If you sit out on their patio, you can enjoy the feeling of sitting out on a patio in NY. You are surrounded by decorated walls that are transformed into apartment buildings, cafe's, little tables to look like people are eating outside restaurants in NY. I have never been to NY so it was cool checking things out while we enjoyed a few drinks before our meal.

Everything about this dining experience was good, except my sister receiving the wrong order. For some reason our waiter thought she said something different then what she wanted, so when our order came out we had to send hers back and the waiter had to put in her order. I ordered the nachos, which were ok. They come on large home made chips, with steak, cheese, jalapenos and guacamole. The steak was a little tough to chew through which was disappointing, but their guacamole was pretty tasty. My sister ordered their taquitos. They weren't bad, nice and simple dish, dip them in their chipotle sauce and they were actually pretty tasty. Besides getting the wrong order out first and her having to wait for the taquitos everything else was nice. Our waiter was polite and quick, the scenery was cool and the drinks were delicious.
