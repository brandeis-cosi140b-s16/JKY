Ate here for lunch on a weekday with my wife.  It was good.  Very good prices.  Free chips and salsa.  The salsa had a unique taste, but I really liked it.  We both ordered the chicken burrito off of the lunch menu.  Great portion size.  I really liked it, but my wife didn't like the sauce that was on the burrito.  I agree the sauce could have been better, but it wasn't bad.  I had no problems cleaning my plate.  The service was a little slow however.  It seemed like there was only one waitress working the tables that day.
