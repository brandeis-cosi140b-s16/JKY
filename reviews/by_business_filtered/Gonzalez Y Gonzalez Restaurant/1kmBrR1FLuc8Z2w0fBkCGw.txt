I was pointed here for the best dessert in New York, New York. I ordered the grande fried ice cream. Grade cost  an extra dollar. It is worth the extra dollar, unless you are on a diet. Then, don't order dessert. It was an excellent fried ice cream (am not usually a fan). The ice cream was great quality and neither melted nor too frozen. The bowl was perfectly accented with cinnamon sugar. Overall, it was fantastic.

The staff was friendly and attentive. The entrees looked promising, but we only had time for dessert. It was fantastic.
