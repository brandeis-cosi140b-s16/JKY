Located inside the New York New York hotel.  The food was just okay.  Since I live in Arizona and get great Mexican food, this place left little to be desired.  I thought the salsa was bland and they didn't have a spicier salsa available.  My girlfriends and I all had different entrees and we all agreed that the food was not very good.
