The first time I ate here was amazing. The next two were just as good. Good selection of happy hour items from taco salads, enchiladas, and burritos. Buckets of corona for large groups. Sizzling fajitas are my favorite. I went with the carne asada and it was cooked just right. Lots of flavor and very soft. 

If you're at New York New York make it a priority to stop by here and grab a bite.
