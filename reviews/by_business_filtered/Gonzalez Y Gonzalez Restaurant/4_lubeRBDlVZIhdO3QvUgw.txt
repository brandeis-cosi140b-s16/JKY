Stumbled across this place... literally. Came to NYNY to go check out Coyote Ugly and saw this was a cute little dance bar & grill .  Saturday night they had merengue/bachata, no cover, cheap drinks (for LV).  It was a blast!  Great vibe, pretty people!  I danced the night away and never made it to Coyote Ugly! Def check it out if you want to get away from the high cover nightclubs.
