If you think this place has good food, then you've never had real good Mexican food. We ended up here because they were the only ones that were open. The chips were so salty I might as well eat salt chips. The Tacos al Carbon which they highly recommended tasted nothing like Tacos al Carbon, for some reason. And we were hungry! You usually have forgiving taste buds! And then they played this really, really, really..really loud party music. The last time I checked they were a restaurant and NOT a club to be playing music that loud. Isn't that hazardous to your ears? I just think this restaurant is bad news.
