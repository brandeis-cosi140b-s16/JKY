My experience at this Mexican restaurant located inside the NYNY hotel and casino was pretty good and meet all my expectations in terms of food, drinks and service. This isn't a 'refined' dining experience, it is a good, I'm hungry, don't want another hamburger or pizza restaurant.

Gonzalez is a reasonable sit-down restaurant with a reasonable menu with most entrees coming in at between $17 and $22. There are quite a few appetizers to choose from as well, most being around $8-9.

I ordered a simple house margarita on the rocks with rim which was pleasant, not too tart, possibly a little light alcohol, but good none-the-less. My BF ordered the sangria which he loved so much that he didn't even save me a sip!

We decided to go for the Crab Guacamole (just under $12) and were pleasantly surprised to find that this was prepared table side, to your specifications. The serving of this appetizer is just about enough for 3 people to share. A generous portion served with a good stack of chips and pitas.

For mains, I had the Steak Fajita while the BF ordered the pork carnitas. Both are served with sides of refritos and rice, while the fajitas also came with pico de gallo, guacamole and sour cream. 

The steak fajitas is enough for 2 people, especially if you started with an appetizer. I am not afraid to stuff my face and there just was no way I could finish my meal. The leftovers will make a great lunchtime sandwich!

The pork for the carnitas was quite good too if just a little too sweet for my taste. That said, my BF devoured it. 

Once finish, our waiter happily brought over some take-out boxes along with some utensils. 

My notes would be that the waiter seemed somewhat overwhelmed with an unexpected rush mid-afternoon. The margarita, as mentioned, was a little light on alcohol, I think they are more used to making the frozen margaritas. 

Overall, I would eat here again but only order an app or two and then share an entree as the portions are quite large.
