New York New York is one of my favorite places to visit in Las Vegas and this time the vibe was as cool as ever. My beautiful bride had a hankerin' for a chile relleno, so we stopped by Gonzàlez y Gonzàlez, as they were reported to be good.

The place has a really interesting décor, with rough brick walls, red and yellow accents and the usual touches that are supposed to be reminiscent of Old Mexico.

Since neither one of us was exceptionally hungry, we asked if we could split a combo and they readily agreed. Our server was pleasant enough, and I have no complaints about the service.

But while most Mexican restaurants that I know of bring out chips and salsa almost immediately, we were told that there would be a $3.00 charge. So we skipped that. Then the sodas were priced at $3.50, which is much higher than I expected. Our food appeared almost as if by magic, but neither the rice nor the frijoles refritos were hot, but just warm. 

So, nice try Señores Gonzàles - but I can't give you more than a "C" this time.
