This was a truly great meal. It was hands down the best  cheese enchiladas I have ever had. The sauce was sublime and just a little smoky. My hubby had something with pork, which he is now forgetting but thinks might have been carnitas? Anyway, he said it was really, really good - the best meal he had in Vegas to be sure. They also have a separate vegetarian menu - nice!

 I do have a couple of gripes - the chips and salsa are not free and they will not mention this to you if you ask for some. I saw them come out to another table so I asked because I thought they forgot. Gripe number two, the prices are pretty high. With that said, it was still really good food.
