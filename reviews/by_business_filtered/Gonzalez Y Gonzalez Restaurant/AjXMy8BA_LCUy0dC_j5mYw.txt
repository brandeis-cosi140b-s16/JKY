Decent place nothing special. 

The service here was good and the food was just mediocre. We all got s variety of different things and a few of the items just were kind of bland like my moms steak salad? (Don't know if that's what it was called) the chicken enchiladas that I had were ehhh ok. I was hungover and hungry so I ate them lol.
