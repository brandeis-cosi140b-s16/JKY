On a Friday night, there was only one host working. It's Friday night in Vegas in the summer, it's probably going to be a bit on the busy side. At least one more host would have been better service so you have one to greet and one to seat.  After being seated, it took a while to get greeted. Eventually our server greeted us and took our drink order. Since we had been sitting a while, we knew what we wanted to eat but he did not give us a chance to order all at once. I hate when that happens.  It's busy, I get that but at least look at me while you are taking my order. 

The food was good. I had a tamale and enchilada combination.  The portions were good except I would like to have had a slightly larger portion of rice.  

The lower rating is in response to the lack luster service not the food. I would return for the food.
