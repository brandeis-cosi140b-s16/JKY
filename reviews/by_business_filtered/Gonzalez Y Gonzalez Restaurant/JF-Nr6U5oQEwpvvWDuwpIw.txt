**This review is ONLY for the Gonzalez nachos and El Grande Helado! 

We came back to our hotel after a Cirque Du Soleil show and wanted a nighttime snack so we settled for this place. 

The Gonzalez nachos were FANTASTIC - some of the best nachos I've ever had! Nothing was too overwhelming and I found myself digging in despite my pretty full stomach. It was huge and great to share among the 3 of us. Not only were the various toppings really fresh, plentiful, yet not too heavy, but the chips themselves were really delicious. 

El Grande Helado is basically a giant ball of dense and creamy vanilla ice cream deep fried in a flaky cinnamon shell served with deep fried cinnamon pita strips.... It's death but SO unregretfully amazing.. My parents don't have much of a sweet tooth so I ate basically the whole damn thing. I normally don't like fried ice cream because the fried shell distracts from the ice cream, but in this case, the shell was thin and flaky like cereal and offered great texture to the dish! And of course, how can fried cinnamon strips with vanilla ice cream not be amazing....

These two dishes were the best things I ate at Vegas, and I've been trying tons of places! I don't know how the rest of the food here is, but definitely come in if you wanna try the appetizers and desserts. :)
