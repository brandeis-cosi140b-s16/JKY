We stayed in the NYNY during this trip to LV & our last night in town we were both pretty tired & just wanted to hang out in the hotel for the evening. We chose J&J based on reviews posted here & we are glad we did! The atmosphere was calm & quiet which was a pleasant refuge from the noise & bustle of the strip, the staff was great & the food was awesome! We expected the margaritas to be the standard sour mash lime mixture but we were ecstatic to find out we were wrong! The drinks were real lime juice & had a pretty heavy pour on the booze. Also I was expecting the prices to be 2 or 3 times more expensive than they should be just like everything else on the strip but was very happy to find that prices were about average with any good Mexican restaurant that you would find in any town USA.
