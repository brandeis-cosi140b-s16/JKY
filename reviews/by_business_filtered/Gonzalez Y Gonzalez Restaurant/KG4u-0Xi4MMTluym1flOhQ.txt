I can only give this place 3.5 stars cause I didn't order any food and that's my bad. I was looking for quick drink nearby the Zumanity theater and this place had a walk up bar...perfect. I ordered couple of Margaritas...Ultimate and couldn't believe they were only 9 bucks a piece. Of course I assumed that it will be watered down but no. I watched the bartender pour a good amount of tequila in both of my drinks and they were pretty potent. Needless to say I felt very tipsy but sexy and ready to experience Zumanity :)  I have to try the food next time but the a couple beside me ordered some chips and guac and looked damn good!
