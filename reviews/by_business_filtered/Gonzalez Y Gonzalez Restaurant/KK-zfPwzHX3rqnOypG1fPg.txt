My best friend wanted to eat here when we were staying at the New York New York hotel. She said she ate there before and really liked the food. Since we rarely get to eat good mexican food, I was totally down. 

Long story short - The food was okay (I had the steak fajitas) but there was one MAJOR problem. Our waiter had a mad case of staring. He kept looking at us from one table away. It was so disturbing. Actually there were three waiters just hanging out by the bar talking story and playing with each other while my waiter was staring at us like we were rock stars.

Then, in an effort to give tip I was supposed to get $6 back in change. I asked him to give me dollar bills so that I could tip him what I wanted. When he came back, he assumed he was going to get $5 before even giving me my change back and passed me a $1. I was like, "no, no, no" can I please get my change and get a receipt? He was looking at me really confused, and didn't want to give me my change. 

Finally I got my stuff - I was upset and pissed off that the restaurant sucked. Not to mention my best friend had soup that was filled with salt as well and she was upset too. When we got up to the room, I looked at my receipt and saw that my waiter's name was "Jesus" - no way!
