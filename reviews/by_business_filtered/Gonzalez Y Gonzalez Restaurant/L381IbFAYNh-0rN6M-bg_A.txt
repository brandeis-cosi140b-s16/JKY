Disappointed in the taste and the service! First disappointment; I tried phoning the restaurant to order food to go, they refused.  Told me I had to go into the restaurant to order food.  Second disappointment; ordered a taco salad.  I stated I didn't want any dressing.  I requested salsa only.  But when I got back to my hotel room, I found the salad had ranch on it and no salsa.  Third disappointment; the salad cost $12.00 and didn't taste very good!
