We cruised in on Thursday night and it was empty...a running theme I have noticed on this trip.  We had a really nice waitress and that is why I'm giving this place three stars instead of two.

We ordered the Gonzalez combo platter which included nachos, chicken wings, chimis and shrimp ceviche with a bowl of chicken tortilla soup.  Everything was O.K. nothing really too impressive.  Still the service was good and the restaurant itself is really cool with nice decor.  

I would go here again and try some other menu items...but mainly you come to this place for it's ambiance and nothing more.
