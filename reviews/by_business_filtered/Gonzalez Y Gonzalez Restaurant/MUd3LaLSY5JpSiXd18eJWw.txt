We were staying in the New York-New York Hotel, so this restaurant was right below us. This was actually the first place we ate at on our trip to Las Vegas.

The serivce here was beyond what I expected. There was a Raider/Saints preseason game on TV, and we my chick and I sat at the bar. Wanted to sit down, have a beer, watch the game and relax. Especially after the 3 and a half hour drive over here. The bartender who took our orders, I think her name was Heather, she was a real Cool chick. She was from Denver and told us how much of a Broncos fan she was. I Love It when a chick knows her shit about football! Actually kind of a turn-on.......

Any-who, LOL.
          I ordered a Negro Modelo, and my chick had a Mango Margarita. They use Patron Silver, which gained some points from me. Bartender actually gave us an extra one for free. Which I gladly drank. Our appetizer we shared a chicken tortilla soup, its been a while since I had a bowl of this stuff, and I was shocked on how tasty this soup was, We both agreed that this soup was very flavorful. Highly recommed this soup if your looking for a lil snack. 

For our entrees, I ordered the Barbacoa Chimichanga. Very good flavor, meat was perfect, came with rice & beans and some guacamole. My chick had the three tacos, two beef & one chicken. Nothing amazing about them from what she said. 

Nothing negative to say about this place. Food was good, not too expensive (Mexican Food should never be expensive), the people passing by streets that look like New York is Awesome, but the thing that impressed me the most by this place was the service. Of course the bartender was cool, but everyone else that worked there was just as cool & hard working. The gentleman who brought us our food was polite and you can tell this guy works his ass off for this place. From asking for more limes for our margarita to the sour cream for my Chimi, this places service was what I'll remember from here at New York-New York.
