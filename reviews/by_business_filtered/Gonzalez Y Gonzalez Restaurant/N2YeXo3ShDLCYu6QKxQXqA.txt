A decent "cheap eats" in a casino. I really liked their chicken nachos. The chicken was cooked in a tasty red sauce similar to tinga (tinga is a traditional Mexican dish). I would go back on my next visit to Vegas. The first time I went to this place was for the Latin dancing on a Saturday night about six months ago. On our most recent trip last week we decided to give the food a try while visiting NY-NY.
