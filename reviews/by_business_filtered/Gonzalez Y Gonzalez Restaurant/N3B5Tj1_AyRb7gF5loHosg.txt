Not sure why we ate here but we were at NYNY because our girls wanted to ride the roller coaster.

In any case, we decided on Mexican and boy was that a mistake.  I ordered the fish tacos and the fish was really quite fowl tasting ~ not fresh at all.  Okay, so I moved onto the refried beans and rice ~ simply the worst ever ~ how hard is it to make rice and beans anyway???

The waitress noticed that I hardly touched my food and asked if she could bring me anything else.  I deferred given that they could not make decent rice & beans.

To top it off, I had to argue with both the waitress and manager to have the  meal removed from the bill.... Enough said.
