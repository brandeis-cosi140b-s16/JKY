Ok, so looks like there are two categories of reviewers here, people either love this place or hate it. I am definitely the former. We were staying at NYNY and this is hand down one of the best parts of the experience. We ordered the guacamole (which they make in front of you. Cool! And that taste that you can't quite place in it? Cilantro) and as entrees the tacos, wet burrito and chimichangas. Our server, I believe his name was Alphonso, was so nice, the service was excellent! It is expensive but I honestly felt it was worth it. My dad ordered a whiskey and it ended up being something like $15, so that was a but of an "oh ok," but other than that it was great. Highly recommended if you're in Vegas and in the mood for mexican!
