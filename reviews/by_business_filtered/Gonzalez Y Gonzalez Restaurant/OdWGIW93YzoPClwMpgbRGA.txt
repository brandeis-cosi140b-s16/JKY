Decided to eat here because we are staying in New York New York and the positive reviews on yelp. The food was good and decent portions. The service was also GREAT!! The Salsa for the chips was amazing. I was actually pleasantly surprised because everyone knows that good salsas are hard to come by. The restaurant is adjacent to a bar/club with great variety of Latin music. If you are looking to get your feet wet in to the night scene in Vegas but are timid or shy and not quiet ready to make the plunge this is a great transitional place you can go to. Because if you are not feeling like dancing or getting out there quite yet then you can finish your food and not dance. But if you so feel like dancing then you can step right into the scene. Overall great service and a good experience. Another neat fact is that there is actually a Gonzalez Gonzalez in New York City. I love the way the hotel has all kinds of restaurants that are in NY.
