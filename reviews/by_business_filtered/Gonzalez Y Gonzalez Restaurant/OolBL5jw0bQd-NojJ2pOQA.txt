Gonzalez Y Gonzalez does not offer authentic Mexican food by any stretch of the imagination: the tacos are served on hard shells, they do not stock lime juice for margaritas, and the flour tortillas that came with my fajitas were chewy. 

The salsa was tasty enough, chunky and underwritten by a smoky chipotle flavor, but the chips were too thick for my taste. I ordered the vegetable fajitas, and the mixed vegetables were a mixture of excellent and undercooked. The standard cherry tomatoes, onions, peppers, mushrooms, and zucchini were superbly cooked, but the dish also contained some hard, chewy greens that offset that pleasantness. The flour tortillas on the side were not edible.. I believe they did not steam them, so they were sort of... tough. And thick. 

As for the sides, you get your standard rice and beans. I opted for the cilantro rice and refried beans (topped with cheddar cheese, do not expect cojita) which were fine enough. 

The service was friendly, and the food arrived promptly. 

The bottom line: If you're in a pinch, it's better than opting for the food court and probably wont cost you much more. Go elsewhere if you're looking to eat well, because this place seems to be fairly hit-or-miss in terms of quality.
