This had always been our favorite place to eat whenwe come to Vegas.  Since our last trip (year &1/2 ago) the prices went up, they now charge for chips & salsa, and drink refills. They also tacked on an 18% service charge since their wees 6 of us. The service also seemed  impersonal. We need to find a new dinner spot for our next trip.
