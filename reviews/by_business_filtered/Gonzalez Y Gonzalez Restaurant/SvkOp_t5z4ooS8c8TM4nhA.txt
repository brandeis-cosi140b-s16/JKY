Not the greatest Mexican food I've ever had, but certainly not the worst.  The waiter wasn't that great, but he did ensure fast service.  I ordered the chicken tortilla soup, the cheapest thing on the menu, and quite tasty as well.  The soup had generous portions of chicken (this is nice because restaurants skip out on meat portions quite often).  Instead of traditional red salsa, they give you salsa verde and another dip that tastes similar to guacamole, but in a salsa form.  Good food for a good price, but there's nothing special about this place.
