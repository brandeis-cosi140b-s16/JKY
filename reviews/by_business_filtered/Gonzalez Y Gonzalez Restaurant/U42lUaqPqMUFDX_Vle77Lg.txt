Yummmy yummmy! my bf and I were tired from scrambling around different hotels for that night so we decided to eat at this little mexican place at NY before our show Zumanity started (which was like 10 steps away). The salsa for the chips was SOOO GOOD (not watery and not too full of random crap) Anyways, He ordered tacos and I ordered the steak salad. We were in Vegas for 5 days and the whole time we kept craving to go back. My steak was so tender and the sauce over the lettuce had such a great taste to it. Everything on the plate was delicious. The onions, the tomatoes, the avocado. BASED on what I was looking for it was perfect. Not fatty with a lot of taste. Not a day goes by, do I not think about Gonzalez y Gonzalez. Mmmm
