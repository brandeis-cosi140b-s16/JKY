Overall experience was not good. The guacamole had too much lime.  They charge u for everything including salsa and for chips also.   The waiter we had was not friendly. The tortilla soup was bland and served cold.  The food was lukewarm when it arrived.  Fish tacos were not tasty at all.  I would suggest to just past this place by when your walking thru New York New York!
