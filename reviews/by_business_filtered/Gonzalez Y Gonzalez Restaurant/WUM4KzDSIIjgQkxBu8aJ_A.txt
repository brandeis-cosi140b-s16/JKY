Coming from Southern California, one would think that I would be tired of south-of-the-border cuisine as I visited Las Vegas. Perhaps Mexican food is in my comfort zone, but as I strolled through New York-New York around dinner time, Gonzalez Y Gonzalez sounded very appetizing.

It's a small restaurant, with many tables outnumber the few booths. Our waitress was below average to everyone she was serving, though my party and I noted that the other waiters seemed more attentive. The bar served 48 oz frozen margaritas, which could be seen on many of the dining tables. It's also good to note that there is a wide selection of tequila and margaritas offered.

Like many Mexican restaurants (at least in California), chips and salsa were presented as starters. The salsa was amazing, with the chips not lacking either. I ordered a chicken enchilada and chicken burrito two item combo, along with a mojito. The mojito was delicious; the drink was almost green from the mint. Both the enchilada and burrito did not disappoint, either. The chicken was moist and flavorful, and the sauces covering each item were delicious. The beans were tasty, but the rice was not good. It tasted like the microwavable kind. 

Overall, the food was very good, and well-priced. I was surprised to find it comparable to the great Mexican-American food chains found in California.
