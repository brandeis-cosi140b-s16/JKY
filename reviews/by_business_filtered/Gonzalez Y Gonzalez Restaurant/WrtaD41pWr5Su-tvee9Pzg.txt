What a nice surprise! We've been staying at New York New York for years and had never eaten at Gonzalez Y Gonzalez. I honestly don't know why because it was wonderful.  My husband and I split an order of fajitas as they are quite generous. Everyone in our party had a great meal, we will go back next visit to NYNY.  They have $5 margaritas and daiquiris during happy hour. Our waiter, Raymond, was a gem! Probably the best person we dealt with at NYNY.
