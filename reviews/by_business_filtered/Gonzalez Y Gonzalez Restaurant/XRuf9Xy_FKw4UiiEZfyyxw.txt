We ended up coming here pretty late on evening.  The service was fast so that was nice when you are hungry but they were not very busy so I don't know if this is normal service for them or not.  

I had the chili rellenos, it was OK overall.  The rice was strange in my opinion as it had carrots it in.  It came with 2 stuffed peppers, I could only eat 1/2 of once since I had a stomach full of frozen drinks.  

My husband had their version of a caesar salad and said it was just OK.  My mom had a chimichanga and said it was greasy.  The chips and salsa were good and tasted fresh.
