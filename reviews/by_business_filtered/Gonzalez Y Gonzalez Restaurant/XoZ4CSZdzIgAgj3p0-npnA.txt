My group of friends and I went to this restaurant after casually walking around NY NY trying to decide where a good, casual place to eat would be. Came across GyG and decided to give it a try. Loved it!! To start off, the chips and salsa, delish! The salsa has some kind of bbq grilled taste to it. We tried to figure out what made the salsa so unique, and we couldn't figure it out...we just know we all liked it. All five of us ordered something different and each of us were very surprised. We ordered steak nachos, pozole, shrimp ceviche, tortilla soup, and a chimichanga. We all left very satisfied and had no complaints about the food. I will definitely go back next time i'm in Vegas.
