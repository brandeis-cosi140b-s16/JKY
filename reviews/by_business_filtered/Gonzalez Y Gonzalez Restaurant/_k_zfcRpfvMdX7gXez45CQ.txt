Very good chips and salsa.  Los...if you read this your table side guacamole is the bomb!  Try the Cadillac margarita on the rocks.  And ask for the server named Los.

Los!....We asked for you Sunday Aug 19....you were not there...so then we just asked for a booth.  Mimi was a very good server, but we missed your excellent service and sense of humor.
