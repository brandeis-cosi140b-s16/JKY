This was one of our favorite casual restaurants during our trip to Las Vegas. The chips were amazing. We ordered a variety of entrees and they were all amazing. 
I liked the atmostphere of the restaurant. It towards the middle of New York New York on the ground floor, but it is away from the loud noises coming from the casino. It is in the middle of a cute New York street, which i enjoyed. They have an inside of the restaurant as well as what looks like a patio. It was fairly quiet for it being in a casino. 
The service was excellent. We got everything in a timely manner.
