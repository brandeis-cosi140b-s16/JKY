Coming from Austin, TX, I eat Tex Mex all the time and I've very critical when I find it elsewhere. Gonzales Y Gonzales @ NYNY gets it right. I decided to go all the way with this dining experience and I ordered chips and salsa as an appetizer, chicken fajitas for my entree (my pickiest dish) and their Partron Perfecto margarita.

The chips were decent, obviously not house made, but not poured out of a Totino's bag either. The salsa was nothing to write home about, but neither was it bland and they also gave me plenty of it. My margarita was excellent, neither too stiff nor watered down; expertly made and delicious. The fajitas were always going to be the kicker in this deal though. Even in Austin I'm picky about fajitas, but outside of Texas I rarely find any I like. These fajitas I liked. They weren't burnt, the marinade on the chicken wasn't overpowering or non-existent, and tasted like fajitas as supposed to taste. And the fajitas came with 4 tortillas! I thought fajitas only ever came with 3. Maybe this was just Vegas excess.

Also, as an honorable mention, even though the restaurant in inside New York New York, and I sat on the "patio" the ambiance was lovely. The sidewalk theme of the casino's casual dining area actually worked rather well.
