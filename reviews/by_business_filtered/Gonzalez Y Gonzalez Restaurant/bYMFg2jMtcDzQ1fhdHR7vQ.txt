Pretty good!

The atmosphere/setting of this restaurant is awesome. Located in the New York, New York you will actually feel that you are sitting in an outside table in an alley of the big city. Lighting was of course somewhat dim with some "christmas-type" lights strung above you.

The chips and salsa were very tasty. They use white corn tortilla chips instead of the regular yellow corn at most Mexican restaurants. The salsa was very flavorful as well. And of course, I found myself gorging in these before our meal came.

Lunch was actually pretty tasty. Much better than any chain Mexican restaurant around, I had the two combination plate with a chicken enchilada and beef burrito. Both were very hot and had a good mix of cheese/sauce smothered on top. Rice was flavorful and beans were not too salty or bland.

All in all, we had a great time. The food was pretty good, service was ok, and setting was awesome. Also a rather cheap lunch on the strip.
