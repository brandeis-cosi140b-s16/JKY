Yet another place for tourist slop.

Awful food. Awful service. Not much more to be said.

I could melt Velveeta and dump some chili powder in it, but I wouldn't call it chili con queso. The enchiladas were a wet mess of shredded chicken and zero flavor. The salsa was equally bad. 

I couldn't complain, as our waiter never returned to ask. We had to hunt him down to even place an order in the first place. Maybe he was wrapped up with the one other table having lunch.
