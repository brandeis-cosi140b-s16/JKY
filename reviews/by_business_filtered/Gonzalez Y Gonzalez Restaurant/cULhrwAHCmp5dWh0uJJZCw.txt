Blech!  Don't waste your slots money here!  Very mediocre and pricey (just like Vegas! Ha!).  I ordered the patron margarita and it was undrinkable - tasted like salty dishwater.  It sat on the table all night and the server didn't even ask about it, and seemed surprised when I asked him to take it off the bill.  I had drank so little of it, he had to be careful when he carried it to his manager to "show him so he had proof I didn't drink it"  My meal - chili relleno and tamale with rice and beans - was seasonless.  I kept salting it, but it never got better.  The tableside guacamole was pretty good, but the guy who made it was obviously having a bad day - no eye contact, no smile, no talking - just made the guacamole and left.  Definitely would not return there, not with so many other choices.
