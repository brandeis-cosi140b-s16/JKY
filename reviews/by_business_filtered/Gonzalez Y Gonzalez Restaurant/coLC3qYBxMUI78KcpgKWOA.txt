Being from Texas, I automatically give Mexican food places a little leeway once I leave the state. The positives were that the chips and salsa were really good as were the rice and beans. My husband said his fish tacos were great, but I cannot attest since he did not let me try them. The margarita I had (a house rocks with salt) was decent, but had a slightly off flavor that I could not identify. I guess it could not have been too bad since I ordered another one. I ordered the shrimp tacos which by themselves would have been two stars. The sauce they had on them was just weird, and the shrimp was overdone. 
But, the service was great - really friendly and attentive, but I didn't feel rushed.
