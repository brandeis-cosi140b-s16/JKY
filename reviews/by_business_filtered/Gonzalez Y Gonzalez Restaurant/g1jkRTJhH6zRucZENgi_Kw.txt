We decided to try this place because we wanted to see how New York, New York decorated for the holiday season (mildly festive, it turns out; no Rockefeller Center Christmas tree).  It was a little hard to find - it's located on one of the "side streets" that branch off the casino floor.  Don't be afraid to ask someone to point you in the right direction.

Most of the food was good, but the salsa was too hot for my taste.  I asked whether they had a milder salsa, and my server looked at me like I had asked whether they had puppies on the menu.  Unfortunately, my enchilada/burrito combination plate was drenched with the salsa, which made the whole meal unpleasant.  Unless your tastes run to pretty hot food, ask them to hold the salsa, and order a side of guacamole for the chips.  (Both the chips and the guac were good, but not great).

The ambiance was, of course, faux New York side street.  The roller coaster ran overhead; fortunately, they manage to make it a lot less noisy when it runs through the casino than when it runs outside the building.

The selection of margaritas is excellent, if a bit pricey.  Most of them run $15 and up, which is more than most entrees on the menu.  Since I am not a margarita connoisseur, I ordered the happy hour house margarita for $5, and it was fine.

The service was quick, but it would have helped if our server spoke better English, or even Spanish.  (I think her first language originated somewhere in East Asia, but it was hard to tell.)  My wife asked a few questions, and it seems that the server's approach to answering was "Just Say No," which might be fine for drugs but was not very helpful if you're trying to make a substitution on the menu.  Who knows; maybe you won't be able to get them to hold the salsa.
