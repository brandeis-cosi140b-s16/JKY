This place was okay. I would advise not ordering the steak in your fajitas unless you really like your meat well-done (to which I say, you must not really like meat...). Also, cheese does not come with the fajitas and the vegetables in it are not fully cooked. So biting into a piece of red pepper, way undercooked...my tongue was burning off. My boyfriend liked his, though. Overall, the service was fine and the prices were okay. Nothing spectacular.
