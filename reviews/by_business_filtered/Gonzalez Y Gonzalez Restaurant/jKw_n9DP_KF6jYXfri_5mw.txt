This has to be one of the worst Mexican restaurants I've been to. First off, who pays for chips and salsa? For the quality of the food the whole menu is horribly overpriced. It literally took less than 5 minutes for the food to come out. We had just got our chips and dip and the food came out right after. I ordered their burrito and it was disgusting. The flour tortilla was hard, the food was cold, and their idea of ground beef is this nasty brown gunk mashed together that doesn't even look like meat. The queso taste  nothing like cheese. It had this weird taste. We orders margaritas that didn't seem to have any liquor in them. Tastes like straight sweet and sour. The did remake my burrito, which tasted way better than before but still had that horribly goop they called ground beef. I would never recommend this place.
