Been here a few times. If your staying at nyny and don't feel like walking this place is good for apps and drinks. Most impressive is the 3ft margarita. Although pricey at 15 bucks they aren't shy on the alchy and refills are 13 anytime you bring the glass back. Theyre great to bring to the pool and check out the scenery with, if u get my drift.
