Definitely reasonably priced, but this isn't the place you want to go as a veggie on your first day in Vegas when you're hot and tired from an early AM wake up call and plane ride to Vegas.  The belly definitely wasn't happy walking out in the hot sun after a big Mexican lunch.  I was in a burrito stupor for most of the afternoon.

I might come back for dinner on a cool day, but veggie lunchgoers, stay away on a hot Vegas afternoon!
