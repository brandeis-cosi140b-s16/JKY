Recently dined here with my father on 12/15 and came away very impressed. Being from San Diego we appreciate good mexican food and we were not dissapointed. Moreover our server Armando went out of his way to make are dining experience as memorable as possible. My father can be a very picky eater and basicaly Armando listened to what my father wanted. (None of which was on the menu) and recommended something they could make from scratch. Armando is what customer service is all about.  He was friendly,efficient, and a great centerpiece for the restaurant. I ordered the steak fajitas which were great and my father ordered a chicken burrito ()ff the menu) which he loved.  Overrall I felt food was of good value considering you are dining in a casino and ambiance of restaurant was fine. But it was our waiter Armando who made our dining experiance memorable. Thanks Armando!
