I have been coming here since the place opened. We would start our weekends in Vegas with tacos and beer. The food is all fresh, but it just doesn't have much flavor or any sort of spark to it. The inside of the restaurant is clean and not super noisy. Service is never an issue, the food could just be better. If you are hungry and just want something to eat then this place is fine but if you are looking for great Mexican food then I would keep looking.
