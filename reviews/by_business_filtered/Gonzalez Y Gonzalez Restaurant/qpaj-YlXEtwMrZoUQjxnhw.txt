This has been a favorite of my family's since we started going to Vegas years ago.  There have been recent changes in the operation that just make you feel like the place is cheap and trying to nickel and dime  you to death.  They have always had solid salsa and chips, and that has always been part of the meal as is custom in most Mexican food restaurants.  However, on my visit of January 11, 2014 there was no salsa or chips without an extra charge.  A buddy and I ordered nachos and when they were delivered we requested salsa for the nachos and were told by the waiter that he couldn't do that without a charge.  The food was as good as always, but I won't return under the mickey mouse nickel and dime operation that it has turned into.

If you really want Mexican food I would go to Mesa Grill at Caesar's.  It is fantastic.
