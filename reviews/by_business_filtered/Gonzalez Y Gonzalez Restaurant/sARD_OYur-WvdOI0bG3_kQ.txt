Food tasted like if it had been reheated in the microwave. The only good thing about this place were the chips and salsa. Food didn't have much taste, but did make me feel sick later in the evening (perhaps because it's not fresh). I know Mexican food isn't the easiest to digest, but my stomach should be able to handle it since I've been eating it since I was born! This is definitely a no go for me.
