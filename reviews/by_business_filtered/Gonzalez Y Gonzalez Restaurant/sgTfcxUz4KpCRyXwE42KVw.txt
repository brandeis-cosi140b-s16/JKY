Must visit!!!
Steak tacos, fresh guac, awesome drinks and dancing at night! Not into getting out at night? They have HAPPY HOUR too. Hurry up and come here. This spot is awesome and located in NYNY next to Vegas strip exit and Tom Urban. 

I came here on my second day in Vegas and was still trying to figure everything out. The staff is amazing 5 stars. Got the deets on Vegas strip and cool spots around NYNY.

Food:
- Steak tacos. The meat was juicy, tender and seasoned well. Almost melted in my mouth. ~$11
- Guac. It was nice, fresh and chunky. Served in a traditional bowl and had a jalape√±o kick to it. ~$8

Drinks: 
Washed all this awesome Mexican food down with 2 ice cold beers. Forgot cost.

In total with tip I probably dropped $33-$36 bucks. All well WORTH it. Hand downs this was one of the best meals I had in Vegas. Also at night the Spanish music comes on and it's like Latin Quarters Lounge in here.

Stop in, have some food, have a drink, enjoy HH or come late at night and dance the night away. If I return to Vegas, Gonzalez and Gonzalez is in my top 10 of things to do! Enjoy folks.
