Early dinner last night. I'm starting to feel like a Mexican food snob because the food here was just meh. I ordered the crispy tacos thinking I'd be getting a nice fried shell and instead I got something that was more like what you buy at a box in the grocery store. Boo

The chips were pretty good though and out waiter was super friendly so kudos to that.
