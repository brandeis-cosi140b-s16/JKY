This restaurant is located in New York, New York.

Very good food, comfortable seating, no wait for a table at 1PM on a Sunday afternoon.  The server was friendly but took forever to take our order and bring us the check.  Chips/salsa are not served immediately when you sit down, maybe you have to ask for them and they are an additional charge.  We ordered the fajitas, which were super good but only came with three small tortillas.  We had to ask for more tortillas and then the server brought out 3-4 more small flour tortillas.  The fajitas were plenty for 2 people to share.  I had a fun time, enjoyed the food, and would return if I was in the area again.
