Not good "Mexican" food at all. You deserve better! 
Servers were friendly but food left much to be desired.

Worst salsa ever. Carrots and peas in the "Spanish" rice...really?
Burrito was bland and not Mexican! I want to see its papers! 

If you have a jones for Mexican in Vegas, wait til you get to California. If you're looking for a good place to eat on the strip, find somewhere else! 

While you're sitting on the patio or in the restaurant trying to eat your meal, you're reminded that NYNY built a rollercoaster through the hotel/food area. So every 10 min a group of SCREAMING youngsters go by. Happy digesting on that one.
