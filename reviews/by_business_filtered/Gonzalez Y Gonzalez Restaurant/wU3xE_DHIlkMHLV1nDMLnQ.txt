Since we was staying at NYNY, we  decided to check this place out late at night. No cover charge, just a little donation in the entrance is all that's required! Small place to dance, but it was cool. Good ambience here. Beer was reasonably priced. The  music is what I enjoyed! Nothing but Spanish music to get the evening going!! Overall it was a great experience, except for this drunk girl that kept bothering my girlfriend!! But we didn't let that ruin our night. U gotta wait a while for the bartenders to attend to u, like it is usually. Overall, great experience, here....would come back!!!!
