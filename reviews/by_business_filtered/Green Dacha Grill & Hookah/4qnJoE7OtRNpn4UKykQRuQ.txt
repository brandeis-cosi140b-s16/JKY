I had my doubts of a combination Hookah lounge and restaurant, but I was pleasantly surprised when we tried Green Dacha.  The food we had was awesome.  Everything from the Greek salad, the Baba Ganoush along with some favorites on the menu....and the french fries are the best I've had in town...very crunchy and crispy...I will definitely go back!  I also enjoyed the Russian red wines.  This is worth checking out!
