I was craving Beef Stroganoff so we decided to try this new restaurant. It looks like a small cabin from the outside and is quite cozy inside. It even has a fireplace. There are tables with chairs and tables with couches, and outdoor seating in warmer weather. The lighting is low and the Russian EDM is loud, but really enjoyable. My husband ordered the Beef Stroganoff, but I changed my mind and opted for the Schnitzel. It turned out to be a great choice--the chicken was tender, and the breading was just crispy enough and very flavorful. The Village Potatoes were soft and moist on the inside with a crisp coating. And finally, the salad was a mixture of lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, and red peppers, with a simple oil dressing. It was a meal I would definitely come back for! My husband was equally impressed with the Beef Stroganoff. When we couldn't decide what to have for dessert they "treated" us to their Neopolitan Cake because it is typically Russian. It has layers of flaky pastry with cream in between--yummy, but not too sweet. The food prices are reasonable and the service top-notch. I can't speak to the quality of the hookah since I'm not a smoker, but I'm already looking forward to coming back for the food AND the loud music!!
