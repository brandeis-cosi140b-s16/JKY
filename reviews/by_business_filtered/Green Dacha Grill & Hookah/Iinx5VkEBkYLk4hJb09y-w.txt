Great atmosphere, superb service, and GOOOOOD FOOOD! I usually expect the healthy choice in any restaurant to be a compromise.  Not at Green Dacha! I ordered the chicken breast plate, and honestly this was the best I've ever had it prepared - even the rice was seasoned and tasty as is and needed absolutely no condiments or sauce! Will definitely come back to try the breakfast.
