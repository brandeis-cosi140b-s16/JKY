Really great food, and the place is very spacious with clean air! The place looks like a house, and I view it as my second home! It's not too noisy, but what I really love was the food. You can tell it was fresh, and since I'm trying to eat healthy, their dishes are healthy in itself. 

I got a grilled chicken breast, and it was a big portion with fresh salad and potatoes. My friend got a seafood soup, and both were amazing. It was very filling, and I took the leftovers home and it still tasted amazing the next day!

They had the best bread I've tasted in awhile, and it's authentic Russian cusine. The desert is amazing as well! 

The owner was very nice, and he talked to us and asked how we were doing a lot. He gave good service, but sadly he was too busy so we didn't get to say goodbye. 

Other than that, it was really great and I live 5 mins away. Pricing is great, and overall everything was great! Definitely giving a 5 star! 

The owner definitely shows his passion through his work!
