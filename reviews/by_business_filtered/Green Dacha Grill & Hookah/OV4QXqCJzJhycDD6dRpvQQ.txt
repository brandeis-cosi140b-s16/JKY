We bought a Amazon Local certificate after reading the reviews and were looking forward to dining here.  We went after Church on Sunday and arrived around 1:00 pm.  You would expect the restaurant to be busy at that time, but as we were parking we were in doubt that they were open as the lot was empty.  We parked and went in to find the place empty except for one person (owner/employee ?) and they were sitting at a table ASLEEP.......... We turned around and left, as we were leaving saw this person (a man) look out the door as we must have woke him.
The place was very dingy and dark and very un-inviting.  I have to agree with one of the other reviewers that all the 5 stars are trumped up.  I wouldn't go back if it was free.
Called Amazon Local and told them what happened, they were very much in agreement with me about the situation and gladly refunded my purchase.
I would like to say everyone has an off day and maybe this was theirs??
