Great food, nice environment, convenient location.  I've been waiting for the place to open, and it was so worth the wait. The place lived up to my expectations. So satisfied with the place. I always ask for my food to be prepared a certain way, and they do it the exact way I ask for. They are so on point. Wonderful service. Can't wait to go back!!! Oh, and the hookah is great!!
