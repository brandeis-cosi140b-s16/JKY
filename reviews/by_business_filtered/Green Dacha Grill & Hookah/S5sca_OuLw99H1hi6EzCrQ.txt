Had lunch here today. I wasn't real hungry so I ordered just one beef pirojki. It's a flaky pastry pocket stuffed with a moist ground beef paste and it's quite tasty. But afterwards, I still felt hungry so I ordered the Kiss Cake, a 3-inch diameter round cake. It's a white cake layered with white cream that's imbedded with bits of strawberries. Very yummy! Today they were playing "Chill Out" music from YouTube, so it was indeed a very "chill" lunch!
