This cozy little restaurant/lounge is truly becoming a favorite of ours. The Beef Stroganoff is outstanding as is the Schnitzel and Chicken Kiev. The servers are very friendly and attentive, and they are dedicated to making their new establishment a success. They ask you what you like about your meal and what might need improvement. I have nothing negative to say about the food. It's amazing. I don't know about the hookah, but the other reviews seem to be very positive. In my first review, I praised the loud, Russian EDM--a personal preference of mine. In subsequent visits, they played other varieties of music which I wasn't really into. I guess if I had one slightly-less-than-positive comment, I'd wish that they'd go back to the EDM. So next time, I'll ask them and I'm betting they will accommodate my request!
