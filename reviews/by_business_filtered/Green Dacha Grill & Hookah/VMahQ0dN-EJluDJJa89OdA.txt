My mom bought me a groupon as a gift for green dacha grill & hookah. So me and my fiends came here. We did not expect to get this great service. All of my friends loved the place. The food was so good! The owner of the place made my b day so good. The gave us free cake and they took care of us so well. I defiantly will be back! Thank you guys for everything
