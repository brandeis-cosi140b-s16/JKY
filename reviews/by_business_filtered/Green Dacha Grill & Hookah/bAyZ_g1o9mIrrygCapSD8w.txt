Alex was such a gracious host, I needed a place to work on my laptop AWAY from the house (remote workers can sympathize) so I usually look for hookah lounges to work at. Today is my first full day living in LV so I researched this spot and called in to make sure they offered wifi (which they do). I ended up having a delicious kebab platter followed by a green tea w/ mint, lemon and honey. All while being accompanied by a double apple hookah, so good. I was able to get most* of my work done (which for me is an accomplishment) and will become a frequent at this spot for many more days to come. Thanks Alex, look forward to having our salsa socials at your venue!!!
