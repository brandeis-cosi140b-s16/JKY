I come from NY and grew up on Russian food. After moving to Vegas four years ago, I was very disappointed with Vegas' lack of East Euro food. 

When I heard about Dacha I was excited and went there to eat. The service was good, very clean inside and even the music was enjoyable.

The reason for the two star rating is because of what happened with the food. The food itself, Russian stew and Russian salad, was very enjoyable. I pretty much ate it all. However, about two hours later I started getting sick and by nighttime I was vomiting for hours. 

I'm used to eating this food from the family and I have a strong stomach (have not vomited in 12 years until now). Not sure what rubbed me the wrong way, possibly a spice was used that I'm not familiar with. Not sure what it was, but certainly not running to eat there again.
