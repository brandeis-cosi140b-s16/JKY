had never tried authentic Russian food, so this was a fun experience.  The reason I am not giving it higher stars is that some of the food was great, and some was not.  The desserts, not so great.  The music was so loud could not understand the waitress and had to shout at her to place our order.  Plus we could not converse. So the atmosphere left us kind of cold.  It was not comfortable and inviting. I guess if you're going to drink and hang out it's okay but not for dinner.  The owner is nice.
