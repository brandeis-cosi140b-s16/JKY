The server was nice. She doesn't speak English very well though. Spoke too soft for the loud music playing. 

The food was good. I got hummus with ground beef. And my friend got beef kabob with a side salad for me. The unique garlic sauce that the beef kabob came with was so good! The potatoes were good too. The side salad was awful though. I don't know what kind of dressing it was. 

Complaints: The waitress took 20 minutes to come give us the bill after we were finished and we were the only table there. she was too busy talking with her friends and showing each other stuff on their phones. She said she would honor the $5 off check in on Yelp and grabbed my phone to do it. we got the bill and she didn't take $5 off. Also she didn't refill our waters. 

I love Mediterranean food. I won't be coming back here though.
