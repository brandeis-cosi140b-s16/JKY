My group was looking for a Russian restaurant in Vegas and this place popped up with good reviews. Made a reservation for 12 people and when we showed up we were literally the only people there. At that point we were def a little hesitant cause why would a restaurant in Vegas with good reviews be empty at 8:30 pm??

Food was amazing!!! We got a bunch of apps and tons of entrees and shared them all. I don't rembmber any names but literally everyone liked every dish which is hard to do in my group. Try this place out if you in Vegas and wanna try good Russian food off the strip
