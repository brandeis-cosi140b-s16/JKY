The table seating outside with sand at your feet and cantina style seating indoors, be assured Guedo's Taco Shop is the real deal. The staff was friendly and helpful, especially when we told them we were from out of town. We chose fish tacos and beef tortas, both were delicious! The green sauce was our favorite of the salsas. Great food, low prices, and an authentic Mexican Cantina vibe.
