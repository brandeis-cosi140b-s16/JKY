I wish I could write a better review but can't.   Guedo,  the owner,  overcharges.   A lunch special gets costly. They change for cheese that is expected in tacos everywhere.  Guacamole extra but this can be expected.   My mom preferred two tacos but they still charge the the combo rate when she declines the rice and beans.   Plus they charge over $1 for debit and credit.   Finally,  they don't give you a receipt and I  did not feel like arguing so I just paid the excessive cost.   No wonder he hardly had customers and they closed down the other two shops.  Food was ok but I felt cheated and won't go again.
