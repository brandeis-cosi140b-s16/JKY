The cash-only policy and getting nickel and dimed for everything annoys me a lot, but I'd probably be willing to overlook it if the food were really good.  It's decent; I wasn't disappointed but I wasn't blown away either.  I wouldn't choose to go back, especially with so many tastier and cheaper options around, but if I were with someone who wanted to go I wouldn't object.
