Guedo's has been around forever; I remember going there a few times probably before I was 10 years old.  However, while the food is decent enough, it's overpriced.

Take the tacos, for instance. The beef and chicken taste pretty good, but not for $3 a piece (more if you add on cheese, etc), especially when there is no service involved, akin to a fast food restaurant.  Factor in that it's a hole in the wall type establishment (which I'm absolutely fine with) and the prices should definitely be more reasonable.

The fact that they charge for using a credit card is also absolutely ridiculous.  I didn't receive a spiel about how transaction fees are killing small businesses like some of the others here (and everyone, including the owner, was nice enough), but the fee they charge their customers is obviously inflated and aimed at turning a bit of a profit, despicable.  The transaction fees they pay are part of doing business and should be incorporated into the overall prices of their food (which are already too high).

This sort of practice will harm their business far more than the transactions fees they have to pay ever would.
