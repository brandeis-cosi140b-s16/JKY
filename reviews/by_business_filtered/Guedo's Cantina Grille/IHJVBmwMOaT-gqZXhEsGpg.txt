This place is horrible.  Depressing atmosphere, poor quality food, very small portions, but high prices.  Flabby corn tortillas, very little filling (tacos, burros, quesidillas), and barely warm.  No chips available on weekdays.  Ordered items with pork and was told it was "spoiled."  I can't believe this place stays in business!
