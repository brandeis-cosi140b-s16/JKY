The 3-stars are because the prices detracted from the taste of the food.  I couldn't believe how much they expected from the little portions that they served.  This is DEFINITELY NOT a family or college student place.  At these prices, this place should be in Scottsdale.

Service:  They are what you'd expect from a service establishment.  The wait staff is working, so don't expect pleasant conversation or friendly banter.  This is a business.
Price:  Where else can you pay $8 for a 2-taco meal?  and do you want a drink with that--- because it will cost even more...
Taste:  Average.  It's mexican food from a mexican restaurant, so it's exactly what you'd expect.  Please don't expect something spectacular.

The prices for stunning little portions will definitely keep me from coming back.  I ordered my food from the cash register, and couldn't believe that they thought the portions for my money were OK.  I could've easily eaten two portions for a lunch portion, and yet it would've been $16.  

Don't expect college-student prices from this Scottsdale-type price list, and don't expect college-student portions from this meager-portion list.  Also, don't think that their idea of a single-portion would feed an American male...  I heard that John Wayne was 6'4" tall, and I'm not THAT big.  Since I wasn't satisfied, I'm SURE he'd never be satisfied by what they wanted to charge for a single, American-man's portion.  So sad.
