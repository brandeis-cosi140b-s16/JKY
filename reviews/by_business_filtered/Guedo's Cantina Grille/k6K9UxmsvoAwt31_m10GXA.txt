I really enjoy Guedo's Fish and Shrimp tacos - they come heavy with well-prepared (ie. not overcooked shrimp) ingredients and the sauce is soooo yummy.  I also like the salsa-bar they have chock full of radishes, cilantro, onions, and several types of salsas.  I enjoy the low-maintenance of this place, though sometimes it seems a little too low .. but, again, that is the atmosphere of this place, so it honestly doesn't keep me from returning.  Note, though, that some might consider his fish/shrimp tacos expensive (IMHO, shrimp shouldn't be priced like a 99c value meal.. it just isn't!... but that's just me!)

I like to hang out and wait for my food by the register because sometimes the cooks there sing along to the Mexican music and it's quite entertaining.  

I wish this place got more business because it really seems like it has great food, but maybe the competition on AZ Ave with all the Mexican joints is too much...
Every so often, I CRAVE their tacos, so I would say I'm a lite-regular.
