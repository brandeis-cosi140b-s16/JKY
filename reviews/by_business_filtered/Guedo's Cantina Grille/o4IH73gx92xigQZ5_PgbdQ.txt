This is one of my favourite taco joints in the Valley.  I used to live in Chandler and came here often. Recently I stopped by for the first time in 12 years and nothing changed.  The place looked exactly the same and food tasted the same. 

I must say that I nearly always applaud consistency in dining.  

The tacos here are great.  The food is fresh and tastes homemade.  They have a fix-in area by the counter that provide salsa and other condiments.  

The portions are good, not great for the money.  I usually spend about $8 to $10 for a meal, but am not always full afterward.  

They offer lunch specials between 11 a.m. And 3 p.m. during the week.  Otherwise the menu is ala carte.

The Mexican cantina environment is ideal and creates an authentic beach like atmosphere.

The staff is friendly and you can usually find a table.
 
Overall Guedo's is one of my favourite places in the Valley.

I must say that my last view visits have been a turn off.  The portions get smaller and for the money it is simply not worth it.  I like to pay with credit card when I am able to do so.  Each time I pay for my meal I am asked if I can pay in cash.  The answer is simple - no.  I am overpaying for my meal and the interchange fee should not be over 2%.

I enjoy the food, but not the hassle...........
