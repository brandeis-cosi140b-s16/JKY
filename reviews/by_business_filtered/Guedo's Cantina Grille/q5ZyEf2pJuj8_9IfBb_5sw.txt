Fresh and delicious, no question there. I can't really add much to what people have said about the food. It is very good and everything is made when you order. They have a great salsa bar offering a variety of salsas to satisfy your pallet. 

 There are 3 big problems that keep Guedo's from a 4 or 5 star rating. 

1. No combination plates. 
2. EVERYTHING costs extra. If it isn't in the description on the menu, it will cost you to add it. 
3. Cash/Check only.

These issues don't mean the food isn't worth it; it does mean that we don't go here as often as we probably would otherwise.

Try Guedo's out if you haven't yet. Just know what to expect when you get there.
