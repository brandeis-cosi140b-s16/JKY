I found the food to be okay, not great,  but the prices were quite high.  $3 for a side of chips and I think you could have counted about 35 chips in the bowl.  The salsa was delicious but the chicken burro was not that good and again quite pricey for the small size of it.  Also, shabby chic would be a huge upgrade from this mess of a restaurant.  Just a little too run-down for my liking.
