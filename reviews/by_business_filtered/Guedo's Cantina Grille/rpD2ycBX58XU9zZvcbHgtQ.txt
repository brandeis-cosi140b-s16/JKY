I've gone here off and on for nearly 20 years...I'd go more often but honestly, it's way overpriced.

Food is fresh and delicious which brings me back...but shortly after I walk in I remember why it is often 6-12 months between visits.

First, it's cash only...they have an ATM inside which charges you 3 or so dollars to make a withdraw - that's a pet peave of mine - a business should make it easy for their customers to buy from them.

So sour taste write off the bat...then the prices. If you like cheese and guacamole on your taco...it'll cost you nearly nearly $4 for one taco - that's ONE TACO, no beans/rice (that's extra) and NO CHIPS - they don't have them.

So I was in the area a couple weeks ago and took my family there for lunch on a Saturday to introduce it to them - it costs $60 for lunch for 6 people...which is absolutely rediculous (and yes, I had to pay a fee to get money out of their ATM because I forgot to take out cash prior.

Save some money and go to Elmers Taco Shop down the street...you can feed the fam and have enough left over to see a movie.
