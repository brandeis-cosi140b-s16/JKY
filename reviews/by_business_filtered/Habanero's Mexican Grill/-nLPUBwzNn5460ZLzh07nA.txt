This place had pretty good chile Rilenos and I was pleased with them. The lobster tacos were out of this world and I'm saddened we didn't come back for more. The chicken my kids got had a funny taste, and therefore I can't give it 5 stars. It was a small restaraunt and our party of 7 took up most of the place.
