Folks in my office had been telling me about this place for a while so I finally decided to try them out...look up the phone number and dial and it rings....rings...rings...rings....FINALLY someone answered! Although it took a couple attempts (3rd call :p) when I got someone on the phone the service was super friendly! 

When I went to grab my lunch, the place was packed and crazy so I had to wait  few for my order but the service was again super friendly and totally on top of things. I actually just sat there and watched their AMAZING grill cook do his thing (sounds weird but go watch, it's fun!)

Got the salad back to my office, oohed and ahhed at the presentation (sometimes, food is just PRETTY) and dug in-WOW! BEST grilled chicken EVER! Super juicy, fresh, flavor galore! Lettuce?.....ehhhh well it's all about the grilled chicken anyways :P

Aside from the phone difficulty at the start (can't fault a place for being popular/busy) my experience with this place was an "A" for sure.   Just make sure you have some time to order from this place :)
