OK, this was my first time at Habanero's today and I went with my co-workers. YUM!! I ordered the fajitas, steak, asked for extra onion and got it. Delicious, not salty like some of them are. came with tortillas, rice, guacamole and sour cream. So good. The place is busy so get there early for lunch. If you pay cash you get free chips and green and hot salsa. I will be back. Sit inside or outside, clean restaurant.
