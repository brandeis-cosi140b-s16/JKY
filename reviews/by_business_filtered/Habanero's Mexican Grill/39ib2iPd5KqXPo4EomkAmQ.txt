So I have had two different breakfast burritos and three different tacos from Habanero's and loved them all.  The carne asada taco wasn't as good as I was hoping, but it definately wasn't bad.

The carnitas is the best I have ever had.  It isn't dry, but it isn't covered in grease and doesn't tast liek it has been sitting in a bath a water.  It was perfect.  The blackened chicken taco was my favorite and the chipotle sauce is amazing.

For breakfast, I highly recommend a chicken breakfast burrito with the chipotle sauce added.  Keeps you full for a long time, is inexpensive, and tastes AMAZING!

If you are in the area, the kind service and wonderful food is worth the stop and any wait you may or may not have to endure.
