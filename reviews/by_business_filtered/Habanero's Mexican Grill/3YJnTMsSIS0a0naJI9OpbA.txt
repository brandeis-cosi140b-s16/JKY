Well, I have to say that I am not fast food eater and I like to seat and read menu, and service of course . Stopped here right after celebration New Year, I was hungry. It looks like fast food, you must order at a counter, but full bar & serve to table. I ordered fajitas with two eggs in top, no problem! Food was soooooo delusionsssssssssss , eggs great, chicken great, veggies just right ... not over cooked , not undercooked! With margaritas! Let new year get started !!!!!!
