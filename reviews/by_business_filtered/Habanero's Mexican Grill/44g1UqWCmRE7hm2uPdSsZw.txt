I'm coming back. As I've said in previous reviews, I have had a wide variety of Mexican food. 32 years living in the American Southwest will do that to you. I've been to greasy 'how are they still open' dives, upscale fusion cuisine and stuff in between. 

Habaneros has no business being a hole in the wall that isn't packed. The food was excellent. My wife went to the Hawaiian joint next door and walked out wishing she had come with me. 

They make their own chorizo (a Mexican don't ask what's in it food) which I enjoyed in the chorizo breakfast burrito. I also ordered the staple of guerro cuisine, the cheese quesadilla. It was all up to standard. I also enjoyed their refried beens (which didn't seem canned) and their Spanish rice. Would have liked the rice to be a bit spicier, but it may have just been overshadowed by the well seasoned chorizo. 

Long story short... Va a Habaneros y comer.
