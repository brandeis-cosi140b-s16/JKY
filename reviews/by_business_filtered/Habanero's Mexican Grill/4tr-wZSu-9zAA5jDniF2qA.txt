Man so many people hand out 5 stars like its candy.  5 stars should be for food that just blows you away.  This is not food that does that.  The food isn't bad at all, i would say its pretty average and will suffice for a quick lunch or dinner.  This is the issue with help and why everyone isnt a good "reviewer"
