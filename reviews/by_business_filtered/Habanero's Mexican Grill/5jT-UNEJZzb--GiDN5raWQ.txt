This place blew me away!! It's a small place, a few tables and a bar. I went during the lunch hour and all the tables were full and after I ordered there were more people pouring in. I got the parrallidas. It's an amazing fajita type plate with grilled potatoes, chorizo, carnitas, chicken and steak. The corn tortillas were warm and the guacamole was fresh! Their green salsa was delicious and putting all those ingredients together totally exceeded my expectations. I will definitely be coming here often!
