Dear Habanero's ,

I love you !! This place has got to be one of the better Mexican food places I've found since moving here from Cali. Everyone who works here is always friendly and the food always comes out fast. I love the blackened chicken burrito and the blackened chicken nachos. Everything I have tried on their menu so far has been pretty damn good.
