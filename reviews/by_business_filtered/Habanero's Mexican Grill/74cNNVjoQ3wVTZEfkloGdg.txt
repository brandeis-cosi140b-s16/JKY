Habanero's is good fresh food at a reasonable price...but it's generally slow to get your food and/or so hectic it takes a REALLY long time to be served.  If you plan on dining there, make sure it's nice out--otherwise you won't find a place to sit inside and will be roasting or freezing outside!

Mad kudos for:
--Cholula on the table
--Really good food

A big boo for:
--15 min wait after ordering...at 11:30...with 2 people in front of us
--Salsa didn't arrive until after we finished eating despite 3 requests
--No real combo options

The food beats Baja Fresh, Chipotle, & Qdoba--and all those places can be hectic as well, but after a couple visits I'll stick with my 3 stars.  Maybe I'll call ahead and pick-up next time...or just drive through the much closer Taco Bell and have some 35% beef :p.
