First let me compliment the friendly and helpful staff, they were very welcoming. Second, the carne asada tacos my spouse and I ordered were just okay. The meat was a little tough and lacked flavor. I had high hopes for Habanero's. I love Mexican food and they're relatively close to my house. I wanted to love the food, but I didn't. I will continue my quest for a phenomenal mexican eatery in Scottsdale, hell, I will even settle for a hole in the wall in Phoenix as long as the food is GOOD.
