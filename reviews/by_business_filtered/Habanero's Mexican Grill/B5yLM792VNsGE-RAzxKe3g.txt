Considering this place is in Scottsdale, the food and prices are really good for Mexican food. I'm still on a search for good Mexican food here an this place does a pretty decent job. 
We decided to try the Parrillada which is similar to the concept of fajitas but so much better. The price is dependent on how many people order it. 1 person is 10.99 and 2 people is $14.99.  Basically you get a combination of carnitas, chorizo, chicken, beef and potatoes on a warming dish.  There is the option to add shrimp for a few dollars more but we didn't get that. The meats are not mixed together but rather side by side. Each person then gets their own plate of beans, rice, sour cream and guacamole. The guacamole is freshly made and they give you a really good portion.  Even the beans seemed homemade too. It also come with tortillas - flour, corn or wheat. Wow, wheat?!  I didn't really like them but hey, it's great to know you have the option. 
For the price and amount, it's a good meal for two people. 
They make their own salsa according to the waitress. We got a side with chips and it ended up being a green and red one.  Both pretty decent but they were a bit too thin for me. I like mine with substance and chunky.  
For drinks, they have self serve orange bang, pineapple whip, horchata, Jamaica. Yum!!! It's not too often you see that.   
The place has great service too. The staff are all friendly.
