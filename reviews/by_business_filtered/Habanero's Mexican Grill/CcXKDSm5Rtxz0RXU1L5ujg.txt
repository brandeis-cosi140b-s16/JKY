OK-so we came here on a HOT, muggy day in the heat of the summer when the air is thick.  When we walked in the door you could barely breath from smelling the habanero peppers they had been chopping.  It seriously thought I was about to have a coughing attack but that's a good thing right?

I had a snack before I ate here and am so bummed about that because everything looked so delicious.  I ordered the carne taco. It was really good!

Hubs had the chili relleno - really enjoyed it.
Kids ordered nachos & one of their nachos plates could have fed the entire family it was so big!  

I can't wait to come back when I have my appetite on!
