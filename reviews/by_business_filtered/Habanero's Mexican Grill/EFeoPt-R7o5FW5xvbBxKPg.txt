Watery, watery salsa.  In fact, it's too watery to be considered a hot "sauce" because even that has some measure of thickness to it.  It's odd that it is paired with chips, because the chips cannot hold any of it as it runs off immediately.  

Such a bold name to have too - Habanero's.  So the food may be spicy, right?  No.  Even the "hot salsa" which is allegedly made with Habanero is medium at best.  This isn't some macho claim that it's not hot enough for me personally; no, it's really not anything like a typical salsa with habanero ingredients.  When the food leans mild it's all to easy to label it as a gringo place, but even more so when it's under the pretense of being a place with some spicy Habanero ingredients.

Service was incredibly slow, and it's another one of those places where it's ambiguous if you sit down for service, or order at the counter.  

Food was above average, served hot, and in a reasonable portion size for the price.  That's the main positive for this place - that the food is good and worth tolerating the other issues.  It's just not an overall great experience here.
