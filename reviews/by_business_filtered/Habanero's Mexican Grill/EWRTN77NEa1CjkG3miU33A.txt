I was debating 3 or 4 stars. I pushing 4 stars for the value. I thought the guacamole was excellent and the green salsa was really tasty. I had a carne taco and a carnitas taco, both were decent but the amount of food your get for the price is unreal. I think I will give them another try and go for a blackened taco. Overall, I thought everything was lacking salt; from the salsas, to the chips, to the guac. I tried the ceviche but I believe there was some imitation crab meat in it. In my opinion, leave the fake crabmeat out and just do veggies and shrimp, also spice it up a bit. The employees/owners are super nice people. Also, I wouldn't say its a hole in the wall by any means. The place is pretty nice.
