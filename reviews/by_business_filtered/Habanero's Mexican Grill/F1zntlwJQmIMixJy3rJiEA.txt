The food here is excellent and I love going there. The only problem I seem to always have is with the kid's menu. I realize this is a mexican place, but my daughter will only eat chicken fingers and fries when we're there. The fries are always undercooked and greasy and the last time, the fryer was closed down.  I got her a plain chicken taco. Basically, she had no dinner that night. 
The staff is always super friendly and I want to eat there every day, but the kids options can be a little tricky.
