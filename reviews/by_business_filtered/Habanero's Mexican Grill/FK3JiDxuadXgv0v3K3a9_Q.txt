I really like this place!! Small, family owned and operated, with very nice people and excellent food.  We've gone for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I usually get Kayla's favorite for breakfast, stacked chicken enchiladas with eggs, cheese and salsa on top. On Friday's they usually have fresh lobster and fish, their lobster enchiladas are excellent. I also like the calamari and shrimp tacos, their calamari could be the best in town. And I like their flan, it is large enough for two people to share. My only complaint is that they charge for chips and salsa, but that isn't enough to take away a star.
