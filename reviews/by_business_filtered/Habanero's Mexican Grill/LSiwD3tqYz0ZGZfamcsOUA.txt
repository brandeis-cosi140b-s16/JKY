Food was ok.  Cook was rushed, threw food down on the counter, most of which spilled out.  Cheese crisp as underdone (meaning cheese wasn't even melted).  Cook put a bus tub on the hot grill, melted the bottom a little, then pulled it off and set it on the food prep counter.  Then he threw raw chicken on the grill, 2 pieces, then pulled one piece off and put it back into the raw chicken after it sizzled on the grill a little.

Place needs a cook that actually knows what he is doing in the kitchen.  If you ask me, I'm not going there again.
