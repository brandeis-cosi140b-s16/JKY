Mediocre Mexican food.  The best pinto beans any can opener can offer up.  The Spanish rice is completely flavorless.  Nachos are decent with steak but get soggy entirely too fast with the pinto bean liquid.  Flautas are okay.  Red and green sauces are too mild and habanero sauce is too hot.  No happy medium.
