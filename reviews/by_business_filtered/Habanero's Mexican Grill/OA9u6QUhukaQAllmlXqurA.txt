Habanero's is a great little spot. It's not usually packed and is always kept clean and tidy. I appriciate the attention to detail and excellent service..The food exceeded my expectations. Great place for a nice meal for 2...or bring the family (very family friendly). I reccomend getting a side of thier Chipotle sauce - its amazing.
