Ate here for the first time last week. I have been looking for good, fast mexican food in the area and this fits the bill.

We arrived at the peak lunch time and the line moved quickly. It was a little tricky finding a table outside, so we reluctantly sat inside. Then one of the workers politely let us know an outdoor table had just opened up and we moved. The patio had a nice vibe to it.

I ordered the carne asada burrito, which was filled with pico de gallo and guacamole. Nice and simple, the way I like it. The meat was perfectly cooked and the guacamole was fantastic. My mom had the blackened chicken tacos, which I tried a bite of (they lived up to the hype!)

SOPAPILLAS: they are seriously the most addicting and delicious dessert out there but not many restaurants seem to have them. I was overjoyed when I spotted the handwritten sign for "homemade sopapillas." For $3.50, you get 3 delicious fluffy pieces of fried dough covered in cinnamon and filled with honey.

Will definitely make this a regular lunch spot. Note: rice is $1 extra and chips and salsa cost $1.29. You do get a couple of chips with your burrito, but no salsa.
