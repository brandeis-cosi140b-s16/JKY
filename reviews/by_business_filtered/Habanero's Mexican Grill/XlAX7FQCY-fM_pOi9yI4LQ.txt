I have been a customer at Habanero's since the joint opened. The food is delicious, they have a great menu, and the staff is friendly. 

Another great aspect of Habanero's is that they cater. Their mini-chimis are a great alternative to wings on Superbowl Sunday.

My personal favorite dish is the buenos nachos. Authentic? Nope, but it's really delicious. Their fish tacos and carne asada burritos are also great.
