Best place for lunch in the valley. At work whenever someone suggests Chipotle, I reply, "how about Habanero's instead". 
What makes it the best:
- 3 Salsas: Green, Red, and Habanero, all hot and each amazing
- Freshly Pressed Tortillas
- Your order is made fresh, the meat and fresh vegetables are all cooked just for you
- Refillable Horchata
- All for a good price under $10
