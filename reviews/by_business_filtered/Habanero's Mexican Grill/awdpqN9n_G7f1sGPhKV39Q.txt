We were vacationers looking for a quick, but good Mexican meal after a hike. This place did not disappoint. We ordered the Parrillada for two, with extra guac and chips. Everything was delicious. The chicken was good, and all other meats on the dish (beef, chorizo, carnitas) were excellent. If anything, we ordered too much food, but gladly ate nearly all of it. The medium and spicy salsas had both flavor and heat. The wait staff is helpful and friendly. Not sure how this place ranks among locals, but for visitors not used to authentic Mexican fare, who are looking for a quick and reasonably priced meal, this is the place.
