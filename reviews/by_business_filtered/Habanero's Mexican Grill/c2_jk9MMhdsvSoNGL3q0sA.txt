I've been coming here since the place opened as I work right across the parking lot. The food is always excellent and fresh. The owner and staff are some of the nicest people you will ever encounter. 

Some favorites: ground beef burrito, blackened chicken salad, fish tacos, and the breakfast burritos (they are massive and filling and everything you could possibly want). Oh, and the sopapillas. Don't ever forget the sopapillas. Pillowy little bundles of cinnamon and sugar with honey if you want. Delicious.

Yes, they take a little while for lunch but it's all made right before your lil' eyes. 

Red sauce is awesome, green is tasty, and the habanero sauce has a good flavor without cooking your face.

These guys also do catering and deliver!
