LOVE LOVE LOVE....my mom and i cleaned up three taco plates, shrimp, carnitas and lobster, plus blackened chicken nachos and chips and guac all for about $30.    Love supporting local family run and owned shops and this is no excpetion, the owner/chef came out to see how our food was and a discussion ensued.  who doesn't love duiscussing good food with another foodie/chef?   Can't wait to go back for the shrimp tacos and anything Carnitas!  MUST TRY yelpers!!!
