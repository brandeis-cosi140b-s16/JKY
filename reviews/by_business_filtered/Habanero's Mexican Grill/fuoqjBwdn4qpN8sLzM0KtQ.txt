I was in desperate need for a taco fix...  Thanks to yelp, I found a winner!

I really like this place.  I ordered a couple of tacos and they were SO good I had to order more.  The ground beef taco is a bargain with all that it contains.  (Lettuce, sour cream, cheese, & pico de gallo). The sour cream really sets it off.  

It is important to note that each order is cooked especially for you.  The meat is not setting in a pan and spooned onto your tortilla.  It takes a little longer, but it's SO worth it!  If you can't wait then you'll just have to drive through a Taco Bell and suffer the consequences.

Enjoy the friendly service and wonderful Mexican food...  I want to come back for breakfast!
