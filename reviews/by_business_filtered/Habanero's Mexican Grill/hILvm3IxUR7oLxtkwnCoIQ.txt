This place is awful. The food is mediocre at best. If I wanted mediocre Mexican food with no service, I would've just went to Arriba's down the corner. I found the food to be saturated with lard and just overall, horrible. The only bright side to this place is that it's cheap. If price isn't an issue, I'd recommend Los Sombreros, right down the road on Northsight. For one, you get service, two the food is better, but it is more expensive.
