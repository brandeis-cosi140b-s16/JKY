Really good Mexican food.  Love the blackened fish tacos and the blackened chicken salad.  I usually judge Mexican food by their chips and salsa as well and I am always satisfied with both.

My husband and I tried their breakfast this past weekend and we were happy with that as well.  Very nice and friendly staff.  So nice to have good Mexican food that's not overpriced!!!
