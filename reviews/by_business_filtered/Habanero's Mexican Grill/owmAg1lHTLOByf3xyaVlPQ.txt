We decided that it was time to try Habanero's Mexican Grill for the first time tonight.  This "locals" establishment is occupying an old Taco Del Mar location (that closed in early 2008) in a strip center behind the Salty Senorita; just north of the Scottsdale Gun Club.  The decor has been upgraded, slightly, from the previous quick-service business.  There is no table service, though there is real-metal silverware and the tables are bused.

I ordered the fried fish tacos and my wife had a carne asada taco.  The kids ordered cheese quesadilla kids-meals with fries.  We split two Mexican Cokes, a Jarriots and a horchata. The total was $20ish and the food was prepared fresh, as we sat at the bar-stools overlooking the grill.

After the meal, we agreed that the quality far-exceeded the price.  The fish tacos were crisp and balanced; the steak-taco was plain and simple with good flavor; and the quesadillas were too-big, and the kids loved them.

Overall we'd give the place a solid 4 out of 5.  The staff was friendly and helpful...even providing me a sample of the carnitas that was freshly prepared; very nice.

This location is situated in a neighborhood that gets blitzed during weekday lunches.  We recommend coming here on the weekend and/or in the evening.
