HIDDEN GEM ALERT!!! I found about this place last week when I made a wrong turn into the parking lot and was starving, so I decided to try it out. 

I've been back 3 times since. This place is awesome.  It's fast, fresh, cooked to order .  To be fair, I have only had the blackened chicken tacos on corn tortillas each time, but they are THAT good.  the serving sizes are no joke either, so be prepared to share or be really full.  

The horchata is pretty damn good too. 

 My fiance has tried the bean burrito, the blackened chicken burrito and the fajitas and all have gotten rave reviews from him and he's pretty picky about his mexican food.

The prices are moderate, which makes it an even better find.  The service is always top notch, eager to help.  Excellent food and great prices, what could be better?
