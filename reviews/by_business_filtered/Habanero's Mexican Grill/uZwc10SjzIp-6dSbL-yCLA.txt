Tried the Blackened Chicken burrito and Ground Beef Taco. Both were good, not legendary. Burrito had plenty of well seasoned chicken, but still seemed small. It was sort of spicy, more like medium. Taco was on a decent flour tortilla, but nothing stood out and green sauce was kind of too spicy for a mild salsa. Crowded on saturday and Horchata was out of a machine, which is far from authentic Mexican.
