For living in arizona, it's really tough to find some decent, authentic mexican food in the north scottsdale locale thus when I tried this play for the first time I was blown away. The blackened chicken is so moist and delicious, the carne asada is flavorful, and the best part of all, there is no need to run directly to the restroom after eating. BAM! This place has just been marked as my go to mexican food in the valley. Keep it up guys.
