Eek! Methinks not. Very very bland salsa. Tastes close to water with a hint of cayenne and stale chips! I had to season them with salt to at least taste something a bit.
I had breakfast steak burrito. Hubby is right. Sonic's tastes better.
We expected good food because of the 4-star reviews in average but left disappointed and wont be coming back nor be recommending this place to friends.
