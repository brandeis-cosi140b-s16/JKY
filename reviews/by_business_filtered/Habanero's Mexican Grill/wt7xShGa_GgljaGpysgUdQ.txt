Giving Habanero's a solid 3 stars because although I do enjoy the food (great fish tacos), the service is incredibly slow. Most of the time when I go there, I have to plan ahead a 20-25 minute wait (at least) for food to arrive, even if the restaurant isn't that busy in the first place. It's frustrating and time-consuming, but tasty.
