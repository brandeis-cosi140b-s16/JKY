I came here for lunch and was going to sit down but it looked so sad and depressing so I ordered my food to go. Then I waited 20 minutes for that order. At that point, I had to leave, so I went to ask the woman at the counter if my order was ready yet, and she turned and grabbed a bag that had been behind her on a shelf for a while! Not sure how long it would have taken to get my order if I hadn't said anything!

The food is good. Mexican fast food, basically. I had a chorizo quesadilla that came with sour cream and guac. 

I don't really see the point in coming back, though. Oh well, I tried.
