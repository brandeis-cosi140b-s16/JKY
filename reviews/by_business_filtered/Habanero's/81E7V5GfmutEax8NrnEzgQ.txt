I hate it when we are on vacation and we waste a meal on anywhere that isn't amazing. This place was not amazing. It was just barely okay. The Guac was just crushed avocados, there was no real salsa, and it was nothing like I was expecting after reading some of the reviews. 

I did like the tortilla surrounding my very dry burrito. The blackened fish was also very tasty, but I didn't enjoy the meal as much as I had hoped. 

I have to say the staff were very friendly, but that didn't make up for the food.

Maybe Californian Mexican food has spoiled me. This is another place I'll never go to again. Feeling quite disappointed. I wish we'd gone to the Old Tortilla Factory, but the Yelp reviews put us off. Maybe we'll ignore the reviews and check it out tomorrow... It's got to be better than this, surely???
