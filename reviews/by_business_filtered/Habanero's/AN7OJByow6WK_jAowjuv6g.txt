I have been coming here for lunch over the past few months and I finally decided it was time to write a review. Habanero's is definitely a nice little spot for lunch, it's quick but the food is made fresh. Being a Mexican food fanatic I know good Mexican food and this is definitely it. Everything on the menu is fairly inexpensive but the portions are a good size, I always leave feeling satisfied. 

My favorite item on the menu is the blackened fish taco salad, it has everything you could ever want on a taco salad from tasty guacamole to satisfying rice and beans. The blackened fish is absolutely amazing, it's cooked to perfection. I highly recommend anything on the menu that has the blackened fish. 

Today I decided to try something a little different. I ordered the a la Mexicana with chicken. It's juicy marinated chicken sautéed with jalapeños and onions, it also comes with a side of rice and beans and warm flour tortillas. I definitely wasn't disappointed. The chicken was flavorful and grilled to perfection. I made tacos out of the chicken, rice and beans and then covered them with the habanero salsa. The habanero salsa gave the tacos a big kick, but it was worth my mouth being on fire for the remainder of my lunch break.

The only reason that I gave Habanero's 4 stars is because I'm not the biggest fan of their salsa. I am a salsa connoisseur (you probably didn't know there was such a thing lol), so I am quite critical when it comes to salsa. They have 3 kinds of salsa, verde (mild), red (medium) and habanero (very hot!). All of their salsas are very thin, they have more of a hot sauce consistency. While the salsas do taste good mixed in with your meal they aren't really ideal for chips and salsa but it all depends on what kind of salsa consistency you prefer. 

Overall the food is delicious, the staff is very friendly and the service is wonderful! I will definitely become a regular!
