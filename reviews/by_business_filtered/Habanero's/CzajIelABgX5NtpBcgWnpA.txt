This place was GOOD. The salsa was a little flavorless, but the chips were awesome, the tortillas were fresh and the blackened fish tacos were seriously delicious. The blackened fish was particularly spicy, but as long as I had a sip of water afterward, it didn't bother me too much (I'm a bit of a wimp when it comes to hot stuff). We will be visiting again. 

The staff was friendly and the restaurant was nice and clean. Big fan.
