I finally found a taqueria in AZ!!! I'm from CA and had been having hardest time finding really good Mexican that wasn't gourmet or a chain restaurant. I'm sooo happy I finally found a place when I'm in the mood for Mexican Food!! Their guacamole is fresh with a hint of lime and the carne asada is delicious!! I can't wait to try their burritos!!
