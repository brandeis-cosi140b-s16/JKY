This is one of the best taco places in Phoenix. I always get the carne asada burrito, and get a side of their habanero sauce to go with it.  It's HOT, but the horchata on the soda fountain helps to cool it off. 

Super friendly staff that know my order without even having to tell them. I haven't been for happy hour (yet) but it looks like they have some great margaritas.
