Five stars for it being my favorite Mexican restaurant in Scottsdale!  I was beginning to lose hope I'd never find good Mexican food.  Thank goodness for Habanero's!

It's definitely one of those great places that will never do you any wrong by ordering today's thing.  Both times I've been here I've ordered from that separate menu item.  First time, I ordered the Blackened Chicken & Relleno burrito that was served Enchilada-style...and was saddened by the reality that I had finished eating this burrito.  The next time, I ordered the Surf & Turf burrito and loved it almost as much as the first burrito I ate here.

You can't go wrong ordering chips & salsa here.  There's nothing like dipping those mult-colored tortilla chips in that salsa verde.

And don't be afraid to order a drink with your food....because they have so many delicious beverages to choose from.  Don't get Coke or Sprite...try something new!  They have horchata, jamaica, timarindo, pina colada, etc.  Try one of those and it won't disappoint.  I'm salivating just by typing those words.
