I know that everyone has a difference in opinions--and this is mine:
My husband and I ordered cheese enchiladas and flour tortilla hard shelled tacos. 
When the food came, it smelled like hay from inside a horse barn. Yes, I almost felt like I was at a 4-H grounds.
It tasted just as bad. No flavor, other than the smell of the horse barn. YUCK!!! 
I took one bite and had to spit it out immediately! 
We ended up leaving without even eating and when the waitress asked if we liked it, I said, "no." I couldn't tell her it was the best I've had when the plates were still full. She proceeded to inform me that the reason we didn't like the food was because we didn't choose the right combo (example: soft/hard shelled, corn/flour tortilla). No, ma'am, the reason is because the meat was disgusting and the food belonged in a barn. 
I'm not quite sure what flavor people are used to, but trust me when I say you won't find ANY here! :/ I really wish I could give this place zero stars!!
