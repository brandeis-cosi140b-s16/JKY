So Good!!! deliciously flavored Mexican food in North Scottsdale...a rare find. 

This place is right by the Gun Club lol.. anyways lets just say i called up in advance to pick up my order and glad I did so.. Ordered a carne asada burrito with a fried fish taco, along with 2 tostadas and the pork carnitas enchiladas for mom dukes. 

Everything had flavor and sauce was spicy not bland and mild like some places are in strip malls. The service was pleasant and very attentive to the customer didn't just eyeball me or stare when i asked for extra napkins lol. 

Ill continue to drop by... but won't eat here every week just due to my good health ha.
