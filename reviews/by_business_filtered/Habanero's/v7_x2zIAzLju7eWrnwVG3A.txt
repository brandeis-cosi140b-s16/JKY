Service is authentically welcoming. Food is authentically fantabulous! Oh, this place has some good vibes! There seemed to be a good amount of "regulars" which is always a good sign, especially with larger-sized familes in this economy. I had the blackened chicken nachos (okay, half an order and wish I had been with someone to share the huge portion). There was tons of chicken, fresh chopped guacamole, plus all the other yummy fixin's one would expect to find. Wash down with a fountain drink, bottled beer, or house margarita and it makes for a tasty treat!
I think I'll go back next weekend to try the breakfast menu - ole!
