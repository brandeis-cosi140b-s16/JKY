Hacienda's is a nice restaurant, hidden and tucked into a strip mall.  We came for HH and had great service and enjoyed the food. We had:

- Queso Fundido: It arrived and I initially cringed because it looked like that bright orange, processed nacho cheese stuff which I really don't like...but something they did to it made it taste so good! There was fresh spinach and tomatoes added in, and some kind of spice added in. The classic potato chips it was served with were perfect with the dip.
- Sopes: Yum! Filling and tasty. The actual sope by itself was a little dry but with all the flavorful toppings it was overall very good.
- Margaritas: Now we got non-HH margaritas and though it was GIANT (I mean like the size of my head), there was barely any tequila in it. It tasted like sweet/sour mix and no one wants to drink that much mixer...My draft beer on the other hand was very good. 

Most of the people in the restaurant were an older age, which attests to the good prices :) I can attest to yummy food.
