Went to Hacienda's after hearing great things from friends/neighbors.

I was very happy with the suggestion to try out Hacienda's.  The food was excellent with service to match.  The restaurant is immaculate inside, the food was well prepared & seasoned perfectly, prices were very reasonable, wait staff was friendly and very professional, there wasn't a time where I had to ask someone for a refill of water/soda/chips/salsa - they were spot on, kids loved their meals & ate everything, bathrooms were spotless, you can even catch you're favorite team while enjoying a great meal!  What more can you ask for?

I'd definitely go back and recommend Hacienda's to anyone looking for great food, great service in a relaxing atmosphere.

Two thumbs up!!!
