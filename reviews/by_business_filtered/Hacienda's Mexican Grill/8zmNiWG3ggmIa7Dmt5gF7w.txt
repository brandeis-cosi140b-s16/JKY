Hacienda's is the place if you want authentic  Mexican food from different regions of Mexico.  There are dishes here you just can't get anywhere else.  If you are lucky enough to go when they have the Lamb Barbacoa (the best dish I have ever had at any Mexican restaurant)  order it and thank me later.  The Cochinita Pibal, Pork marinated in fruit juice and cooked in banana leaves is a savory treat and served with their house made tortillas.  Yum!  The Tomatilla Pork Ribs are also fantastic.  They also have the usual Mexican dishes such as Cheese Enchilada's in a savory red or green sauce or Fish Taco's ect,  all very good. I ask them to make me Shrimp Tacos and they are wonderful.  Try the Cheese Crisp (not on the dinner menu but they are happy to make it for you) as your appetizer!  They have great salsa too!  If you are looking for bland American style Mexican food this is not your place.  Once in a blue moon they miss the mark, but what real good  restaurant doesn't?
