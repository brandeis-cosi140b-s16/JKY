I had to update this review.  We went last night for our third visit - the first two were great!

The food this time around was disappointing to say the least.  Some of it was bland...and the stuff that wasn't, tasted like something it shouldn't, i.e. - the rice that came on the side with the fajitas tasted like FISH.  WHAT the hell is that about?  The guac tasted like it could have come from a box, it had no flavor at all and was thin except for the chunks of onion and tomato, and the chips just tasted weird.  Our daughter kept commenting on it as well.  If I kid doesn't like something as simple as corn chips, there's something wrong.  Everything was just bland.  The drink was decent...but it stopped there.

Total bummer.  We won't be back.
