This is a fairly classy Mexican restaurant.  It's beautiful inside and doesn't look like an Americanized Mexican seaside tourist place.  Comfortable seating - great place to bring a date.
They have a really large bar area and, according to the signs, they have live music (I went for lunch so no music).  They also have a patio area.
I ordered the chicken fajitas.  Very tasty and they served a big portion so go hungry.
I tasted the fish tacos and they were also good.
Service was terrific. They had a kid (around 8 or 9 years old) filling water glasses and bringing out chips/salsa.  
I need to go back in the evening for dinner and check out the happy hour and the live music.
