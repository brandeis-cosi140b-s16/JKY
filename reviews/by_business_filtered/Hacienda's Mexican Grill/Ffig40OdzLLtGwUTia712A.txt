All we had were the street tacos .... carnitas, carne asada & shrimp and guacamole.  The guacamole was fresh with chucks of avocado. The tacos tasted good and were a good value.  We were in time to get lunch prices which was a big plus.  We will be back to try some of there other dishes, but for now it's nice to have something close by where we can get a decent taco at a  fair price.  Nice decor and nice patio area for dining al fresco.
