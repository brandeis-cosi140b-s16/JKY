I'm happy to report that my second experience here was much better than my first.  

This time around, service was wonderful.  The chips are clearly house made and delicious (they even sneak some fried flour tortilla chips in your basket - bonus).  The margaritas are cranium-sized and quite tasty.  My fish tacos were somewhat untraditional but yummy nonetheless.  

The restaurant has a beautiful view of the mountains.  It adds a lot of great ambiance. 

This space has been home to a number of places...  I hope this one makes it.
