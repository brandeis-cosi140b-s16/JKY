The food is bland and flavorless we tried dinner 2 times once during the week and again on a weekend. Same issues both times service is simply slow and lazy the food is not good and equally lazy. My burrito was half grilled chicken and the other half black beans...somehow both halves were equally dry. Just another bad North Scottsdale restaurant.
