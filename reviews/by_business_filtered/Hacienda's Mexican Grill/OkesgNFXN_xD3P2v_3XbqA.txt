Great new Mexican in n Scottsdale very good menu and good tasty food, nice bar area. Really good staff especially JR, hard working crew all very friendly and well trained. Give it a try and ask for spicy hot if thats what you like. Visible managers watching what's going on, busy even quite late. Good luck to them!
