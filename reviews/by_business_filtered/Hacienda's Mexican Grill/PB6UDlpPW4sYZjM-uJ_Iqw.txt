Stopped by this place for lunch yesterday while running some errands. The chips were nice and light, and they mix in some flour tortilla chips that are a greenish color which I assume means there's some guacamole flavor or something. I didn't get a ton of that but they were still good. The salsa was really good. Bright, nice texture, balanced flavors.

I ordered the green chicken chimichanga, because, duh, chimichanga. The chicken was all white meat, juicy, finely shredded, delicious. The portion sizes were good too. I have but two qualms and it's really kind of just nit-picky stuff. 

First, they try too hard on the plating. It's Mexican food. There's no need to be prissy about it. In their defense, they're close enough to Troon that prissy plating is probably required by some city ordinance. But seriously - forming your rice in a pyramid and trying to keep it all separate? Please. Either you make a pretty plate OR you put shredded iceberg lettuce as a garnish, but not both. 

Second, it appears that there's a white woman from the Midwest working in the kitchen. As I said, the chimichanga was delicious and the green chile sauce was lovely, however, it seemed to have a cream of mushroom soup base and they put actual large chunks of mushroom in the sauce. Mushrooms, In green chile sauce. On a chimichanga. Just let that soak in a minute. Then in their little cilantro lime rice pyramid, they put peas and carrots. That's right. Actual peas and carrots. In cilantro lime rice. At a Mexican restaurant. Weird.

As I said, the qualms are nit-picky. The food was overall quite good and the service was attentive without being annoying. Definitely going back. I'll just ask them to hold the peas and carrots.
