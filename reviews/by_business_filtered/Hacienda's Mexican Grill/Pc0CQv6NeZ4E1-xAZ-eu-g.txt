Stopped by for Cinco de Mayo and was pleasantly surprised that "Happy Hour" prices were on and that meant a $3 glass of wine...so why not.

Had the grilled chicken burrito with tomatillo sauce (sauce recommended by my helpful waitress and it was spicey, mildly hot, but not over powering and just what I wanted to complement the burrito.) the combination of refried beans with grilled chicken was very flavorful and there was guacamole and sour cream on the side to enhance or cool the forkful of burrito as you choose.

For me it was a solid four to four and one half star lunch.
