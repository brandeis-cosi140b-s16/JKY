Not sure if this is just normal for a place that just opened but pretty much everything was bad for us. Too bright lighting, dirty seats, hard to read menus, bad salsa, weird chips, terrible margaritas, slow to no service (had to ask for someone to come to the table) $18 for fajitas that contained 6 small shrimp? 3 tiny tortillas with that? Yikes, won't be back...
