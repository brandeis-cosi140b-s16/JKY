After a long wait we tried another trip back to Hacienda.  This time the experience was much different than the several times before.  We only ordered a few items of food, but everything was much improved from when we went over a year before. Service was excellent, Margaritas perfect, not too sweet like you find in so many bars, the appetizers were very good except the three chicken tacos that were exceptionally greasy and not really tacos but more like a pastry puff, terrible.  However, the guacamole is one of the best I have ever had, not creamy and frozen pre made goop, but nicely constructed and fresh. The aioli sauce was also excellent as well as the spinach queso dip.  The salsa that comes with the chips is good, not over salted, but mild.  Ask for their hotter sauce, it will satisfy anyone who likes hot chile, I mixed the two together to create the perfect mix. Along with the corn chips, thin and crispy, they bring a spinach flour tortilla chip which is a nice touch for those who like something different.  The tostadas had a nice Mexican white cheese on them, and black beans.  The food has some flair, and not really standard Sonoran style, but the crafting of the food is good.  A bit pricey for what you get, but this should be a good food trip for guests and out of town travelers looking for something memorable.
