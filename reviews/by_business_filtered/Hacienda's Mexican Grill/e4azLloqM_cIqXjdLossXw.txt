Hacienda's has been in business for several years and the food has remained consistent. The service on the other hand has seriously declined.  Had dinner here with the parents and our server named Fabio left quite a lot to be desired.  I don't think I have ever singled out a server on here before but this guy was out there, like on another planet!  Every request we made with him was met with an open stare followed by confusion. I don't think he had a poor attitude there was just something really off with him and he was extremely slow.  Literally one of the top 5 worst servers I have ever encountered, every interaction was completely awkward and it wasn't just me, my parents were equally put off.  The three star rating is recovered for the food, I had the steak fajitas and they were pretty good.  My parents had shrimp enchiladas and tacos both of them were also satisfied with the meal.  Unfortunate to let service ruin the hard work in the kitchen, hopefully management will take note.
