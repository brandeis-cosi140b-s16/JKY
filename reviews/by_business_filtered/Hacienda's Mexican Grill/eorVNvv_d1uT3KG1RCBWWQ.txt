We make it here about once a month and have always been satisfied. I've had the tacos which are very good but my favorite dish is the Cochinita Pibil (a marinated pork dish). My wife always goes for the chicken fajitas which she says is also very good.

The service here is also very good. Everyone is friendly and knowledgeable; for example, I had no idea what Cochinita Pibil was but my server not only explained it but recommended it.

This is a well appointed, classy Mexican restaurant with a large bar area.  At first glance the prices look a little high but you aren't eating at a restaurant ending with "-berto".
