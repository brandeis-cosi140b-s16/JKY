I am sad to report that this restaurant seems to me to be losing ground. It never seemed a great restaurant but my first experiences involved competent wait staff that paid attention to the customers and a kitchen capable of serving customers decent food in a timely way. I posted a positive review at one point. I have been back three times since. Each time was a little worse. Service is slower. Kitchen takes more time getting food out. Wait staff loses touch with customers. In June I said never again but I was back in November. Waiter started off well. First round of drinks showed up quickly. Getting his attention for the second round was harder. He has mastered the trick of serving someone nearby, perhaps walking within a couple of feet of you and not noticing a waving hand or raised glass. We got the food we wanted but saw the wrong order delivered to one person, saw another couple not get their order and give up and saw a 40 minute delay (I think, I didn't have a stopwatch) for an entree salad. This place is convenient. Staff is very nice but there is more to a restaurant than that....
