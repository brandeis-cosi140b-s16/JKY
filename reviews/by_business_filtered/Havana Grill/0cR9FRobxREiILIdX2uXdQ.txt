My hubby and I decided to stop here for a bite before catching a flick at Colonnade next door. We didn't want to fill up too much before the movies , what were we thinking stopping here first? This place has good Cuban fare with a range of six different flavored mojito's to wet yer whistle . We ordered a few scrumptious appetizers , one being Tostones which are green fried plantains with camarones or shrimp, shredded and ground beef. These were different but delicious with a tomatillo salsa on top . I chose the chorizo Frito which was spicy Spanish fried sausage. We thought we might want more so we decided to have the Sopa de pollo, which is a delightful version of chicken soup , with potatoes and fresh squeezed lemon , I have had this before and wish I could take home containers of it every time I feel a hangover coming on . I mean I have had cravings for it ! There is a zesty spice to it that is amazing. Needless to say we pushed the limit leaving little to no room for crappy movie food. But what can I say my taste buds are growing a bit more refined. Love this place which is the sister to Florida cafe on Las Vegas boulevard. This place is great for a quick bite or large groups wanting to party , you will get a great buzz and want to salsa In your seat!
