This is more of a club than restaurant. But the food is good. 
Hard to believe this place is there because it's way too cool for where it is. (Not in Miami and far from the strip haha)
Best looking women I've seen in Vegas are there lol
If you like salsa dancing this is the place to go 
If you want to go to Miami but don't have 300$ for a plane ticket, go here
Good food good service good music and dancing beautiful women... Hidden gem.
