Great Cuban sandwiches and Mojitos. The outdoor patio seating is fun, because you can make fun of all the weird little kids hanging around in front of the movie theaters with their pants hanging off, and their hoods on, even though its 118 degrees out...Not that I'm judging them. I have one of my own at home (kid, not a hoodie).  :)  I have been there several times and usually get the mini Cuban sandwich, and Plaintain chips. They have a name, but I cant remember it unless I am looking at the menu. The menu is quite extensive, but if your drinking the mojitos, and I recommend it, you wont need much to eat.  And the more you have, the weirder those kids get...:)
