I love going to Havana Grill. I'm Cuban and while, I'm pretty picky on my homelands food, Havana Grill is pretty good. I love the choice of garbanzo, black or red beans with most of the dishes but I will say the red beans aren't Cuban at all, our culture doesn't do pinto beans for red beans. Otherwise I'm a big fan of the Cuban sandwich, papa rellena, croqueta and tamales. The best is lechon asado with moros! Worth the drive!
