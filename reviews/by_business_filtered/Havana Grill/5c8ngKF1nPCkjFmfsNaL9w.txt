My friend had eaten at this restaurant before and ordered a roasted pork entree and he didn't like it.  However, he wanted to give it another try yesterday so we decided to go.  I was in a pissy mood, so I already doubted that this place would be any good, however, I was taught to try something at least three times before I 'X' it out of my life.  

After glancing through the menu, nothing seem appetizing to me.  Then, I remembered that Cubans are known for their cuban sandwiches, and found it under the appetizer section ($7).  Then glance down the menu some more, and saw the pork and corn meal tamal ($5).  Glance down a little more, there is a whole appetizer plate with both of these items on there, plus chicharrones and croquetas (all for $15).  Of course then I ordered the appetizer plate, and that put a smile on my face because it was YUMMY.  There is this dipping sauce that came with the plate, made everything exponentially YUMMY.  Oh, almost forgot, there were fried plantains as well.  

My friend ordered the shrimp ajillo, that was alright, maybe because there was so much more flavor in the appetizer plate.  Because it was so yummy, I ordered the red sangria ($5), and boy was I glad to order it.  Also, they give you a basket of fresh warm bread with a moist center, and just enough butter to make it delicious.  

I would definitely come back to this restaurant for some more of those appetizer and sangria!
