Decided to try this place due to a groupon purchase.  Ate here on a Saturday night.

Food- Ordered the plantains as an appetizer. It was subpar- I've had plantains  that taste the exact same way at the EDR (employee dining room) for FREE..!

Entrees- we ordered pan con bistec with banana chips & lechon asado. Again, both dishes were nothing out of the ordinary and both on the dry side. I felt the pan con bistec could have used some kind of sauce. The presentation of the lechon asado did not make the dish look appetizing. And when we cut into the pork, it was so dry. Thank goodness for the black beans, which we mixed with the white rice & pork to make the meal somewhat edible. 

Atmosphere - it was a bit dark in the restaurant. They were about to set up  for late night music / DJ.

Service - not bad, not great.

Overall - I don't think i will be coming back here.
