I ate here for the first, and last, time tonight. I can't remember the name of the sandwich I ordered, but it was steak with caramelized onions on smashed bread. It was dry, dry, dry. The onions were about half cooked, certainly not caramelized. The steak, besides being dry, had no flavor. I guess the best thing I had was a few french  fries. Two people in our party arrived late, placed their orders, and waited. And waited. Finally, someone brought the bill. All of the orders, even the late ones were on there, along with the tip, but still the food hadn't arrived. They had to ask for it again. It was never even made.
