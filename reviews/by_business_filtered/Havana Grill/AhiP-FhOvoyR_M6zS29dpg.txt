If you are looking for good authentic Cuban food, this is the place. I was raised in Miami, and I occasionally get home sick and crave good Cuban food! I have been to all the Cuban restaurants in town -  this is my favorite!

If you want a sampling of a Cuban sandwich with their mariquitas, which are fried thin green plantains, I recommend the appetizer Mini Cuban Sandwich. It has tender roasted sliced port, ham, cheese, pickles, with mustard. Then it is pressed on a grill. Don't get the fries - try the plantains in their mojo garlic lemon sauce.

For my entree' I had the Lechon Al Despelote, which is chunks of roasted leg of pork served on fried yuca and topped with melted cheese.  There are three small servings of pork/yucca to this order with your choice of black beans and rice (more wet with rice and beans served separately) or Moros Y Christianos (black beans & white rice cooked together) for a more dry helping of black beans and rice.  I prefer the separate order so it is moist when I combine them. This was an excellent meal even though the portion of pork/yucca is very small. The cost is $16.00.

He had the Palomilla Empanizada, which is the sirloin steak that is thinly sliced and breaded. It is topped with grilled onions. He really enjoyed this. One of my favorites is the Bistec De Palomilla, which is similar to his order above except it is not breaded. Both come with the same selection of rice/beans and are also priced at $16.00.

Other items I enjoy from Havana Grill are their Plantains Maduros, which are fried sweet, ripe caramelized plantains. I don't always have room for dessert, but I do enjoy both the Flan Cubano (caramel custard) and the Cake De Tres Leches (white cake/three in three milks).

The restaurant is beautiful. I love the decor and flowers. It has a nightclub, which is awesome entertainment on weekends. They have also added outdoor seating recently. 

Our server this time was Gabriel. Excellent service!
