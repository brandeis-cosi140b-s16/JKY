We've been going here for years.  Used to be good service, good food.  Today, only good food.  We stood at the hostess stand a few minutes, a server with a tray excused himself between us to deliver a tray, not once saying "Just a minute folks."  We waited, and finally asked the bartender "Should we just take any seat?"  He nodded, and so we did, grabbing our own menus from the hostess stand.  As soon as we sat down, a blaring narrator came over the PA system from a current fad class in drinking and painting.  The instructor boomed over the PA system, drowning out the restaurant's music playing overhead.  We ordered croquetas, papas rellenas, black bean soup, and arroz con pollo.   Delicious!  If only we could have had a conversation together over the din of the art instructor giving painting instructions to the 20 or so drinking/painting students.  Must've been some marketing gig to get people in on a Tuesday evening.  The service was terrible.  Delivered chicken soup rather than black bean.  Corrected.  Never once refreshed our water glasses or asked if we needed another delicious mojito.  This place is slipping in service.  Sorry to see this.  The food is still good, but the service sucks.
