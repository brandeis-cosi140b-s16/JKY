I give 5 Estrellas because of the service and delicious food. El lechon asado with rice and black beans (moros y crist√≠anos) was awesome. The tostones with garlic dipping sauce was to die for. El Mojito and Cuban cafe closed it off with Cuban style. Too bad I live in Hawaii but I will return again!
