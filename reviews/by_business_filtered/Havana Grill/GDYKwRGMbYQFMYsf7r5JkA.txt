We've visited all of the Cuban restaurants in Las Vegas and this one we believe is the best. The food is authentic and absolutely delicious. e.g., Ropa Vieja and Bistec De Palomilla are our two favorites. The flan is mouth watering! 

Note when you arrive on a Fri/Sat night, the dance floor maybe empty but will become filled up quickly and quite loud after 9pm, so either enjoy the atmosphere or sit on the other side of the restaurant where it's more quiet.

The service is always very attentive and polite!
