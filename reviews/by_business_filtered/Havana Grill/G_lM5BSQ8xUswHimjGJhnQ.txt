I had been meaning to try this place for a long time when the GF announced that she had a groupon that was about to expire.  Great!

We stopped in for lunch on a weekday and the place was almost deserted.  We both had the Cuban sandwich with fries...I guess we just couldn't resist.  Our waiter, Carlos, was very friendly and promptly brought out our drinks and a basket of hot buttery bread.

The sandwiches were good and the fries were perfectly done.  My only gripe was about the small amount of ketchup provided in a little side cup.  Why can't I decide how much ketchup I need?  We asked for more and another few droplets arrived.

I'm sure we'll come back, especially being this close to the theater.
