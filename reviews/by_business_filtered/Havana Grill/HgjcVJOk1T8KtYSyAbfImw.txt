Well it isn't Miami, but it is the best Cuban food in Las Vegas. The tostones, vaca frita, lechon asado, platanos maduro, yuca, flan and tamal are extremely authentic. The rest of the dishes not extremely good but not horrible either, in some cases not really Cuban either. I have to say being Cuban I miss the food from Miami, but this is as authentic as it gets. It turns into a nightclub/restaurant after 9pm on the weekends and can get a little loud, but the ambiance is nice. The staff is also very pleasant. I am giving it a five star rating again because it is in Vegas. If it was in Miami it would get a 3 1/2 star.
