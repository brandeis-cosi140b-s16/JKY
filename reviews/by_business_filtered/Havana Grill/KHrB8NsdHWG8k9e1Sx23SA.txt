I was so disappointed by the food here. I have heard great things and I was eager to try it. My friend and I both ordered the bistec palomilla and the steak was void of flavor. We were both disappointed. I have been to Cuba and on thing that Cuban food is never lacking is flavor. I  will not be returning here.
OAN:  the atmosphere was nice.and It seems like a nice place to have drinks.
