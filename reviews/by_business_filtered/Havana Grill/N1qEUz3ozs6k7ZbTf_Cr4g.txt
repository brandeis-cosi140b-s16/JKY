Came here because friends found it on Yelp and wanted to try. We went for Sunday lunch and lucky us! Everything was 50% off. (I think the deal was 50% off everything Sunday-Tuesday or something like that.)

They started us off with bread - slickity buttery bread but oh so warm. They kept it coming too, which is always a plus in my book. I ordered something quite expensive - some pork dish marinated in citrus with yucca smothered in cheese. I couldn't taste the citrus-ness of the pork, the yucca was sooo good but really oily, and let's just say cold cheese isn't exactly tasty either. But pork was really tender, and the moros was delish. I tried some of my friends' foods and they were really good, so I probably just ordered wrong. They also had quite a bit of food for vegetarians (half of our group were vegetarians). Service was pretty prompt with the water and the "how's everything going" checking. Overall, I could really see myself going back here and giving it another try. Needless to say, the 50% off price didn't hurt either. =)
