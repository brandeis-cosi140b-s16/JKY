Wow, that was awesome!  Great food, fast service, a little pricey but definitely worth it.  Definitely coming back.  It's a well kept secret.  I read prior reviews and was prepared for a small restaurant with slow service and found the exact opposite.  Definitely coming back.  Best Cuban food in town!
