Wanted to have a meal close to home and decided to try this place on someone's recommendation. Severely dissapointed!
I was debating what chicken to try, in my quest to eat high protein, and the server suggested that the pollo a la planchia was really good. I took her recommendation and decided to order this. The chicken breasts were pounded and marinated and grilled. I found the chicken to be too oily and also the onions that came as a garnish to be very oily. Since it took over 20 min, for us to get our order, and the entrees were priced at $14 I think, I expected more. Instead of rice, I asked for a salad which they got-lettuce, tomatoes without any dressing. This came with a side of beans in a smallish bowl and I took 1 bite as I did not like the way it tasted and looked. I asked for hot salsa and got 2 bottles of chilli sauce.

D had the Havana Grill Pollo Salteado which came with rice and beans. It was ok. The serving was quite big but lacking in flavor.

The positive was the server who greeted us promptly and brought glasses of iced water and some bread. Even though it was not too busy, they took long bringing out the food, and then bringing the check as well.

I will not be going back.
