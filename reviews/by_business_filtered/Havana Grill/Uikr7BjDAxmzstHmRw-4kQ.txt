Had a friend visiting from Oklahoma, So on he's last night here we took him to havana grill, for the atmosphere and the food. 
the service was great, even with the loud music and the other distractions. its definitely not the place you want to go to on the weekend after 10pm, if you want to have conversations and stuff, cause we couldnt really hear each other talk with the music, which is expected i guess lol; cause it kinda turns into a little club in the middle of the dancefloor, but people can still sit around and hang out. Also we went on a friday night after 10pm, and there was a live dj.
the food, at least what i ordered was...idk..eehhh. I wasnt happy with it, but everyone elses food tasted really good, maybe its just what I ordered, the fried plantain was on point though! took me back home for a mn...loved it. but i will definitely go back, before 10pm on the weekend if i'm more interested in conversing and eating :)
i loved the music. i loved the cuban, salsa, reggaeton mix the dj was playing, wouldve had more fun if i was with a bunch of my dancing friends though  lol :)
