I went here for a friend's birthday and we had a blast! I made reservations for 10 people and the staff was very accommodating with a large group.Happy hour was until 7 pm so we enjoyed some refreshing pre-dinner mojitos for about $4 each.

Most of our group were Cuban food rookies and our waiter was gracious enough to provide recommendations and explain the menu. He suggested we get an appetizer sampler which came with a tamal, mini Cuban sandwich, croquettas and lots of other goodies. This was my favorite part of the meal.

I ordered lechon asado which was so tender and flavorful. Several in my group ordered Ropa Vieja which literally translates to old clothes. It is a traditional Cuban dish that has shredded beef in a tomato sauce. It tastes like Filipino menudo to me with a twist. We had some fried plantains and yuca on the side.
All of us were full and satisfied and had more than enough for leftovers.

I had the Orgasmo Habanero for dessert simply because of the name! It has three layers - chocolate, tres leches and flan. It definitely lived up to it's name!

Havana Grill is a fun restaurant with friendly and attentive staff. I don't know much about Cuban food but everything I tried was delicious. Next time we'll go when they have live music and get our hookah on!
