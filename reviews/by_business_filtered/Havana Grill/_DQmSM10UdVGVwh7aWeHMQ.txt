I've been to Havana Grill several times, so this review is long overdue! I have never had a bad meal there. I tend to stick to the same items, but always make sure to try what everyone else orders. 

They start you off with grilled Cuban bread with butter. It's perfect, served warm and it melts in your mouth. My favorite item on their menu would have to be the Tostones. They are delicious little fried plantain patties topped with chorizo, ropa vieja or shrimp. The ropa vieja tostones are the best! They also have amazing papas rellenas (fried mashed potato balls filled with seasoned ground beef). The last time I went there, the papas were a tad bit too salty. I still enjoyed them though! I ordered the ceviche appetizer as my meal and was pleased with it. It wasn't the best I've had and it could have used more shrimp, but it was good nonetheless. You must also try their red sangria. It's delicious! 

I would highly recommend Havana Grill if you're looking for good food. I'm not an expert on Cuban food, but I have never been disappointed by my meals there.
