First, the food is average. It would be okay if it weren't so expensive. Basically this place has a "hole in the wall" menu with "sit down restaurant" prices.  For instance, you'll order some rice and beans with a little meat,  tostones and a beer that should  cost no more than $10 and here its going to cost your more like $30. 

All of this would would garner them a 3 star review perhaps. But I had a had my credit card number stolen at the restaurant. After paying with my card, about a week later I learned that my card had been duplicated, and approximately $1000 of gas, food and Bachata concert tickets had been purchased on the counterfeit card. My credit card company spotted the activity. And I figured out that it happened at Havana Grill. 

So pay with cash or follow the waiter to the cash register and keep an eye on your card.
