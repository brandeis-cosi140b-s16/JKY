So yum! This is a spot in a strip mall that's easy to overlook. But don't do that. You should go eat here. It's quite delicious. Service is pleasant, friendly, and attentive. Ambiance and decor are nice. Music and dancing heat up late at night. There's an outdoor seating area where you might be serenaded by a mariachi band. The mojitos are fab. The menu is fairly lengthy with lots of options. It was really difficult for me to decide on just one entree. I finally settled on the Palomilla Empanizada. It was so delicious! Big portion, very filling. It reminded me of all the little places I ate while visiting Little Havana in Miami. So good! I'm definitely a fan.
