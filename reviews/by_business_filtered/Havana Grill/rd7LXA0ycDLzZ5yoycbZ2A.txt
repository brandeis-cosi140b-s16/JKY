I love love love this place.  We just came here for drinks, and I'm so glad we did! The Mojitos were perfect and the bartender was giving us samples of different flavors of Mojitos and offering suggestions from the menu.  I ended up ordering a salad which was pretty tasty...I can't wait to come back and try other things on the menu.  The atmosphere and music were perfect, and there was a hot guy smoking a cigar and drinking a Corona...it just looked right!
