Positives: the drinks are great and the bartender was very friendly and offered great suggestions.  Also, the drink prices are pretty reasonable.

Negatives: ummm, the food.  Tried the lechon asado and it was missing the "lechon."  It wasn't tart at all!...it was actually kind of sweet.  That definitely threw me off.  Just weird.  And the rice was cold and hard.  My friend got the chicken and rice and her dish was cold as well.  The rice lacked the bright saffron color you would expect and was oversaturated with the cooking liquid.  She ate about three bites and quit.

Even though the drinks are pretty good and the decor is nice, I don't think I'll be back.
