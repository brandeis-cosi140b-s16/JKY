My experiences at Havana Grill have more often than not flatlined by the time the check came. I will say that their mojitos are authentic and crazy delicious and you'll be challenged to find a better one in town!

Maybe I've just picked the wrong items to explore Cuban cuisine with, but the only standout thing I've had here was the garbanzo soup which had a deep, rich flavor from all of the meat, a nice broth and was really filling. The appetizer croquetas tasted like something that might be served under the warm lamp of a 7-11. They were kind of stale, served lukewarm and really had no distinctive flavor besides frying grease and potato. It just made me sad and that's the last emotion I want to feel about something I'm eating. I ate here a few years ago for a friend's birthday and because she had such a large party it was a set menu of some shredded meats, rice, beans and I believe plantains. Nothing struck me though and the pork I had was lake bed dry. 

The service has been unmemorable for the most part save my last visit in which our waiter was a very friendly dude who was nothing but charming with our table of ladies. 

It's a place I wouldn't go back to by choice, but if friends were going I wouldn't make a big to-do about it and just suck it up with a mojito or three.
