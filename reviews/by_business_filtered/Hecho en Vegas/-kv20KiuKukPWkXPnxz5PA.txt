I really enjoyed my experience at Hecho. The environment is excellent with bright colored walls and neat decor, staff was amazing and friendly, and the drinks were delicious and strong. Complimentary chips and salsa are great, the red salsa is my favorite.
For a mean I ordered the huge taco salad that was served in a giant taco shell. It was full of flavor and I was able to substitute refried beans for black beans.
