Came for weekend brunch to get the bottomless bloody Mary's but at $29 you have to have 3 per person to make it worth it and we didn't even get our drinks before our meals arrived. My husband had to ask the bartender if we were going to get our drinks which had been sitting on the counter that whole time we were waiting, very frustrating. The food is average American Mexican food, nothing amazing but not horrible. Just basic flavors and basic choices. The service definitely needs some attention from management, for being at the MGM I would expect service to be the top priority. When our waiter saw my husband getting our own drinks from the bar, she didn't even bat an eye or apologize... Save yourself the trouble and go somewhere else on the strip.
