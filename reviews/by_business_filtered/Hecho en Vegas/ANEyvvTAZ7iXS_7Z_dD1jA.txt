I must say, this was a really good choice for both food and "people watching" in MGM Grand... The hostess that helped seat us was very nice and made small talk with us, which we thought was very neat... All too many times you get those girls/guys that just point to your table and give you a menu... This girl had character... 

At first glance, the menu can be a little large but it helps provide many different Mexican dishes... 
I went for the 3 taco appetizer as I was on a "liquid diet" and it was good. The tacos were small and very street-taco like... I was content with the size and with the taste. I had a chicken, pork, and a beef taco and all of them were good...

Now for my main course, I had a drink called something very clever and I can't remember it... It was basically a margarita with a beer in it... It had a cool name and it tasted great. 

All in all, our experience at Hecho En Vegas was really fun and we got to see several people getting escorted inside from the pool and kicked out on to the strip, I'm guessing... It was a ton of fun watching all of the drunk people... Oh, chips and salsa are free, and they really help when people watching...
