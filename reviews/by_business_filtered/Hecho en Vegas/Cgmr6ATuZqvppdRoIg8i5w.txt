Had some military buddies coming into town. So me being the local wanted to find a place for us to watch the game and have a few drinks. I had put my bet in the sports book at the mgm so I thought I'd try this place. It wasn't too busy. So I walked up to the bar, but it seemed the heavy set white bartender was more interested helping the other white customers and completely ignored me. Maybe I didn't look rich enough. I ended up taking my buddies, one of who was being deployed that following week, and showed them a better time elsewhere. I will not be coming back here or gambling at the mgm casino altogether because of this experience. We don't make much money in the military, but we don't deserve to be treated like this. Definitely not friendly at the bar.
