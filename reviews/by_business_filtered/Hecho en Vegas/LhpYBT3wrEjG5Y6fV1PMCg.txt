Amazing tostada salad! I ordered it with chicken, and it was too much food. I could have done without the meat. I ordered the sangria, which was good, but it didn't come with any fruit. My husband had the enchiladas with white sauce that was amazing. Great food, but the service we got was amazing!!!!! I would definitely return.
