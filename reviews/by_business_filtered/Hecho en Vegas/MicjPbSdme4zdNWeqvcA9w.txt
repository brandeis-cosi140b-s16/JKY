The table side guacamole is a must! I'm giving this place 4 stars simply for the service. The food was sub par. My carne asada tacos tasted like the meat had been broiled not grilled like in most Mexican restaurants. Our server was amazing, I wish I could remember his name, and made our dinning experience very fun. He was joking with us the whole time and constantly checking in on us to see if we were doing well or needed anything. They have all sorts of premium tequila and the top shelf stuff, which is meant to be sipped, is served in a champagne flute! Again, guac was good but the rest of the food was just ok.
