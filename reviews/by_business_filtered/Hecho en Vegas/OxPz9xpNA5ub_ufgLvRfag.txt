In October my girls and I went to Vegas. One of our friends came out from New Jersey, while the rest of us from Southern California. After a concert in the MGM, we were starving. I worked my magic with getting my group of friends a table swiftly. We were seated at a big table and had prompt attention from our waiter. We promised to leave generous tips and be an enjoyable crowd of people. The food was delicious and well worth the price. I ordered the enchilada trio with all the fixings. My friends enjoyed their beverages, the fresh salsa and chips, and we left our plates cleaned with smiles on our faces.
