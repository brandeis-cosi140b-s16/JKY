I came in for the all you can eat tacos for $20 had about two plates but they were really nothing special and aside from that somewhat reasonable price everything on the menu was very expensive. Im taking off 2 stars strictly for being overpriced and tasting bland and my 3 stars are strictly for the wonderful service, my server was named Jose and he did a great job and so did the ladies who took my reservation down.
