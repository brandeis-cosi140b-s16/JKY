came here with a group after frozen fury, it is right outside the mgm garden arena.  I would say walk your drunken self else where if i were you. 
For the price of everything, the portion size was really small and the flavor was lackluster. The whole table felt the same way. 2 people from out table even returned their margaritas because they didnt taste right. The server was nice, but that doesnt really make up for everythign else.
