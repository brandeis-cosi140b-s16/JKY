While the food was amazing, I specifically told the front hostess and the staff that my wife was celiac and now dealing with a very sick woman who was glutened. I don't care if you have someone in your family who has celiac, if you can't train the staff on allergies, then don't pronounce yourself as gluten friendly. My wife is sick on our first day of a three day trip that we have been planning for over 6 months. She doesn't have a diet choice, this was a necessity.
