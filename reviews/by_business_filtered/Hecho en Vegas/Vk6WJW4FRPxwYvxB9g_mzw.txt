My friends got their dinners, but two of us still haven't. It's been about five minutes. Not sure what happened. But none of us at this table are happy. Margarita is decent but pricey. Don't think I'll be coming here again. Nor would I recommend this place to anyone else.  The chicken quesadilla was pretty good, though. So I guess if you can overlook the service problems, the food is pretty good.
