Thank you so much for making our decision to skip your establishment so easy Friday evening. Telling us and number of other couples that there was a 20 minute wait when your eatery was less than half full was a stroke of business genius! I can only assume that the rest of our dining experience woud have been just as dismal had we chosen to "wait".
