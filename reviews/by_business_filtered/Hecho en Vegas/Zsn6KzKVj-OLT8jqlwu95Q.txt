I enjoyed the dinner here. It is pretty much how I expected and hoped it would be. I saw a couple of bad reviews on here, but I think these people are kind of out there. 
First off, walking up to the place you can tell that its a comfortable, casual, and energetic type of place, and to me that is perfect if you are trying to hang out and relax. 
We got our water, and placed our order for margaritas and table side guac from our perfectly friendly server, and both were good.
I had "The one and only combination", and my wife had the skirt steak fajitas, Very tasty for sure. 
I cant say anything bad about this place. 
People complaining about the price (which actually isn't high) should probably review the menu before hand, and then go to the food court next store. 
On the strip, out drinking, don't feel like being bound to a dinner schedule? This is a good place to stop.
