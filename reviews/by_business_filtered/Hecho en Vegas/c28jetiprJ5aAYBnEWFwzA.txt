I was craving some Mexican food and missing my good ole' Tex Mex I get back home, so I made hubby go here to have some grub and margaritas.  

We ordered the queso for starters.  It comes with flour tortillas but we requested they not bring them because that would be too filling.  The chips were ok and the green salsa that they bring out was so good!  I didn't care for the red salsa too much, as it had a roasted taste to it.

I ordered the street tacos for my meal.  I thought the pork was hands down the best one, and I do not eat pork.  So I probably wouldn't get this again.

Another night we were there, we had drinks at the bar.  It seems to me they have a different bar food menu, as there were fish tacos on the bar menu and I was annoyed because I would rather have had that than the stupid street tacos I had the day before.

The margaritas were good, but I can honestly say the food is just ok.  We both paid for it the next day, so I wouldn't eat here again.  LOL!

The food is 2 stars, the drinks are 4 stars, and that makes them a 3 star place!
