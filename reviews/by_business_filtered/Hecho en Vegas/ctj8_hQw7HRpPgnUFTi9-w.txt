On our latest trip to Vegas and having a craving for Mexican, the Wife and I decided to check this place out. The food was 4-5 stars, but the service was more like a 2-3. So I settled on a 4. Like I said the food was good-the wife had the nachos with beef and I had the steak fajitas. It was soooo good. We even enjoyed the chips and salsa ahead of the meal. 
Our waiter was either too busy or not sure on how often to check back on us. 

I would try this place again since the food was so amazing but would hope to get a different server.
