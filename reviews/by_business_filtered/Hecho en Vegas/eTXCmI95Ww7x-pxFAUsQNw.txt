We had our wedding rehearsal dinner here with around 25 people and it was great! The food was tasty and kept coming, family style until everyone was full and then we had dessert!
You can choose from set menus for large groups but we found they were also very accommodating for vegetarians and vegans in our party. And like a lot of other reviewers I don't really like guacamole, but the stuff from here is delicious!!

But the real star of the show was Leo who looked after us throughout the night. Flexible, warm, wonderful. He made everything so easy and lovely and managed our kooky and late family with grace and ease.
