This place was ok. The food was pretty average but hit the spot when I needed it. The black beans were the best part of the meal,they had quite a kick. beef enchiladas were cool. Nothing really to write home about but if you want quick Mexican food this is the place. Oh and the drinks were weak. Won't rush back here.
