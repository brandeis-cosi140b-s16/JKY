Our group had mixed feelings about Hecho during our recent trip.   We went on a Friday evening on arrival day, so it was at the end of a long day.

The food is good-I had the shrimp/steak fajitas which are very good-corn tortillas and good rice and beans rounded out a good dinner for me.   Others said the food was decent-my wife's tamale plate looked good and one friend had the all you can eat street tacos.

Drinks...I enjoyed my beer, but they are very high priced, as evidenced by the $80 pitcher of margaritas 3 at the table had.  They weren't aware this would be the price and felt it was not worth anywhere near that cost.

Service was decent and I'd try it again next time in town.
