This restaurant is located inside MGM Grand casino and I went during CES. 

Ordered and enchilada and a fajita.  The wait for the food took a long time. Pretty much finished all their nachos waiting for the food. When the food did arrive the food quality was average. Definitely I had better Mexican food than what they served. Without even tasting the fajitas visually the veggies were over cooked. 

If you want Mexican food there are better places.
