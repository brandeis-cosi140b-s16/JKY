i really liked this place. i had the 3 enchiladas sample with beef,chicken and pork. they were excellent. the guacamole was really good too. Good service. my friend had the tacos but he said he wasn't impressed. But who goes to a mexican restaurant and orders tacos anyways? my food was delicious and i would definetely come back.
