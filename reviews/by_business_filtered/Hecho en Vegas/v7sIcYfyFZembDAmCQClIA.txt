I have never loved going to dinner with my mother in law so much. She treated us to Hecho's and everything about the night was perfect. Excellent and attentive service. Spectacular food made exactly how asked for, and delicious appetizers! Any tourists that go through the MGM MUST stop and try it. The rolling guacamole cart (made directly in front of you) is to die for! Just a wonderful night with a full thanks to the Hecho's staff! Can't wait to eat it again!
