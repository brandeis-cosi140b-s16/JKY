Went here on a whim. So worth it. The prices were right and the food was GREAT! We got the guacamole table which was fun and different. Highly recommend. Our table got nachos which were heaven, the cheese was perfect, the meat was juicy and the size was plenty. The chimichangas and burritos are huge enough to split. The enchiladas were good as well. Not sure if anything is bad at this place. The service was great. Everyone was friendly and checked our table frequently.
