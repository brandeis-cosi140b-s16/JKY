If you need a Mex food fix, this is a good place to go. It's small and cozy (though it can be hot in the summer). The staff there is delightful and attentive when it's not busy. The food is good. I would go even if it were for the complimentary chips & salsas alone! The selection of salsas is like a choose-your-own-adventure. But onto the entrees... I like all of the huaraches I've tried. Lengua tacos and lengua ranchera are my favorites. Carnitas and barbacoa are excellent choices too. The desserts are not bad either. And they have horchata! Reasonable prices, large portions, and great food make this place a winner.
