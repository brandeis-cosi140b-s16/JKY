It took me a long time to stop by this place, but now that I live a block away, I'm there all the time! Great drink selection, and their margaritas aren't too sweet or too sour - just right.  Their fish taco's are freakin' amazing. The only thing I have against this place is that all their salsas are spicy (and I'm a weakling when it comes to spice). But! They are redeemed by their queso dip - top of it's class. You'll see me here all the time - moreso once they put out their patio seating!
