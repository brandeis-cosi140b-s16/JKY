Great food and portion sizes. I will start out by saying I'm not really a big fan of Mexican food, but this place really impressed me. I was not really expecting anything too great when I walked in because of the small size of the restaurant. I was seated quickly and given tortilla chips with a variety of sauces. The chips were way better than the cheap packaged stuff you find at grocery stores. I liked the dark red spicy sauce. 

I ordered the Fajita Loca with ham, steak and bacon. I was pleasantly surprised by the ample portion and fresh meats and rice offered. The steak was flavorful and not too chewy unlike cheap "mock meats". Although I don't really like bell peppers, they were pretty good, and I finished all of them on my dish. 

The service is great with friendly and prompt staff, My order was taken quickly and I did not have to wait a long time to be served. One minor thing is that you don't get a spoon with your standard fork and knife. I did not really mind this, but you can probably ask to get a spoon if you really wanted one. Although some people say the place is too hot, I did not find it a problem when I went on July 3rd 2015(76 degrees F) 

Would definitely go again- 5 stars for the great food and reasonable prices.
