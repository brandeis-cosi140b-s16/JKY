I hate to give this place a bad review, because the first time I went, it was delicious! The guacamole is great and the service is friendly. However, the last time I went it was so terrible that I don't think I'll be going back again. The server informed me that it was $1 tacos, so obviously that's a deal, but they were so bad that I couldn't even eat them. I got three different kinds, all of which tasted like burnt, old meat, topped with slimy cilantro and onion-- no tomato, lettuce, cheese, or sour cream-- which was confusing to me, since my friend had ordered hard tacos and had gotten the listed toppings. Her hard shells tasted stale! I filled up on tons of guacamole and chips and salsa, but I feel like their food quality has gone down since opening.
