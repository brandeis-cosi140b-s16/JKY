Tried this place for lunch after having discovered it just by driving by.  Hadn't been in the area since it was an ice-cream shop.  I typically frequent Maize for Mexican food just because it's within a few minutes from my work, but I've been looking to try different places occasionally.

I got 3 different tacos to go (steak, chorizo, chicken).  The tacos were good, but the chorizo was not very flavorful.   Having read other reviews, people say that the chips and salsa are the big draw.  I wasn't offered any with my order to go, so I can't say anything about that.

It's a small place, but has a fair number of seats in it for the space.  That's one big advantage over the obvious comparison to Maize, which has minimal seating.

Overall, the food was not spectacular enough to warrant another 15-20 minutes of extra driving for lunch, but I'd be willing to go back for a sit-down meal to try out the chips and salsa with their other entree selections.   Recommend that you start offering chips/salsa to people (like me) who make to-go orders!
