This is a local 5. It is really the only legit Mexican place around. Sorry Maize, you have good ingredients, but your burritos are wrapped too loosely and they are small. Huaraches has an authentic taste, great ingredients, and I haven't had anything bad from here. The side of nachos with jalape√±os and ballpark nacho cheese threw me off the first time, but now I think it's charming. 
Now, compared to other areas, this might be a 4, but around here I think this is really the only game in town.
