Love Huaraches! It has been a great addition to the neighborhood, even though it is in a bit of a random location as far as restaurants go! I am just happy to have something so cheap and delicious within walking distance of my mom's house when I come down to CU for a visit. 

I have been here several times now and each time am very happy with the quality and service. The salsas are all great, each their own unique flavor. The chips are always fresh and crispy. Most recently I got the traditional steak tacos. The steak was flavorful and tender, and I love whatever corn tortillas they use (maybe they make in house?). There are so many items to choose from and a pretty good vegetarian selection as well. 

You can't beat it for cheap eats. I love that it has more of an authentic vibe than the other Tex Mex joints in town.
