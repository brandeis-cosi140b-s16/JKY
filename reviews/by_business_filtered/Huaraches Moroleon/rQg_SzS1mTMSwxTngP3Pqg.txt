Pros: delicious food. 4 salsa options with your chips. He chips are fresh and yummy. The menu had lots of choices. The enchiladas are yummy! The Diabla enchiladas are super spicy- but with a good fire taste. Our wait staff has always been super friendly. Outside seating as well. 

Cons: it's small and hot inside. There is sometimes a bit of a wait, but it's worth it.
