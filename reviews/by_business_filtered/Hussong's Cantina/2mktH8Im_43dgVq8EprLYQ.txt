This place is awesome!  The location and atmosphere are perfect.  It is well decorated and makes you feel like you are at the original Hussong's in Mexico.  The food and margaritas are fantastic!  I can't say enough about what a great experience it was hanging out there.  Whether you want to go with your lady or a bunch of friends, the setting is perfect.  I did not expect the food to be as good, but knew the margaritas were second to none.  I was really nicely surprised about the quality of the food.  In a city where everything with some quality is so expensive, it is nice to know there are places like Hussong's where you can get the great experience, food and drinks at an affordable price.  Highly recommend this place to anyone!
