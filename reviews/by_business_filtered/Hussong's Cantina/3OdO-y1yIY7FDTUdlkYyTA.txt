The hostess was very nice and invited us in to dine so we said OK lets try something new.  We went in sat down and started looking over the menu.  After a while we noticed that no one had checked on us and at least 2 songs had passed by.  I looked at my wife and we decided to play a game.  We put both our empty water glasses out for the server to see and we counted how many times someone would look at them before they came over to check on us.  Menus down and empty glasses out, servers glanced over our table 11 times before we decided to leave.  This place needs work.
