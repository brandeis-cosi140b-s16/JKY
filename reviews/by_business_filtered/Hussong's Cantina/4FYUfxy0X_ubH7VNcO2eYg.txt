I had the best experience at Hussongs! I was in Vegas for Labor Day weekend with 3 of my friends and we headed to Hussong's before we went out on the town. We got a table almost immediately and had a great, chill server. The ambiance is great because everyone is just there to have a great time with great food, drinks, and service. We got nachos and tacos and OMG sooo good! Can't forget to mention the endless chips and salsa which come with two different and delicious salsas. The margaritas were delicious too, and everything is reasonably priced, especially for Vegas. Go to Hussongs if you want delish Mexican with a friendly and fun environment!
