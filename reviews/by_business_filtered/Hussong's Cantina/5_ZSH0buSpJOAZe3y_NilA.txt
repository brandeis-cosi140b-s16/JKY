Love Hussongs! Great margaritas. Bartenders are always friendly. The salsa isn't hot, but if you ask for some hot salsa, they'll bring you Chipotle sauce that's delicious. Mango guacamole is delicious. We have had the Carne asada, chicken, and carnitas tacos....all are delicious. We love getting our taco fix here. Yum!
