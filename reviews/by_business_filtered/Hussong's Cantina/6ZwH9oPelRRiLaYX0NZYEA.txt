Decided to stop by Hussong's Catina before a show at the House of Blues. I LOVE Mexican and I'm usually pretty easy to please. The food was maybe a 6 out of 10. The waitress was friendly but borderline too friendly if you're pickin' up what I'm puttin' down. I bumped up the rating by one star because of the a-mazing slash terrible white guy mariachi band with a harp player. The location is convenient if you don't want to leave Mandalay Bay.
