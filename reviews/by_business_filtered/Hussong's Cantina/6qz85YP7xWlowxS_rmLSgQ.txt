Came here for dinner and ordered the Enchiladas Plazeras, the entrees took awhile to come out, but they were pretty tasty.  My entr√©e was large; I could not even finish the whole thing.   Three loaded enchiladas with chicken and cheese, topped with lettuce, sour cream, chorizo, tomatoes, chicken, and potatoes.  The enchiladas were good, but they seemed a little dry to me.  It would have tasted better topped with some guacamole.  The chips and salsa are very good, I loved the green salsa!  The red spicy salsa also wasn't bad, but the green salsa was amazing!  My friend ordered the street tacos which he said were delicious.  The flautas are also very good.  This is definitely a bar atmosphere, the seating is not that comfy and there aren't a whole lot of tables.  They also don't have a restroom inside the restaurant; you have to walk down the hall to the public restroom.  Not a bad place to satisfy you hunger cravings, or if you need a cure to a hangover.  Mexican food will always hit the spot!
