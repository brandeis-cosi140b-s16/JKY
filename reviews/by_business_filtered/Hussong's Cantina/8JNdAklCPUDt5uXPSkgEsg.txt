Kind of annoying waitress with a high pitched fake tone but the food was tasty. I had the steak and rice risotto and the best part of the meal was the corn cup. Roasted corn with queso fresco and butter - so tasty. My friend had the enchiladas suiza and they were a tad salty but still had good flavor.
