The best Baja Tacos I have ever tasted! I have been to Husongs Cantina a couple of times over the past few years and worth going back but this was the first time I have ordered the Baja Tacos and now I am craving them in my sleep! We were a party of 8 and were seated quickly on a holiday weekend and everyone loved the dish they picked. Great chips and salsa and they kept the bowl full! Great service. I could have done without the live band - They were very loud for such a small place! Would probably go back for lunch over dinner so I did not have to scream over the band as long as they serve Baja Tacos for lunch!
