I am usually quite generous and forgiving, but Hussong's was an incredible disappointment. The hostess could not be ruder. It's a bar, really, and people are passing through. 

The food is meh. The service is horrible. I really hope that they take the time to improve overall. The Mandalay is one of the best places for customer service, but this place in the Shoppes was extremely disappointing.
