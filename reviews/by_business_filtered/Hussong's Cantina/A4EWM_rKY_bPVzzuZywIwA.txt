Yum! Since I'm at MB often I always come here for lunch. I frequently get the mango habanero guacamole XTRA HABANERO! And it never disappoints. Home made chips and a side of habanero sauce how could you go wrong? The veggie tacos and the Mexican street corn are equally enjoyable. I haven't been able to enjoy a margarita yet but I've heard they're amazing. Shout out to the manager Chad! He's awesome.
