This is the second time my friend and I have eaten here and each time we've left a little disappointed but after tonight, I do plan to return. 

Even though the restaurant was a little busy, our service could have been better. We weren't given straws and when I asked for straws our server forgot and never came back (I finally just got them from the bar). By the way, the water tasted weird, which is pretty concerning. 

I'm also annoyed because my friend is a vegetarian and we are both health conscious so after coming to yelp to write the review, we find that they have a separate vegan/vegetarian menu you have to ask for. This would have been nice to know. (Grrr!)

I will say their gluten free chips and salsa are delicious but one can not live off chips an salsa alone. We both had the tostado salad and were very surprised to see what came out or lack there of. The salad was supposed to come with black beans and corn, which were nearly hidden the portion was so small. We could never even taste them! We expected some other veggies like peppers or onions too but we really just got some lettuce on top of two fried tortilla pieces. The chicken was dry and since my friend didn't even get the chicken or cheese, I felt worse for her. Bottom line this should not be considered a meal. Very disappointing.
