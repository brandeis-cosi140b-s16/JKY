After being seated for what seemed like a century, it took the waiter a while to finally take our orders. I ordered the flautas and my fiance ordered the carne asada. By the time we got our order, the food was cold. The unappetizing meat inside my dish was rubbery and the potatoes in the carne asada were hard. Needless to say, it was not worth the money we spent. Will definitely not be going back.
