Went with a group of girls on a Monday night, when they have happy hour from 7-10. The service was friendly and attentive. The chips are fabulous!!! We ordered a bunch of apps and split them. Our favorite was definitely the corn and the nachos (those chips!) Excellent food, and the mariachi band adds such character to the place. I would recommend it to anyone looking for authentic Mexican food on the Strip.
