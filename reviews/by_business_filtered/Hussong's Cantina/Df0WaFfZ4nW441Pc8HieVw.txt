Went to Hussong's on a Thursday night and was very disappointed. The service was good but the food and drinks were horrible. I had the enchiladas suizas and I had to force myself to finish one of the three on the plate. The sauce was terrible and the chicken inside was dry and bland. The beans and rice were average too. As for the margaritas, the waiter raved about the house margaritas so we gave them a try. Needless to say we were very disappointed. 

The one bright spot in the evening was the mariachi trio that strolled through the restaurant. They were great and very entertaining. It would be worth it just to sit at the bar with a cold beer and listen to those guys play.
