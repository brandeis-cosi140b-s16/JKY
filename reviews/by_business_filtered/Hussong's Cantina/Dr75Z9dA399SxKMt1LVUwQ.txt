I thought it was very good! Sat at the bar and we were immediately offered chips n salsa. Best red salsa I have tasted in a very long time! Chips were warm and crispy and I couldn't stop eating them!

I ordered the chicken tacos and they were quite delish! Excellent corn tortilla, nicely seasoned chicken, and tasty rice and beans.  Top this off with friendly and speedy service, and I say go!
