We went here with a group of friends...we had heard the food was good.  The food was fantastic and they have the best chips and salsa ever!  I would come back just for those.  We ordered margaritas by the pitcher...two different kinds, both were fantastic! It was very casual and down home which is hard to find in Las Vegas.
