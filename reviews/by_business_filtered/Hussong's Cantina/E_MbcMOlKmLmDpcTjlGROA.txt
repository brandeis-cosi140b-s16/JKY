The good news is that they have a nice vegan menu. The bad news is that they are not that great at serving vegan food. I ordered vegan enchiladas & they ended up serving me vegan chicken strips rolled up in torillas with sauce. The side salad was also missing.
They also don't do well with special orders. My husband is vegetarian & asked for a normal cheese enchilada with the vegan chicken strips. The first plate they brought out was just chicken enchiladas. The second plate was just vegan enchiladas. Not that great in my opinion.
