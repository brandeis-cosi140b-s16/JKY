My boyfriend and I came here Sunday to watch the Redskins and the Cowboys games. They had a deal in which he took part in that indulged all you could drink Tecate and all you can eat tacos for $25.00. I ordered myself a HUGE 64 ounce Romance Margarita which I thought was amazing as well as steak nachos. The nachos weren't that good but the bar service we received made up for that. Our bartender was awesome! She literally could read our minds when we needed something and exactly what we needed. I wish I grabbed her name; however, she was a blonde girl!
