Wow...the Steak Burrito was to die for!  I got it mojado style with both the red and green sauce and I literally cleaned my plate.  Soooo delicious!
A little pricey, $15 for a burrito, but what do you expect for a restaurant in a Las Vegas casino.  By looking at their menu, seems like they have something for everyone, they even had bone marrow as a "meat" option for your burrito or tacos.  
Two thumbs up!
