The house tortilla chips were thick and not very good at all... they are just filled in a big popcorn machine up front rather than cooked to order and served warm and fresh. The salsa, on the other hand was tasty which made the former fact a real shame. We left them untouched. Unheard of.

Food was just okay. Same as the service. I ordered the vegan chile relleno with gardein beef tips. My friend ordered the vegan quesadilla, which came on a single medium tortilla served open faced?

I wasn't a huge fan of the rice and I love my rice. There was a lot going on on the plate, flavor-wise my dish should have been exploding. The flavor just wasn't there especially having had such delicious Mexican in southern Colorado. My avocado slices were not even ripe. It was hard not creamy as a good, ripe avocado should be.

I did like the beans.

Pay attention to things like how busy the place is... follow the crowd. Better off going to Slice of Vegas a few doors down where it's busy for good reason and you are sure to be impressed.
