Hussong's is located between Luxor and Mandalay Bay.  It seems to be the place that invented the margarita.  Whether that is true or not, is irrelevant, because the margarita's/drinks kicked @$$!

The drinks are not too expensive ($10-$12 range), but they still pack a nice punch.  Most drinks in Vegas are extremely watered down and 90% sugar, but not these.  They tasted fresh and did not resemble Kool-Aid.

For food, we enjoyed the quesadilla, which had tons of flavor, but was also very heavy.  

Cons:
The service was not good at all.  The servers were extremely friendly, but also extremely absent.  Maybe I caught them on a bad night.

I will definitely look to come back here next time I am in Vegas, though.
