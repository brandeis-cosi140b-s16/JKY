This place was slightly below average for me.  I went here for dinner with some friends while staying at Mandalay Bay.  The dinner itself took a long time- our food seemed to take forever to cook and they brought out the wrong order for one of my friends.  If you order the quesadilla, beware the it will arrive looking like a pizza with some chunks sprinkled on top.  The restaurant was loud, mainly because of the trio of singers/musicians loudly serenading the patrons in Spanish for tips.  Unfortunately they came to our table just as our food arrived and probably breathed all over it, delaying our meal even further.  This place is convenient and the food is decent, but don't go for the ambience.
