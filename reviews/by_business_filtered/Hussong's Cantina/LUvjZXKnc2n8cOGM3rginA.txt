Great food, great drinks, reasonable prices. We started off our meal sharing the....wait for it....64 OUNCE Romance margarita.  It was made with strawberry and banana pur√©e and it was a little slice of heaven. Paired with their amazing chips and incredible homemade salsa, I was happy. 

I personally like Mexican food because as someone who is gluten free, the menus tend to be 90% GF. Same holds true here. I ordered the shrimp tacos and they were great. My hubby also really enjoyed his chicken chimichanga. 

Service was good and atmosphere was great. I highly recommend!
