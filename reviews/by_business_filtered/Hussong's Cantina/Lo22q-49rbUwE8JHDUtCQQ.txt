I wish there was one on the East Coast! Every time I am in Vegas I have to stop in for the margaritas and tacos. They are both as authentic as it gets! The ambiance is great too... it reminds me of a Mexican saloon. The complimentary chips and salsas (you get a couple) are delicious. I have tried most of the appetizers, all of the salads, as well as the chicken and lobster tacos. So far - the nachos, fried avocado salad and lobster tacos are at the top of my list. If you are adventurous, I've heard the bone marrow dish is out of this world. The bartenders are great and make every margarita by hand to order... I mean squeezing the limes and all! It is certainly a must try next time you're in Sin City!
