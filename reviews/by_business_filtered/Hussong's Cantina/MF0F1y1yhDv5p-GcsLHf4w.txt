Decided on Mexican for lunch today while shopping and playing tourist here in Las Vegas at the Mandalay Bay!  We were seated right away and the shortly our waitress brought us complimentary chips and salsa...nice!  Ordered a margarita which was good, but considering that they say they are the home of the original margarita I kind of expected a better margarita!  Not a deal breaker though.  For lunch hubby and myself both ordered chicken enchiladas that came with rice and beans.  I must say that the enchiladas were pretty tasty.  However, the rice and beans could have very well been left off my plate....me no likey!  Service was subpar.  Our waitress seemed very overwhelmed and pushy.  Overall, I would consider returning but it wouldn't be my first or even second when it comes to Mexican food!
