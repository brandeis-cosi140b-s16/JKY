My server was very helpful, explaining the difference between the Original (fresh = sour) and the Traditional (mix = sweet) margaritas. The original was delicious. I was torn between ordering the avocado/shrimp salad or the lobster tacos, and my server recommended the salad as one of her favorites. I was surprised to see the entire avocado was deep fried with cooked shrimp inside. Unusual, but tasty. Served on a bed of lettuce with the whitest scallions I've ever seen, plus tomato and bacon bits.
