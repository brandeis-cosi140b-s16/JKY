So we were pretty exhausted and staying in one of the conjoined hotels and Hussongs was just easy. And we're Texans and were craving some Mexican food.

I came with a party of 5, all hoping for really good Mexican food. It was definitely not bad. But I can't tell for sure if I really felt that way or was just really tired/hungry.  I was wavering between four and three stars to this point but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and go four.

The chips seemed authentic. They were the thick homemade style which I love. The salsa left some to be desired which was a major bummer. Salsa can make or break a Mexican restaurant in my humble opinion.

I ordered some kind of trio combination plate as I was feeling pretty indecisive. I believe it had an enchilada and taco both with meat of choice and a beef flauta. Rice and beans of course. It was good!  I would go back. I would probably try something different as I wasn't wildly pleased with my entree.

My husbands quesadillas looked and tasted pretty amazing. Just a basic chicken one off the appetizers I believe. I might go that route.

Overall we had really good service and enjoyed the food. I would recommend trying it.
