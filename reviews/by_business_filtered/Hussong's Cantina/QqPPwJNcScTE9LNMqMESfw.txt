So, we came in here a little before they closed, and the place was pretty empty, which was nice. Very tasty American-Mexican food. The guacamole was really tasty. I had the Tostada salad, really good with a nice kick of jalepeno. My mom ordered the fish tacos, she seemed to like them. The service was really good, our waitress was nice and friendly.
