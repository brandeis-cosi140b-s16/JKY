Sat at the bar for a quick lunch before heading out to the airport.  The bartender was okay but he was trying to act cool making it very hard to understand a word that came out of his mouth!  We ordered the enchiladas and vegetarian tres tacos.  The food was mediocre and definitely not worth the price.  The filling for the vegetarian tacos was blah - potatoes, a few carrot pieces and a mushroom?  Really?  No red/green peppers, no onions, nothing remotely Mexican?  The beans are not vegetarian by the way - make sure to ask!

My boyfriend liked his margarita but I did not.  Overall a disappointment.
