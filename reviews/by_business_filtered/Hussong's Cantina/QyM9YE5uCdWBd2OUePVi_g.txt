My mother's family lives near the original Hussong's in Ensenada in Baja, and I've enjoyed a few (um, crazy) nights back in the day there.

Hussong's Las Vegas is quite different. They have a decent-size menu, and friendly staff and management. 

Went there with the honey, and ordered a pitcher of original margaritas. They said they don't use pre-made margarita mix, which I find too sweet. The margaritas were sweet-made with agave nectar, but not over the top.

Chips and salsa were good, and the salsas they serve have a good flavor and decent heat. I asked if they have a HOTHOT salsa, and the waiter brought out a salsa made with habanero and goodness know what else. After one taste, I couldn't feel my mouth for a good five minutes. If I was drooling, I wouldn't have felt it.

We had a queso fundido appetizer with chimichurri. We added the chorizo to the dish, and it came with warm corn tortillas. Let me tell you, it was fantastic. The dish is small, but packed with flavor. Melted cheesy, meaty goodness, and we couldn't get enough.

The boyfriend got the enchiladas plazeras at the waiter's recommendation. The plate looked like a mess, with potatoes, carrots and sauce on top that made it look like some sort of stew dish. The stew concoction on top was pretty good, but the enchiladas underneath all of that didn't have very much flavor.

I got the fish tacos, and for fish tacos, they were quite tasty. Generous fish, lots of cabbage slaw and sauce. 

The portions on the entrees were generous, and we left stuffed and satisfied.

We'll be going back to try another dish in the future, and to see the rock and roll mariachi band...which from what I hear, plays everything from rap to Black Sabbath. Coming from a mariachi-player family, I've GOT to see that....
