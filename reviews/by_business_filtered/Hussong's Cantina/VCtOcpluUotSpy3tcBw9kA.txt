Hussong's Cantina was a good way to start our Vegas stay. Our food was good and some additional positives include the unlimited chips and salsa and the prices (considering most restaurants in Vegas outside fast food can be pricey). We did find the service to be mediocre, and we were told a 25 minute wait whenever there were clearly tables available all over the restaurant. Overall, it was a good experience with tasty food. However, I do not think I would go out of my way to eat here on my next Vegas visit, but good if nearby.
