Great bar service here at Hussong's Cantina. Our bartender was friendly and explained the tequila menu, even bringing out the extra stuff. I love a margarita that isn't made with a pre-made mix and Hussong's brought it out just the way I love it. It felt like a true Mexican margarita. The chips and salsa were quite good, but the guacamole was over the top with onions. If you love onions - go for it. If you don't... skip it. The guy next to us didn't speak English and the bartender found a translator for him. Great service - I wouldn't hesitate to return.
