Very disappointed with the quality of food that I received when I dined in. 
I was excited to see they had vegan options, and had a tough decision on whether to eat here, or slice of vegas one day. I chose wrong, but then later atoned for that mistake. 
The chips and salsa, as well as the service, were both excellent, so the two stars reflects upon the rest of the dining experience, because both of those were 5 stars. 
My vegan burrito was tasteless, very little in terms of redeeming factors. The sauce that came on it was very bad, it tasted like it was cooked for like 3 hours too long accidentally, burnt, but not in a smoky good way. There wasn't much in terms of crisp veggie content in the burrito itself, mostly some very bland tasting gardein strips. The rice and beans that came with weren't very exciting either. 
I think the tell tale sign, was my girl, who usually digs this type of cuisine (its her favorite) didn't like her meal at all (non-vegan meal). 
One of the 2 strike outs during our trip, but slice of vegas just down the way was delicious.
