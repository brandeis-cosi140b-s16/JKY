So this place is actually AMAZING.

The chips are ADDICTING! They were hot with the perfect crisp and saltiness. The basket will be gone...Filling up on chips here is acceptable. The salsa is also bomb and so fresh.

Menu - Such a great selection. Really something for everyone. I didn't even know they had a vegan menu, but I actually was debating between options even without it.

I ordered the arugula salad which was a smaller portion, but delicious. Also, actually affordable - $12 for hotel Vegas. That's a steal.

So Vegas trip for work, but fun food indeed!

One note - arugula salad was not arugula but rather spinach....awk aardvark arugula. Still amazeballs nonetheless.
