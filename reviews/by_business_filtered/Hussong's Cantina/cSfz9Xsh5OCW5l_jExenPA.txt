Amazing Mexican cantina in Mandalay Bay! In the strip of shops, this restaurant is tucked in but quite lively from the walkway. 

The service was wonderful and the grilled corn appetizer is a must-try. It's unlike any other flavor! 

The chips were thick and hot and the salsas were fresh and tasty. 

I ordered the Surf and Turf. While the steak was a little tough, the shrimp was to die for and the corn that came on the side was wonderful.
