If you are looking for real Mexican food and good service.....THIS IS NOT THE PLACE!

I'll start with the chips and salsa. Chips were pretty good, salsa was NOT. It reminded me of canned sauce. In fact, we asked the waitress about the salsa and found out that it also doubled as the enchilada sauce as well as the sauce they put on the wet burritos. Not much effort going on in the kitchen.

We ordered several apps and all 3 of us ordered an entree. I was going to order the tacos, but they were $4 ea for meat only and $0.45 for each addtl topping, so you could easily spend $6 per taco.....and you had to order 4 to get beans and rice....so, for 4 tacos it would cost you about $24.....yikes. The tacos were served on the mini corn tortillas that are about 3" in diameter. 
 
Our waitress was not very good at her job. The bus boy should've actually been the waiter. She was not very attentive. In fact, we were fortunate enough to have a coupon for a free taco, so we tried one each. When we got the bill, they charged us for the tacos.....

If you are looking for good food, go somewhere else. You can get better Mexican food at taco bell.
