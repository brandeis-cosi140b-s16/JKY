Ate here on our trip to Vegas last year using a Restaurant.com certificate.  Gotta love the places that let you include liquor the coupon.  We each had a large margarita that was delicious and not weak.  We shared the steak nachos that were excellent.  Shared a couple other appetizers that also hit the mark well.  A bit small of a space and you get to know your neighbors well.  Great deal with the certificate.
