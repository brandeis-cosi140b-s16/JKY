I wanted to like this place. Really I did. We were here for a week and hoped this place was good enough to eat here twice. I had a Vegas Insider card with a special deal, 2 for 1 margaritas and a free appetizer with 2 entrees. Also had a gift certificate from restaurant.com but did not got a chance to use it during this visit.

At first I thought they made a mistake, but they indeed honored the card. We got the 2 for 1 margaritas and they knocked the price of an appetizer off of the bill. They were pushing a steak dinner special, maybe we should have spent a few more bucks for that. We decided on tacos instead. I had the steak tacos, my wife had the chicken tacos. Hers were greasy. Mine were dry. They weren't very good that day. Each taco dish also came with a small cup of beans and rice that were just ok.

They do give you free chips and 2 cups of salsa to start off but the mild salsa that was so mild we could barely taste it (looked kinda like balsamic vinegar) and the hot salsa was HOT but had the consistency of watered down ketchup. It was not salsa, it was hot sauce. We got a side of guacamole as our free appetizer. The guacamole was good and fresh, with chunks of avocado. So good we put it on our tacos.

The margaritas were good and strong. They were served in a 12 oz beer glass filled with ice. The Mariachi Band wasn't playing when we were here, but I hear they are just too loud, so we were just fine with the music playing through the sound system. Service was good. The hostess seated us right away and everything came out pretty quick. Our server was friendly and attentive. 

If you are looking for a place in Mandalay Place to enjoy a drink or two, they make a really good margarita. We just weren't impressed with the food. Will probably go back but will definitely try something else if we do.
