The 48oz margaritas are to die for!  I bought the take home goblet and came back for refills a few times with some friends.  They were strong but mixed well so they were delicious!  The food was great and not too expensive but the atmosphere is the best part.  The bartenders and servers are exceptional and are genuinely friendly.
