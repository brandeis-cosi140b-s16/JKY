Stopped in for a quick snack and drink at happy hour. We were immediately greeted with a free basket of warm tortilla chips and two types of salsa; the tomatillo avocado salsa was particularly tasty. We split an order of nachos and each grabbed a traditional margarita - all of which were half price for happy hour. Everything came out very quickly. The nachos were admittedly a bit small, but I think that can be excused since these are possibly the best nachos I've ever had. Delicious chips that were piled high with chicken, beans, corn, and veggies, with sour cream and green salsa drizzled on top. The margaritas were tasty and particularly boozy. 
Great place, would definitely come back.
