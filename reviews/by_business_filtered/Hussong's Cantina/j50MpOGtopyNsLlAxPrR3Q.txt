After walking and rushing from one end of the strip all the way to Mandalay Bay just so we can get our Lion King tickets before the box office close, we were SO GLAD to have found this place. And a good thing we did because we got to try the Bone Marrow and it was SUPERB! 

It sounded weird at first but apparently the Bone Marrow were these large bone marrows served with sides of chimichurri salsa, onion-cilantro mix and corn tortillas. It was on the fatty side, but it was delicious and a cool experience. I ordered the Quesadilla while my friend ordered the tortas. We both thought the quessadilla and tortas were just OK while the bone marrow was something to rave about. I like the chips and salsa that we got when we sat down- spicy!
