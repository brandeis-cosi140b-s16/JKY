Another restaurant with loads of fake "memorabilia" on the walls.

When I arrived, they walked me past a bunch of open tables to the table farthest in the back, right next to the constantly swinging kitchen door, and facing the table that was being used by the staff to fold napkins. If it were not for the fact that the busboy folding napkins had a great butt, I would have complained.

Later, when they found out that I am conducting one of the big shows in town, they offered to move me to a better table. I politely declined, (Too Late) but thought; "Ya mean if you'd thought that I wasn't your average customer, you would have given me a reasonable table?" Not good.

They advertise as "Not your standard gringo Mexican food place". But that's exactly what I found. The food was all very average. The tomatillo salsa that was served on my "Enchiladas Suizas" was the same that was served with the chips when I arrived. The chicken inside did not seem spiced or marinaded in any way. The tortillas were dull.

The margarita was good (made with fresh lime juice), but it was not "the original" margarita, as advertised. According to Hussong's history, the original was made with Damiana liqueur, which adds a slightly bitter, herbal flavor. Here, they substitute Cointreau, which is citrusy and very sweet - again, appealing to the average Gringo.

I've mentioned this before, but I'll bring it up again: Las Vegas is jam-packed with awesome Mexican restaurants - and most of them are dirt cheap. If you're gonna charge $16 for an enchilada, you'd better back it up with outstanding food; interesting drinks, and impeccable service.

I did not find any of those here.
