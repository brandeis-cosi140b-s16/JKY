Famous Pros n Cons

I lived in mexico for a few months, lived in LA, dated a Mexican girl for 10 years so in sum - I've eaten Mexican food all over the place for many years....



Pros - 

Quite simply the best Mexican tasting food in Las Vegas!
Fries were amazing
Location is great if you're by Mandalay/Luxur
Staff is very helpful and friendly
Tortilla soup was to die for
Fajitas were fantastic too and great meat cuts
Real Mexican Food - authentic
Roots in Ensenada Mexico - they own a bar there, same family - fun place!


Con -

Prices could be lower but maybe they pay for the location - Mandalay may have them by the balls. 

In sum - You gota have it!!!! You need it!
