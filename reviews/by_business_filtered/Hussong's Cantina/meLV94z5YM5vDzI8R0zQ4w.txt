After visiting the next-door Burger Bar and considering that the best casual dining in Las Vegas, my friends and I were really happy to find a cool place right next door.  Ironically, they had a live mariachi band which reminded me of the original Hussongs down in Mexico (the place to "break your drinking cherry" when you turn 18 in SoCal...).  Now that it's so dangerous to cross the border south, I'd say cross the border to the east (of Los Angeles) and head over to this new one in Vegas. 

Food:  Tasty, Plentiful, Good Pricing
Bevs:  Drinkable, have four 
People: Both the staff and the crowd were pretty cool when I went there

Viva Las Vegas!  (and get the shirt  ;-)
