Located in Mandalay Place, inside of Mandalay Bay resort hotel casino on the famous Las Vegas Strip. I love this place, I will start by saying the owners are incredibly nice. The food is fantastic, and they have a Mariachi band that plays Neil Diamond! That's not enough for you? Ok then, they have one of the best happy hours on the strip, a killer selection of tequilas and did I mention fantastic food? I am looking forward to my next visit, there is so much more on the menu I want/need to try. If you find yourself on the south side of the strip stop in, you wont be sorry.
