This is your 'Mexican food' place if you go to Chili's for a steak (nobody would do that) !  Stop fooling the tourists by telling them this is authentic Mexican food. Oh yeah... way over priced, even for the strip... I had to give this review a star rating in order to post but I want to take it back.
