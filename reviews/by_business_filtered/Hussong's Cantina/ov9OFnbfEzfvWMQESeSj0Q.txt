We went recently with our son to try some Mexican.  The place is gorgeous and the tarnished silverware was very rustic.  Management should be ashamed of themselves for leave one poor guy to be battered by the crowds.  It was a Thursday during the summer at 2pm!  Being that I have worked on the Strip and still work in the business in this city I felt the gentleman's pain.  But the management was nowhere to be found.  That is poor and corporate, instead of sitting and eating management should have jumped and helped this poor fellow.  Tourist stories of Vegas go far even if people will come only once.  The food was great and enjoyable.  The quesadilla was great, using actual Mexican styled cheese for a change and my burrito was stuffed to the brim and topped with the amazing salsa given with the chips.  we didn't have any dessert or drinks cause we were with our 3 year-old, but the bar looks like a cool place to hang out.
