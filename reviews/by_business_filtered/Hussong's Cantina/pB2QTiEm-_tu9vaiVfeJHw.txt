Your average GOOD Mexican Cantina.  They have all the usual suspects you'd expect and give you fresh chips and salsa when you sit down.  Everything seemed very fresh and had great flavor.  I'd compare this place with your local high quality Mexican restaurant.  While it was perfectly great, I have no real reason to return here unless everyone in my group wanted to go.
