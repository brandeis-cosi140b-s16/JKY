Wow, what an awful experience. Maybe it was an off night? Our evening didn't go nearly as well as some of these other reviews.

What started off as a 30- to 40-minute wait turned into an hour, followed by a 45-minute wait for our food after ordering. Service: 0/5.

Our food came, and it was extremely hit and miss. Guacamole, quesadilla, and burger and fries (oddly), all great. Definitely would recommend those. However, the tacos (awful), Mexican and cheesy rices (badly undercooked), beans (off flavors), carne asada (rubbery), and salad (criminally under-lettuced) all were some of the worst Mexican food our party has ever had.

We did manage to get free swag (sunglasses and shirts) from some restaurant sponsors, but that did very little to make up for the $150 we spent on a pretty awful experience. YMMV
