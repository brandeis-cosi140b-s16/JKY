The service, food and margarita's were quite smashing at Hussong's Cantina.  
My friend I were seated very quickly and learned that they were only serving the late night menu.  We both ordered a burrito and margarita and enjoyed a most wonderful meal.   
The server was very polite and took care of our ever need.
