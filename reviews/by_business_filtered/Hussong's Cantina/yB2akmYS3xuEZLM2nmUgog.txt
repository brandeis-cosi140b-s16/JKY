I've eaten here twice. Both times the servers were very nice but not particularly knowledgeable. The food was pretty good but the style is different. Many items come "deconstructed" but the menu doesn't prepare you for that. So the food wasn't what we expected. Will be back but wish they'd be more precise in their menu descriptions.
