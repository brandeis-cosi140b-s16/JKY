Wow!
Perhaps my review is extra good because I had no expectations for Hussong's.  I'm not the biggest Mexican food enthusiast - don't get me wrong, I like it at times, but I don't crave it regularly the way other people seem to.
My best friend had a gift certificate for it, so we decided to check it out.  
We were promptly seated.  The place was pretty crowded on a Thursday evening around 8pm. 
Our waiter brought us these delicious warm chips along with 2 dishes of salsa.  We also requested their extra spicy salsa that he brought momentarily - I could have filled myself up on the chips and salsa alone as all 3 assortments were delicious!
I proceeded to order the El Pepino margarita (jalapenos and cucumber).  Maybe I got lucky, but it was one of the best margaritas I've ever had.
For the main course, I ordered their combo meal which included a steak quesadilla, corn, beans, rice, and chile relleno.  I don't know what they did to that damn corn...but it was some of the BEST corn I've ever had! That makes 2 bests in one meal! The steak quesadilla was excellent as well.  
Overall, we left feeling very pleasantly surprised, happy, and full! We will definitely be returning :-)
