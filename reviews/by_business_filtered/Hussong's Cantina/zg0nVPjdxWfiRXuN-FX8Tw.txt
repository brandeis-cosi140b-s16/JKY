Quickly seated. Waitress was friendly and discussed drinks with us. Checked on drink ingredients when she wasn't sure and brought sangria samples. Great margarita. Husband liked the carna asada and they have some of the best pork quesadillas I've ever had. Only reason for 4 stars was the smallish table.
