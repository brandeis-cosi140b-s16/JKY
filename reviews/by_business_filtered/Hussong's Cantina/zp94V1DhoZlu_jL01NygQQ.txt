We came here for the vegan menu on 3/15/15 and were very happy with our entire experience. I had the nachos featuring Teese vegan cheese and Gardein faux-chicken. It was luxuriously creamy and very satisfying. 

The mojitos here are the best in the hotel. We tried the mojitos at the Franklin bar in Delano and one at the Border Grill in Mandalay Bay. The one at Hussong's is far superior. Pleasantly just sweet enough and a generous size. We tried the peach and mango mojitos and peach was the best of the two. Highly recommend. 

Lastly our server was excellent. She was very friendly and accommodating.
