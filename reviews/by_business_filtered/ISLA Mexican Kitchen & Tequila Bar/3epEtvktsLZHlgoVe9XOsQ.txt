We've been to Isla twice now. The first time was for brunch and my wife and I really liked it. The atmosphere and food were both nice; that said, it takes a lot for us locals to make a trip to the strip. But Treasure Island is pretty easy to get to from the I-15, so we made a second trip for dinner the second week of September.

Like our first visit, we had a friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive server. She was able to answer our questions about the menu and took great care of us. Unfortunately, like most strip restaurants the drinks are overpriced; $6 for a coors light? One of my biggest Strip pet peeves are the overpriced drinks. Margaritas...$12 bucks; you get the picture. I wish these places would make a bigger effort to cater to the locals and offer a better value to the tourists...anyways...I digress.

We each order just entrees after gorging on the delicious chips and salsa. You get a tower of chips and three salsas. They taste house made to me. I would be shocked if they weren't. All a little different with good seasoning and not to mild or too hot/spicy.

I had the Smoked short ribs. Excellent and tender with a nice red chile sauce and smashed potatoes to go with them. A very tasty "Mexican" version of meat  and potatoes.

My Wife had the fish tacos. These came out on a long rectangular  plate. Breaded and deep fried Mahi mahi on corn tortillas. Very tasty.

My Cousin had the Roasted Mahi Mahi with a passion fruit habenero sauce. Nice presentation, but the fish was a little too fishy for my tastes. I could smell it slightly when it came to the table. I wouldn't have hurt you, but I know when fish is not at it's absolute freshest. 

Overall, Isla, is a tasty "haute" Mexican restaurant on the strip. It's worthy of another return visit for sure
