We ate the bar in front of the restaurant - they had some games on and it's just better for socializing.

Had really tasty Sin City Ambers to start with.  We ordered their "famous" guacamole to start with.  It was great - creamy and flavorful.  I thought the rest of the meal was good, standard fare, but the guac would bring me back again.
