I swear if it wasnt for my dude Arturo who was our bartender for the night, my night wouldn't be as entertaining. This guy is the real deal. Luckily my gf copped us a 2 for 1 cocktail deal, courtesy of TI. I basically had rum and coke and another glass of vodka and cranberry juice. I did get a bit tipsy and I did have a great time talking with Arturo and my gf! He is so helpful with the types of drinks too. He gave us the details on each tequila and told us what was hot and what was not. 

He introduced my to some expensive ass tequila called Ansom Broso which was anejo and cost $125 a shot!!!! Holy crap! He even gave me a swig of the tequila azul which cost $25 a shot! He is legit I tell you.

If you ever visit TI and drink through ISLA, I suggest coming around 12 am and having Arturo as your personal dude.
