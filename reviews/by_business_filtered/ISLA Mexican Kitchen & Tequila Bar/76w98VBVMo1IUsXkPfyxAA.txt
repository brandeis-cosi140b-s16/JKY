I really like this place. We stayed at the TI a couple years back and ended up here. This place really turned me on to tequila. They have a nice little bar (with video poker built in) right off the casino floor. That means you'll get casino noise and smoke. Welcome to Vegas, get used to it. I would prefer if my back wasn't to the casino, but it's ok. They have more lounge-type chairs right on the casino border, but they are too low for me. I'm a little taller and it feels like I am sitting on the floor. Anyway, great tequila selection at decent prices. The interior of the restaurant is very nicely decorated. You can go here, not spend a ton and feel like you're eating someplace nice. As with many Vegas restaurants, you'll often be told there's a huge wait, even though it's half empty. Never understood that. Also, their hours are terrible. Even the bar seems to open late and close early. It's a bar in Vegas, they should really be open longer. The food is very good. Not as good as Taqueria Canonita, but much cheaper and still more 'gourmet' than the average mexican place. Everything I've ever had was very good. They have some different menu items that make it fun to sample. This is one of my favorite places in Vegas, especially for tequila. Ole!
