I can't believe how many stars this place has!!! I visited this establishment on Cinco de Mayo nonetheless and it was a huge disappointment. I was eating with friends that were in town staying at TI so they wanted to eat somewhere in the hotel. I should have known it wasn't good when we were seated without a wait. The drinks were eh okay, but for the price should have been way better. One of my friends ordered a Gin and Tonic and had to send it back because it tasted funky. 

Now for the food. I ordered the seared Ahi tuna salad. It looked and tasted like canned tuna smothered in chili powder and piled on a spinach salad. The flavors were all over the place, grapefruit slices that provided an unwanted punch after eating the bitter (fully cooked) tuna slices. One person ordered the shredded beef tacos and lamented that he could have had better at Taco Bell. After drinks and dinner (no appetizers or desserts) our bill came to $130 for 4 people. Needless to say I won't be going back anytime soon.
