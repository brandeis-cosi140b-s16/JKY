Made a reservation here for my sister's 21st birthday, because it looked fancy, she loves nachos, and the prices were acceptable for everyone in the party.

Our waitstaff was awesome. Half of the party ordered drinks, and man were they strong! If it hadn't been the youngin's ordering them, there might even have been complaints that they were TOO strong. Definitely a plus in my book...

The Chips and Salsa that is brought to the table is delicious! I love the different flavors they give you, and you can tell the chips are made fresh.

I split the fajitas with another person in the party. I would DEFINITELY recommend splitting dishes. They are HUGE! The fajitas were flavorful, and didn't need any hot sauce (I am a freak about hot sauce, I ALWAYS need hot sauce).

I had a couple bites of the steak burrito - yummy, flavorful meat! I also tried some of the nachos - very well made; a good amount of cheese and toppings to fill every chip.

At the end of the dinner, they even brought out a complimentary dessert for my sister, and we procedded to embarrass her beyond belief by singing as loud as possible.

This is a good restaurant to go for a more low-key or romantic setting, without getting too serious or expensive.
