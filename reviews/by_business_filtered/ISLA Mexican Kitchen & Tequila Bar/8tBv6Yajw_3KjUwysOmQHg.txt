Hands down a solid meal.  In the land of buffets and suspect food, this place delivers a good meal with real flavor.  Sure it might be a few dollars more than your local taqueria but hey, it's Vegas.  
I had the carnitas plate and I definitely recommend it.  There are also a ton of different tequilas to try out.  The bartenders were ready with recommendations.
All in all worth the money and time In a city where a sucker is served every minute and shitty meals are as plentiful as the strip club flyers in the gutter.
