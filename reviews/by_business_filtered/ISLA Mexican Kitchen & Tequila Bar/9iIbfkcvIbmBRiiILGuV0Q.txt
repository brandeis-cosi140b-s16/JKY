As a man, I have to say it was pleasant to have the buxom woman seat my party as we arrived at Isla.  Got a couple orders of the guacamole which was alright, not the best but not terrible, 4 out of 5.  The margaritas were nice and strong.  The tacos, not too good, 3 out of 5.  The service was very good, very attentive.  The decor was also very nice, I was glad to see Treasure Island stepped it up as I hadn't been since my younger days when the draw was the arcade.  Overall, pleased.
