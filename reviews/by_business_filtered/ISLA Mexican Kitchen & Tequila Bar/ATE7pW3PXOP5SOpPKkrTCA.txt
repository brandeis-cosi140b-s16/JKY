It's all about the MARGARITAS!!!  The PRIMO IS PRIMO!  Somehow that addition of fruit juice sets off the slight bitterness in tequila to a T.  The Guacamole is like homemade, and the sauces are not so searing hot that you can't eat them without tearing up.  Warm tortilla chips make the appetizer perfect. The couch seating area by the bar allows you to people watch, or dart out to see the Siren's Show in front of TI.   We had a great time, with fun, friendly waitstaff, and a showy bartender, who kept the bar hoppin.
My buds said their chicken enchiladas were too corny, with too much sauce, but from all the reviews I read from California, we must have a certain kind of Mexican food we cannot find here.  Reasonable prices make Isla a fun stop in TI.
