Food: The food here was very good. I tried the chicken enchiladas which were very tasty! Also we were served tortilla chips before our meal with three different salsas which were also great! Recently I tried the masa corn cake appetizer which was also pretty good. 

Price: Prices here are very cheap. Each entree dish was maybe around $30 or under. You can also get tacos, enchiladas, or burritos which comes with rice and beans which were are around $16 and under.

Service: During my first vist here the service was pretty good, nice and speedy. However durinfg my recent visit here, service was extremely slow! I think they were understaffed with their waiters...and plus our meals came out before our appetizer even made it to our table. 

Location: Located right in Treasure Island.

Atmosphere: I liked the atmosphere here. It wasnt super fancy or anything but it was definitely casual. A very nice restaurant to eat for couples, groups, or families.
