We had tickets for mystere, and needed to eat a bite before. So we decided Isla Mexican Kithchen located in the treasure island.
I first asked what would be quicker sit-down or bar since we only had an hour. We sat at the bar,  first come firsr serve. Our bartender/waiter Sergio was great. He took our order chicken quesadilla for the man, chicken tacos for me! We asked for chips and salsa. Which were free and came with two delish salsas. Chicken tacos were great especially the beans. Sergio made a few drinks for other tables and let us try the excess. Strong strong margaritas.But very nice since Sergio did not have to let us sample. I would eat here again and again! We had great service and loved the food.
