(DISCLAIMER:  I only tried this place for some light pre-show bites & drinks during Happy Hour.)
It was wonderful to be able to skip the insanely long, slow buffet line that stretched in front of this place and plunk our buns down at the bar.
Our bartender (Edwin) was WONDERFUL!   We had the premium classical margaritas ($7 HH price) - and I must say, it was one of the best margaritas I have had.  I mean, ingredients included freshly squeezed lime juice and grand marnier (cointreau?) drizzled on top - how can you go wrong?  Somehow, he kept us in drinks (no waiting/trying desperately to catch the bartender's eye here) without any perceptible rush or stress.  Absolute first class. 
As for the food, we had the achiote chicken wings  and the marinated pork tacos ($6 each - HH prices).   
To be honest, I admit my expectations were low  (too much Las Vegas buffet food) but the food was surprising tasty - gorgeous to look at and the flavors mature and harmonious.  My only gripe is that the servings were a bit small...    but overall, this place was well worth the time & money.
