Came here with my best friends D and fellow yelper Michelle E. on a Groupon outing!  The set up of this joint was very cool, dark... spacious [you weren't in your neighbors conversation, which i hate]  the bar is in a seperate section but still very accessible.  

the table set up is beautiful and you get a good view of the kitchen.  tableware and silverware were beautiful, artwork on the walls are very cool.

the food is very similar to the fresh mex places out there like chipotle or baja fresh.  Nothing special... but not at all bad.  

Chips and 3 salsas to start.  Chips were fresh and super crunchy which i love!  I ordered a chicken burrito that came with a salad and beans,  which was very good, but in the environment that we were in I just expected a little more i guess?  Something special?  the awesome thing about this place was i walked out not feeling stuffed like i usually do which is a good sign to me.  

The presentation of the food was nice and the prices are awesome!!
