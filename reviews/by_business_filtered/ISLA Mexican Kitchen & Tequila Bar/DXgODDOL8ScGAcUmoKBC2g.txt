Visited here for what I knew would be a solid tequila experience. The tequila selection is great...the service was Jekyll and Hyde-ish. 

We were initially served by a waitress who was a little cool, and business like. Helpful, but not super great. She went on break or something, and out of the back came Linda (I think that was her name, I was pretty deep in my margarita at that point). 

I believe that Linda is the same server some people call "too attentive" and "almost creepy" but she was amazing. We ordered a tequila flight, and she educated us on each tequila. She then asked what we liked and did not like, and brought over MORE free shots to sample. She also brought a higher end tequila she declared her favourite. She read our table so well, it was no surprise she seemed to love her job so much. 

Then, just as suddenly she was gone and the other cold server was back out. Would have stayed longer and ordered more flights had Linda stuck around. What happened? We'll never know. We paid the bill and got out. 

Recommend; fresh blackberry margarita, any of the tequila flights for sipping. Decent value and a fun place. Hope to see "Linda" (?!)  on our next visit. We sat in the bar, overlooking the casino which was great for people watching, especially as Mystere let out.
