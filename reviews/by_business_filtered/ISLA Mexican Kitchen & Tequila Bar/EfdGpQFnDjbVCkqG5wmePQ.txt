Wife and I went to Isla with a Groupon, so the price was right.

Unfortunately, the dining experience didn't live up to our expectations. The food was very pedestrian and unremarkable.

Chips and salsa were OK - neither amazing or terrible. They came on a fancy elevated stand which made things a bit messy.

I ordered some carne asada tacos which were pretty much just meat in tortilla without any other trappings. They didn't taste bad, but aren't something I would ever seek out again.

We shared queso fundido which was basically just melted cheese in a bowl. Yes, I know that's what it's supposed to be, but surely it could be dressed up in some way into something you couldn't prepare in 45 seconds in your own microwave?

The restaurant was decently pretty, but we found the furniture a little odd. Chairs were very high so we constantly felt like we either had to put our palms down on the table or slouch right over. Not very comfortable.

Overall, Isla might be worth checking out if you have a comp, a good coupon, or if you're absolutely desperate, but for the price you're better off trying one of The Strip's Mexican places that combines sophisticated looks with sophisticated tastes.
