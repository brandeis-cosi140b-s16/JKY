Isla boasts delicious Mexican food.  Our server was amazing and took excellent care of us.  After he was informed that one of our dining companions was a strict vegetarian, he gave her a side of queso as she couldn't partake in one of our appetizers and made sure that both of her sides with her dinner were vegetarian.  

The muddled mojitos were ridiculously tasty.  I had the fish tacos. I loved the corn tortillas which were soft and not hard and annoyingly flaky.  My only complaint is that it's hard to dance on a full stomach, so pace yourself, cowboy.
