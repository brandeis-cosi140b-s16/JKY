Sis and I patronized this establishment twice on recent visit to LV.  First night was just for cocktails and snacks.  The house margarita was fine and my sister's lemon drop was best she had in Vegas.  We ate at the bar and really enjoyed Augie.  Her service was great and her stories equally good.  Look for her when you belly up to the bar.  Foodwise, we loved the chicken quesadilla we shared.  It was not what we expected, but unlike a prior reviewer, we LOVED it.  MMMMMMM.

Then a couple of nights later we came back for dinner.  No room in dining room so we ate hunched over the low table in the bar.  This did allow us to watch the rodeo on TV so that was cool.  Had the guac which was yummy and came with 3 delish salsas.  Sis had the seafood enchiladas and I had the biggest chile relleno I've ever seen - stuffed with chopped grilled veggies and cheese.  MMMMMM  again.  Lovely sauces on both dishes.    No booze this night as we were recovering from prior evening.  But the food was great and I would definitely come here again.  It's not your garden variety Mexican food - so if you want to that don't come here and dis the place.  Say hi to Augie for me and ask about her dogs.
