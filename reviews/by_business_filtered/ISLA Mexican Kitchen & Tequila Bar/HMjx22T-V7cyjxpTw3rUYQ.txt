WHERE: Located inside Treasure Island Hotel/Casino! (If I can recall, it's by the buffet?)

WHY: Try some uniquely crafted Mexican food!

WHAT: Firstly, the place was absolutely gorgeous! From the dimmed setting, to the chill atmosphere, it gave off a great vibe.

My friend and I decided we try this place out because he is a fairly picky eater, but isn't picky when it comes to nachos! When we entered the restaurant though, we were directed all the way to this spot in the corner. It was literally in the corner, you can probably fit a full-sized square table right next to where we were. That right there made us feel like outcasts!

While we were seated, we waited for our menus and realized the table wasn't "cleaned". A couple minutes later, the server realized we were there, saw the dirty table, and went to grab a cloth to clean it with.  We then made our orders.

One of the servers came to give us water, and he noticed my glass was dirty as well, so he gave me a new one. Thank goodness! I love me some water, and I don't want any dirtiness in my water! X)

I tried the Isla Sliders, which included a trio of shredded pork, beef barbacoa, and chipotle chicken sliders. They were all good, but I did notice they were dryer than the usual slider.

My friend tried the Isla Nachos. On a positive not, he loved them (Although they gave us nachos with three types of salsa after we ordered, LOL). I got to try them as well, and the nachos are the way to go!

Overall, I thought this place was just decent. Thinking about if I will ever go there just to eat again? I don't think so. =/
