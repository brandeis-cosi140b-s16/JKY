Years later I and I still make sure to do a trip here everytime I go. Just went out with a Bachelor party and when buffet plans fell through, this is where we went. It was a big hit and they were accommading. They have "tequila goddesses" roaming around now, its both good and bad. Just go eat your Filet Minon burrito.. you know you want to. Its the definition of Vegas.. An excess of quality of meat in a burrito.
