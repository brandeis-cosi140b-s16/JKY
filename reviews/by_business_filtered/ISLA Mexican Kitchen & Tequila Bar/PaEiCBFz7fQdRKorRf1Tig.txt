I went here last week with a friend from out of town. We ordered the corn masa cakes as an appetizer, and I got the chipotle shrimp. Both were just okay, certainly not the 4 stars average that this restaurant seems to be getting. For the high price, the appetizer and entree were just ordinary, not tasty, nothing amazing, 

On a positive note, the decor of the restaurant is really nice. It wasn't too noisy considering it's located right inside a casino on the Strip. We also shared a dessert, the cinnamon crepe. This was probably the one shining glory of this restaurant. If it weren't for the dessert, I would have rated this establishment 2 stars.
