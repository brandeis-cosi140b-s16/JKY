this is one of the better, upper class, gourmet type mexican food restaurants. if there is such a thing. i onlt gave this place 3 stars, heres why.

1. food tastes great, not exactly an el taurino but it's still good. 

2.  all the meals come with spanish rice and black beans but literally everything else is extra. guacamole, hot sauces, torillas...... get it?

3. the service is terrible, excluding for the frequent water re-filling.

4. eat as much as the chips and salsa you can get, it's free and good.

have good eatin!
