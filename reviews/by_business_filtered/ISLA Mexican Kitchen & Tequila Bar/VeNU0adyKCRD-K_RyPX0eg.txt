I'm from New England, where really great, authentic Mexican food is pretty tough to come by.  I'd really love to try the Mexican places that the more critical reviewers of ISLA are comparing it to... because I've never tasted better Mexican food than the meal we had at ISLA!

The freshly made tortilla chips came with 3 varieties of salsas for dipping.  All were tasty, and it was fun mixing and matching them together.  I ordered a classic margarita, which was also tops!

I ordered the chicken enchiladas, and the boyfriend ordered the filet mignon burrito... yes, you read that right: filet mignon in a burrito.  I tasted it,  and it was pretty fantastic!  My enchiladas were also delicious.  I especially loved the flavorful red and green sauces they came topped with!  The rice and beans were also fantastic; far more flavorful than the types I've had at Mexican places back home.  I ate every scrap of food on my plate, as did my boyfriend.

The prices were fair (especially for Vegas), the service was quick and friendly, and we both left saying we're not sure if we can go back to eating at Mexican restaurants back home after eating there!  I'm salivating just thinking about it, and saddened by the fact that it will likely be a very long time before I ever get to eat there again.  Sigh...
