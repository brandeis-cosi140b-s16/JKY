It was our friends pick, and she choose this place. Since they like staying at Treasure Island often, this is one of her favorite places. They recommended have a tequila shot that comes with a tomato base chaser (sangrito). 

Our server was attentive. We started with Chips, Salsa (three types) and Guacamole. I ordered a Margarita since it is a Tequila Bar at this restaurant. The drinks came quickly, as well as, the food. I had ordered the Carne Asada Burrito, tasty, but needed a little kick, so I asked for Jalapenos, but all they had were Serrano peppers. Boy were they smokin hot!!!! Everyone enjoyed their food, so that is a plus. 

The Tequila Goddess came by to make her pitch. We had asked for a menu of tequila shots and Specialty drinks. For a 'Tequila Goddess', she was not very knowledgeable of the different tequilas. 

I enjoyed the background salsa / merengue music. I would return for a tequila shot and a bite to eat.
