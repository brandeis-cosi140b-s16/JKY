Review is only for the nachos:

I know, it's only for one dish, but my friends and I went there after hearing they had the best nachos in Vegas.  I'm always suspicious when I hear the claim that some place has the "best" dish in town, but I swear that this claim may be true.  

Isla offers the perfect upscale nachos.  Not some bizarre fusion version of nachos, where you can't recognize the dish anymore.  Instead, Isla has chosen to offer quality from the chips to the toppings.  

And it's all about the quality fresh ingredients, the blend of cheeses and the steak.  The melted cheese sauce drizzled over the chips is a cheese blend and includes distinctive Oaxaca cheese.  The steak is high quality and not overcooked.  I'm dreaming of these nachos right now and I think there's a little drool on the keyboard. Soooooooooooooo good.
