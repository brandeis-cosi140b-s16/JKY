It was a 30 minute wait for a table, but were told we could dine at the bar.  The bartenders were really friendly.  There were signs at the video poker machines at the bar stating if you play $1 bets and put at least $20 in the machine, you'll drink for free.  Well, I put a lot more money in AND paid for my drinks.  Whatever, I wasn't going to be that person demanding free drinks.  They should take the signs down if they are going charge because I'm sure there's plenty of hillbillies that will complain.
The food was ok.  I just got a quesadilla that I won't write home or Yelp about.  Pops got a pork green chile burrito that he said was cold.  This was surprising because we got our food in like 5 minutes.  I'd figure it would be piping hot.  Can you say "already made and thrown into the microwave?"  
So I won't be back.  Too many fabulous restaurants in fabulous Las Vegas to spend my pennies here.
