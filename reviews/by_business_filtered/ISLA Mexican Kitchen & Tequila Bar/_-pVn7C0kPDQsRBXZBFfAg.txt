A very good place in Treasure Island to get traditional modernized mexican food if you're in the mood.  Went there with a group of 10 for a birthday party since they have big booths and nice ambiance. I had the chicken enchiladas and we ordered the $100 tequila drink for kicks, where a "Tequila Goddess" comes out to make a margarita right at your table.  It takes a few minutes as she squeezes lime juice and talks about the liquor that is going into the drink - which is very expensive stuff.  The food is excellent and the service is quick.  You don't have to get too dressed up, just don't come in with flipflops or a tank top.

Esquire Magazine rated it one of the America's best new restaurants for 2003.
