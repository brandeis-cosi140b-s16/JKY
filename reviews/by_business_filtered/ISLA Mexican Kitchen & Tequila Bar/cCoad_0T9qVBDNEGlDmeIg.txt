OMG!! How could I have given this place ONLY 4 stars last time. Four of us stopped in for some chips and salsa, because they are sooo good, but ended up getting dinner. 

We all got margaritas, best I've tasted. The server told us that they ordered the wrong glasses so they were bigger than usual, probably a lie but whatevs, we got them anyways. Then the chips and salsa came, mmmmh, I ordered some Habanero salsa cause you know, I like it HOT! Delicious...so after 2 baskets of chips, or maybe 3 our meals came. 

Carnitas, Tacos and Enchiladas = Party. In. My. Mouth!!! I tried all of them and I just couldn't get enough! Maybe it was my buzz or maybe this place is THAT f'n awesome. I'm getting excited just writing this review. 

Isla, can you please open one of yous in Chicago?! Pretty please.
