We decided to check out ISLA for happy hour and from there make a decision on staying for dinner . We ordered 2 margaritas and an order of guacamole.  The guacamole was fresh with a little pico and the chips were warm and delicious. The rest of our party showed up and we decided to stay for dinner, as it turned out a wise decision...  The waitress was very sweet, as my boys showed up with a couple of almost empty Fat Tuesday yard drinks, and she had no problem letting them finish them.  I had another margarita, and they brought out more chips, with 3 different salsa's.  After a couple bowls of chips my wife and I decided to split the chicken tortilla soup, and the chicken mole.  The chicken mole for me was the start of the dinner, deep rich mole sauce over nice chicken and rice with friend plantains.  There were also no complaints about the famous nachos, chile relleno.
