Thank you again Yelpers!!!

We stayed at Treasure Island over the weekend.  So, we decided to try Isla, because it had so many great reviews.  And, it definitely deserved it.  I had the Chicken Poblano Mole.  That sucker had some kick to it.  The rice was a nice short grain, cooked so it had just a bit of bite to it.  So, many restaurants overcook their Spanish rice.  

I found the prices for the drinks a little on the high side, until I tasted mine.  I always say, quality costs.  My margarita with hand muddled fruit, and my wife's mojito were top notch.  

Even the dessert was great.  We had the flourless Mexican Cake, and a scoop of Dulce De Leche Ice Cream.  The cake was a molten cake with just a hint of chile.  And the ice cream was topped with candied walnuts.
