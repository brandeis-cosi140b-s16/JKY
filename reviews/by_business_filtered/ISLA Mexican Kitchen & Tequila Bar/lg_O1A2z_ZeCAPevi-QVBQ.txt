Excellent service (until last 20 mins when we wanted our bill), great tasting food, and huge selection of tequilas just as we wanted. When we first got here a lady approached us and we thought it was a server, Nope it was a photographer, beware she will take you pic and try to sell em to you later in the evening and the problem is they were pretty good pictures. Chips and guac were good starter and an organic margarita, the server surprised us with a few shots of tequila after and it was just great from there on. We will be back.
