I was very impressed with the decor, the service and the food! My colleague and I were staying at Treasure Island for a trade show and decided on Mexican food for dinner. I'm happy ISLA was the choice. 

Warm, crunchy tortillas with three dipping sauces came out and made no need for an appetizer, although they had very tempting choices. My co-worker ordered the steak pyramid and it looked amazing on the menu. When it actually came out, my first impression was that it was smaller than I expected, but it did come with a side of rice and beans. I got a bite of the meat and ohhhhh la la, that's some tender ass meat! I don't know what they use to marinate it but damn it was yummy. 

I, on the other hand, ordered the pork sliders with fries (I am a french fry fiend!) There were 3 total and I got full after the 2nd one. The entire experience, lighting, decor, food presentation was all very impressive. It was definitely a far call from the hole-in-the-wall joints in SJ. If you're ever by Treasure Island, drop by ISLA, you won't be disappointed!
