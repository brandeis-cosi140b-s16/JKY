basically a glorified, more expensive chevy's with an interior that i am 100% positive was designed by the same people who did pf changs.  you must decide for yourself if that is a good or a bad thing. the muddled margaritas are delicious (try the blackberry top shelf!) as are the homemade corn tortillas.  one of the few places on the strip i would recommend to the vegetarian or vegan as there are a few options for us in, las not for veganus (HA)!  i mean, goddamn there are a lot of fucking steak houses in vegas.  you can enjoy your dead cow along with your coke fueled blow job at 5 am on a wednesday morning and ain't nobody looking twice.  it truly is the most ridiculous place on earth.  like trashy took a shit in the desert, welcome to las vegas.  

anyhoo...we were in a huge hurry because we had tickets to Mystere so i couldn't take everything in while i was freaking out trying to stuff myself full of (free) booze and food.  i am such a free loading heifer.
