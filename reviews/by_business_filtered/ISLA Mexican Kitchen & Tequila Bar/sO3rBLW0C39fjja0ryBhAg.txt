Ambience : Nice and relaxed but wow there were a ton of SKANKS here.

Food: We tried the Queso Fundido (just average compared to others I've had), the Chicken Quesadilla (this is actually what the rest of the world calls an epenada.. quite bizarre they took a normal dish and called it something else.. hrm), and the pork tacos (decent). I've had too much mexican food in Texas and Mexico to be impressed by this. HOWEVER major points for giving us chips for free.. screw you Diablo for charging for them. 

Drinks: This was the high point! I tried both the blackberry and pineapple maragaritas and they were both amazing.. fresh fruit, and the tastes combined with the margarita surprisingly well. My boyfriend's pineapple mojito was also excellent. 

Service: Ehh.. I've had better, I've had worse.. waiting 25 minutes for the check after asking for it really sucked.

Cost: Dinner for 2 with tax and tip and drinks  was sub $75.. can't complain.

Overall I'll be back.. but probably just for some drinks and appetizers in the bar.
