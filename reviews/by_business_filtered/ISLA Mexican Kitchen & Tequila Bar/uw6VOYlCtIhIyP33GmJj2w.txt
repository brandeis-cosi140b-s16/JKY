I love this place, it's just about the best Mexican I have had in years...but it's closing thanks to se√±or frogs. They have a contract that they can be the only Mexican restaurant in TI. I think TI is stupid to get rid of it. While it is here I recommend going and trying the amazing food it has to offer.
