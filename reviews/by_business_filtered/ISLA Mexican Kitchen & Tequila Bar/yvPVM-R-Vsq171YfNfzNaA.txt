Went here because a friend recommended me and told me it was a reasonably priced food.  It is Vegas after all so didn't want to splurge all my money away on food. Now what also made this place even better was a little thing called GROUPON that saved me even more money.  I am very picky when it comes to Mexican food, but I really enjoyed the food they served here.  Their Margaritas were strong but yet very flavorful also.  Their burritos are nice portions with a lot of flavor.  

They have a huge selection of tequilas and even though I have not gone there doing Happy hour, they have discounts on their tequilas.  

I can't wait to go back and have a few drinks and more food.
