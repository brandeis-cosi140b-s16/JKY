We took the tram over to TI from the Mirage.  We were seated right away and greeted by the Water mistress.  

The tequila goddess stopped by next but none of is were in the mood for tequila this night.

We order the Chipotle Adobo... TO DIE FOR.  I just don't think I have EVER had Guac this good.  

Everything else was good too but nothing to write home about -- its the Guac alone that will have me back at ISLA.

Their Sangria was pretty good though the first sip made me shudder (I'm sure this had everything to do with the hangover i was nursing as the rest of the glass went down fine).
