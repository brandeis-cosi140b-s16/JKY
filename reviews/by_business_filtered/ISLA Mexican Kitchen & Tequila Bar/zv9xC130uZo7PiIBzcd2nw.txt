Isla is really a big contradiction.  The room is quite nice and it's arranged well.  Then you're brought chips and salsa.  Someone decided it would be cool looking to have a metal frame that holds chips on the bottom and 3 bowls on the top for the salsas.  They are fixed--they don't move lazy Susan style.  It makes it a bit challenging to reach up into one of the small bowls to retrieve some red salsa (no heat), tomatillo salsa, or pico.  If my wife had been with me, those little bowls would have been removed and placed on the table for easier dipping.  But, it does look different.

I ordered the carnitas dish.  While another reviewer noted the saltiness of the dishes, I looked for salt and pepper on my table.  There is absolutely NONE!  I guess you have to ask for it.  There was also NO Cholula nor Tapatio on any table.  By the time I got my server to stop long enough, I was 2/3 of the way through my meal.  Is this really a Tex-Mex place?  My carnitas were OK but nothing that I can't get in any number of places around town for a lot less.  The redeeming part of the meal was dessert.  The cr√®pes were quite good and the ice cream in the sweetened tortilla bowl was very good and a great ending to a lackluster meal.

My server had too many tables to cover including those in the bar area which is semi-closed off from the restaurant section.  I don't think I'd return to Isla.  I'm glad I had a Groupon.
