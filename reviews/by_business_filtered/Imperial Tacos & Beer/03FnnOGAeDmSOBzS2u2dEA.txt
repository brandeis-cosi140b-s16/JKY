Came here after the Mr. Olympia expo for some tacos and beer and this place by far has exceeded my expectations. Tried almost every taco here along with their ceviche, bacon wrapped jalape√±os & asada fries and we couldn't get enough. After all my 28 years of eating I've never had such amazing food.
