So for months my cousin, Tracy Lee, had been posting pictures of her food from this restaurant so when I was finally in town and had the opportunity to finally grab some lunch with Tracy, she mentioned this place and I was like YES! I love me some tacos. 

First of all, the decor and feel of the restaurant is what I'd like to call "modern taco chic." Cool vibes and fun colors. If Paisley happens to be the host, give him a high five because he is so wonderful and friendly. 

Their menu and beer selection is one of a kind. I'm loving this whole trend of gourmet tacos and this place does it so right. Tracy took charge of ordering the appetizers because she knows what's up. She went with the chips and guacamole with extra pomegranate seeds...possibly my new favorite thing to put in my mouth. Next she ordered the corn salad with a side of rice, which once you get them, mix them together! The corn salad is their take on Mexican street corn which we all know to be fabulous. Next I ordered two tacos, the Al Pastor and the Baja Fish. It was SO difficult to just chose two, they all looked mouth-watering. The Baja Fish was very yummy and big! However, I wish I would have followed Tracy's suit by ordering two Al Pastor tacos because OH. MY. GOSH. Easily the BEST Al Pastor taco I've ever had the pleasure of eating. 

They have an extensive list of craft beers on draught which will pair wonderfully with any of the food on their menu. We finished off our meal with their churro dessert and I can say I've never had churros quite like theirs, filled with deliciousness and chocolate sauce for dipping. 

If you're in Vegas, please check this place out!! I really wish they had a location in Arizona for me to go to!
