Tacos & Beer is one of my favorite places to eat in Vegas. I love the Baja Fish Tacos and Shrimp Tacos! The guacamole is really good too! Try their frozen mango margaritas, they come in a regular water glass... But it is so good! The only thing that is not excellent is that I've gone there a few times late night on a Friday or Saturday and they were understaffed, so it took awhile for our server to get to us. Being open till 2am is a plus for anyone looking for a late night bite!
