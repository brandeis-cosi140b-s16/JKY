This place is beyond not good. I see all of the 5 star reviews but how many friends and relatives can you have. We went in at 7:30 on Sunday and they were out of the beer we ordered. There were a total of maybe ten people in the place. The waitress was new so it took a while to sort that out. OK no biggie, we ordered alternatives. Then we ordered three different tacos. About thirty minutes later our waitress comes to check on how our food is, the problem is we have no food. So we are into this ordeal over an hour and are making zero progress. We paid for our beers and left.
