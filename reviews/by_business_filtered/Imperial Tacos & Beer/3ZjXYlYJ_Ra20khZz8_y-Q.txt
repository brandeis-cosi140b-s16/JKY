Best. Place. Ever!!

This spot was once a hang for my girl and I when it was called another name. I wasn't sure what to expect when it became a new establishment. On a whim I took my band mates there last night for a real chill hang. It also happened to be Happy Hour (we showed up around 12:30 am) 

First, we were totally welcomed by great great staff. . Super nice, informative on beer selection and food options. Staff A+ 

I am a big fan off unique beers AND THEY'VE GOT EM! Beer A+ 

The decor in this place blew me away! Completely different and way way better than the "old place" Vibe and Decor A+

FOOD!! These tacos were grand. And I was happy to see at 1 am they would put great effort into a well made taco. Fresh, tasty and with an awesome presentation. FOOD A+

I will be back religiously. Thank you to the staff (sorry can't recall names =o) for being gracious and welcoming!

Go To Tacos & Beer!
