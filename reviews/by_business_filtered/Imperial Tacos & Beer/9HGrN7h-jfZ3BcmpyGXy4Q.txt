I was quiet disappointed with customer service...food took long to get to us there were two other tables besides us with only two persons clearly they were not busy!!!.We were a party of six 4kids two adults,it was over priced the waitresses was horrible didn't come by to fill up our drinks or chips we waited awhile before we had to ask an employee that we were out of chips.They charged there tip on the bill we complained about bad service they said  restaurant rule they need to automatically charge tip for 6or more in a party.Doesn't make sense and it was very unfair that we got poor service and had to pay for tip.Isn't it up to us to tip a person depending on their service.I was not by any means trying to get out of tipping the waitresses but she definitely did not deserve the tip she charged us.All she did was take our order bring our drinks when we first ordered them and our bill! Definitely do not recommend this place
