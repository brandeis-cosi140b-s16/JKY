First of all, we were certainly welcomed well from Miguel V. And we loved being checked on often even though we sat outside. We got chips and salsa and tacos and OH MY GOSH!!!! I wanted to order 3 tacos from the recommendations he gave me but ended up having one carne asada and one chicken and let me tell you I got super full even though I usually can eat. Very rich with guacamole, cheese, beans, pico de gallo and salsa and the tortillas were just amazing .. I honestly would have had more if I could.. I definitely recommend it and will come back on Tuesday. Tacos are only $2,50 each ..
