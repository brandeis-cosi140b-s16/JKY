Let me start off by saying I am a huge taco fan!  So when I tell you that the tacos here are some of the best tacos I've ever had, that really means something. I've been here multiple times and tried almost all the tacos so far, my favorites are the al pastor and the veggie. The al pastor is so flavorful with little chunks of pineapple on top... And you might think I'm crazy when I say the veggie taco is one of my favorites, most people like meat in their tacos, but this veggie taco is so tasty! Mashed potato in place of meat, mushrooms and what ever else veggies it has, perfect... It might just turn me vegetarian! Jk but it is very good. I'm not a beer fan at all, so I can't comment on the beers, but the cocktails I've had are the Dirty South Andy (kinda like a Moscow mule with little tweaks) and House Margarita (it has "salt air" instead of salted rim which is pretty unique and cool!). This place is pretty new still but I think once the word gets around it will be pretty popular!
