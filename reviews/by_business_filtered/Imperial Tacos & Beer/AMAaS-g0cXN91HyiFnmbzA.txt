Tried this place for a quick lunch near the Convention Center. Service was not good. The hostess ended up being our waitress too, and she was unfriendly from the moment we entered the door. The bartender looked like he was offering much better service but unfortunately we were seated in the main dining room and experienced the slow and unfriendly service instead. 

I ordered a soft drink & it literally took between 5-10 minutes. She wanted to take our order as soon as we sat down but since it was our first visit we needed a moment with the menu. It took another almost 10 minutes for her to return. It wasn't as it they were slammed or too busy, just bad service.

That being said, the food was really good & I would be willing to give it another shot sometime, maybe for happy hour.
