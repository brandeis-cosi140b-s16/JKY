places like this really make me wonder about yelp reviewers.  4 1/2 stars?  you have got to be kidding me.  these chefs know nothing about Mexican flavors.  started with guacamole (at least I thought I did.  it actually came out 5 minutes after my tacos).  the avocado wasn't quite ripe which made the texture somewhat unappealing.  it also lacked flavor.  I squirted a little lime juice in it which kinda helped.  as for the tacos, blah.  the famous crispy taco was pretty boring and the mashed potato was gag worthy.  the pork taco wasn't bad but at 4 bucks I'm gonna put it in the fail category.  finally, the barbacoa taco shared the same fate.  for a place that supposedly specializes in tacos, Imperial has a lot of work to do.  go try the lamb tacos at carson kitchen if you really want to be blown away.  and, they make their own tortillas.  almost forgot to mention the beer.  they were out of the one I wanted.  that fact, combined with the lack of front of the house service, and a mostly empty restaurant at dinner time, lead me to believe this place is in serious trouble.
