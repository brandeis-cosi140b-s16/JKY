One of my favorites from the decor to the taco options I love this place , def start my meal off with a michilada and the quacamole with pumpkin seeds and pomegranate . For me the simple tacos are my favorite , been and cheese is probably on my top list ; but def try all of them if you can , 3 tacos usually fills you up . Enjoy the place one of the best in Vegas .
