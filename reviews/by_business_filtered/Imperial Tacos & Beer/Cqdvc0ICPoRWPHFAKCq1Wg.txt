Ok so this is the second time I've been here. I couldn't remember what I didn't like from the first time. I just remembered I didn't plan on coming back. But I met a friend for lunch. He picked here. 

I love the decor! The lights are main with the Jesus candles which is pretty cool!!! And there is a mural of Cheech and Chong behind the bar! Once again awesome!!! 

Drinks- Some beer comes in tall cans so ask before you order. Passion fruit margarita so sour and tart that I couldn't finish mine. It was awful! And it's $9 for a small glass on the rocks! Originally I was going to order a cider but wasn't about to spend $14-$16 on one cider!!! 

Food- Crunchy taco the worst taco I've ever had the meat is drenched in a sauce that tastes sooo bad I didn't even finish it. Shrimp taco had too much going on. And shrimp isn't whole it's pieces. There was no shrimp flavor because of all of the sauces. Best taco was the bean and cheese. It was actually really good and I think it would have been better plain. 

Service was interesting. When I first came in. I said I was expecting someone and took a table. Ordered margarita. The nasty passion fruit one. I asked how it was and he said a little sweet. Liar!!! That thing was like drinking sour candy! And he kept coming up asking if I was ready. Seriously in 10 minutes he came up 5 times. And when my friend sat down asked if we were ready. I literally had to say give us a minute. Geez the guy hasn't even looked at the menu yet. Then he wasn't around when we were ready. Finally he came back and ordered. Two other people came up and checked on us. Then we waiter forever for the check. 

Don't waste your time!
