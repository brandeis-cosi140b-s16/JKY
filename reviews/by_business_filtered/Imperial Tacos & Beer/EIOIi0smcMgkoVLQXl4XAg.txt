I had a great experience sitting at the bar, the bartender was very nice and the ambiance is great for watching a sporting event in a low key environment. 

The items I had were: 

Corn salad- more like a corn salsa, went well with the chips

Pineapple habenaro salsa- good flavor profile but didn't care for the apple sauce like consistency 

Cilantro lime rice- cooked well but could barely make out the cilantro and lime 

Carne Asada- extremely salty 

Pork al pastor- this was my favorite of the three tacos because it had the most balanced flavors 

Fish- very juicy fish but a little salty and was not a fan of the flour tortilla

Churros- cooked to perfection, maybe a little too much cinnamon sugar but this was my favorite of the night 

Overall, this restaurant is very promising and sets itself apart from other Vegas restaurants with its friendly and competent service.
