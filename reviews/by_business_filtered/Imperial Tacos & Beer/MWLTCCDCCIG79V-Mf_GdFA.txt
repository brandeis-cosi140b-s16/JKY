Absolutely delicious! :) My friend and I got off of work and were looking for a new place to have a few drinks. I saw the Tacos and Beer sign and the appeal was instant. 

The place itself has a great ambiance. Very welcoming and bartender was friendly. The food was great. I had to order more.. I had the beef adobado and the green pork. I also had the beer batter fish. Yum!!!  Margarita was delicious! I love the salt foam with tajin. that adds a great kick to it. Nachos were not all that great though.

The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is due to the Happy Hour menu was extremely limited. There is a great selection of beer and hoped there would be more options on the HH menu. Just four taco options. I had to order off the HH menu to get a variety of tacos. Also the bartenders were friendly but the rest of the staff was not welcoming at all. Sitting near the service bar, all I heard were the servers taking bad about their tables. I thought that was a bit unprofessional. 

Regardless, I would absolutely recommend it to my friends!
