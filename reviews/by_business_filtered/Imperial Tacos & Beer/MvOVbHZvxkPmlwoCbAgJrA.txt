We stopped in here for lunch instead of Jersey Mike's. I regret it. It took 30 minutes to get five tacos. There were barely any other customers in the restaurant and we sat for that long. I ordered two bean and cheese tacos, they didn't come with half the ingredients the menu listed.

Also, be prepared to pay $6 for Tecate.

For those prices, you're better off anywhere else. The food didn't taste great, it was severely over-priced, missing key ingredients, and took much longer than necessary.

Patrons beware.
