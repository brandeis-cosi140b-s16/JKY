This is decent food and a good selection of beer and liquors. I am not a huge fan of the tacos (a little to much going on even with a simple taco, sauces, seasonings) and I don't like the nickel and dime you mentality. It is weird that they charge $2 or something for chips and salsa. Then all the tacos have prices around $2-$3. The point is to sit there with some chips and salsa, scope the menu and drink your first drink. Instead you order, order again, wait and then order again. Seems drawn out. The entire menu is this way as well, which I don't care for. If you want something it costs less than $3 most of the time but two people, two drinks, tacos and 2 appetizers was $50 pre tip, and i wasn't exactly full. I think the format works with their other restaurant (Fire Fly) serving tapas, but with tacos it feels odd with tapas tacos.
