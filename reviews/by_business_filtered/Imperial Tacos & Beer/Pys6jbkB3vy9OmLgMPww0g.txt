I was in Las Vegas and met some local girls who invited me out to dinner at this location for "Taco Tuesday". First the beer selection is beautiful and its truly a local place. They have a full bar as well and its a really great little party spot. They had a huge TV while the World Series was going on so it was a great atmosphere, almost sports-barish.
On to the food:
They had a great menu with everything Mexican with an American touch. The tacos were great and the enchiladas were among the best I've had. If you're a craft beer fan then this is a must stop for a calm location away from the strip.
