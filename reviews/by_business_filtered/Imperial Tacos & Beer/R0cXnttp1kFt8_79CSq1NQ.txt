Wow. I'm blown away. Super cool environment. And crazy in love with the veggie tacos. A new variation and take on it. No more just rice and beans only.:)
Hand made tortillas and to top it all of the best guacamole I ever had. Delicious!!! I recommend it to everyone. New favorite Mexican restaurant in Vegas. And it's close to the strip.
