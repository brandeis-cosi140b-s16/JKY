This place is great and in the regular rotation when you want a great value, delicious tacos and a sweet beer selection. Cool build out in the former Firefly Restaurant location on Paradise. Nice casual place to watch a big game and good for groups. They've always got the Sculpin Grapefruit IPA on tap which as far as I'm concerned, is the best beer out there. Puerco verde tacos are my fav, same with grilled fish but I haven't had a bad one yet and I think I've tried them all!
