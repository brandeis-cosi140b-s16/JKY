Best taco place & Best Mexican food in Las Vegas ! I have a fav taco spot in la . This is my Vegas go to! 

This place was amazing from start to finish ! 
Got there around 10:50 pm
The happy hour started at 11pm where they have Mexican beers and margaritas on special for 3& 4 dollars.
The shots of patron we got were like 10$ each but big shots worth it with a diet coke back . (Also they refilled my diet coke through out the night it was on the bill
After but they took it off cause I told them it was my backer for my shot) it was a big glass. 
Customer service was great! Waiters are pleasant and attractive. 
The tacos are amazing! all reasonably priced and sized like 3/4$ each . They are speciality tacos and very good not like generic ground beef or something. Each is unique and flavorful 

The spicy shrimp (big shrimps ) n steak taco were my favorite! I will definitely be going back for those. They were spicy and had different amazingly yummy hot sauces to choose from
On each table . I also got mahi mahi taco and cevich√© was an amazing appetizer with loads of chilled mahi mahi .
Tip : come during happy hour and your tacos are only
2/3$ and happy hour is 3-6pm
Or 11-2am
The ambience was great! There was live DJ spinning great music, I didn't want to leave.! And it makes it for a good place to have some drinks of course. 

Crowd was classy and attractive. And it is a mexicAn resturant , so there was also a Mexican soccer team
There. It was cool :)

It was pretty dark with green neon lightening . Which I loved added to the night life ambience. 

In summary an amazing Resturant and I will be back! Hope they have a DJ again! It was a Tuesday night when I visited!
