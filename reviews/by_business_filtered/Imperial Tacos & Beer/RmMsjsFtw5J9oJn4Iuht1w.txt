I'm a firm believer that the best tacos come from trucks park outside of bars at 3am or in front of tire stores/mechanics/job sites or in little taquerias  tucked into strip malls. So when i heard that this hip little place that used to be Firefly was slinging some seriously good grub, i had to check it out. I was NOT disappointed! This place is fantastic. I've only ever sat at the bar, and only ever ate the tacos, but i've heard everything on the menu is dynamite, but my main obsession is the al pastor and the puerco verde (topped with chicharron), but the fish tacos or to die for, and the chicken tinga is simple and delicious.  I highly recommend this groovy little spot, especially for happy hour!
