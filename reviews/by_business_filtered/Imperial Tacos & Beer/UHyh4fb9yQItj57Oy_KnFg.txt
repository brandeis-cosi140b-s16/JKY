Don't waste your time.  Food is just ok and the service may be the worst in the city!  A friend and I went for an early dinner, around 6 pm.  The place was hardly half full.  We waited for quite some time before we were even greeted.  Then the greeting consisted of, "do you want to start with margaritas?" When we declined the drinks, the server left and a different server came back 10 mins later to take our food order.   We started with chips and guac which were mediocre, a little bland.  So we thought we add some spice.  We asked for hot sauce and continued asking for it, 3 times to be exact, didn't get it till our tacos came out.  I don't know if maybe they were having an off day but will definitely not be back to waste my money.     I am a very understand customer especially being that I work in that industry but man, it was honestly that bad!
