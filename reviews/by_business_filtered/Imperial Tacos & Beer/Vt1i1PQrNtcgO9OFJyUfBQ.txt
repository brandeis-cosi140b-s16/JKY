First time here! Had a few modelo Negras and a couple of micheladas which were good. We also ordered some tacos. I ordered the 8.95 mini taco special so I could try a few different meats. I ordered chicken tinga.. Carne asada and bbq beef. They were tasty I was just surprised how small they ended up being! My love
Ordered 3 tacos.. Shrimp .. Al pastor .. And chorizo. Overall it was good and I would come come again!
