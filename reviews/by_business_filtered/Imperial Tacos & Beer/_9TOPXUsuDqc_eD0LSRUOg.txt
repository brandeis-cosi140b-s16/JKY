I give it 4 stars because of the food ! The food was AMAZING !!!!!!!!!!!! Of course today is Cinco de Mayo and the restaurant was pretty full but it's a tiny restaurant so I didn't really see a reason to be neglected... our service was completely horrible.. I don't know if she was new or what but she was a beautiful brunette young lady maybe she was just overwhelmed... But we asked a server if she was news she told us no, so I guess there's really no excuses for the service that we got ... I'm not sure but she took FOREVER to give my husband a refill , To take our order, and even just to check on us .. The managers never came over to check on us to see how everything was either .. I mean if you are THAT BUSY you should at least see how everyone is doing .. But I'll go back again it's just I think I want a different server or maybe a different day would work .. The food was just AWESOME .. I had the shrimp taco and beef tongue taco ! Awesome sauce . With a mango Margarita!! I think that they just need a bit more training on how to handle under pressure ..
