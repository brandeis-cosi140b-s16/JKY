Stopped by for a weekday lunch with my wife. They managed to make the the formerly Firefly space seem way less pretentious and more welcoming, which is great. I started with a Tahoe Mountain wild pale ale that had a fragrance of grapefruit and a pleasantly hoppy finish. My wife had a Gose which she found too sweet, but I found very tasty. Salsa offerings with the chips and salsa were very fresh tasting. The Queso Modelo on the other hand was bland with a very un appealing texture, in our opinion. On the plus side though, it was a huge serving for an app. 

Entrees were the taco sample with a few more tacos on the side. The stand out had to be the Adobada. So flavorful. Carnitas and Puerco Verde were also very good. I thought the Lengua was somewhat flavorless; all the punch on that taco came from the delicious pickled radishes and salsa on top. 

On the side we tried the Charro beans. They were so good they made me wanna slap my momma! Definitely a must try. 

Service was speedy and attentive. The food came just about as fast as it takes to make a fresh tortilla and make a taco. We will definitely be coming back especially for the happy hour specials.
