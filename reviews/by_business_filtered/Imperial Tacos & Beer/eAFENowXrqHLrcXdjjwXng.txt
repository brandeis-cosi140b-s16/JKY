Where do I start?!? 
Service and food.. Wonderful!!!

First we ordered the ceviche, and the corn salad... Ceviche tasted fresh and full of flavor.. The corn was also so good and full of flavor. If you like corn I definitely recommend this. 

Next we ordered practically every taco on the menu and they were ALL amazing, fresh homemade tortillas as well.. My personal favorites were the fish taco and the baja fish taco. They were both so packed with flavor I couldn't decide which I liked better! By far some of the best fish tacos in Vegas, I'm also a huge fan of fish tacos... 
The carne asada, chorizo, chicken tinga were also yummy... 

We got churros for dessert and those were also to die for. 

Overall everything was amazing and we will definitely be back!!!
