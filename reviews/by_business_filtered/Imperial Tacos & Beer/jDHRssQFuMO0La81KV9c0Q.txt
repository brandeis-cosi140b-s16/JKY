The name hits it home--yet there's alot to this place.

First off, the rotating beer selection is has a great variety. Their menu also features signature cocktails, all that I've tried have been excellent. The bartenders will help guide you to a selection if you need it!

The guac is awesome, slightly chunky just how I like it.

As for the tacos--top notch. Handmade tortillas really set them apart from other establishments. I've had 8 of them so far on the menu, each of them just as tasty as the last. I'm not picky, but if you are, I'm sure you could find something.

By the way, they make 4 different hot sauces and the bartender/server will arrange them from hottest to mildest.
