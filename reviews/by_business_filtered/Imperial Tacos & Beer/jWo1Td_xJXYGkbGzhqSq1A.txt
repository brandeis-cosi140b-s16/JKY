Ok so finally gave them a second chance. Wife and I went in late Sunday afternoon and sat at the bar. Almost empty, one guy at the bar and a couple of couples at tables. Football was on a couple of televisions and futbol was on one. The bartender Natalie was a true delight. We both had tacos, me the fish. Surprised at how reasonably priced the food was. The draft beers which I guess rotate often are listed on a giant blackboard by the bar with a description.  We tried a couple of different ones and enjoyed them. My wife order something in a can that I realized later cost ten dollars and since the staff had all of their clothes on that seemed a bit pricey or I could see this being a five. Thanks for the improvements and we will be back.
