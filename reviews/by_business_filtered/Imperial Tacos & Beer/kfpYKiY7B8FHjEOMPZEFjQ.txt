i am so glad i tried this place, i was there last saturday and i came back today, the have my favorite beers dogfish 120, cantillon sour , i tried an italian IPA that they recommended it was delicious they have that on draft. 
service was great, very friendly staff and everyone very attentive i sat at the bar and jesus was the bartender cool guy very knowledgeable.
the place is super cool. the decoration is unique, best tacos in las vegas, im from mexico and i know about tacos, these are different but good, they use traditional mexican ingredients, but the decoration is fancy...... i tried all the deserts and my favorite was the flan......
