Unimpressive to say the least. My wife and I came here for a late lunch and found everything underwhelming. The service was slow, chips and salsa was generic store bought stuff, the ceviche was all lime and came with stale tostadas. And to top it off the tacos were bland and kind of cold. The only positives were the busser who was on top of his tasks and a solid beer selection. Would not recommend and will not be back.
