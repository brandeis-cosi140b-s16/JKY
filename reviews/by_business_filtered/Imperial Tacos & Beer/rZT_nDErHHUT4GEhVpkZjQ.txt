On a recent trip to Vegas, we bought a Groupon for 6 tacos and 2 sides. There were two of us and this was the perfect amount of food. They bring salsa and refried beans to the table as starters (free). I thought the beans were a nice touch. Both were delicious! We each ordered 3 tacos and both chose different ones.  There wasn't a single complaint! The tacos were so tasty and I personally enjoyed every one that I had. We felt like we got such a great deal with the Groupon. We sat outside so can't comment on the decor but outside was nice even though you look out towards a parking lot and the restaurant is along a road. We still couldn't complain given the location...it was a wonderful find since we're out-of-towners!
