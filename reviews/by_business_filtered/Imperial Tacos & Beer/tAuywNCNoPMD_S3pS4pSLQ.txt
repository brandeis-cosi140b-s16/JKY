Delicious and tasty tacos!! I'm already debating what to get the next time I go back. Shrimp tacos were my absolute favorite! I got the pablano taco (8 out of 10) the Baja fish taco, (6 out of 10) and the shrimp taco which was a 10/10! Maybe even more. The chips and salsa were just ok, but the green salsa was the bomb!
We also got the  bacon wrapped jalape√±os.... Yes, I'm coming back and bringing my appetite. See you there!
