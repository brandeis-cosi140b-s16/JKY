Do NOT waste your money here.  I don't understand how people can like this food.  I wouldn't eat here for free.  I also went with a cook who is from Mexico who got "the runs" from their tacos.  They boil their meats....... I tried every taco on the happy hour menu and the margherita........ The deink tasted like soap and the tacos were absolutely horrible.
