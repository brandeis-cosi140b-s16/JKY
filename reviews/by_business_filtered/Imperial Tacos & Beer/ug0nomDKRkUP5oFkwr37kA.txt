This place is pretty cool! Came here tonight to meet some friends for Taco Tuesday around 11pm. Apparently my friends had invited a bunch more friends too because we ended up having a big table for probably 12-15 people. Now I have to say that when approaching this place I wasn't really feeling the vibe, it's pretty much a bunch of people hanging out in a parking lot on the outside, but inside was much more inviting and more my scene. Our table was right when you walk in, the air conditioner was blasting so I was freezing initially, but luckily I brought a jacket or else that may have made me miserable. The music was loud like other reviewers have mentioned, it could definitely have been a bit lower so we could talk to each other without yelling, but the music they were playing was good, I liked it. Chips and salsa were good, my margarita was pretty standard, my boyfriend's Jalapeno Margarita was delicious! I got 2 of the Chicken Tinga tacos and they were awesome!! I really loved them, the best part was the texture of the tortilla, it was perfect. I could have easily eaten another taco or 2 but we had to take off, and I was comfortably full with all the chips and salsa. Service was decent, and our bill for the 2 of us where we had 2 happy hour margaritas and 6 tacos total was $33- a good deal! I'll definitely check this place out again for Taco Tuesday, but only if I can sit inside :)
