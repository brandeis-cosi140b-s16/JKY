Went for the first time last night.  A friend of mine was DJ'ing there. The atmosphere was very casual and cool. Deco was definitely a convo topic at out table. All good remarks. Waitress came by and we weren't ready to order so she huffed off. 20 minutes later she showed back up with even more attitude and was really bothered when a friend asked about the desserts  (which aren't on the menu). I ordered a soup and when she came back with the soup and my soda her response was "I lost your straw" and never came back with a new one. I had to track the waitress down just to pay my $10.00 bill (soup and soda). I could totally understand if she was busy with tables since she was the only waitress BUT she had like 3 other tables besides us. I will give this place another try. Hopefully the wait staff gets better.
