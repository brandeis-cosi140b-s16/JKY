Seriously, delicious food!
But service needs to be improved. Had a cold taco on the plate (it came out cold), so ordered a bowl of rice and beans to replace it bc lost appetite for the taco...25 min wait without getting checked and the group had finished their food. Had to flag down the server and asked for them not to put the rice and beans on the bill and to not bring them out bc we had waited too long and we were ready to leave. Instead of an apology, I received an eye roll. And they weren't even busy!!
