WOW! I hesitantly tried Isabel's Amor Mexican Restaurant, located in the same plaza as Blue32 in Gilbert, because I was afraid of being disappointed. What an awesome surprise! For appetizer, we had Baja Shrimp Coctel (Ceviche) and it was delicious. Have not had it better anywhere else. For entree, I had Carnitas, thinking it would ok, but it blew me away! Unbelievable flavor! My husband had the Pescado De La Parrilla (Mahi Mahi) and it was fabulous! Service was wonderful, the manager came to our table to see how everything was and there is a Musician on Thursdays and every other Saturday. I have eaten at many Mexican restaurants in Arizona and this place will now be my Go-To Place! It is a more casual, upscale Mexican Restaurant with reasonable pricing that must be tasted!
