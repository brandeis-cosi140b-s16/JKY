What can I say, happy hour from 11 to 7, and great food, staff is amazing the place is clean and I've been here multiple times and have always had amazing service from the while staff, if you haven't tried it's a must, anthony the bartender gets me in and out in 20 min, when you are short on time and need amazing food but still can make it back to work in time, this is the place. Live music as well. This is my go to place
