A rare 5 star rating from me. Like my profile says good product will get you 4 great service will get you 5.  Isabel's Amor has become one of my favorite spots to grab lunch. 

The food has come out fresh and well prepared every time, unlike some of the surrounding fast food Mexican joints in the area. 

The decor is clean, with a slight vintage industrial vibe to it. When the weather is nice, they open up one of the walls to the patio (I'm sitting here enjoying the smell of rain right now).

The service is great. Seems that Anthony takes care of me every time.  He's friendly, fast, and my drink never reaches empty.  The staff also recognizes me when i walk in, a BIG customer service WIN in my book.

The lunch special is very reasonable, and the enchilada style chile rojo chicken burrito is def one of my favs. I get it with a side of sour cream and the borracho beans (pinto beans cooked with chorizo and chilies).  The enchilada sauce has just enough of a spicy and salty bite to make interesting when paired with the sour cream.  The beans have a taste that's very similar a traditional chili. It's definitely enough to fill me up...

If you're looking for spot for a casual or even business lunch while in this area, i would highly recommend stopping here.  It also wouldn't be a bad choice as a date night spot either.

Happy Yelping folks, and I hope you enjoy your meal!
