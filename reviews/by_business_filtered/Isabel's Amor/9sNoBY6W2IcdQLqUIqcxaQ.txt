I hesitate to even write a glowing review about this place because I am scared that the word will get out.   Scared that I will never be able to go back because it will be so packed.  At any rate, these folks are tied to the Someburros franchise in some way.  I can taste it in the chips and salsa which are delicious!  My wife and I went for opening day of restaurant week and got 2 apps, 2 main dishes, 2 margaritas and a dessert for $44.  I had the carne asada...it was unstoppable.  The serve it with beans and rice and a flour tortilla that is homemade without a doubt.  The flavor in the carne asada was amazing.  Was like nothing I've ever had before.  Real good flavor.  The street corn was bomb.  Highly recommend!  And the jicama and watermelon salad was also really good and refreshing. Arhat it's were very good also.  Check this place out!!!  It's definitely worth it!
