This placed is great my husband and I went last night for our first time. Love the atmosphere and employees are on top of everything.  Food came out pretty quick. 

We started with the jicama and watermelon appetizer which I loved. The flavors were great only thing is its $6 for a small amount of fruit/appetizer even though most appetizers are small for $6 bucks its over priced but its worth trying.

I got a chicken & beef enchiladas- chicken was ok, beef was amazing their tortillas are delicious im not sure if there homemade but they sure taste like it. Out of the 3 choices of beans I was satisfied with my choice I tried my husband and his were grest as well. Rice as not good its like every mexican restaurant its flavor less and on the plate to take up room.

My husband got the carne asada - He enjoyed it but we thought for $16 he'd be full or at least get more meat out of it. I buy 1 pound for $6 at the store and thats a deal :) 

Overall... less rice and beans more entr√©e
Definitely a must try!
We'll be going back most definitely! !
