Eh. That's really it... The chips were strips of chips and they were too thin so it was kinda like eating crumbs because they kept breaking. The salsa was eh. My husband ordered a carne asada plate and about 1/8th of the plate was meat, the rest was beans and rice. The meat was dry. For paying an extra few bucks to get some meat on my salad, I should have received something that looked like meat? Instead there were crumbs of ground what-can-only-asssumed-to-be-meat interspersed through my bowl of lettuce (because the presence of other salad-like ingredients was sorely lacking.) I guess that's my mistake for ordering a salad at a Mexican joint.

The server was pretty awesome though,  she was really on top of it. The ambiance of the restaurant is very cozy and quaint,  it looks like one of the walls opens up to the patio which might be cool when it's not 120Â° outside. 

The prices didn't match the food quality.  Maybe it was a bad day or a growing pain? Eh. Maybe we'll come back. Maybe.
