Very quaint new little place with good ambiance.  Quiet decor and a nice bar seating area. Our waiter was very friendly and prompt.  We started with a unique flavored margarita, Blackberry Sage.  It was delicious!  Their house frozen margarita was delicious as well, included organic agave. Both were served in mason jars.  

All our food was nicely prepared and rice had a nice flavor.  The only complaint was that the carnitas were pretty dry.  We explained that to the manager and she welcomed the feedback.  

Onto the desserts which were REALLY creative and tasty.  I would recommend the Margarita Lime Cheesecake served in a baby mason jar. If you order to go, they send you home with the cute labeled dessert jars.

Hopefully they can make a few tweaks to the food and this place has a lot of potential! Love the location !  We will def be back.
