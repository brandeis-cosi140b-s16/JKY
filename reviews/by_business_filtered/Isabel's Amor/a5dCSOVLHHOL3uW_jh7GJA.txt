Tried this place last night. When the hostess seated us, the two chairs were full of crumbs. My wife began brushing them off while the hostess just watched her. She said nothing and did nothing. 

The food and drinks were solid. I had fajitas and my wife had the chili relleno. She did not care for the batter on the relleno as it was soggy, not crisp. But other than that everything was good.
