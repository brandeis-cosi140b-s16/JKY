First time for dinner last Saturday night. Not crowded with lots of staff. I had one of their combo dinners. Enchilada with beans and rice. It was good, price a little high compared to other Mexican restaurants in the area. Limited draft beer choices. The decor was nice and the staff was friendly. I'll try it again. I was struck by the number of employees vs customers. Good location, nice outdoor seating.
