Very very dissapointed. We had fajitas and a chili relleno. Both had no spices or flavor. Very blah. I don't even know what to say about it since it was so boring. Inside was nice and the server was very friendly and fast. The salsa is ok but nothing great either. The patio looks great for this wonderful weather but two items that should have had lots of flavor and are pretty easy to gget right just did not hit the spot.
