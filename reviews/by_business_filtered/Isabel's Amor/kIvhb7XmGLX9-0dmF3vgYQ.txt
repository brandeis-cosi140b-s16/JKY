My fiancé and I stopped in for a quick dinner on a Tuesday night... The place was pretty empty. We sat at the bar, since it was the only place you get happy hour, service was attentive and quick. Since the appetizers were discounted for HH, we got 2. The corn and the "pico de avocado" were both fine, but pretty small portions. The menu is pretty simple and the decor is nice. We were both really disappointed in our food.... First I was sent out the wrong item. I ordered the chile rojo chicken dish, what I got was the relleno. I def snuck a bite, before sending it back. When I got my dish i was disappointed in the presentation, the chicken looked slopped on the plate, like cafeteria food. I thought the over all flavor was really boring and certainly not worth the $14 price tag. I just ate my tortilla and gave up. My fiancé's dish literally looked like dog food. He said it tasted similar. I did not try it. We both thought the rice and borracho beans we not worth eating. The salsa they brought us at the brining was watery... More like taco sauce. 

On a good note... The tortillas and margaritas were good! Doubtful that we would ever return.
