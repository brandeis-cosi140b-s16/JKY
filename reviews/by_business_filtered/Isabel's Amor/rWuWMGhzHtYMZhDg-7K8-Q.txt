Excellent food just like their sister restaurant Someburro's. I was expecting table cloths and waiters...there were waiters, but it was definitely casual.  The service was great, we were there at Lunch on a Sunday, and were pleasantly surprised to find happy hour and a lunch menu in effect.  Margaritas were tasty and on special discount for Margarita Day.  All in all very pleasant experience. 

The only complaint I had was that the chips (complimentary and passable-but Someburro's has better) come in a little basket with a paper liner. The basket was stained with old, caked-on salsa. Everywhere...sides, top, bottom.  They looked dirty and I am not sure they could be cleaned.

Someburro's is much closer to me and much cheaper for dinner, so I would opt for that normally and especially at dinner.
