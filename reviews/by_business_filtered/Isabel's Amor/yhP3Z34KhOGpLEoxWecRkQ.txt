Good food. Few choices. This restaurant seems more like a Tex-mex type of restaurant. No burritos or chimis which is disappointing. Their bean dip is one of the best I've ever had. The enchiladas were delicious. The restaurant is really tiny and only has a few seats. It was more of a one time place for me. Nothing really stood out as being amazing that would make me want to ever come back.
