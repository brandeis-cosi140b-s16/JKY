Sushirritos have long been a trend in California, and like everything in Vegas, we get it years later. At least we get it from the people behind Soho, the best sushi place in town. 

We got the Redondo and the Rockport to share, both sans red onion (he's picky). The mistake was ordering it just on soy paper, like I always have in California. These weren't really "Mexican fusion," they were really just large sushi rolls beside the fried tortilla strips and cilantro. Which was good But they needed a tortilla to really feel like a sushirrito. (Plus, just being wrapped in the soy paper made them a little drippy on the ends, which wouldn't have been a problem on a tortilla.)

The rolls themselves were really great, but I have to give the edge to the Rockport--the soft shell crab was great. It also was more substantial than the Redondo, though the flavors of each were great. But again: these are big sushi rolls with primarily sushi flavors, not burrito flavors. Fair prices ($10.95 each) considering all the seafood in them both. 

As a side we ordered taro chips and mochi. Mochi was mochi--nothing else to say there. The taro chips were great, perfectly cooked and not oily, with some kind of sugary seasoning on them. What was weird was the nacho queso sauce that came with them. It was good...but it mixed kind of weirdly with the seasoning. 

I'll probably be back sometime soon, and I'll definitely try a different roll, on a tortilla this time. They've only been open two weeks but the line was out the door the whole time we were there, so it's safe to expect this place will be open for awhile. (Or until the trend loses steam.)
