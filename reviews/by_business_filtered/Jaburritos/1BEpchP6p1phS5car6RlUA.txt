I would have posted a photo if I had remembered prior to the brutal slaughter that occurred on my first ever Waikiki Rice Bowl from Jaburritos.

I live fairly close and, with the construction going on towards Sahara and Decatur, I opted to try it out. I was not disappointed AT ALL! The service was friendly and fast (a rarity in these times of lethargy, computers, and cell phones), the food was hot and very well prepared, and the portion sizes were quite large for the amount charged. I like places where I can get a good bang for my buck and this place is now at the top of that list.

It's kind of like a Subway (but 100x better and without the stigma of pedophilia). They have a pre-constructed menu that you can choose from and have your choice served either as a jaburrito, rice bowl, jachos, or salad (I think...I'm not a salad person). Also, if you like, you have the option to build your own. The sky is the limit!

I am very VERY pleased and I will try my best to add a photo at a later date. However, until then (which may be tomorrow), I can only give you the following vivid description:

Deliciously sticky/fluffy white sushi rice topped with a heaping portion of grilled chicken and slathered in queso de gallo and mango teriyaki sauce accompanied with savory sweet roasted corn, fresh red onion, crispy tortilla strips, juicy jalape√±os, fresh cilantro, and shredded romaine lettuce. #YUM!!!!!!
