Went on Saturday 10-17-15 around 4:30 PM with my new yelp friend Jamie P.  This restaurant is located in a small shopping center on Sahara just west of the 15.  David's Bridal, McDonalds, and Landry's are in the same area.  

The line is set up kinda like Subway...you pick whether you want nachos, a burrito, a bowl, or a salad, and then you can choose between their signature burritos or build your own.  I got the redondo which is Ahi Tuna, Salmon, Yellowtail, Cucumber, Tobiko, Guacamole, Red Onion, Tortilla Strips, Jalapeno, Cream Cheese, Lettuce, Avocado, Cilantro, Wasabi Mayo, with Soy Paper ($11.84 after tax).

They have an awesome machine that rolls the rice onto the nori/soy paper.  A sushi machine! Never seen one before.  Fancy-schmancy.  

Honestly, I don't even know how to review this place because...well...I don't like sushi.  THERE.  I SAID IT.  I've tried, really.   I want to like it so bad because it's to beautiful and hip!     

Like Manami S. noted, the assembly line was chaotic, with the guys reaching over each other and reading the recipes off a piece of paper.  The same guy asked me twice about somebody else's burrito, then the cashier tried to charge me for the person behind me.  My burrito was missing the cream cheese and the onion.  Mildly irritating but understandable in their first few weeks of opening. 

The place was crowded and there's only seating for maybe 20 people so we took our burritos over to McDonalds and ate them.  I got about five bites in before I gave up and gave my other half to my new friend.  If I ever go back, I'll stick to the white girl options like the waikiki (chicken) or the boardwalk(steak).
