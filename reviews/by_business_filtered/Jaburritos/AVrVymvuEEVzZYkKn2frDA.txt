We were really excited to try this place and it didn't disappoint! We came in and the guy asked if we've ever been there and we said no so he explained to us how the whole thing works. Basically, it's like chipotle/subway where you can create your own or choose one made up from their menu. I got the rockport without tobiko and subbed cream cheese instead and my husband made his own. They make it right in front of you and they're really friendly and patient. There wasn't too much rice on the rolls and they were pretty hefty with the portions of the proteins and toppings. We got the combo with our meals, we got the seaweed salad and the taro chips and dip. The rolls were really good! My husband said he couldn't taste the sauces too much so we'll have to ask for extra next time. The sauce for the dip was also in a very tiny cup so it was kinda hard to get the chip in there lol. We got too full so we didn't have any room for mochis. Each of our burritos had like 3 types of proteins in there so they were a good size. The place itself is nice, I love how bright it is in there. They're also trying to be eco friendly so that's cool. I'm glad this place is right by my house so I can get my sushi fix whenever I get a craving :D
