I'm a pretty straightforward guy. I like sushi, I like burritos. And I love sushi burritos. When all of that is factored, everyone knew that I'd be a fan when Vegas finally joined on the sushi burrito train. This place is good, really really good. Which is why it's a 4.5 star from me. The location is nice, across the street from palace station, it's very minimalist and clean. I've gone here so much the staff even remember me and my order. My top two favorites by far are the long beach and the Baja. If you want to go off menu, that's totally fine because it's a create your own burrito type deal , so throw on your crown and have it your way boss. One thing that sets them apart from another sushi burrito place is that they are definitely more dedicated to fusion. They have more traditional burrito items so it doesn't always just feel like sushi to go. The lines can get long, but I can't penalize a business for being too popular. They definitely could improve the ordering system. It seems to get slow at times, and I'm not sure if that's just a product of new people or what, but maybe call ahead ordering would be legit. Burritos are legit and worth the price
