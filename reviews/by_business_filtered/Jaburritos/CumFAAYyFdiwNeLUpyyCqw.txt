this place is YUMMY! definitely satisfied my sushi craving without the overstuffed feeling of AYCE sushi. the staff here is very sweet and helpful. he gave us some suggestions on what the most popular ones are, and we ordered the long beach and the rockport. both were awesome! lots of flavor but not overwhelming. I'll definitely be back, way to go jaburrito!
