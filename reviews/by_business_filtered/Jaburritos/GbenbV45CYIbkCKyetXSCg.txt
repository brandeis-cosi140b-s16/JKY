I have tried this twice within the past week. I am an avid lover of Soho and when I found out a sushi burrito place was opened by the same owner I flipped out. Both times that I have been here the line has been long, but it is definitely worth the wait. I have tried the Huntington and the Mission. I have enjoyed both because I absolutely love ahi tuna and salmon. I was spectacle of the jalape√±os on the burrito but they work well! I also love the poke sauce. I will definitely come back soon, if I could eat here everyday I would.
