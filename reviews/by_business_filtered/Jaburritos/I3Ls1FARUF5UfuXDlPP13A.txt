7/10. I've always been a fan of the concept. The Chef definitely knew the demand and created the trend in Las Vegas. The experience was pleasant and staff was friendly. Food wise, I expected a bit higher in the quality side but presentation was above mediocre. The taste could need a little more punch in all five senses. So far I've tried The "Long Beach," Redondo" and Mission. Oh! I almost forgot the taro chips! They were crispy and not greasy also seasoned with a sweet and salty flavor but you have to scoop it off your plate or sprinkle the seasoning onto your taro chips for the reason that it didn't stick well onto the chips at all. I'll also skip the cheese sauce with the taro chips. Not really my thing... Overall I still recommend for everyone to try! #iam3am airuzz@instagram
