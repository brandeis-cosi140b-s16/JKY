Finally sushi burritos in Las Vegas!  This is similar to eating a giant hand roll, but because they are so big they are able to a greater variety of ingredients and sauces.  I was impressed by the size of the burrito - it was big and probably about a 1/2 pound.  The soy paper wrap is thin with a faint flavor of sesame.  They also were not heavy on rice, they just had a thin layer or rice on the outside and the rest was packed with fresh fish and other yumminess.  

Their assembly line is very fast so this might be your new perfect spot to grab a quick lunch.
