Ah, I was so looking forward to this place and it did meat all of my expectations. My husband and I were able to get 2 burritos, a drink, and mochi ice cream for about $25. This was not a bad deal.

The place was small, but the crowd was big. We saw at least 20 people come and go during the 30 minutes we were there. Ordering the food felt a lot like Chipotle in a slightly more disorganized fashion. 

Because of how busy it was, it felt difficult to truly customize your order without holding up the line. It was my fault, because I should have taken initiative, but I do think it would have been nice to be asked.  I got the Baja burrito, it was great, but I personally needed more sauce. My husband got the Redando and he felt the same way. Anyways, next time we will speak up.

I will be back to try the nacho sushi experience, the bowl, and the other suggestions. I hope this place does well and opens up a place in southeast Vegas.
