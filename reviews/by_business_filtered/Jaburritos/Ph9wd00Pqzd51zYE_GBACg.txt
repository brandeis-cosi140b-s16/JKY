It's an American sized sushi roll.

Jaburritos isn't a new idea; it's just new to Vegas. There are a few locations on the Western side of the U.S. that serve this style of enormous sushi roll. Yes, this is sushi and not a burrito, but "Jaburritos" sounds better than, "Large Sized Sushi Roll Eatery", moving on... 

The ordering style is the "create your own" model, but they also have pre-made options to choose from for the creatively drained. This was me when I walked in, and after a brief explanation of the menu I ended up going with the Long Beach Roll; spicy tuna, shrimp tempura, surimi crab, romaine, cucumber, tortilla strips, guacamole, chipotle mayo, Anguilla sauce and a side order of Taro chips and nacho cheese. 

This crazy ass meal was actually very good and very filling. All the ingredients were extremely fresh, fried additions weren't overly fried, the veggies were crunchy and weirdly enough the house made salsas fit-in perfectly with the other flavors. I did have a problem with the nacho cheese on my Taro chips; it definitely came from a can. 

Jaburritos can be a bit pricey depending what you order, but no more than any other decent lunch place in Vegas. I would definitely come back and see what else I can jamburrito into my face.
