This place is going to be the next Robertos of sushi! I've seen this concept done in SF and LA but they have a unique twist by incorporating a few subtle Mexican flavors.  Most of the other places have been pretty much just Japanese flavors.  I'm always a fan of fresh ingredients that I can pick up on the go.  Definitely healthier options than your normal fast food or burrito options.  Pretty much all the basic sushi roll ingredients you can think of(salmon, tuna, shrimp tempura, egg, crab salad)...I would like to see them put eel into the mix as well in the future. And for the non seafood eaters, they have chicken and steak. I like that they have tons of fresh veggies you can add and seaweed salad.  The tortilla chip option also gives it a nice crunch to the rolls.  They also have chips, I wish they had a wonton chip nachos with a mix of fishes/crab, eel sauce, etc.  Lol....if the owner is reading this...I've been dreaming of a place that would serve nachos like the ones at Samurai Burrito in Fountain Valley, CA ;). They were quite the money maker there...I have no doubt it would be similar in Vegas.  They have a plethora of interesting unique sauces to pair with all the rolls.  They also have a thicker house made soy perfect for topping the burritos, as well as the normal pico de gallo, salsas, wasabi and ginger. Quick service, large burritos, reasonable prices!  This is truly fast food sushi heaven.
