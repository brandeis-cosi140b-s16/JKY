It's about damn time we get a sushi burrito restaurant in Las Vegas. I've been waiting for a long time since trying jogasaki at foodie fest 2 years ago and my dreams have come true. In a nut shell it's really just an uncut sushi roll but eating it burrito style is awesome.

Setting: Right off W. Sahara after rancho. It's in the mcdonald's parking lot. Pretty big parking lot so you should be able to find a spot. 

Interior: Bright but really not a lot of places to sit especially with how popular it is, so have someone claim a spot and get their order while you're in line if you wanna be those people lol.

Food: It's everything you'd want in a sushi burrito (minus unagi). The redondo was the burrito I selected which really is the best bang for your buck. Tuna, yellowtail, and salmon (I highly recommend adding shrimp tempura) This is sushi heaven rolled almost perfectly (it is pretty huge). Comparing this to jogasaki it is about $5 cheaper, and a lot bigger. Foodie fest won't be the same with Jaburrito around.

Service: Friendly but they're more focused on churning through the customers, especially when it's busy it was like waiting for sushi burritos at foodie fest. 

Drinks: They have water cups but they're the kind you get from the dentist's office, so don't let your water sit in that cup for too long. I opted for their apple soda which had an unusual aftertaste, so I'd go for the melon soda instead.

Overall: 30 minutes away from my house and yet it's quite worth the drive. Jaburritos has staked it's claim as Las Vegas's first official sushi burrito restaurant and it's here to stay.
