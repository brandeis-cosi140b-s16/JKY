Sushi!? Burritos?! Whaaaat?!
I was super excited to find out that Vegas finally has a place with the concept of sushi burritos so I definitely had to check it out. I love seafood, so it took me a while to decide on one of their choices, but I finally settled on the Rockport ($11.25) mainly because of the soft shell crab along with some sweet anguila sauce and wasabi mayo on the side. You also have a choice of getting it wrapped in nori dried seaweed... and a couple others I can't recall because I like nori. I wanted to get a smoothie, but they said they're focusing on the food for now so it'll be about another week until they start making the drinks. That's reasonable.

So, how's it taste? I was a bit sad about the overall size and amount of rice that was put, but it was pretty good. My choice may have hindered me from tasting the quality of fish that they have to offer since the soft shell crab is mainly crunch and the spicy tuna is already minced. They have quite a bit of sauces and even a little salsa bar on the side so I definitely recommend trying some additional sauces. I don't think the salsas would go well with the sushi burritos, but try them out with the nachos (or "Jachos")

I wasn't wow-ed my first time going, but the owner and other employees seem eager to grow and improve everything which is great! I'll definitely be back to try other things and see how they decide to improve the food.

...I'll also be back to get that mango smoothie I wanted to so bad ugh.
