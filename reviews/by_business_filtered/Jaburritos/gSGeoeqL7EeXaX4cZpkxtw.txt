When I heard that a sushi burrito place was coming to Las Vegas, I could not be more excited. It's definitely a cool concept! For burritos around $12 chock-full of fresh fish, you can't beat it for value.

The restaurant is set up like a Chipotle, where you line up and tell the people behind the counter exactly what you want. You get a choice between soy paper and seaweed for the wrap, and brown and white rice for the inside. There are a lot of toppings, including soft-shell crab, yellowtail, salmon, veggies like red onion, jalape√±os, radish and lettuce. Sauces include yuzu chili and diablo (which my friend Emma didn't find hot enough but I was burning from.) You can also add guacamole, avocado, cream cheese or tobiko (fish eggs). I tried the Rockport, which was AMAZING--soft shell crab, spicy tuna, surimi crab, jalapeno, tobiko, cucumber, red onion, chipotle mayo and sweet anguila sauce. I highly recommend trying one of their combinations instead of creating your own. I'm sure their creations are highly tested.

Once you pay, you can pick up a few of the excellent housemade sauces, including a salsa verde and amazing housemade soy sauce.

My Jaburrito was amazing--very filling, the fish was of great quality, and the flavors just went perfectly together. I was a little apprehensive about the lettuce, and using the salsas, but they actually tasted great together. 

The setting wasn't much to write home about (there weren't enough tables in my opinion) but it did have what matters--good lighting for photos!
