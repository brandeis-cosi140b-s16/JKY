SUSHI BURRITOS IN VEGAS UGH YES FINALLY.

I may have gotten a little too hyped for this place, which means my expectations were a little bit higher than usual... The staff was friendly, but I had to wait 25-30 minutes until I could finally order. I kept in mind that there were new hires who were working the assembly line, so it was understandable.

Redondo - 3/5 // $12.95
The first thought that came into my mind as they were making my sushi burrito was "that's all the rice they put on it? Really?" I thought there'd be at least a little bit more rice to make up for the lightness of the fish and toppings. The quality of the fish was pretty good considering the fact that we don't live by the coast. All the other toppings felt like they were a little bit skimped on and there was supposed to be Chipotle Mayo sauce, but I barely tasted any in mine. Overall, there was't really much flavor to it and it didn't really fill me up, which was a little disappointing (and I have a small stomach tbh). My friend told me that I could have gotten sauces on the side, which is what I should've done! Next time, next time...

Other than the food, the atmosphere is refreshing with its white, open space. I got my order to-go, so I didn't really get to bask in the restaurant. When coming here, keep in mind that there may be a line... because there will probably be a few first timers who will take forever choosing which toppings to put on their sushi burrito.

I'll have to try the taro chips and maybe one of the juices next time, but I probably won't be going back any time soon since I won't be dying to have another sushi burrito again.
