Sushi burrito..  Interesting concept but even cooler in person!!  It's just a really HUGE sushi roll!! 

You can opt for a normal-ish burrito -depending on the extras you decide to add. And they have tortillas.  So fear not, non-adventurous sushi people. 

I made my own, with the nori rice- which is a nice thin layer. Got some shrimp tempura and some random stuff in it, but the seaweed salad was the best part! 

Prices are reasonable considering the prices at a normal sushi joint are about the same or more for a smaller portion. 

We also got the queso and taro chips. Both of which were pretty good. 

We left feeling satisfied but not overly stuffed and with a good feeling in our belly that it wasn't a greasy, oily, heavy meal. 

There isn't too many tables, I'm sure on a busy night during the dinner rush it can get pretty busy. 

We'll be back for sure!!
