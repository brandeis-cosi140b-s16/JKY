I found this place in the local paper and for some reason, a sushi burrito just sounded like something I needed to try.  I decided to give it a shot and let me just say, it was AMAZING. First off, I honestly didn't think the burritos would get me full.  I really thought I was probably still going to be hungry afterward because, c'mon, I can kill some sushi on any given day (as long as it's good!) and these burritos didn't look like your average burrito.  So I ordered the Redondo burrito (since I Yelped it before I got there) and got some of those chips with a side of cheese.  When I sat down to eat, I was in heaven. I paid for two burrito combos and it was only about $25 plus tip. To me, that's not bad at all considering how fresh the seafood was and how generous they were with it.  I hate when places cover up their seafood with a bunch of veggies or stuff like that so you can't tell how much seafood is actually in your meal. Nope. Not this place. I got what I paid for and I was extremely satisfied. 

My ONLY complaint about this place was the seating.  I don't live close enough to this place to be able to take it "To Go" so when it was getting close to time to pay, I was a bit nervous that I would have to sit in my car to eat.  I understand how it works, but it was kind of annoying that there were people saving seats for people who were at the end of a long ass line. I'm sure by the time THOSE people ate, people like me would have already been done with my food. Lucky for me, I had placed my order to go but right before I walked out, someone had just got done eating and left.  I sat down in a hurry before one of the other scavengers stole a seat for their friends in line. Anyway, I'm sure this place didn't expect for it to be so busy/popular which explains the limited seating. If there's one thing I had to point out, it would be that and only that. Otherwise, I walked out full and completely satisfied.
