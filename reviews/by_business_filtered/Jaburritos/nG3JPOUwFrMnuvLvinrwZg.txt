This was my first sushiritto and it was pretty good. It's exactly what you'd thought it'd be - a burrito size sushi roll. I got the Rockport without red onions or masago although the jalape√±os were overpowering so maybe I'll skip that next time. This place is like a Chipotle for sushi lovers and I'll be back to try something else!
