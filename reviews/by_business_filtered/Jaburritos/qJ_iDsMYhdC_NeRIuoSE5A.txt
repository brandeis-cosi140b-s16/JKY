What seemed like a big sushi roll to me ended up being so much more.

My friends and I were really impressed by Jaburritos. A handful of us created our own while others ordered off their menu. You can try so many things here and you will be pleased by what you get!

Taro Chips were new to me and I think I would stick to regular chips with queso rather than the Taro Chips. The flavor was weird, but oddly enough I kept eating more.

Adequate amount of seating is provided and the restaurant is well kept. Be sure to stop by! I wouldn't be surprised if this place's popularity blows up soon.
