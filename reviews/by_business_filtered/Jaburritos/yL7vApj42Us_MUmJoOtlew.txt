Every time foodie fest comes in town I always go to the sushi burrito truck asap. I'm so glad a sushi burrito place is finally here. It was pretty busy when I went, but soooo worth it. 

I got the Huntington burrito. It consisted of ahi tuna, lettuce, onions, jalape√±o, cucumber, tortilla strips, and seaweed salad. Extra extra ahi tuna and extra poke sauce for me . 5/5. I scarfed that burrito down. No ragrets. 

I also got the taro chips. Sweet and salty goodness with a cheese dipping sauce. 

I can't wait to go back again and try everything else :D
