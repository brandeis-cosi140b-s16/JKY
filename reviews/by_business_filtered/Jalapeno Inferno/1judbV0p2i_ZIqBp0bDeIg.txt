I have wanted something different and jalape√±os did not disappoint, our waiter(Tommy) was courteous,fast, and informative, since it was are first time, Tommy started us off with a comp. sweet tamale that was very good and I will order as an appetizer, I ordered steak fajitas, which were brought to the table sizzling hot and came with rice and beans nicely displayed, everything was very tasty, and the chips and salsa are also very good, I will be eating there again very soon, Enjoy
