Have gone here several times and always had a good experience however this time was a disaster. Cold soup sent back and still not hot the second time. One person in our party asked for mustard for his burger, did not have any which was weird because he also had eaten here before and they always had Mustard. French fries were ice cold and so they gave him another order half the size. My lobster tacos were great but my husband said his chicken tacos were fair. My friend had a fajita salad and almost choked on something hard which we figured was an onion skin. All in all it was not good. Oh and we had to wait 20 minutes for a table.
