Love a free sweet corn tamale! It was sooo good. And so were the housemade flour chips! I wish they were the only representation I had of Jalapeno Inferno because this review would look much different.

However ... and this is big ... the $75.00 on 2 margarita pitchers was totally a RIP OFF.... are you kidding me? Not cool, Bistro Mexicano, not cool.

They offered pitchers for the group - and we're like "WOW, that's great." And then they charged us for 8 individual overpriced margaritas that they dumped into glorified glass mugs... I guess "bistro" is like code for snotty bartender, overpriced drinks, slow service, and "B" at best mexican food.

I'd go here again, but I'd definitely have to pre-game the Margaritas beforehand... otherwise the first 30 minutes of the night will be signing an "official document" verifying we're of legal age. And then top it off by throwing down a Benjamin for two measly margarita pitchers...

I wanted to love it. And I just really didn't - not at all.
