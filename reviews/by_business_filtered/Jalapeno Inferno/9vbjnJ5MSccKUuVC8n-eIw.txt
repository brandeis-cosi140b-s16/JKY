Remodeled inside looks much better and more like a real restaurant.   Our meal was prior to the lunch rush so the service was prompt & food came out right away.

Corn tamales had a wonderful texture - moist & bready, almost like a crumbly cornbread.  Spinach enchiladas with slivered almonds were interesting as well.  

Prices were very reasonable considering that it is the lottie-dah part of North Scottsdale.  Restrooms were nicely decorated and very clean.  Good selection of tequilas.
