AWESOME awesome awesome...  tripped over this stripmall and decided to have lunch with Hubby here.  Warm chips and great salsa - Check!  Delicious Margarity (not too tangy and nice and strong) - Check!  and really yummy food -- Check!  They won some awards for their Tamale and they really are amazing.  The steak fajitas were what I ate the first time and were totally BOMB and then I had a combination platter with a cheese enchilada and a chicken soft taco.  You nearly had to roll me out of there!  Hubby had the Unconstructed chicken taco and I must say I was really jealous.  He then ordered the Inferno sauce on the side (brave man) and was so surprised as to how hot it was.  He loved it - now I know he's nuttier than a fruitcake.  We've been back every weekend since its discovery.  Try it -- you'll like it!
