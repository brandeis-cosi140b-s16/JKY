I'm a little late with this review, but it is worth the read! 
I have been going to jalape√±os for 15 years. The chips and salsa have always been superb, however, the margs have never been a reason to go there. Over the last few years my family and I have noticed the service and level of quality slowly decline. The last visit I made and will EVER make was the final straw. It was new years day with a one page menu and a way overpriced buffet. To make a long story short we were accused, by the owner, of our 4 year old eating food off the buffet without paying, even though it was free for kids under 5. When we were charged for him and the 10 grapes he "stole" she told us we were "Wasting food".  She continued to speak to us like we were 5 years old and made us feel like criminals. I will sorely miss my chips and salsa, but I will not miss paying too much for poor service and overpriced average food.
