Great little place - would be amazing in the cooler weather of fall / winter with the outdoor patios. 

For the vegan crowd they offer a veggie fajitas. I didn't bother to ask if there was dairy, but it didn't taste like it, but was very tasty - if only lacking a bit of seasoning on the veggies - but I would rather that than too much salt. 

The service was good. The manager checked up on our large party and we had a good experience. If you're in north scottsdale and want Mexican it's worth a try.
