I LOVE their chips... 1/2 flour, 1/2 corn in a basket. I've always had very good meals but can be a little inconsistent- however, in many, many visits it's never been bad. And most of the year, the setting on the patio would compensate for any missteps.

This weekend we were there on a Saturday and had an incredible summer special!! $15 for a sampler platter and a flight of Margs! We often share the sampler app (usually $13) anyhow so to get the three little Margs for $2 was crazy! 

The black cherry sangria is delicious!! Although,  I've grown more in love with the sangria-Rita!!
