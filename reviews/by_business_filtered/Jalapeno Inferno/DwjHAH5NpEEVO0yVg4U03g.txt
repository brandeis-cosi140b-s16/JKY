This restaurant is great! My husband and I were visiting Scottsdale for a few days and it was suggested by locals we check out this place. Everything we ordered was awesome. We were given a complimentary tamale for being first timers and wow, it was amazing.  The fajitas and enchiladas were delicious entrees as well. Highly recommend!
