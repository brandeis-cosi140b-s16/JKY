After experiencing Jalapenos, you'll have a hard time going to any other Mexican restaurant!  Best food, salsa, drinks and service. The recipes are developed by the incredible owners who have decades of experience. They know how to treat customers and train their staff with the best service ethic possible. Our favs are the spinach enchiladas, tomatillo chicken enchiladas, and just about everything else!
