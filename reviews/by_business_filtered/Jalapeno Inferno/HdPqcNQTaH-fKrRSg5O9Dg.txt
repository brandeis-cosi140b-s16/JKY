We stopped by for a late Sunday lunch.  I had the lobster street tacos and my wife had the shrimp tacos.  Both were good, but I think the shrimp tacos had better seasoning (yes, I tried one of those too :)

Cold beer.  Reasonably priced.  Big portions.  Both lunches came with generous portions of rice and beans.  A bit too much for lunch, but good tasting.
