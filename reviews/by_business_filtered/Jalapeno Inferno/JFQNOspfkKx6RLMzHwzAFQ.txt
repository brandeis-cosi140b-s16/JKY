My visit on 1/1/12 will be my last.  My family was treated very poorly by the owner.
We were accused of "sharing the buffet", when we all ordered entrees, with the exception of my son in law who did order from the $16.99 marginal buffet and ate one plate.  We have been going to Jalapenos for 20 years, and have always enjoyed the chips and salsa and various entrees.  In all the years we have eaten in various restaurants in the Valley, we have never been treated like this, especially from the owner.    I will miss going there,.
