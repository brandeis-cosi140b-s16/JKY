It's always nice when the owner of the restaurant asks how you're doing. That's the service you get every time from Jalape√±o Inferno in North Scottsdale.

The lighting is better in the bar, so I prefer to sit there. We shared the green corn tamales, always a treat, but I don't think they need the cheese in them. 

My wife got some kind of fried mexican pizza that was huge and delicious (most of it is in my fridge this morning). I tried the Goat Cheese and Mushroom Enchiladas and they were super tasty, as were the black beans on the side.

The *Princess Margarita was good, but she said it was little too tart. I had The Boss and the Top Shelf, each unique and tasty, but I'll stick with the Top Shelf Margarita only next time.

Overall, this place is great! I thought I remembered it having fewer vegetarian options, but I was good-to-go. I do, however, wish they added something meatless to the spicy section of the menu. I know how good that inferno sauce is ;)

Turns out the owners opened a new place recently for American food, wine and rock-and-roll, Rhythm and Wine. Looking forward to trying that too.
