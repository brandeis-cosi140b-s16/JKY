Food is awesome, service is fast and friendly. The chips are awesome too.  Never had chips like these.  This is a great lunch spot but the dinner is fantastic too.  Atmosphere is cosy with the right mood lighting for evening.  Shrimp tacos were fantastic and we ordered a picture of margaritas.  Best margarita I had in a long time.
