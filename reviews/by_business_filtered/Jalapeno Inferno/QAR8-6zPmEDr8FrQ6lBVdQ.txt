Decided to give this place a shot after seeing it on my happy hour app. I signed up for the email newsletter on their website and received a 5$ coupon when you spend $20 or more on anything. 

Food wise, they had half off happy hour from 4:30-6:30 and domestic beers were 2.75 and imports 3.75. The chips were tasty and so was the salsa. The funditos were good but nothing you wouldn't find at any other mexican restaurant. 

Their website and social media work seems to be very good. I like places that keep me informed of what's going on.

The cantina was very nice inside and everything was tasty. 

Might go again someday and try some more dishes. Hey where was this "free tamale" everyone is talking about?
