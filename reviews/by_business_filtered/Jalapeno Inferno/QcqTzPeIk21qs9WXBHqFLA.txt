I bought a localdines certificate after reading all the positive reviews, but in the end it wasn't as good as I was expecting.  There was nothing wrong with it, it just seemed like standard Mexican food.  If you tell them it's your first time there, they do bring you a complimentary green chili tamale appetizer, which was yummy.  I also liked the mix of corn and flour tortilla chips that come with the salsa (complimentary).  I had the spinach enchiladas and they were good, but I've had equally good ones at Serrano's and Carlos O'Briens.  The BF had the steak street tacos, and he said they were good.  Service was good...no complaints.  If we were in the area, I might try it again, but considering we live in south Gilbert, it's kind of a hike for average Mexican fare.
