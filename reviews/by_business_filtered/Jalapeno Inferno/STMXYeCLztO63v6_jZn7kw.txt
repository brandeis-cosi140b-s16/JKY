Good Day all-

I've worked at Jalape√±o's on and off now for about 5.5 years (I've eaten here since 2000).  If there is anything I can say about this place in that amount of time; is it is by far the most consistent place I have ever worked for. You will get no surprises, (well you might if you try something new) the fav's are always spot on and the rest of our menu is just a straight up bonus to the pallet.  Its home to so many and the crew is always ready to take care of you and make it wonderful!  Please join our email for exclusive deals!  Season is about to hit so remember reservations are suggested and we are so looking forward to taking care of each and every one of you!  So from our kitchen to your taste buds, we look forward to seeing you all at Jalapeno's!
