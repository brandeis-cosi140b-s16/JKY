Just found this place about 3 years ago. Jalape√±o inferno has quickly become one of our regular places to eat. Their chips and salsa are homemade and yummy. We like our salsa hot so we request the hot and mix with the regular. The shrimp and lobster fajitas are to die for. And to wash down this fiesta of flavor you can't go wrong with the Boss margarita!
