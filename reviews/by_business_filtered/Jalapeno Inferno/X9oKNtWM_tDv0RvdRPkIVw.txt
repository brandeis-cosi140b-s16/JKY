After a few days of stewing, I just keep getting hotter and hotter over the Easter Brunch my husband and I experienced. It is quite possible that this place hasn't done buffets before. We arrive 15 min prior to our reservations which were at 10am, and were told "WERE NOT READY" the hostess was shocked that were arrived on time. So ok we'll go walk around. Came back 10 min's later and was seated. Then once seated, our server walks up about 5 min's later. Gave her our drink orders and she pointed out where the buffet was and to go ahead. Got up to go and was stopped by a different server, which said the foods not out yet. Now a line is forming around the buffet table and in the bar at the omelet bar. 10 more min's go by and finally the food comes out. My husband and I go up, get our food and get back to our table only to be even more disappointed that the food is "luke warm" REALLY. The table next to us asked for HOT plates, which they put there food on to warm it up. Then the bill comes $22.00 pp, $5.00 for each drink that seemed to hold about 3 oz (small), but the kicker was, we were then changed a 19% service charge for the 2 of us, NOT a party of 6 or more! Will we ever go back? Absolutely NOT! Terrible service and food. Extremely disappointing especially for the area. Nothing upscale about this place.
