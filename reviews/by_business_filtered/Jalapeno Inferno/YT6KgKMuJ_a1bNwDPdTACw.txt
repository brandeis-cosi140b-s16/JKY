I hardly go to Mexican restaurants, I am a hard critic. Usually I can make it or make it better!
I am very pleasantly surprised, overall the food was really good and the service even better. I had the corn tamales (gave up meat for lent) and hardly miss my meat. 
The chips were a great treat, first place I have ever gone to that has flour chips ( reminded me of my grandmother) and corn chips as well...the setting was very pleasant, patio dinning with great people.
Need to come back for a meat dish!
