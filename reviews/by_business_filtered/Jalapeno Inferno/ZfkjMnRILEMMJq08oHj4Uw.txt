My wife and I was told about this place from our hotel concierge. We checked it out for lunch last November and loved it. The sweet tamale appetizer is amazing! I had a spicy enchilada and it was really good. Crowds seemed high which was a good sign that it is popular. If we come back to visit AZ again we will go back
