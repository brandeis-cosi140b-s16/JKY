This was the second time we've been to Jalapeno Inferno and I am certain it will be the last.  We decided to hit up this joint again after forgetting we've been there once and subsequently bought a localdines coupon thinking we would try the place out.  After purchasing the coupon we both realized we'd been there before and weren't impressed the first time, but since we already bought it, we headed down for some dinner.  

The restaurant was packed on this particular Sunday night, so we waited about 15 minutes to be seated.  We were seated in the bar area, which normally would be fine, but like I said it was pack and we were surrounded by people who were getting a drink waiting for their table.  It was so uncomfortably crowded I almost had a panic attack.  Thankfully a booth opened up near our hightop table and we quickly claimed it to get out of the crowd.  The staff was accommodating, but seemed super overwhelmed by the massive amount of people.

The chips/salsa that were served before our meal were ok.  The salsa wasn't my style and the flour chips were good, but the plain ones (not sure why they mix the two) were so-so.  I ordered steak fajitas, which came out looking like chicken (a weird color) and the Hubs had enchiladas, which he seemed to like.

Basically, my opinion is there are better mexican choices in town.  Jalapeno Inferno is OK, but I would rather go to GREAT than OK.  Just my two cents...
