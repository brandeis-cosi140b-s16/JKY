So good! A friend and I were trying to decide on where to go for dinner and this place showed up on yelp. When I mentioned the name, she started raving about how good it was, so I had to try for myself. Definitely didn't disappoint! We had chips with salsa & guacamole, chicken and steak fajitas, beef enchiladas and even tried the flan, which I've never had before. Not a big fan of the flour tortilla chips but the server was happy to swap them out for corn when we asked. A little pricey ($80+ for 3 ppl) but we did order a lot and the portions were huge. We'll have plenty of leftovers for the next day or so! I will definitely be going back!
