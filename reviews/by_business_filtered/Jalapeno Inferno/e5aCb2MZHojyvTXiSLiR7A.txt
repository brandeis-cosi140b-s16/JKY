I'm not sure who's writing awesome reviews, they are either not familiar with good Mexican food or they are being paid to write this stuff. The food was some of the worse Mexican food I've ever had. They are busy only because there are not many choices in North Scottsdale. Trust me, it's worth the drive to go somewhere else.
