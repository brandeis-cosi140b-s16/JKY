Moved from one side of town to the other and was looking for a good Mexican food place to replace our old one.........  Stopped for lunch one day and are hooked. Have been back many times and taken several groups there for lunch and dinner. Inside and outside seating. Great Summer weekend and seasonal specials too.  Try one of their skillets and great for seafood.
