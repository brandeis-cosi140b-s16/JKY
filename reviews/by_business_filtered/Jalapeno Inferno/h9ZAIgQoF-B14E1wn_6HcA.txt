Earlier this week, we used our handy Google mobile app to locate what we hoped was authentic Mexican food. We were craving flavorful salsa and well-spiced meat dishes after a long, warm day in the desert. What we found here was slightly different than we were expecting......The chips were made of corn AND flour tortillas, which was a nice surprise but way too filling while waiting for our food. The salsa was just fresh tomatoes with some cilantro (or maybe even parsley?) for color.
It was "Taco Tuesday", which here meant all-you-can-eat of crunchy or soft with 3 different filling choices."Hamburger Helper-esque flavored shredded beef tacos", according to my teen son. Ooops :( I ordered the "award-winning green chili sweet tamale". I fear they left the winners with the judges, for they didn't make it to my table. The tamales were dry and contained about a tablespoon of chopped chiles throughout. And, although they were sweet as promised, they lacked depth of flavour overall.
The service was fine and the refills on soft drinks was fair, but I really was hoping for more. We are in town for a couple of weeks and may try it one more time since it's close to our accommodations, but with all these Tex-Mex and MexiCali flavour houses to choose from, it will take a lot to win us over for a better review.
