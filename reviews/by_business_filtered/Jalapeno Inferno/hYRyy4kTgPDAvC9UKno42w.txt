I hosted a birthday party for my 80 year old mom today and we had 45 people.  It is hard to find a place that will host a group of this size and be personable.  The manager(Becky) and the staff were truly incredible.  The environment food and service was exceptional.  I go there with friends often for lunch and this evening was so awesome for me,  my family and guests.  Oh and the food is awesome!!
