went for the first time and had an amazing experience! great food, great drinks, and great service, her name was kim! I was bragging about how awesome this place was so I took a friend and had a completely different experience. the bartender was RUDE. she acted as if it was an annoyance to have customers at her bar. I tried to order food but could not get her attention to get a menu. I sat there for about 20 minutes with my empty margarita, thinking she would ask if I wanted another one but she never did, so I took my business elsewhere. very disappointing.
