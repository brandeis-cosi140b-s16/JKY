Just had lunch there today. Pretty much got in an out in an hour, which was a plus. Food was so-so, waitress was not GREAT but not bad. The flour chips are really good, but I don't care for the corn ones, and the basket is a mix. The salsa is good, but could use a little kick. I had a combo and got a beef enchilada and a beef soft taco. Didn't care for the enchilada but the taco wasn't bad. Did not care for the beans but the rice was actually pretty good. My boyfriend got the chicken tacos and they were really good with an avocado cilantro dressing. Overall, Eh, but I had a groupon so I wasn't disappointed.
