Service and related issues have worsened this past year.  A few examples...  Slow service, multiple occasions can't find our server to order a 2nd margarita.  Witnessed staff having personal conversations while multiple tables needed something.  When not busy, we were ready to order yet our server walked past us 4-5 times without greeting us.  One occasion the food arrived before the margaritas (again, when not busy, which is an odd occurrence for drinks ).  

We seem to always receive our queso appetizer when we're out of chips and the server often walks away before we can ask, or the server forgets when we ask (meanwhile staring at an un-eatable cheese dip that is cooling off and thickening, wishing oh so much gosh... if only we had chips with this cheese dip). This should never happen and actually the dippable appetizers ought to be served with more chips anyway. Heck, in general it is harder to get salsa or chip refills, but perhaps that is intentional?  

Some of the female servers, bartenders, managers seem rather friendly with each other.  There isn't the same professionalism; it's as if everything is extra casual now.  Hostess issues too.  Standing by the hostess station, we watched everyone who arrived after us be seated before us, and we come to discover the hostess crossed us off the wait list without calling our name (and no real apology or anything).  

All of these things were uncommon when the owners were frequently present in years past before the opening of two additional restaurants.  I fear this place has descended into a sort of resting on one's laurels status wherein they don't need to worry about these sorts of matters any longer.

And what happened to the vegetarian and gluten free menus? Hostess claims that someone stole them.  Odd.  Perhaps there is an alternative explanation.
