I have finally found my favorite Mexican restaurant.  Food has great Flavor and the hotter sauce was good enough to drink although I had to ask for it. The service was impeccable, they kept both my diet Coke glass filled and the hot sauce coming. Now for the good stuff.  The top shelf margarita was wonderful and if I wasn't driving I would have had at least three. They served a mix of chips, both came out hot. The corn chips were standard, but the flour ones were more fluffy and addicting.

I can't wait to go back.
