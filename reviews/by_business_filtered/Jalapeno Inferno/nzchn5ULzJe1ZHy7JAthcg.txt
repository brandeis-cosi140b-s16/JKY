Best chips and salsa in Scottsdale. 
Fabulous nachos!
Great margaritas- get 'The Boss"
Smoky pork hatch quesadilla is amazing
Black and blue salad is wonderful

I personally do not like their chicken but I like shredded white meat cooked in a pressure cooker. They grill chicken great or do shredded chicken but not all white meat.
Wishing they would add the delicious smoky pork as an option and not just for the Smoky hatch quesadilla.

Staff is warm and friendly. 

A great place to take family and friends visiting Arizona.
