I went here on a cold night around the holidays and it provided the warmth I needed. The front room is pretty hokey, and I'm not sure I'd like dining in there. But the back room, the "lounge" area, is much more my style. The food was above average Mexican, lacking the spiciness of other spots but more than making up with the quality ingredients. I also enjoyed the live entertainment (some acoustic dudes covered "My Winding Wheel" by Ryan Adams -- play that anywhere and I'll give three stars). I'd go back, but only for that back room. The front room looks like Don Pablo's had a lovechild with Ajo Al's. Blah.
