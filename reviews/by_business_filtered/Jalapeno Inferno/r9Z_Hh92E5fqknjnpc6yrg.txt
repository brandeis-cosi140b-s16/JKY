In the mood for Mexican and somewhere different, we found a $30 for $15 gift certificate for Jalapeño Inferno on localdines (http://www.localdines.com/phoenix?ref=19485).  A great deal.  It made a meal for two half price.  Even better; It turns out this place is one of those great family owned strip mall restaurants that valley residents should be more aware of.

The setting:
We didn't eat in the dining room.  But from what I saw, it was quite spacious, and had a fairly formal setting for a causal family place.  The patio is big and if you sit farther back, you'll be on the other side of a pond setting between this restaurant and Jade Palace.  It's a nice touch.

The food:
The chips and salsa are awesome.  There are two types of chips in the basket.  One is a traditional tortilla chip; the other is very crispy, more like a wonton.  The salsa is pretty mild, but very flavorful.  A great way to start any meal.  Upon telling the server it was our first time here, he ordered us a free tamale.  It won best of Phoenix (I'm guessing in the new times) so they're pushing everyone to try it.  It's really good.  We also ordered the chicken and steak fajitas for two.  Delicious.  The steak had quite a kick to it, something very spicy in that rub.  Also props to Jalapeño Inferno for giving both plates a generous scoop of guacamole.  Most restaurants are really starting to cheap out on it.

Overall:
The service was great.  The food is excellent.  Jalapeño Inferno is a wonderful place to eat.  Get the localdine (http://www.localdines.com/phoenix?ref=19485) for a good deal, then enjoy a good meal!
