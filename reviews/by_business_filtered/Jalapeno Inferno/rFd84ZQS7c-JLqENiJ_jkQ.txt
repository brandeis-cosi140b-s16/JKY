It was "under construction" when I visited yesterday, but I enjoyed dining in their cantina nonetheless.

Good quality from the chips and salsa to my chicken wrap. Reasonable lunch specials, and I am guessing an amazing atmosphere from the look of the work going on in the dining room.

I shall return!
