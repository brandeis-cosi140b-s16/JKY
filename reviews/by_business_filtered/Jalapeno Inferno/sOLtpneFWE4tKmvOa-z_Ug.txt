My new favorite Mexican restaurant since my old one unexpectedly closed down a few months ago. Little did I know there was another within 10 minutes from my home. Happy hour is insane. The margaritas are amazing and everything we ate was delicious. The restaurant is beautiful and staff is very nice which I didn't expect because of the area. The only downside is that it doesn't feel like its very authentic.  My husband and I are still going to be regulars for sure.
