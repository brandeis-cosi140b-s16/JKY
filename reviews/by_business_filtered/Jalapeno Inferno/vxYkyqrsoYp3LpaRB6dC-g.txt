Two words of wisdom for you, and I hesitate to write this because it's going to make this place busy...

TACO TUESDAY.  For $10 you get unlimited refills (2 at a time) of chicken or beef tacos, soft or hard shell.

The drinks were strong and the staff is EXCELLENT.  They actually care, which seems funny to even have to mention that.  The manager even came over.

Watched one of the world series games here and it was a great experience all the way around.  It was clean, quiet enough, great food, great service, and what else could you ask for?

I didn't go during a football game on Sunday, but they have a sign that makes me want to.  all kinds of specials and special items.

Go check this place out of you are anywhere close!
