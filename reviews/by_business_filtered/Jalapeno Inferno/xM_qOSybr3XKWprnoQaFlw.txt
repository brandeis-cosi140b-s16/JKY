This is everything a Mexican restaurant should be!! Awesome chips and salsa (too good) and clean, fast, friendly place. All the entrees are awesome. The hatch green chilis are super spicy and good. Highly recommended the Grande Burrito with red chile beef, the Hatch Green Chile Enchiladas and the Hatch Cheese Skillet appetizer!
