Two words, Happy Hour!

Margaritas for $2.50, beers for $2.00, and some pretty tasty cheap food. I ended up ordering the Tacos Tijuana w/carne asada which only costs $5, it came with two tacos and rice and beans. The tacos were delicious, they came w/chorizo, steak, and cheese. I also ordered the camaron tropical guacamole (also $5), it was also delicious and definitely different, it's not your average guacamole. The guacamole was mixed with mango and shrimp, my mouth is watering just thinking about it. 

The bartender was really nice, he showed great customer service. I can't wait to return to HH again, Friday nights it starts at 11 p.m. and ends at 2 a.m.
