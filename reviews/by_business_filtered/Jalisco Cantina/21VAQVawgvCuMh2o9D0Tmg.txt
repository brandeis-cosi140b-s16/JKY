Excellent Service and decent food. I would recomend this place to anyone who is looking for decent friday night dinner, I love their server i think her name is marissa she is amazing this  was my 2 nd visit within a month, Food was good just was disappointed with the Fish Taco which i  regret not going with the server's advice for chicken Taco instead of Fish it didn't taste good. Everything else was good.Management should take care of the furniture, one of the table that i sat was broken. It's all about details.
