A recent transplant to Las Vegas -  I have found my "Mexican food home" with Jalisco. The Street Tacos are some of the best I have ever had and the Carne Asada is always consistent. My wife loves the chees enchiladas. Another real nice touch is the refried beans served alongside chips and salsa. Try not to fill up on them as I always do, and always find myself taking leftovers home, which are almost as good as the original a day later. Highly recommended!
