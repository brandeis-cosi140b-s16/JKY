I came here because I was craving some chips and salsa. Upon entering, this place looked closed. I'm talking no one around, no hostess, and I had to flag down a waiter to get us seated. 

Carne asada burrito- 4 stars. The meat in it was juicy and yummy. I think one of the best carne asada burrito I've had in Vegas so far. 

Mini chimichanga- 3 stars. Was okay. 

Service- 2.5 stars. These guys, dunno what they're doing when there's only 2 tables including ours that were booked. I'd only come back for the burrito, but it's not to die for so I'd probably not come back for a while.
