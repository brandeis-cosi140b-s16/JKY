Started with complimentary chips, beans and salsa. The salsa was tasty and the beans would have been perfect if they were hot, they came out barely warm. The waitress was very nice and was always around when I needed something. I ordered the carnitas burrito and this thing was a monster. Ive eaten alot of places where there is some meat and lots of filler but this was the complete opposite.  There was pork stuffed all the way through and it was delicious. The carnitas were so tender and flavor was really good. I shouldnt have eaten so many chips and salsa and maybe I could have eaten the whole thing. 70% isnt bad. Lol. I was hesitant going in since the name change from Super Mex but im glad I did and I will go back.
