I live near this restaurant and was hesitant to try it because I'm picky about Mexican food (from Texas and Tex-Mex is my favorite food group) and the yelp reviews weren't overwhelmingly positive. However, about 3 months ago my mom was in town and we were tired and wanted to eat something quick so we decided to finally give Jalisco's a whirl. 

Place wasn't very crowded and service was attentive and good. 

The salsa and bean dip they serve with chips is good. 

We ordered guacamole as an app and it was blech. I did not enjoy their guac. The avocados did not taste fresh. My favorite guac is the simplest & freshest and theirs has huge chunks of onion and tomato and was watery. Just say no!

I got a combo plate with a hard shell ground beef taco and cheese enchilada. Both, including the rice and beans, were very tasty. Whatever cheese they use in enchilada is bomb. The red sauce is good too. Thumbs up.

I got an agave marg on the rocks and it was so sweet I couldn't drink it. Next time I would skip the agave--maybe I just don't like agave.

My mom got a chile relleno and she said it was really good.

Since this first visit, I've ordered take out twice on nights I didn't feel like cooking and you just pick up from their bar. Definitely worth giving this place a try if you are craving Mexican and in the mood for a low key lunch or dinner. BUT, skip the guac & agave.  Thank me later.
