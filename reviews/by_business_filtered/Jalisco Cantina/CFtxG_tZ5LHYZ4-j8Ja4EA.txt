The food is good, especially at the bar after hours because it is made fresh. The bartender is nice, a man named Carlos. He was quick and pleasant with my order of drinks. But when I come during the day, there was no one to greet us, and there was only a sign to tell us to seat ourselves. Once we sat down, the waitress gave us miss-matched silverware and cups of water that had small fingerprint-looking stains on it. But once we got the food, it was mediocre, and mole had no flavor, any chicken we had was drenched in some sauce. But the enchiladas were hot and good, and the fried chicken was fresh, but lack of seasoning on the mole and rice could be tasted. I would suggest this place if you are also drinking or seeing the live band, but not during the day after lunch.
