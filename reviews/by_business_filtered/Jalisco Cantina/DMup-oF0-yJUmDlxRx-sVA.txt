Warm and inviting! Our waitress was super attentive. In fact, one of our orders came out a little mixed up (no biggie) they felt so bad they bought us a round of margaritas!!

We had the fresh guacamole and it did not disappoint! It was chunky with cilantro and onion. I loved it!

I had a cheese enchilada , chicken taquitos , carne asada.
All were AMAZING.

Margaritas not very powerful, but still enjoyable.

I'll be returning for sure.
