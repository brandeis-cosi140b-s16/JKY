Didnt know that there's a great Mexican place just a few blocks away from our house. Found a groupon and checked reviews on yelp. Decided to check this place out. We ordered the guacamole - not the usual but in chunks. It was good. we got the green chili rellenos and carne asada burrito. Servings r huge! Will go back again
