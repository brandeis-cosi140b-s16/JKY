Stopped in around 2am on a Friday because we wanted beer and some Mexican food after getting off work. Well, we got the beer, but waited almost an hour for our food... I have to mention that we were the ONLY 2 people ordering food. The bartender kept coming over and apologizing that it was taking so long... but I'm still confused WHY it took as long as it did. They only offer half the menu that late at night, and it's not like we were ordering extravagant meals.
When our food finally came out it was absolutely inedible. The shrimp in my burrito was burnt, as was my boyfriends fish, chicken, and shrimp tacos... We had to flag down the bartender to tell her we just couldn't eat the food. So we ended up leaving, still hungry, an hour and $20 later...
