Have to say I wasn't impressed here. Walking into the place a little early for Dinner but there was only one other table seated. It should have alerted me to the disappointment that was coming. As we sat only two other tables came in and both of them were Senior Citizen aged groups. 

I mention that only because as we were eating our food it reminded me of the food I ate at the nursing homes my grandmother lived at as a teenager. Very bland and not overly flavorful.

I was given three small soft taco shells for my shrimp fajitas. With all the peppers, onions, guacamole and cheese on the plate you could have easily used 6 to 9 more shells. The shrimp were incredibly overcooked and lacked flavor. 

The Fiance had a taco dish that was also very bland in flavor. We had to order extra Guacamole and Salsa just to add flavor to the food. 

The waitress had a total of four tables while we were there and we still only saw her three times. Once to take or order, once to deliver and finally to give us a bill. Never checked on us to ensure we were ok and I had to Flag her down to request my extra shells and get our bill. 

I don't recommend the place but if you like mild almost bland food you just may love it.
