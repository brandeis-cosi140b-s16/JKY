Since they changed the name (formerly Super Mex), things have gotten better at this location. I'm a big fan of their nachos. Before the remodel, they were good. Now...they're pretty awesome! The grilled chicken nachos are my favorite, but they also have steak, shrimp and a few other options. The servers are friendly and usually pretty good about refills on drinks and chips and salsa. The Ceviche I'd a great way to start your meal. It's big enough for 2 or 3 people to share. Prices are a little more than before but still reasonable. I definitely like the new spin on the place.
