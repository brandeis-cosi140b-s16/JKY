Everything was delicious!! I make a home made Albondigas soup too and was pleasantly surprised theirs tasted very much like my own. It was really good and a large bowl, so I had to take some of it back to the hotel with me. My husband ordered their special which was a pork enchilada dish. He shared a few tastes with me and it was very very good. Salsa and beans to dip were great. No complaints here. Highly recommended!
