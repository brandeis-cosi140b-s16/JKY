Mediocre food with no ambiance at all.

I decided on this place because I ran into a groupon and I still haven't learned my lesson  that sometimes there's a good reason to skip on a groupon deal because the food isn't great. The food here was ok. No bold flavors and it's not a spot I would likely visit again. 

Mexican places should always have some authentic decor and the ambiance is key for me because the experience begin with your eyes. There's nothing of that nature here and the food pretty much went along with everything else. I ordered a hard chicken taco & a cheese enchilada which lacked in flavor and my mans mega burrito was a mega disappointment as well. Lots of food for sure but not traditional in any way. 

The service was good so thank you for that but it needs some traditional decorations and a chef who knows about Mexican flavors. There are so many great spots in town and this one isn't one of them.
