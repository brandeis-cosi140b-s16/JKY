Food was okay. Service was okay. It was a beautiful night so we choose to sit outside, away from the smoke of the bar. It was nice but not really taken care of. They have the potential of making it very nice patio seating. The best thing was it was Tuesday night which apparently meant live music. Probably won't return.
