Two tacos with rice and beans is VERY filling! I was pretty hungry and I could only eat one taco. I got the asada and al pastor - both packed full of meat and very flavorful, especially the al pastor. Taco shells themselves are a bit too small tho; you kinda have to use a fork to eat. Comes with pico and guac. Mexican cheese was plentiful and delish on the plate! 
Free chips and salsa comes with a chipotle brown and a bean dip - both yum even tho I prefer red salsas. 
I ordered a Dos Equis on tap, too, and got a HUGE one in a beverage glass. A beer glass would have been classier, but hey. :) 
This place is open 24 hours which is amazing. For the quality and price, I'll definitely be back. :)
