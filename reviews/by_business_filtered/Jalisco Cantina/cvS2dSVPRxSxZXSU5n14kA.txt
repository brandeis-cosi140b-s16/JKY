- I found out about this place through Groupon, & it was pretty good!
- We were seated right away.
- The service was great!
- They have albondigas soup! And it was delicious! Not many places have albondigas soup.
- Their queso fundido is to die for! The cheese that they use is amazing!
- I also love their complimentary salsa!
- They have a separate bar/gaming area if you like that sort of thing.
- It was nice & quiet. (I hate loud restaurants)
