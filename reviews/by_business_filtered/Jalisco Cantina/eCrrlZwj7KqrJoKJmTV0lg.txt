Two stars because food was decent. Carne asada was really tender. One additional star because the bartender immediately greeted us and was nice. 

However.... The seats within the bar are really uncomfortable. We sat at a little table and I could not get comfy. Maybe I'm weird, but I didn't like it. Next, I went to the ladies room and the entire door was missing to the entrance. Why?! What happened? I stood their confused. Men's room had a bathroom door, why couldn't the ladies? 

I would eat here again. Oh! It also was weird that the bartender was walking around smoking a cigarette. I didn't care about that really, just didn't seem professional. 

Food is good though! Seriously, eat here.
