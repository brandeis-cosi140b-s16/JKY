We have been going here since it was SuperMex. This place is very good and their customer service is always great.

They have a large selection of Mexican food. I love the fried jalape√±o and onion appetizer and it's ONLY 3 DOLLARS!!! Great prices! Also, get the entertainment book, they have five or six two for one coupons for this place. You can't beat those deals.

Everything we've tried has been great. Love their carnitas and carne asada. They also have a very good hot salsa if you ask for it. Beware though, the hot salsa can be pretty hot.

We usually sit at the bar. Omar the bartender is awesome. He has amazing customer service skills and knows how to treat a customer. Can't say enough good about him.

If you like Mexican food, give this place a try. You'll probably love it.
