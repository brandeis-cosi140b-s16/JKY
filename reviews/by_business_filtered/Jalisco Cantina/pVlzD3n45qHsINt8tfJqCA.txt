I arrive and ask for a booth, I do realize I'm a party of one in a near empty place ( before lunch rush) and was acomodated. I explain beforehand I have a Groupon. I was told what the specials of the day were and I agreed. So far so good, right? WRONG!. The seat in the booth tilted, it's broken, I nearly fell....I asked server to pick a drink for me....she did ...but why do you serve top shelf margaritas in a bud light promo glass??  Food, well if it wasn't served with salsa and tortillas, it could pass for a diff. cuisine...it was yummy. Server 5 stars, she did her job ( thanks lisa). Management 1 star just 
for hiring her!.. (otherwise,  should not have hazards in restaurant) Bartender, the drink was awesome...again management...pick new glassware!
