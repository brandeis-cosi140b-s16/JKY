Was excited to try this place because it had great reviews. However, we were really unimpressed. First of all the waitresses argued over which one was actually going to wait on us, after we had already been waiting for quiet sometime. The waitress barely understood basic English. My husband ordered no beans with his meal and I got no beans with mine which I wanted. My husband said his chicken enchiladas tasted like chicken from a can. I wasn't impressed with my meal as well. We ordered fried ice cream for Desert and it wasn't good at all the ice cream was hard as a rock and couldn't even spoon it apart. Don't think we will be returning.
