This place sucks as did Super Mex come to find out it's the same owner. They think that adding spice or making the plate hot in taste makes it a good Mexican restaurant. The chicken was hard and dry and serving queso fundido with "tostito" chips is a No No tortillas is the way to go. The bottom line is this is a gringo restaurant.  I will not be back and I will not recommend this place.
