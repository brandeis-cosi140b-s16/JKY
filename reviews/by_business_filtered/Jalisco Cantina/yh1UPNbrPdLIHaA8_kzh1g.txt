HUGE fan of this Mexican restaurant as Super Mex. Was sad when I arrived and saw that it was now Jalisco Cantina. The menu is a tad different but the atmosphere was still the same, and my favorite employees were still there. 

Next thing I noticed different outside of the name were the chips and salsa. Super Mex had the super-sized round chips and JC has regular chips. They were still tasty, however. 

I typically order the Super Mex burrito and my mom the taco salad, but we both stepped out of the box as I ordered the vegetarian nachos and she the chimichanga. They were both AWESOME!

At the end of the day, I will miss Super Mex. They were here a long time and loved their food. But Jalisco Cantina is great in their own right, and are worthy of carrying the torch. They are their own entity, so comparing them to Super Mex would be unfair. But, they are worth the visit and try, and I will be back often as the food is absolutely delicious!
