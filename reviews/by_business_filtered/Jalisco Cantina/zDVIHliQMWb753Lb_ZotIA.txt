Ok first off I go in there and order food to go. I ordered 2 bowls of tortilla soup and one taco combo plate with one additional taco, got charged $ 32.00 That's crazy. Second I get the food home only live a couple minutes away the tacos are soggy and ice cold, the soup is ice cold too. I was wondering where the chicken was in the tortilla soup since I just received 2 bowls of broth. No toppings like cheese and avocado or tortilla. There was some tortilla in the soup soggy as hell too. I would recommend that you steer clear of this place the food was disgusting and I would not feed it to my dog. I basically just threw away $ 32.00. Also from what a patron their told me as he was disappointed too because he blew $ 80.00 in 5 minutes on 5 different machines and could not even hit anything better than a pair. I think this place is owned by crooks who cheat people anyway they can food, machines, whatever.

AWEFUL EXPERIENCE.
