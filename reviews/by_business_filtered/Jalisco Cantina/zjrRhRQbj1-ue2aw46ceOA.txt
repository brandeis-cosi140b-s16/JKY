We come here regularly not for the great service but for the reasonably priced food. I have gotten a few different things here. I've gotten chicken taquitos that were good. I also got the lettuce wraps one time but the shredded chicken was too greasy. My favorite is their carne asada burrito. They put an adobe sauce over it that I always say no to. I usually get a side of tomatillo sauce to put on top but be prepared it has a kick. The free chips and beans are always a nice way to start our meal as well.
