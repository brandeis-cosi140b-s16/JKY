Absolutely loved their fajitas!  The salsa is amazing as well!  The establishment is set in the usual over the top Vegas grandeur.  Dimly lit and very noisy.  I was there with my girlfriend and between the lighting (or lack there of) and the noise level being so high it provided an insulating effect and which was pretty intimate when we sat next to each other.

I took a star off because it is also very expensive, which is par for the course in Vegas, but as good as the food ad service was (which were great) I couldn't justify the price which worked out to be around $45 a person.
