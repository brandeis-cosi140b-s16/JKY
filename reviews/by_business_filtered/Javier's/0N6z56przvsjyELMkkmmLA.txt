the drinks were awesome. I got a blended strawberry/ mango margarita and the organico margarita. the bartenders are very accommodating and friendly. I had a 9:30 reservation but i just decided to eat at the bar around 7:30. i ordered the cabo azul, it was pretty good portions but  I couldn't finish it. it was quite salty. I feel like for $30 i wish the meal showcased the seafood more. all of the seafood was hidden behind either a poblano chile, or tortillas. the best was probably the free chips and salsa. the salsa is awesome and im a salsa fiend.
