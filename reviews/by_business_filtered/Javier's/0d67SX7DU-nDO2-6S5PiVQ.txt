Ate here on 22 December 2013.

The food isn't mind blowing but is way better than your typical Mexican fare.

The margaritas here are the best I've ever tasted. Hands down. Try em all!

The server was very professional and had a great sense of timing for when he was needed and when he wasn't.

This is a great place to enjoy both a casual meal and a nice dinner in the evening.
