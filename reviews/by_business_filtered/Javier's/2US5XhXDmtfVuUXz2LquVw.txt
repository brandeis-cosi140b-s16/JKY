Javier's is one of my favorite restaurants on the planet.  We started going to Javier's in the late 90's when the only location was in Laguna Beach.   The location at ARIA has stepped up the game as far as how the restaurant looks.  But it still has the same amazing food I remember from the days in Laguna.  

Do yourself a favor.  Head over to Javier's, order any flavor of fresh margaritas, mine is the jalape√±o, the Guacamole as an app, then for dinner, The Carnitas.  You'll leave full, and with a huge smile on your face.  Just like I do.
