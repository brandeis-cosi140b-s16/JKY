Ate here for a client dinner. I thought the food was great, however the ambiance was a little loud for a party our size (6) it was difficult to hear the other end of the table's conversation.  Decor was beautiful.

Started with the queso and guac. Both were good. Chips and salsa were good too, the salsa had a bit of a kick to it.

For my entree, I tried a sampler platter of a shrimp taco, Maine lobster enchilada, stuffed chile relleno. It was delicious!  This is upscale mexican food and the average entree was around $30. This was very similar pricing to all the restaurants in the aria hotel.
