Having come from Phoenix and eaten plenty of Tex/Mex it is always nice to have a more Mexican sit down style dinner. I had the Chicken Mole at the recommendation of our server and it was the best I've ever eaten. Really recommend this place if you are on this side of the strip. There is another Mexico City style restaurant in the Shops at the Venetian that I like as much and the ambiance is great as it is next to the canal but this place is more romantic and a better dinner atmosphere. Margaritas were exceptional as well. Only comment is it was expensive, as are most things in Las Vegas but the quality and flavor were excellent.
