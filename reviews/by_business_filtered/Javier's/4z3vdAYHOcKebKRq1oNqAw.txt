This place is awesome!  Best upscale Mexican food I've ever had...I'm a local and I yearn for authentic taste of Mexican food from my spots in the Bay Area, with this place I can maintain until I get back to visit home.  My husband and I have been 3 times and between the two of us have had a variety of meals.  It is pricy for Mexican food...but worth every dollar.
