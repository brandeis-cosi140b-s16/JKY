On my last trip to Vegas, I did both dinner and drinks at Javier's.

For dinner, I had the chicken mole enchiladas.  The mole was outstanding.  The salsa that comes with the chips was flavorful.  The margaritas (especially the Granada, with pomegranate) were delicious.  And service was prompt and friendly.  It's a bit on the expensive side: $20 for 2 enchiladas and the standard sides of beans and rice.

I liked the drinks so much that I came in for happy hour a few days later.  This time, I sat at the bar, and despite the fact that there appeared to be as many bartenders as patrons (three), it took nearly 10 minutes to get someone's attention and place my order.  Still, the margaritas were again delicious.

Worth checking out, keeping the price point in mind.
