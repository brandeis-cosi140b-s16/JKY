This was in Vegas in Oct 2014 for a Girls' Trip---the important part of that statement being "Vegas" so this is not going to be extremely detailed.  This much I will tell you, the salsa was fresh and to die for (we kept asking for more, I think it might have been complimentary which makes that fact even more greedy, but the chips were fresh and the salsa was delish so I'm pretty sure we cleaned them out). 

Nevertheless, we all ordered the fajitas and none of us finished them. They were DIVINE!  We all ordered different types (I ordered beef) and everyone enjoyed their meal so much so, the girls and I were emailing about "those good fajitas we had in Vegas" last week, like little piggies.  

Again, it was Vegas so that's all the detail I'm capable of providing due to the activities and atmosphere of said locale. You're welcome. Go there, it's good/
