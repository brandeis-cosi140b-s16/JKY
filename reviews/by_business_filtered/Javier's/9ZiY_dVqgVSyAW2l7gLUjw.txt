Great food! I have already reviewed Javiers in Newport Coast, CA, this is the same great Mexican cusine and the same owners. Impecible service and delicious food. Decor and atmosphere is great. I suggest reservations for prime dining times on weekends. This is the best Mexican food I have eaten in Las Vegas and I have eaten at most of them on the strip.
