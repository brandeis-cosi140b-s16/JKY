Flew in from LA for a 3 day business trip in Vegas. Ended up staying at the Aria and headed into the first restaurant i saw. The menu looked decent so decided to try it out, even though the ringing of gambling wasn't too far from my chair. Sat at the bar and was promptly served my drink and a plate of chips and salsa. Very good salsa and nice warm chips. Ended up ordering the Chile Verde and it was tasty. Good sauce and well presented. The meat could have been a bit more tender, but overall I was satisfied with the visit, food and service. Didn't get the chance to try anything else, but they looked good too.
