If you're in the area or staying at the Aria you need to make a stop here. The margaritas are AH-MAZING! My bf and I decided to come here for dinner prior to a cirque show and we are so glad we did. The food was really good, but the drinks are what makes it. They don't taste strong, but I think that's the magic of them because 20 mins later after 2 you'll be knocked on your ass. Just sayin'. So take the time to stop, make a reservation because it gets busy.
