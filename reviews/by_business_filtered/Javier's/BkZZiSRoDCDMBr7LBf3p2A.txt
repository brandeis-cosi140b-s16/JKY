We went there for a second time in 4 nights!  We ordered salads and drinks.  The service is really good.  All the servers show you that they care.  
We were there really late (close to midnight) and one of the servers was putting the table setting on a table in the corner in the back and he was singing while doing it.  It was so adorable!  It seemed that he was enjoying what he was doing.  It somehow made me feel better about the place and the environment there.  I'll definitely go back and I totally recommend dining there for some fine Mexican dining.
