The Margaritas are the BEST!!! However they are a bit expensivo but let me tell you how you fix this problem. Have at least three because after the 2nd you wont give a damn how much they cost cuz your buzz will have you as happy as a hippo.
As for the food at this Javier's, well it's not all that. Yes the food is good but since its Vegas you can defiantly find a better dinning experience elsewhere. Stick to the drinks, hold up the bar and enjoy the eye candy the Aria hotel has to offer. Hopefully the bartenders are more friendly and attentive because they were slow when I visited this Javier's. 
Enjoy  the margaritas and Hasta La Vista Baby.
