I went to Javier's last night before seeing Zarkana and I'm so glad I did.  After reading Rod U.'s review, I knew the Cabo Azul would be what I'd order.

I was seated promptly without reservation and I was soon brought water, iced tea, and chips with salsa.  I had a few minutes to study the menu once again--I really didn't have to--when the server came back to take my order.  The chips were warm and the salsa had a good flavor with lots of cilantro flavor and a small amount of bite.

The Cabo azul is a mixed seafood plate with a (1) grilled chile relleno stuffed with Dungeness crab, shrimp, and jack cheese, (2) a lobster enchilada in pasilla sauce, and (3) a shrimp taco served in a soft flour tortilla that's been slightly grilled.  The dish was wonderful!  It's a great selection of seafood.

There was no skimping on any of the fillings.  The enchilada had great tasting lobster.  The crab and shrimp in the chile relleno was plentiful, and the grilled shrimp in the taco were excellent!  The dish also had black beans and rice.  The chile wasn't hot at all.  Although I like hot peppers, I think it would have detracted from the crab and shrimp.  For dessert, I went with their fried ice cream which was standard and good.

Service was excellent.  My iced tea was refilled without asking, plates were cleared quickly, and a manager came by two times to see how things were and once to chat about the heat or lack of the chile.

The room is really nicely done with different decorations including a wall of carved wood that is quite interesting (see other peoples' photos).  This is a place I'll revisit!
