Javier's is our go to restaurant in Vegas. The food is delicious and the servers are friendly and attentive. We went for a bachelorette party with 12 girls and they were very accommodating, went for a birthday and they made it extra special and even a regular dinner with no occasion feels like a special night out. The chips and salsa are addicting. My favorite item off the menu is the steak salad. Their cocktails are extremely strong, I had to ask if they would bring me some extra pineapple juice on the side so I can lighten it up a little. The prices are very reasonable for Vegas. Javier's never disappoints. 

Note: Make a reservation and you won't have to wait. Speedy service, always!
