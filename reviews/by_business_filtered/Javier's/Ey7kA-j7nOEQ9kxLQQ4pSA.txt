I was at the Aria for a conference and stopped by this evening for a bite to eat at the bar.   The bartender was really nice, had a couple margaritas which were fantastic then ordered Carnitas for dinner.    When my food arrived the presentation was good but the meat was so incredibly dry I could barely pull it apart.   I complained twice  to the bar tender expecting him to offer  me something else and he just kind of shrugged and told me they are usually very tender.  I expected a litte more from  a place where you are paying $30 bucks a plate.   The fact that they didn't attempt to correct the problem really bothered me....$60 buck dinner tab which was pretty crappy all the way around.
