Javier's! It's one of my favorite restaurants in California and now it's in Aria! Yes! Yes! Yes! It's been a long time coming. I've eaten here an upwards of a dozen or so times. Dining in at one of the tables was stuffy, really dark and the server messed up more than once on our order and drinks. I'm thinking great...they bring my favorite california restaurant out here and messed it up! The next time I came I had to drag my boyfriend because he was less than impressed with our first visit. We sat at the bar and YES this is the vibe and food we were looking for. Food came out quick! 10 minute quick! Service was great even though the bar was busy. Now we dine here once a week or call our order in and go pick it up. The tacos are our favorite pick. We get them, crunchy, soft, filled with steak or chicken. If you haven't eaten here do so! I would suggest the bar though. They try a little to hard to make it Vegas fine dining. When your ordering tacos and snacking on chips and salsa (which btw are MMMAZING) it just doesn't add up.
