I had been dying to eat here because I'm drawn to the decor in the place, it's BEAUTIFUL inside. However, the moment I tasted my margarita I knew I wasn't in for a delicious meal. If they can't make a proper margarita for $15 it's a problem. We got the shrimp ceviche which was tasty enough but not great. The carnitas were over cooked and over priced and the lobster enchiladas were again not good and over priced. The service was good and the place is beautiful but I still can't believe we payed $100 to eat that.
