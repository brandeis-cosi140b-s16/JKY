Ate here for lunch and was pleasantly surprised at how good it was.  

They have some very spicy salsa but you have to ask for it.  Delish!

Jalapeno margaritas?   Yes please!   I can't tell you how many of these I had.  VERY pricey but I couldn't stop myself.  

I had the crab and shrimp quesadilla which was fabulous.
