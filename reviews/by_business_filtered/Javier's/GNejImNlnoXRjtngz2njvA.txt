Based on the recommendation of our waiter, I ordered the Margarita de Tamarindo and the Trio enchiladas (crab, lobster, and shrimp). 

Some oddities: I asked about subbing out my rice and beans and was told no. My wife ordered two a la carte tacos and was told the plate (with beans and rice) was the same amount. 

The chips and salsa were very good. Service was brisk and attentive. The audio system had a great music mix including Frank Ocean and Digable Planets.
