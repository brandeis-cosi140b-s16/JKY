located in aria.. very underwhelming experience.. $12 margarita quite acceptable.. $30 chile verde way too lacking in tenderness.. brother in laws steak picado way too chewy..  my knife and fork kept slipping off my square shaped plate... very frustrating.. wifes carnitas were just about acceptable but very dry off the bone... sorry javier... need to work on your waitressing and seating staff also..
