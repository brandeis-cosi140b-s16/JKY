Excellent choice for Mexican at the Aria hotel. Started with the cheese fondue appetizer with corn tortillas and it was fantastic. Chips and salsa very good. Had a seafood enchilada and shrimp taco for entree and it was excellent. Service was just ok but food so good I'd still give it 5 stars. Affordable for Vegas prices, certainly cheaper than steakhouses and if you love Mexican this is a great alternative.
