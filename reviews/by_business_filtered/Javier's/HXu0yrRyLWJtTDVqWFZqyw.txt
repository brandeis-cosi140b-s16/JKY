Decided on mexican on my last night in Vegas, was going to go to Picasso but decided it was a bit much after almost a week in Vegas.  Just wanted something simpler!  
Loved it!!  Great atmosphere, ambiance, and vibe!!  I went with my girl, but their was all kinds of groups as well!! 
Drinks were great, my girl had a jalape√±o margarita and a aroma de mujer margarita she loved them both!! 

Had the queso as an appetizer was great.  We also enjoyed the mole and steak fajitas.

Great place for Mexican, with a great environment.  Our server luis was outstanding!
