Went with a group of friends last night for dinner and was totally disappointed. We raved about this place because we've frequented the one in New Port Beach. Surprisingly our wait to be seated wasn't that long but getting our food was a whole another story. We waited for fifty minutes until our food came and then service became nonexistent. My wife tried mentioning to the waiter about how long the food took and was basically told if we wanted him to take our food back and ordered cancelled. Lol. Crazy. What do u do. Needless to say I know I won't be going back there and. I'm sure neither will our friends.
