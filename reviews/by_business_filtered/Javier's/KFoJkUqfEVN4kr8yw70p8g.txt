For a city where everything is bigger, the portions were surprisingly on point at this establishment. 

The bartender was very forthcoming in letting me know what his favorite salad was which turned out to be a great recommendation, and he also recommended a reasonably priced aÑejo tequila to sip on, which I appreciated. 

The salad that was recommended was the Ensalada de Salpicon. The ingredients were really simple, and I was afraid perhaps too simple, but when it arrived, it was perfectly seasoned. The chicken was marinated as well as the cabbage itself and shredded, not wedges of cabbage as I was afraid it would be (you know how sometimes presentation is so focused on the aesthetic value that to eat it takes a village - it wasn't the case here). 

The tequila also turned out to be delicious. I asked for a nice, sipping tequila and hoped for one that wouldn't cost me $50, and the Azunia Añejo came highly recommended, and throughout the meal, deeply enjoyed (yes, my feeling about tequila can come off as sexual). 

Even though this was the most expensive $^&%&^$ cabbage I've ever had, I know it's Vegas, and needless to say, I wouldn't expect them to leave money on the table when everyone is charging really expensive prices. That's the only reason they didn't 5 stars (cause they weren't a "bargain"). 

If you like Mexican Food but can't make it down to Diablo's or wait for 20 hours to get seated, Javier's offers a chic and trendy experience with modern Mexican cuisine that's not ostentatious or overly priced.
