No, you're not going to find any taco specials here. But yes, you can get your polished $20 tacos and eat it in a swank dining room. 

Hate to say it, but my expectations going in were pretty low. The chatter on Javier's was  "over-priced" "not worth it" "underwhelming" "not real Mexican food." How else was I to feel? After eating there not just once but three times, I'm happy to say that Javier's isn't so bad.

My Mexican friends are gonna kill me, but I actually like the food here! The selection isn't unique. You've got your usual meats, tacos, enchiladas, etc. Ingredients and recipes aren't creative masterpieces but the menu is easy to navigate and won't confuse you. The food tastes cleaner here--which can be expected. Meats and other ingredients are of a higher calibre and it really shows in the flavor. I can vouch for the Carne Tampique√±a and the Cabo Azul. And since everyone's #1 question is "is the Carne Asada worth it"... No, it isn't. Not to say it isn't delicious but like kobe beef, I'm 99.9% sure its a gimmick to add intrigue. It worked on 2 of my friends so far!

Total date spot for sure. Its got the expensive, swanky feel without being overdone. The dark woods and leathers add to the luxurious ambiance but still make it warm and comfortable. The bar is under this massive rope chandelier and be sure to check out the world's largest chainsaw sculpture. It's actually pretty cool.

Service is up to fine-dining expectations and the bartenders are excellent. They've got a huge selection of tequila bordering the lines of ridiculousness. Some of them go up to $2,000. Of the ones I've tried, I highly recommend the Clase Azul. Sweet, smooth, and relatively reasonably priced at $20. I don't usually get mixed drinks, but they make a mean margarita. They run around $17 (if i remember correctly). I had one with cucumber and lime which was nice & refreshing.
