This restaurant is NOT baby friendly. A towel lady in the bathroom told me I could NOT change my babies diaper, so I was forced to change it at the dinning table. This is very insulting to all mothers out there, and their customers. I'm sure the next guest at our table would love to know that there is possibly poop left over from my babies dirty diaper. Thank you Javier's for showing your true ignorant colors.
