This was recommended by my sister-in-law and it was the best meal I had in Vegas. It's located in the middle of the Aria casino, but once you're inside, it is very intimate.  The service is impeccable and the food is outstanding! The decor is amazing, lots of skulls, but they are hidden in a not in your face kind of way.
We ordered a couple margaritas and one was better than the other. I liked the jalape√±o one the best!
We ordered a tuna ceviche for appetizer and it was outstanding, very fresh and very delicious! For our main course we ordered the Carnitas and Cabo Azul ( lobster enchilada, crab chili relleno & shrimp taco). The carnitos were the best I ever had, crunch on the outside, moist on the inside. The seafood was very fresh and i can't even decide which one was better. 
If you are ver in Vegas, this place is a MUST to check out!
