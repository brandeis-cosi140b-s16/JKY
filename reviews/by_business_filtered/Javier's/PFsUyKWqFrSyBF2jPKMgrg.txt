I've been wanting to try Javier's forever and finally got my chance. I got the chicken enchilada and chicken taco with rice & beans. The chicken was so tender. The taco with the Monterey Jack cheese made the taco even better then it was already. Oh and the Spanish rice, oh so good. I can't wait to eat here again, might be tomorrow :-)!
