3.5 stars if I could. Got a comp credit to this little gem inside Aria. The place ain't no taco bell, with beautiful decor and a nice "liquor tree". Very intimate and inviting atmosphere. This upscale-ness is certainly reflected in the price with many, entrees wavering around $20-much more than you would expect from a typical Mexican restaurant. 

Free chips and salsa-Salsa was a little hot and that basket of chips was huge!

Didn't get to try any entrees since we were stuffed already from a pre-dinner. But we did get drinks and dessert.

Mango and strawberry margaritas---but their mango margarita was delicious! Blended nomnomness.  

Caesar Salad-Caesar salad dressed up with little tortilla chips...Tiny, tiny portion. Not worth that dough my friends. 

Also tried the flan and the fried ice cream. The flan was good, creamy and not too sweet, but I'm more used to a creamy, coffee flavored Vietnamese flan. The fried ice cream was much different than the tempura kind you find at Japanese joints. Vanilla ice cream covered in some kind of nuts in a fried bowl that was cinammon-sugar dusted. 

Service was EXCELLENT. So kind and attentive. I would come back just for the service.

But that price...2 margaritas + 1 salad + 2 desserts = $60. Welcome to Vegas.
