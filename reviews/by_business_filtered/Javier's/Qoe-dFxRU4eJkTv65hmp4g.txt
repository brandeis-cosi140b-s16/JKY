This place was terrible. I will start off by saying it got one star because yelp requires a star, that and their salsa was good. We had to wait a long time to get in but not the worst situation, it is Vegas on a holiday weekend after all. My husband and I ordered the carne asada. We were so excited to get the full flavor one typically associates with carne asada with a traditional steak....well forgive the Vegas pun, no dice. See what I did there? 

I ordered medium well, both steaks came out bloody, as in medium rare. We had waited almost an hour, I wasn't about to send it back and wait even longer. This is a 50 dollar meal per person for an improperly prepared, tough, flavorless steak. I have had much better prepared and flavorful steaks from outback. 

Side note to the servers, give a steak knife when serving steak. This way when you serve tough steaks, your patrons fingers won't hurt when trying to cut their food. 

Had the food been incredible, I would have said well worth the money. Food sucked, service not that much better. I would AVOID!
