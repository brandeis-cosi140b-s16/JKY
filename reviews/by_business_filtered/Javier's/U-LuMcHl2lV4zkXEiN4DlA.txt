My husband and I just had a wonderful experience at Javier's last night.  When we arrived, we were immediately seated.  I loved that every seat is a great seat. Most tables have booths.  Our server Ciara was so sweet and took care of us with no delay. My drink was absolutely perfect!!! Pricey but perfect! We ordered the costillar de Rez.  OMG it was so amazing. The meat melts in your mouth! Overall this place offers gourmet Mexican food.  It is on the pricey side but to me it's worth it!
