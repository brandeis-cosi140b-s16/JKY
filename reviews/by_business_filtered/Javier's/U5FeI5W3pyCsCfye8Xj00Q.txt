We were in the Aria looking for the buffet that we thought existed since a lot of the signs inside pointed to their location, but alas, it is not open yet.  We ran into a gentleman coming down the stairs who said he worked at Javier's if we wanted something to eat!  We all decided we could go for Mexican, so we walked on over.  

Let me start off by saying the food was amazing!  We all loved our food.  The chips and salsa were very good!  Well, the salsa for sure!  It was so good, we all had to stop eating them to not spoil our appetite for our entree!  And not to mention, the chips and salsa were never ending!  Very good!  I ordered the 2 seafood enchiladas and they were delicious!  Two of my friends ordered the Cabo Azul and loved it!  Even our friend who ordered the quesadillas loved them!  And we have all had the good, the bad, and the ugly of Mexican food!  Javier's is definitely in the GOOD category!  

The restaurant was huge and very nicely decorated!  Very dark, but very sexy!!  We loved it!  Our server was on point, we had no complaints there!  The prices were kinda inflated, but it is the Vegas strip, so what would you expect!  Even the bathroom attendant was nice!!  Totally loved my dining experience at Javier's!  One of the best meals we had in Vegas!!
