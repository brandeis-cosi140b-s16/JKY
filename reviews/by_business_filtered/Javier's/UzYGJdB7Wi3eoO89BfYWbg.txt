Loved it!  Went there with my boyfriend this past Saturday evening.  I did call for a reservation earlier in the afternoon and got in with no problem.  As our day progressed we realized we would not make it by the reservation time.  I was able to call and change it to an hour later with no problem.  That said, when we arrived at 8pm...the place appeared pretty much full.  
We were seated promptly in a nice big, round booth...and from the moment I tasted the salsa for the chips....I knew this was going to be good!  The salsa had just the right mix of flavors and a lil kick at the end.  
I am a big Mexican food lover.  I ordered enchiladas rojas..one chicken and one cheese.  Yummmm!!  My boyfriend is not nearly as much into Mexican food as I am, but this place had more than enough items on the menu that you would not find at a typical Mexican restaurant....so he had lots of options.  He went with the rib-eye(Filete Ladrillo)...and loved it!  
This will definitely be one of my go-to places whenever I visit Vegas!
