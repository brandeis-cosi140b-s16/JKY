This place is DELICIOUS!!! We stayed at the Aria and ate 3 of our 6 meals here! The chips and salsa set the tone of any Mexican restaurant in my opinion. This place does not disappoint in that department! Crispy, extra crunchy chips and very flavorful, spicy salsa. 

One meal was seafood nachos, the next seafood quesadillas, and lastly seafood enchilada trio.  Yes, seafood galore, I know. But it's fresh and tasty. The bar location is perfect to grab a bite or sit in the dining area and relax. 

I don't understand why some people think this place is pricey. We pay these prices in Chicago. The portions seemed normal to me, not small. Perhaps it's just various demographics, but I recommended this place to anyone who would listen and even to some who wouldn't! 

I know this place from Southern Cali and its just as good in Vegas. A must if you're staying at Aria and check it out if you are just in the area. I will definitely be back!
