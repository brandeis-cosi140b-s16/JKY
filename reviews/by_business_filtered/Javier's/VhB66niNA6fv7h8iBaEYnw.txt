Â¿Tienes Hambre?

I enjoyed the ambiance at Javier's authentic Mexican restaurant this afternoon. The low lighting was great (even though I dined with a girlfriend). The chips and salsa is spicy and delicious. I ordered the Cheese Enchilada & Chicken Taco (from Combinaciones & Mexicanas) not as flavorful as I hoped but I may come back in the near future to try another dish. Overall great experience!
