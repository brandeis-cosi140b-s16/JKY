Seriously, I think this is some of the best Mexican food I've ever had, and my husband agreed!  

Javier's is pretty new restaurant in the Aria, and it is absolutely gorgeous.  Think upscale with old macabre carvings, candlelight, and dark wood.  Sit in the horseshoe-shaped booths if you can - very romantic!

They started us out with chips and salsa - the chips were still hot and the salsa was perfection!  You can tell a lot about a place from the salsa.  I wish I could have tried a cocktail (and I suppose I could have) but it was noon and I still hadn't had my morning coffee.  In hindsight, go for the cocktail.  Chips and salsa + coffee = weird.  Chips and salsa + a margarita = just right.  

My man had the Cabo Azul combination plate, and I filched more than a few bites.  Just the right touch with seafood and sauces!  I had the chile relleno with picadillo and that was also delicious.  The beans and rice were not an afterthought, either - they stood out on their own with the right seasoning and flavor.  Loved it!
