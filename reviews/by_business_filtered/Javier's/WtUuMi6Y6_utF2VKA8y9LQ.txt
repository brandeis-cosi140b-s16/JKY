Hey Javier's in SoCal. You should be embarrassed to have your name on this debacle.  Even if they hadn't been 20 minutes late on our reservation and the serviced hadn't been bad and they hadn't  stuck our group in a make shift table in the corner, the food still sucked. I had the $30 lobster enchiladas, which are great in Newport Beach, and I couldn't taste lobster and they were way too salty.  No one in our group had a meal better than mediocre.  Total disappointment. I'd never go back when the are so many good restaurants in Vegas.  AVOID!!
