Beautiful, beautiful bar. I absolutely adore the decor - very unique, very inviting, very cozy. 

They have a great drink menu selection, especially for a tequila lover like myself. However, I did get the jalapeno margarita and it was soooo spicy (too spicy for me, and I usually enjoy spicy jalapeno drinks). Over the course of close to an hour I only had a few sips. The bartender even dropped by to give my friend (almost done with her drink) a free drink (with no explanation). I should have spoken up, but I will opt for a nice glass of wine to enjoy this space next time.
