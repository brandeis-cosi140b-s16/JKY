Just ok in terms of my dinner plate. 

Came here for dinner with friends during my b day weekend celebration. We did not set a reservation and the restaurant was accommodating. Our party of 4 was led to a dark lite booth. It's very dark so watch your step if sitting in the booths. 

The service was great and our food arrived quickly! I was surprised to see that they offer chips, salsa, and guacamole free! Yum!  The specialty cocktail menu had interesting margarita drinks. I sampled the Jalapeno margarita one of our party ordered and it was tasty. For entrees we all ordered something a little different. I ordered the Fajitas de Carne o Pollo it was just ok.  As for the rest of the party everyone really enjoyed their entrees. 

I do not think I will come back while visiting Aria or Vegas really. I'll stick to having Mexican cuisine back home in Texas.
