Absoultely love this place !!! This review is only for the bar area. Every time i'm in vegas i have to make a quick stop at this bar. The tamarindo margarita is my favorite !!!! However, if you want to do a good meal you have to try the tablita, which has grilled steak/chicken/carnitas and 4 different salsa beans and rice. it is more then enough for 2 - 4 people. So delicious i highly recommend.
