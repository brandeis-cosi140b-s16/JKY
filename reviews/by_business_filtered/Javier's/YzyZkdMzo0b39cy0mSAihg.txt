We have Javier's here in So Cal so I was curious if the one at the Aria would stand up to what I expect from Javier's and it did! I LOVE their chips and salsa and I can't stop with the Pina Margrarita (margarita with muddled pineapple) - I'm craving one now! Last visit I had the cheese enchilada and crunchy beef taco combo... great meal! 

We had a party of 8 for a bachelorette party and they were very accomodating. Our reservations were on time and our server was great! It was one of the girls birthdays so to make sure her birthday didn't get over shadowed by the bachelorette party we had arranged for a birthday cake to be delivered there (from a separate baker in the Aria) and it was ready as a surprise with a lighted candle after our meal. There was a cake cutting fee per person of about $4 per person I believe which I already knew so that didn't come as a surprise. 

Great experience, food, and cocktails - exactly what I expect from this swanky Mexican restaurant!
