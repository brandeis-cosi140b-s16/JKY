Mediocre food in a very noisy environment.  You don't come hear to talk with friends -- you come here to YELL at friends.  Still, if the food was excellent, you might put up with it.  My fish was below average and a bit rubbery.  My friend's fajita came late and was pretty cold.  There must be better places in Vegas.
