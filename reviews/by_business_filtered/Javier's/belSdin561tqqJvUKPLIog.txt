Enjoyed Javier's A LOT!! We got a round of the pomegranate margaritas and they were soo good! Almost addicting, until you realize the price! They are from Crystal Cove and now on the Las Vegas Strip, so the pricing is understandable, but Javier's would be a million times better if the prices were a wee bit lower!! 

I had steak fajitas! For the most part they were nearly amazing, as was our experience! The vibe is fun especially the later it gets. 

Being from Las Vegas we were so happy to hear they opened one in City Center and are happy to say we will make the drive to the strip for this wonderful Mexican food!
