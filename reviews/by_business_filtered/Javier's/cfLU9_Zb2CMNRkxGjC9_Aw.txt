Well what can I say other than I paid $22 for the smallest split breast chicken I have ever seen. Not impressed thought Javier's would translate in Vegas from Oc but epic fail. We sat in the bar area and our server was out performed buy the bus boy. Sad to say because we love Javier's in Newport and irvine.
