NOT RECOMMENDED 
--------------------------

SERVICE - Mediocre 

* Slow to take order and very slow to deliver food. 
* Had to get up and ask were the meal was.
* Food delivery was ultimately staggered - leaving others in the party to wait.

* Management did not care and did nothing to rectify the situation. Blamed the kitchen.

FOOD - Passable

* Guacamole is very small and bland for the price. 
* Margaritas are weak.
* Enchilada tasted good but was cold in the middle.
