If i could give this place more than five stars I would.  Very nice place, food is amazing and every Margarita is out of this world!  My favorite is the quesadilla de mariscos.  And laguna Rosa Margarita.   Can't get any better than that.   Only down side to this place is you get drunk here and the craps table is right next door to lose all your money! Lol
