Hands down best Mexican food in las vegas!!! It is on the pricey side for mexican food but the taste makes you forget any that about that price.  The Cabo Azul must get! You get a lobster enchilada, shrimp and crab chile reno & lobster taco so great! My friend my 3 enchiladas 1 shrimp, crab and lobster she said it was beyond delicious. The cucumber margarita was devine! My friend got a mix of mango and strawberry together it was pretty good. The service excellent!  So fast and checking on you never without nothing . They put your food in the container for you which was cute.  I will hands down be back. Thank you Javiers for a wonderful evening
