We just had a party of 6 dine at Javier's.  The whole reason we went was that so many friends recommended, however we were disappointed with the food.  The service and atmosphere were excellent,, however none of us thought the food was much better than what you would find for a fraction of the price at other Mexican restaurants.  Most of the food was acceptable, with the exception of the beef tacos, which had no flavor, and the beef was quite dry.  Not a restaurant we will return to.
