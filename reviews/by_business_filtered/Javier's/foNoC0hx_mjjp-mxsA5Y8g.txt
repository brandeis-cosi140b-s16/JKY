OK it's expensive and loud BUT it's Vegas get over it. The food is cooked to perfection.    The service is excellent, not surprisingly. The decor on one of the far walls reminds me of Dante's Inferno, so beautifully carved. I have eaten here 3 times over 1 year and it's consistently high quality. BTW use your cell phones light to read the menu, you'll know what I mean when you try and read the menu
