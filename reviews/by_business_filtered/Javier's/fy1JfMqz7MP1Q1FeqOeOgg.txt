Went with my wife and friends. We have been to the Javier's in Newport Beach and it was very good so we expected at least the same. We live in Vegas and dine out a lot. Javier's is really decorated very nice. Waiter brought us menus. It was so dark in the restaurant that we had a hard time reading the menus. The waiter came by and gave us a flashlight. We ordered guacamole . I've had better guacamole out of a plastic container from a grocery store. You'd think a high end Mexican restaurant would know how to make guacamole. I ordered Carnitas. It was very good. My wife and friends ordered tacos and enchiladas . They all commented there food was average. Service was so-so. Not great but not bad.
I thought the prices were very high for what we ordered. Will not eat there again.
