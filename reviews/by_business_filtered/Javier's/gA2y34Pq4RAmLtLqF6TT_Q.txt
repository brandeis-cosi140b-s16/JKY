My wife and I were hanging out at the Aria, and decided to give Javier's a try. I love good Mexican food. 
We were seated in a nice section of oversized booths that made it feel nice and private. 
The waiter came and took our drink order and so we both ended up with the organic margarita. Delicious. 
We ordered the shrimp ceviche for our appetizer and I don't really know what to say about it other than it was the worst ceviche I have ever tasted. Or should I say not tasted. It tasted like they just got some frozen precooked shrimp and then cooked them again and then sprinkled a little lime juice on them. It was weird. Then to make it even more weird the server placed a bottle of tapatio next to the dish almost as if he knew it needed some flavor. Yea that tapatio came in handy. 
For dinner I had the mole verde, and it was good. My wife had a filet off the grill with a little chipotle cream on it. It was good too. 
I think the ceviche just threw me so out of sync that the place never really recovered for me. 
Nice place. The dinner plates we had were good. Service was great and drinks were great.
