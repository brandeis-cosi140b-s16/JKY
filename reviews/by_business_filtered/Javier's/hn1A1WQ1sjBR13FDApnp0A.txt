This place came highly recommended by my friends in California. It was a hit! Of course everywhere you go in Vegas you are going to pay high prices for food and especially drinks. There was just something about this place's atmosphere that fit me. I totally loved the feel in the Aria Resort, but most likely would never stay there unless they had some kind of a deal. But, certainly worth walking here and enjoying your evening.
