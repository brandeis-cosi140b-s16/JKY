We came on for an event and they had appetizers out for us. It just wasn't very good as it looked like it would be but that could be because it wasn't the other foods we saw on menu. They something like a nacho chip with chicken and pico on it (weird flavor and texture with those two). They also had like melted cheese and stuff in a tortilla that felt cold and old. I did however really enjoy their salsa. I gooped it out in spoonfuls per chip. I love it when the spice it up to be almost uncomfortable. Service and cocktails was great too.
