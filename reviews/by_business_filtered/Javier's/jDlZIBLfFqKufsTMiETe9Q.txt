If I would offer negative stars I could.

We live in Veer Tower. That's about 300 feet from Javier's. We've had their lunch and dinner several times. Food is good. 

Service? Not so much.

It's always been mediocre, but recently we had such awful service I sent an email to the manager explaining our lack of attention, lack of apology & pure awful business lunch there recently. I politely offered some recommendations to ensure future diners do not have the same experience.

I expected some sort of response.

I waited.

I called and left a message for the manager. Sent a second email.

No response.

They must be accustomed to tourists and not concerned with locals/reoccurring business.

We will not be back.
