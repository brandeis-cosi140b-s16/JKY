Overpriced is an understatement.  I was here for work and my boss paid so money personally was no issue but if i'm going to pay 50 bucks for carne asada it better be the best i ever had. It had no flavor or seasoning of any kind other than some salt?  The beans tasted like el pollo loco pinto beans and were covered in water.  I can't even believe the cost of something that plain.  17 dollar margarita?  Yeah i know its not authentic and all that but if i can get better mexican food for a 6th the cost off an east oakland taco truck.  There's a problem. Service was good though and the aria is a nice place to stay.
