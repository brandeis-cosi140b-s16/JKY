One of the most authentic places I've ever visited! Came here with my family of 4. We didn't have reservations on a Saturday night, which isn't recommended, but we didn't care to wait. We waited an hour until we got seated. Service was EXCELLENT! The waiter (which unfortunately I didn't catch his name) was so helpful and knowledgeable of the menu. They bring complimentary chips and salsa as appetizers and it's so GOOD! I ordered a chicken fajitas which was so yummy! My brother ordered the most popular dish on the menu, which was the lobster enchilada with a shrimp taco and he said it was phenomenal! I will definitely be coming back ! :)
