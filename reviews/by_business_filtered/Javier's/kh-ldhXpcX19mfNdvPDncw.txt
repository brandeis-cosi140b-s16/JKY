Started off with our waiter missing the salad that was ordered.  Then my shrimp and crab enchiladas at $30 were somewhat bland. I wouldn't think it was canned but the shrimp sure tasted like it.  Portions were on the small side since my 110 pound wife finished her meal which I can't recall what it was but she said it was tasty.  Nice ambiance in the Aria casino, we ate on a Wednesday night before the July 4th weekend.  Since great Mexican food is available in the SW/West you really need to take it up a notch in Las Vegas because there are numerous better places to eat there.
