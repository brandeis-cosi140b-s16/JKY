THE FOOD!  Let me list a few places that serve better Mexican food than this place:  Chipotle, any local taco stand, and 1000's of small independent Mexican restaurants.  The food here is remarkably average and super overpriced.  

We only ate here because we were in meetings all day and didn't want to venture outside of the hotel for dinner.  I can only deduce that captive hotel guests are the reason this place stays in business.
