Park @ Aria North Valet. While the company and margaritas were fantastic that's where the good times ended. I, for one, am never going back to Javier's. The food is just, ok and definitely not worth the price charged. We were told in advance that they were unable to split the check, which sucks when your going with a group of friends, but we went with it. Most of us had cash and paid accordingly, but there were two that used their cards. For some reason, when the cashier got the bill back she charged one card the entire $433. Completely ignoring the $350 that was in it. I'm unsure what she thought that $350 in cash was for at that point. On top of that, in trying to remedy the problem, they charged her the correct amount and double charged the other friend for her portion of the bill. When called over, the manager was in a word - INEFFECTIVE!! We were told that the $433 hold should drop from my friend's account....we'll see.
