Not a huge fan of Mexican food, but every once in a while I get the fever.  But I'm use to going to hole in a walls, not an expensive place like Javier's.  Located in the beautiful Aria, this restaurant is elegant and nicely decorated.  Service was extremely friendly and fast.  The food was very good, so I forgave them for the high price.
