I can't even explain in full detail how horrible of a restaurant this is. I've dined at the Javier's in Newport numerous times and always had such a good experience so thought the one in Vegas would be just as nice. The service at Javier's in Las Vegas is the worst I've seen in any restaurant. Not only did the manager Omar try to yell and waive his fingers in my face he was yelling at me telling me the cold shrimp with no seasoning or toppings was what I ordered and forced me to pay he was the rudest person I've ever met. Not only is the manager and staff very rude it took us over an hour to get our check and had to repeatedly get up to ask for it. Apparently at Javier's Las Vegas the customer is not always right. I'm filing a complaint in the am and am going to try to get in touch with the owner. I would never dine at Javier's Las Vegas again and if this isn't dealt with then I will never dine in the Newport location as well. All my friends will be told about this and Javier's Las Vegas will definitely be losing more than a few customers
