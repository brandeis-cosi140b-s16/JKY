Pricey--more than Cava and Carlitos, fine dining Mexican in Montecito and SB, respectively. 5 bucks for a small diet Coke seems gratuitous.  I think it's overpriced but truly innovative menu with well-executed traditional dishes as well. 

But it's very good. My verde enchiladas were 22 and perfect. I don't think it's any better than Rosa Mexicano, however. And the chicken enchiladas suiza are 16 or 17 there and you get rice and beans on the side. I don't know how prices at the Aria branch compare to the Newport Beach location, but since I avoid the OC like an STD, I will never know. 

I was at Fashion Island this summer and yes, that's a very pretty place to shop. But other than Laguna, I despise the OC except for the secondhand/designer resale which truly is outstanding both in terms of quality and value. 

But I didn't like anything about Newport Beach, not even the beach and couldn't wait to return to WLA and cross the border back from the Orange Curtain back to civilized Los Angeles. 

The spicy red salsa deserves all the praise it has received from Yelpers. 

I didn't get adventurous with cocktails and in fact, didn't even drink wine. But everyone says their specialty cocktails and various margaritas are noteworthy. 

It's wonderful food but you'll spend more than Rosa Mexicano in NYC or LA and, with a few exceptions (the lamb shank over orzo with the best greens you will ever eat), Montecito's Cava. 

Bartender--Tina, I believe but it could be Tara so I apologize if I have gotten it wrong--is not only beautiful but smart and a great bartender with a great personality.
