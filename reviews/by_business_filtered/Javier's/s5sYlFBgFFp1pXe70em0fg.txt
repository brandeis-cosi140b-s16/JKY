Bar and appetizers as we were in a hurry pre-show (off to Thunder Down Under for a shocker time with an "older" birthday girl.)  Margaritas and men were fresh and strong that night.  Traditional Javier's margarita on the rocks-hit the spot--$18 worth of thirst quencher, party starter!  Chambord margarita was too sweet for my friend, but I willingly traded for my second traditional.   Why the 3 star rating, you ask.  Well, the food was not good.  5 soft tacos on a plate for $24--tried 2 beef, 2 chicken, 1 pork.  Dry, flavorless, even with adding cabbage and small amount of guac, which was provided on the side.  Go for drinks.  Bar had nice, energetic atmosphere.  Others seemed to like dinner, so maybe that's better than our one sampling.
