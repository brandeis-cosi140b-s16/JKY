The food was so delicious and the staff was great! They have people in the bathroom to turn on your water and hand you towels. Not to mention a huge supply of lotion, body, spray, and perfume, so bring singles to tip. The only thing that is a small downer is they DO NOT seperate your bill so come with cash they will only accpet 5 different cards per table. I'm going back when I get there it is expensive tho so just FYI.
