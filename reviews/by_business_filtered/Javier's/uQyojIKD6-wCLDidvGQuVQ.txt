I eat at Javier's every month during my work visits to Vegas. This place is incredible and so is the original in Newport Beach. My favorite is the Carne Asada steak and the jalape√±o margarita. The ceviche with white fish during the summer is incredible. Sit in the lounge with Olivia or Suzie, or at the bar with Victor. And visit the wall of art carved by a chainsaw.
