Very disappointing experience. I have eaten at all the Southern California locations, celebrating four of my last anniversaries at the Newport location, but this was a let down. We recently moved out of SoCal and had come to Vegas to see friends. Since we loved the other locations so much we thought it would be a great place to celebrate my birthday.  The service was very poor from start to finish. It took over 40 min to get our appetizer and almost as long to get drinks. Our water glasses sat empty more than they were full and the food was just average. By the end of the meal we just wanted to end this disaster so we gave the waiter our credit card and it took another 20 minutes and a follow up to get it processed. Not a birthday dinner I want to remember.
