Javier's was exactly what I was looking for! I needed a fancy restaurant without completely going broke. I figured since it was Mexican food that the portion sizes would be generous, and I was right. We were celebrating a 21st birthday and I needed a restaurant with a upbeat atmosphere but still had some class to it and I felt Javier's was perfect. The food was delicious, and the free chips and salsa while we waited were enjoyable. My husband ordered a Pineapple margarita and I got the pomegranate one. You could actually taste the alcohol and it was more than just mix! When making the reservation, I made them aware of the birthday we were celebrating and they brought to our table a plate of Flan with a candle on it. The flan was sweet and so cute! In total for for our two entrees (a carnitas plate and carne asada salad) , 2 drinks and a taquito appetizer we just hit $99 and I was extremely happy with that price along with the service and quality of food.
