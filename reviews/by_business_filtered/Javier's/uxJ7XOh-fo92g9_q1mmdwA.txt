I even went through the trouble of creating an account on Yelp to give a review.  NOT authentic Mexican food at all.  I am a Las Vegas native and $12 for pre-made guacamole on a slimy piece of lettuce is insulting.  Got the chicken taco and enchiladas.  The taco was NO better than Roberto's!  Husband got the chicken suizas - beware of the red onions as a topping.  When onions are really old - they are very potent. The chips and salsa were so salty - had to order two waters.  Save your money poor tourists!
