Simply disgusting. I got the appetizer taquitos and had shredded beef as the filling. It smelled and tasted horrible that i immediately got nauseas. My husband and brother got nachos because they played it safe, and STILL it was disgusting. They had the chicken and shredded beef and they both sat there with an empty stomach than to fill themselves with what smelled like cow manure.
