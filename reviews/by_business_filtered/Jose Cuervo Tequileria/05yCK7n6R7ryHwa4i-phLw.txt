***Confession: I love tequila but have never been a Jose Cuervo fan.***

A few weeks ago I was stuck in the Southwest terminal @ McCarran Airport on a 5-hour layover & needed something to eat and drink (of course). Even though I'm not big on Jose Cuervo, tequila sounded good so I decided to give it a try.

I sat @ the bar & Raymond (AKA Raymundo on his nametag - LMAO) was my bartender/server. I had a really long time to kill (5 hours) so I figured I'd take my time deciding what I wanted to eat and drink. Everything on the food menu looked delicious & even though I was completely undecided, Raymundo was very patient with me. I finally ordered the taco salad w/ shrimp & it was absolutely delicious!

As for the alcohol, I explained that I don't lie Jose Cuervo & Raymundo thought that was funny since I was in a Jose Cuervo Tequileria so that's all they serve. LOL Hey said the margaritas are good, affordable, & come w/2 shots of tequila. However, since I had so much time to kill, I decided to indulge in a couple of double shots of 1800 Silver over ice & it wasn't bad @ all. I actually just bought a bottle of Coconut flavored 1800 earlier today & it's delicious over ice! So I guess I do like Jose Cuervo @ times. LOL

There seems to be mixed reviews about the service. I had excellent service & since I was sitting at the bar, I found out that most of the people who work there are pretty hilarious! They were cracking jokes, making funny comments under their breaths, & acting up like I do with my co-workers. Seems like quite a few of them have been working there for a long time.

Overall, I had delicious food, tasty tequila, & great service! I look forward to going back next time I'm hanging out in the Southwest terminal in LV.
