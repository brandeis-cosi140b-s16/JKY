Seat yourself works great at a place where there isn't anyone looking for a place to sit... at say, AN AIRPORT. The overly aggressive waiter made me feel like a homeless person and rushed me to make a decision. I got up and left. 

1 person tells hundreds, and your place is already a ghost town good luck suck!
