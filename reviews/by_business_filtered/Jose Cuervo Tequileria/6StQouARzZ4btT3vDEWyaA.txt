I had about forty-five minutes before boarding for my flight. This place is way under staffed. It is seat yourself, I sat and it took than ten minutes for the understaffed waitress to even acknowledge me and come over. She told me the only thing I could get in 30 minutes was a salad. Ten minutes of my life I will never get back!
