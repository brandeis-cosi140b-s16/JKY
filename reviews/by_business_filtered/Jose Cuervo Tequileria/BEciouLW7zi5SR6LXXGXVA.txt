If you aren't in a rush to catch a plane, this is a decent Mexican food place to catch food at. Just be prepared to search high and low for a table. And when you do happen to get a spot, order asap as your waitress comes. Took 10 to even get one, another 20 to order and then about 15-20 for the food. I had a taco salad with chicken that was really good for airport food. Dark red salsa is extremely spicy! All the waitresses were working their butts off so make sure not to complain and just be patient.
