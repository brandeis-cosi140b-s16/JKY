I'm going to be nice to this place because it is a regular haunt for me when I fly SWA through LAS since it is central to most of the gates in their terminal. I have always grabbed a seat at the bar and I have always found the bartenders there to be very nice. I see a lot of complaints about the waiters and that may be true... just one more reason to put your butt in that bar stool by the taps.

Let's get one thing straight first, this is *airport* food so your expectations for quality should be lowered and prices should be raised... no matter what. I grabbed a Subway sandwich in an airport once. $8.99 for a turkey sub that is $5 down the road from my house. So, yes, you will spend $10 on a beer or wine and it will be as large as a $4 pour at home. I don't like it either, but it is what it is when you're traveling. Don't want to pay high prices for standard grub? Pack a bag lunch.

Food here is OK for standard mexican stuff. The guac comes as a side for some dishes and I think that's more worth it than ordering that straight up as an appetizer. I usually stay away from the fried dishes, so I have had quesadillas and tacos there without being disappointed once.

You can get your drinks to go and they sometimes open up the very end of the bar for to-go drinks only... nice to be able to just walk around people watching with a brew between flights to kill time if you ask me.
