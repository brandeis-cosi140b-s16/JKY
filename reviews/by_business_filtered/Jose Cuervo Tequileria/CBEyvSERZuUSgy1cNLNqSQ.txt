Near C16 terminal. Came here to watch Broncos/Niners game before our flight.

Guac and chips: guac bland. Chips were essentially tostitos. 
Taquitos: best I have had. We ordered a second order
Wings: delish. Sweet and spicy w a hint of roasted chiles. 
Service: our server was good. Kept refilling my soda. 

Overall not bad while waiting for a flight.
