When I was looking in the restaurant there  was not anywhere to sit which I took as a good sign. Found a seat and it took 30 minutes before anyone came over. I understand it is busy but It felt like the staff made eye contact with me several times and still passed me by. Ordered the steak nachos for 16 dollars. Bad decision. They are on par with Taco Bell. The beer was $10. I could tell the wait staff was hustling and they seem anxious. They were working hard. Stop here for layovers frequently and was alway curious. Curiosity satisfied. Don't plan on coming back. Still waiting for my check.
