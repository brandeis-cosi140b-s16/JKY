Is it possible to give no stars, or maybe just an angry emoji? 

Can't comment on the food because couldn't get service long enough to order any. The waitstaff was SO miserable that it made me realize why some people don't believe in raising minimum wage. I literally think these managers go out of their way to find the waitresses from HELL because it was unlike anything I'd ever seen. Thank God It's an airport restaurant because I couldn't WAIT to leave Vegas after that experience. 

Good luck, and steer CLEAR of a waitress named Melonie.
