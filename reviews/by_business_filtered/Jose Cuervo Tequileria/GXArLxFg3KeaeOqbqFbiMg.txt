This was one of my worst dining experiences ever!  My partner ordered the Quesadilla and asked for them to hold the sauce and I ordered a hamburger.  The Quesadilla came with the sauce all over it and the hamburger was barely edible. As for the ice tea it was so bland that I don't think even a half pound of sugar would have helped. 
Wait time from ordering to it appeared on our table was close to a half an hour. Considering that most people are rushing to catch a flight this seems like an extremely long time. 
Go to Burger King, Wendy's, just about any place but this joint. 
Zero stars if I could it would be negative stars
