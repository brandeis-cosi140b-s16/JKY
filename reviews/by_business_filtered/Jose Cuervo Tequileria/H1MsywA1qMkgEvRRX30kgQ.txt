Avoid this place at all costs. Waitress actually yelled at us at noon on 2/16/12 when we tried to ask if it was "seat yourself"... There was no sign saying " please wait to be seated" .She didn't even look up from what she was doing with the forks she had at her station.. A second waitress approached us and then told us it it was open seating. Searched all over to find a table but could only find one that was literally piled upon with dirty dishes and money from a previous customer. We stood several minutes while one waitress circled around the table several times, and she finally stopped long enough to pick up the money and tell us that we could sit if we wanted but it would be a while before she could clean the table. We then watched her walk away and pick up menus and other items, leaving us to continue to stand there. So... We left and went next door to Burger King; not what we wanted but we were waited on and not treated rudely!
