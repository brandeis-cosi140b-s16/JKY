Service was good, though my food was not. I ordered the taco salad with no sour cream, cheese or corn (food allergies) and it came out with all three of those things on top. The food didn't seem fresh at all, either. My friends did like their food (quesadillas) so I'll give them a star for that. Would not come back here - look for other options in the airport!
