This place has a great vibe. One major major problem  !!! They only have fake non 100% agave tequila - #josecuervo 
Brandi was a nice waitress but not very understanding on us and how we feel. This is not a real Mexican restaurant so don't come here unless u want sub par food n fake tequila. Service is nice though! 
So expect to feel all warm n fuzzy inside n they got sports on!!  Ughhh so I'm gonna give it 2 stars. I'm feeling nice
