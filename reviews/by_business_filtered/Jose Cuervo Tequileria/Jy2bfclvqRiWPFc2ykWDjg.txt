This is a great place to relax while waiting for a flight. It's so good that in fact, once I lost track of time and missed my flight!! If I'm in Termnial C, this is my go-to if I have to wait for over an hour. If you're short on time, be aware, service can be slow, so let your server know from the get-go you're in a rush.

The food is pretty gosh darn good for an airport. They have blue corn tacos, and there are some smaller, lighter plates if you want to eat healtier and actually take the time to read the menu. And of course, Jose Cuervo is in the name. 'Nuff said.
