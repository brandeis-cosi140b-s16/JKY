Horrible service, bland food, expensive prices. Granted this is located in an airport terminal, but come on. We should have been tipped off when the guy sitting next to us paid, and left his plate almost completely untouched. Our waiter was horrible, forgetting to bring items. Definitely do not recommend!!
