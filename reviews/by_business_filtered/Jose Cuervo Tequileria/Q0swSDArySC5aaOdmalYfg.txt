Horrible Service.  Took over 15 minutes before we saw a waitress. When she came she was rude and impatient. When I asked her for a recommendation she rolled her eyes and gave me the menu. I'll just have chips and salsa I told her, she then gave me chips from a table that had been sitting out for others guest who had gotten tired of the wait and left. I should have left too.
