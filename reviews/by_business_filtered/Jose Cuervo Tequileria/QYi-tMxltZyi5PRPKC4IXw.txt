As far as airport food goes, this could be a lot worse. The service was friendly and the menu has a decent array of options. I would have liked to try the drinks on a different occasion (later in the day). It wasn't great qualify, but it hit the spot and was relatively cheap. 
There are two of these in the C teminal of the airport, but I think only one yelp page for them.
