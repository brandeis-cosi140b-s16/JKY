One of the many choices at LAS. The atmosphere is good young staff, a bit slow, learning but friendly. My order, the Chicmichanga is loaded with beef, nice portion size and good flavor. At $12.59, I was disappointed no chips or salsa, I had to ask. Mexican food for me includes chips, but we are at the Airport, another way to extract money.
