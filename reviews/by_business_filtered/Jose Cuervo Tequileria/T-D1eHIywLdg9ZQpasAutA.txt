I'm glad this place was an option while our flight was delayed this last week because of weather conditions. 

The LAS airport has a lot of choices ranging from overpriced subway, pizza hut, Wendy's, to popcorn. 

This place actually felt like I was paying for what it was. 

You seat yourself, the waitress was very quick even though the place was crazy packed due to everyone's flight being delayed.  Its nice to have the option of getting a margarita even though I stuck with water. 

Was able to watch sports center while waiting for the food which is a plus.  I ordered blue corn quesadilla.  It was very decent.  Lots of food for 10 bucks.  The service was quick.  Its right across from C14. 

I would come here if you want something beyond the overpriced fast food places.
