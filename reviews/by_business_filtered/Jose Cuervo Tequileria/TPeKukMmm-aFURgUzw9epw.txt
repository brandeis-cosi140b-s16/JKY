Three stars instead of two, because compared to the other dining options at McCarren, this place is a five star spot.

Compared to the world at large, well, you're better off eating just about anywhere else. 

I was recently faced with a six hour layover in Vegas, courtesy of my friends at Spirit Airlines, who are unable to get their $hit together. I figured I'd make the best of it and get drunk at the airport, and have a last go at Mexican food before heading back to Boston.

This is the kind of airport gouging that I sometimes find infuriating... no chips and salsa at the table, $10 cocktails, no side salads, etc. Other times I grit my teeth and say nothing, but with such a long layover and such terrible options overall, well, I really just wanted to get out of Vegas.

I ordered a double vodka soda ($15), a full-sized Caesar salad ($9, no side salads as an option here) and a carne asada burrito ($12 I think, maybe $15).  The drink was strong but nothing was especially good about the meal. 

Side note here: Logan Airport, in Boston, has a law against price gouging at the airport. Just because you're a captive behind TSA security lines doesn't mean you should have to spend $60 on lunch.

As I was eating the burrito, I kept thinking that something in the seasoning was really familiar. It took a long time for me to recognize it, but that flavor was Taco Bell, which I haven't eaten in about twenty years. So yeah, this isn't great Mexican fare. 

Another double vodka soda later, and a few bucks lighter, I was ready to take a nap in the long walkway between terminals. If there are any entrepreneurs looking for an opportunity to open a restaurant in Vegas that serves something other than Taco Bell beef or deep fried everything, I recommend scouting locations in this busy airport! It might be expensive to rent here, but if what you serve is even halfway decent, you'll make a killing.
