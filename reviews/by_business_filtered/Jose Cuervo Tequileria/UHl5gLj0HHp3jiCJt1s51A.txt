I am not a fan of airport restaurants, and this place will not change that. The food and drinks are average. I really do not like the fact that this place is NOT kid friendly. This airport location was a connection for me and my family and during the layover; my wife and I ate here but I had to buy food at the next door Burger King and Sbarro for my three kids. It was cool that they allowed us to bring in this food (our server agreed they are not kid friendly) and that is good or otherwise we would have just walked out. It's not that my kids do not like Mexican food, there is only a chicken quesadilla that would qualify as kid-food and $13 is an outrageous price to pay for the size (yes airport food is always too high).

I would come back here to eat...not a whole lot of other options without walking to another place in the airport....and no airport food is worth that.
