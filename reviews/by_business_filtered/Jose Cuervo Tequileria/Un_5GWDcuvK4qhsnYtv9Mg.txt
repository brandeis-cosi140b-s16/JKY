Pretty decent airport food with top notch service! 

Needed a spot to chill and get some work done before my flight, and got a gigantic Dos Equis and the Carnitas Smothered Burrito (at the suggestion of my awesome waitress). Hit the spot, got the work done, closed the deal. Not bad at all for a random vegas airport resto.
