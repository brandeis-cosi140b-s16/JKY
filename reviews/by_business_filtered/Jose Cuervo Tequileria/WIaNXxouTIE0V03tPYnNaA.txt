Food tasted pretty good (I had the chicken tacos).  The prices of course were ridiculous, but that's to be expected at an airport restaurant.  Service was a bit slow because it was really busy and the waitresses had to share 2 computers.  They should really have bussers so the waitstaff can be more attentive. Overall - OK.
