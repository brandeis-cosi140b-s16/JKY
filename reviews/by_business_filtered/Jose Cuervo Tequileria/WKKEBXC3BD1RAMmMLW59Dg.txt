Decent Mexican food for an airport.  We arrived late, around 9:30, closing time was 10:00, but our server was pleasant and friendly.  I had the green chili pork burrito, and well, I could barely taste the green chili.  The salsa was decent.  The beans and rice I left mostly untouched.  Like I said, if you stuck in an airport after many delays and need a bite, this will suffice.
