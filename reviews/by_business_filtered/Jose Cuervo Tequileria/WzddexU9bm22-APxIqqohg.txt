You know what? This place isn't half bad. Service is fast (everyone's got somewhere to be) and friendly.

Excellent sandwiches, which were fresher than we'd expected. Great margaritas - we had the mango haba√±ero ones. Super fun people-watching, too - as a relaxed traveller, it's amazing watching the number of tequila shots people will buy when nervous.

Yes, it's overpriced - it's an airport bar!
