what else was i gonna do while waiting for my delayed flight??? for all that know me, you know i'd be getting a margarita.

i guess it was ok. to me, it was a typical over priced airport joint.
i got the $16 margarita! wow, $16!
i sat at the bar and the bartender was pretty cool. i even got to see a little love (lust) connection developing next to me between 2 travelers. 

i probably wont be coming back here.
oh well....
