If I could give 0, or simply push a button and close a place, I would. The food was overpriced (it is an airport and it is to be expected), the beverages are the same (again, airport) but the service is awful.  I can handle expensive food that is mediocre in an airport.  I will survive. I cannot deal with service this awful.  I had 2 hours before my flight, ordered a burrito, beer, and chips.  I had to run to get on.  When I ordered I asked if it came with chips and salsa, and was told a small portion, at which point I ordered a side of chips and salsa "to get with my beer, because I haven't really eaten all day."  My beer took 15 minutes and came sans chips and salsa.   I asked again, and another 20 minutes later it came out.  Finally, my burrito arrived, and my beer was almost gone.  She didn't stop to let me order another, or even come check if I wanted one when it was gone.  I thought beverages were where establishments  made their big bucks?  I guess not. 

Finally, when I could get her attention (after being done for 30 minutes without her coming back) I asked for my check.  Then I asked again, and again.  I finally had to get up and walk up to the front and demand that they let me pay before I missed my flight.  It was ABSURD.  I get the feeling this became a self fulfilling stereotype.  Older individuals got far superior service, and I am sure she thought "young guy, probably tips poorly."  Damn right I do when I almost miss my flight after asking for my bill three times, and I only have one beer in me after an hour and forty-five minutes.  Give me service, and you get a good tip, give me that kind of service and you don't.  I travel through this airport fairly often these days, and will never be returning here.
