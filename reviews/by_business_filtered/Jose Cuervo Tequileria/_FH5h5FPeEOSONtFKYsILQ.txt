Has anyone else noticed that the menu conveniently OMITS the drink prices.  I figured a margarita would be an average price - NOT.  It cost $14 with tax - the same exact price as my food.  Obviously, intentional deception by the restaurant.  I ordered the shrimp enchiladas verdes.  Shockingly, they were good, but I could not eat the beans or rice - bleh.  The chips were also soft.  How does that happen?
