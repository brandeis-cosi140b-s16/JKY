I used to like this place.  It was a nice place to chill and have a drink before your flight.  They had a good blue corn taco plate I enjoyed a lot. 

Today was a different story.  The nice menus were replaced with photocopied paper.  No more brewed or fountain tea,  only in bottles.  No more blue corn tacos.  Or a taco plate. 

I ordered the three carnitas tacos on corn tortillas.  I was hungry.  I thought something tasted funny,  and noticed into the second taco that they were flour tortillas.  I mentioned it to the server,  she acknowledged the error,  and took the plate away.  And brought me a plate of two corn shelled tacos,  instead of three.  Which were tasty, credit where credit due.  

As polite as the server was,  she kept mentioning that she was leaving soon,  to the point of annoyance. When she brought me my check,  she kept hovering to see if I signed my tab.  

Their tap beer selection is nothing special,  and there are other lounges in the terminal.  

I miss the old menu and selection of beverages.
