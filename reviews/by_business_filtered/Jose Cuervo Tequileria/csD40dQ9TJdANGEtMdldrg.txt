The food here was disgusting. Trapped in the airport, options are very limited so we decided to give this place a try for breakfast. The bacon was clearly precooked, the eggs were subpar, and the breakfast potatoes were room temperature and very apparently not fresh. I'm sure they microwaved whatever prefeozen potatoes they served the day before. The margaritas were overly sweet and the service was sparse. We would have been safer with a fast food option as opposed to this sit down place.
