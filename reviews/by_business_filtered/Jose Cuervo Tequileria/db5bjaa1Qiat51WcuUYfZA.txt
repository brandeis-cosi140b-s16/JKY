Service always seems nearly non-existent. One waitress spilled drinks and salsa all over the floor and it stayed there for about 15 min before someone cleaned it up.

Food is overpriced and really seems like convenience food. The chicken in my quesadilla was cold (the cheese was melted though??)

The one good thing on the menu is the La Familia Reserva tequila. If you aren't here for that, sbarro is probably a better bet... :-/
