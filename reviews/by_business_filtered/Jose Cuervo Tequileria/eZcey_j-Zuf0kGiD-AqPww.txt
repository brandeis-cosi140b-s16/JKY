Don't be tempted by the outdoor decor and salty promise of margaritas, chips and salsa. This is certified ghetto. I am not sure what was worse...the food or the service. I mean the people (I hate to say it) are a few beers short of a 6 pack if u catch my drift. The chips tasted like stale free chips you get at a dive bar. It's not even worth my time writing about the rest of their so called food. Hide ur kids hide ur wives,..Save urself save ur stomach save ur money...Go to chipotle nearby.
