Yeah I can see why this place has such low reviews.
We were here last Sunday waiting for our flight that was a little delayed. We were a bit hungry and the outside of the place looked good so..... we decided to give it a shot. Unfortunately we checked out their Yelp after we ordered our food......

We both got 2 large beers and that was great, the waitress was a bit rude but in a funny way and was pretty quick to bring us the drinks. 

The food.......... Do you know those frozen Old El Paso burritos? They come 2 in a pack and you can get either the beef or the chicken?
Yeah, those are far better than the burrito I had at this place.
I ate it...... because I was hungry and I'm not super picky at the end of the day.... but once I finished it, I realized how much that burrito sucked!!! It was dry, bland, the meat was tough.... terrible.

Lastly, I'd like to comment on the cleanliness of this establishment. If the front of the restaurant is a reflection to what the kitchen looked like...... it worries me a little. It was filthy! So many dirty table all over the place!

Next trip we are sticking to Jersey Mikes.
