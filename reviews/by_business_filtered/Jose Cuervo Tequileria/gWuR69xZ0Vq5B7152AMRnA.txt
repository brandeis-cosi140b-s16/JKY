Wow, seems like I should have read the reviews first before dining here.  Goodness.  On the other hand, maybe it's best I didn't, as I never would have eaten here, and honestly, my experience was not that bad.

During our layover, the closest place to our gate was this restaurant.  It really didn't even matter what the restaurant was, we would've eaten here anyway due to its proximity.  Luckily, it was Mexican food which I generally enjoy.

Started off with guacamole and chips.  Did not expect to receive the biggest dollop of guacamole I have ever been given by any restaurant ever in my life selling guacamole.  Holy cow.  It was creamy not chunky, which is fine.  Slightly over salted (according to my husband), but edible and filling.

We split the taquitos and the chicken tacos.  First of all the taquitos were very good.  Pretty decent portion too.  Very savory, nice flavor.  Satisfying in the way fried Mexican food can be satisfying.  As for the tacos, we got them on corn toritillas.  The plate came with three, and again, decent portion and very satisfying.  I liked my meal.  Did not leave feeling disappointed as far as the food goes.  It tasted pretty fresh, and looked pretty on the plate.

The service could use a tweak.  It took forever to be waited on, and then forever to receive the check.  But it was extremely packed in there, so perhaps that's the risk of dining in an airport restaurant.

I'm not sure what others were expecting when eating here.  I suppose we were just starving and ready to go home, so were easily pleased.  I dunno.  But our experience certainly wasn't awful or 1-2 star worthy.
