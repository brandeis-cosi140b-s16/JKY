Terrible choice to eat our lunch. 1st the server Anthony stopped at the table and just looked at us without saying a word. We said we weren't ready to order yet having just sat down. He just walked away without a word. Then came back and said are you ready yet. Like where in the hell is the greeting and asking if we would like to order drinks. So we ordered and he just left again somewhat rudely and definitely unfriendly. When he came back he just threw the food down and walked away.  No utensils or napkins. We had to ask another server for the bill. Never saw this unprofessional server again. Thank God.  Oh... The food was just ok, salty and stale tortilla.  But then again it's an airport restaurant.  8/30/14  3:30pm.
