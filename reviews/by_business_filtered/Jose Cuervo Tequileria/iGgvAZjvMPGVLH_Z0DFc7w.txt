Short Story:
Airport food...what can you expect?

Long Story:
Last meal before leaving Vegas.  My co-workers and I got 2 nacho dishes and some chips.  It was okay.  I mean, it's bar food.  It held me over until I landed in San Jose to go eat real food.  I have nothing against this place, I'm just saying it's really average.

Verdict:
Meh...
