My flight was delayed and I just wanted to sit down and have a bite to eat since I hadn't had breakfast or lunch and it would be a long time before I could have any kind of dinner.

I looked at Nathan's Hot Dogs, since I haven't had them in years. Two hot dogs and fries would run close to $14. I kept looking and found Tequileria. There were tables and chairs. I looked at the menu and saw the prices were quite reasonable for an airport.

I ordered the chimichanga platter expecting a small microwaved burrito type thing. What I received was one of the largest chimichangas I've ever gotten. Along with tri-colored chips, rice, black beans, salsa, and picante. I expected the cheese, sour cream, and guacamole chimichanga to be mostly empty but it was pack with pork carnitas. There was no air inside it at all. 

The pork was tender and fell apart easily even using the plastic fork. It tasted good. If this was a frozen chimichanga that was just microwaved then I'd like to know who makes them and sells them. 

My server, Sonya, was also very pleasant and attentive even while being really busy. I never saw her stand still unless she was talking to a customer.

Water and the chimichanga cost $11.88. That's slightly more than a Sam Adams at one of the bars. For a restaurant dining experience in an airport in Las Vegas, that's kind of hard to beat.
