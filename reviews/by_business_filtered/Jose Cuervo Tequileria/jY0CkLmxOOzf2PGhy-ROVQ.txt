Um how do they not have lids for take out drinks? Thats already my first impression. The burrito I had was decent, but way too pricey. Usually, I don't buy food at the airports, but I was hungry, so it was ok. Our waiter took too long too. Not worth the wait, if you're on a time schedule with flights. The restaurant is a nice size. I'll give it that.
