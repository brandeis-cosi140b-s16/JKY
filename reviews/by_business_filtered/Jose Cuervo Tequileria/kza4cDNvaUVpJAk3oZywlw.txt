The service is some of the worst I've had, even for it being in an airport. Our server was rude and consistently rolling her eyes at everything, giving disgusted looks, and taking forever to do anything. The salsa was runny. The queso was just plain melted cheese. But, the margarita decent and that's all I really cared about at the time.
