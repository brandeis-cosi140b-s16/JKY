Good place to chill if you have a 2 hour delay. I actually met up with my sister here (she was leaving from Terminal C and I was at Terminal B). It is a far walk from Terminal B so get ready to get your exercise on. The service was pretty good. Our waitress was very nice and efficient. It was about an hour before closing time and she did tell us when they were closing but wasn't pushy about it. We ordered the Baja Shrimp Tacos and the Southwest Chicken Chopped Salad. Both were pretty good. Could've also been because we were starving from traveling all day...this was our stopover destination. If you have time, I definitely recommend sitting down and ordering food versus buying a sandwich from one of the convenience stores...those sandwiches were dry and flavorless. Not sure if I would ever have a chance to come back here but it's not as bad as I thought it would be.
