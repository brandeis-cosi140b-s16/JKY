This is one of the worst places I've ever eaten, domestically or internationally. It's hard to say whether the food or the service is the most offensive. The table was filthy and the menu covered with an unidentifiable yellow pudding-like substance.  After being ignored for 15 minutes, the waiter finally came and took our orders with an abrupt, hurried manner. He seemed annoyed when asked to wipe the grimy table. The dining room was filled with dirty un-bussed tables and the employees chatting in small clusters concentrating on anything other than customer service. When the food finally came, it was cold and held the dull matte finish of food that's set for awhile before being served.  The worst part is that the place seems unhygienic, a characteristic that is unacceptable in a restaurant. The place has a captive airport audience so it might survive but the management and owners have nothing to be proud of.
