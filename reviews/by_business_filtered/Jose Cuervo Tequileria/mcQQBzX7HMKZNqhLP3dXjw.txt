Our flight was delayed flying out of the Las Vegas airport so we were stuck at the airport for almost three hours. I got quite hungry and made my rounds to all the food places to eat but nothing seemed appetizing...when I came to this PACKED place, this is where I wanted to eat-plus it was right next to our terminal C14..I ordered the nachos with carnitas and let me tell you, for a minute , I forgot I was at the airport...MYFOOD WAS SO YUMMY - Great service too , thanks Angelina !!! Great way to end our vacation :-)
