$12 stella artois? $9 shots?  Welcome to Vegas (airport that is), but let's capitalize that this is both in Vegas and at an airport, so maybe I can't blame what's driving the price point.  If you get a beer though, you can have a shot for $5. Ok.  Food was also just alright.  Definitely nothing to rave about.  It's nice to at least be able to sit somewhere and watch sports if that's your thing as that's my hubby's thing.  The servers seem friendly.  Maybe we were getting their attention because we were sitting in the front, where the servers would come out from the kitchen, so I'd recommend sitting there or they might ignore you.
