This is one of the worst American Mexican joints that I have ever eaten at  Even the name sounds horrible.  Tequileria, really?  Rhymes with diarrhea.  

Food is on par with Taco Bell but at full restaurant prices, cant say anything about their margaritas since I didn't get any drinks but their food is just terrible!  The staff here is so un-motivated that when we sat down there were 3 tables by us that needed to be bussed and they didn't come by to clean them until we were done eating.  We were there for 2 hours......

Stay away...stay away.
