The Tequileria in Terminal C is NOT, I repeat, NOT a good place to go if you have a plane to catch. If, however, you're delayed or really early, you will be able to kill a ton of time here because the service is exceptionally SLOOOOOW

My server last week was in a world of her own, totally going through the motions, and clearly would rather be somewhere else. The food is not bad and they only serve Cuervo tequilas, but at least they do offer some other liquor and beer choices

With not many other restaurants available and a captive audience, this place is what it is and likely will never change, but Burger King and Sbarro don't serve beer
