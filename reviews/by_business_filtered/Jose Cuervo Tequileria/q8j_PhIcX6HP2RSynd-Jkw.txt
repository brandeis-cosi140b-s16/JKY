There is not a lot to choose from in this terminal. You are forced to eat here essentially. And apparently you are forced to eat tortilla chips and pay for them. It's the principal of it. If you give me chips I assume they are free. A small grievance but after a week of excess and freebies in Vegas this is a let down. 

The margaritas are not great. The service isn't anything to write home about. Just suck it up alongside your fellow travelers and wait for your flight. You should just be happy you made it through security.
