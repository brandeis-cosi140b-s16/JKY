The family strolled into this nightmare a few months back. I was actually trying to describe to a coworker of it's pure horror, so I had to look this delight up on Yelp. A quick search for "Terrible Mexican place in LasVegas Airport" is in order. BAM! Up pops Jose Cuervo Tequileria with little hesitation.

I honestly want to see who is cooking things in the kitchen.. Or if they even have a grill/stove/oven/any other actual cooking device. I am betting on a row of microwave ovens. Food prep consists of cutting up limes for drinks and opening prepackaged food to fling on plate.

With a cross country flight and a 1 year old in tow I strolled into this place with little-no hopes of getting a good(decent or edible) meal. Unfortunately I was still let down. Serious how can an owner/manager even allow this place to serve food? I am by no means a picky eater and have dined at plenty of lousy places but come on.... The fact that anyone can give this place over 2 stars should be shot. Maybe if you are just slugging drinks on the way home from a Vegas bender and didn't eat anything, perhaps a 3.

- Can I get a small beer? Out rolls the 40oz mug. My fault for not just ordering a bottle of beer... Rookie mistake.

- Chips and salsa ICE cold. Asked for warm chips. Sorry we don't have any warm chips. Um ok. Wife ordered side of quac. As others mentioned, not sure if avocado was an ingredient.

- Carne Asada tacos
As others have mentioned about the tacos they were pretty bad. Actually really bad.. Cold dog food served on a ice cold Costco tortilla. Thought for sure my cast iron stomach would be put to the test.

- Chicken salad
Bland and cold prepackaged chicken chucked onto a bed of the saddest looking vegetables I have seen. Lettuce consisted of those tasty white hunks at the bottom of the head. Green lettuce? Nah who needs it.

If your looking for a good conversation piece or you lost a bet, this is your place! If you are reading this you are probably too late and I look forward to your Yelp submission.
