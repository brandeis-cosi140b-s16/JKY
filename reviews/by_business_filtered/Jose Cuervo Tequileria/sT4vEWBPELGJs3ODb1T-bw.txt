Drinks, yes. Breakfast, NO!!

Coming back from Vegas and wanted to get a decent breakfast since I knew it'd be a while before I could eat again between the flight, the drive and other commitments. Walked past the bagel place and Burger King- went for this place thinking I could get a decent, sit down breakfast.

This was the laziest, crummiest breakfast I've had in a long time. For $8.00, I got a plate of "faux eggs" (you know those watery- light colored reconstituted powdery crappy things) with some cold shredded "cheese" thrown on top and a couple cold tortillas. Not good. Not good at all. Next time, I'll just get a bagel or even Burger King would have been a better option.

Go here for drinks. That's it.
