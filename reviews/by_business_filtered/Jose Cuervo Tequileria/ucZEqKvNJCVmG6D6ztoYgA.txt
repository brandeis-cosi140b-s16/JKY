Wow. Anyone impressed with this place must be coming here at 6 am and still be drunk. Service was slow and sloppy. One you get your food you will not see your waitress again. I have seen no less than 6 people get up and hunt down their waitress so they could pay their bill and leave. The table behind me for up and left in a fury as they had been sitting there for over 30 minutes without service.  Food is so-so at best. But what can you expect from an airport place.
