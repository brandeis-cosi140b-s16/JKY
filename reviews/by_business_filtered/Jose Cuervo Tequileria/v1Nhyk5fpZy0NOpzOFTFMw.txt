No bueno!  

Unfortunately bad decisions are sometimes made when I only have 35 minutes between switching planes while tempting margaritas are staring me in the face.  

Banana Margarita - There's no price on the drink menu, so my server said it was $14-$15, glad it only ended being $13.49.  The drink was good but came in a very small cup for the price.  

Chips and Guacamole - At almost $11 I figured, what the hey, it's going on the company expense report and it'll be my dinner.  It's the only thing I ordered and she brought out the wrong dish.  There was a delay in getting my receipt because she put in the right order but had to make a correction.  Instead she brought me Chips and Salsa, which was $6.49.  I said, "I actually ordered Chips and Guacamole."  She says she either take that back or she can add on a small side of guacamole for $1.89.  I don't have time for all this mess so I say, "Just bring me a small side of guacamole."  Well, the guacamole on the bill showed up as $2.89.  It was tiny!  Not to mention, it wasn't fresh made, nor was it packed a few days before at some local distributor, it was the canned stuff that was like a thick soup with no chunks of avocado.  The tortilla chips were like Mission Tortilla Chips, except triangular.  I hate Mission Tortilla Chips.  

If you want to stop here and get a drink, that's fine, but the food (not just my dish) seems to be lacking.  If you want to walk around with your drink, order it in a to go cup.  Las Vegas McCarran Airport is rad like that.
