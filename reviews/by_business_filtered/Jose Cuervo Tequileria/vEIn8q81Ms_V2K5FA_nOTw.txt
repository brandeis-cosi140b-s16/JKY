You can't beat the location of this place in Terminal C in Las Vegas airport.  We all know that the food is barely edible, but who cares?!  It's a nice spot to have a drink or something (simple) to eat while waiting for your flight.   The waitresses/bartender  work their you-know-what's off and are so pleasant.  Yes, they get slammed and you might have to rush them along a bit, but it's fine.  It's the airport and everyone they encounter is probably hungover, tired and crabby!!! Lol Hats off to them!
