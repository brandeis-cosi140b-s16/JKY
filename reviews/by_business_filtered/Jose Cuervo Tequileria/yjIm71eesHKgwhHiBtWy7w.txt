I had 2 and a half hours to kill so I'm glad that the airport had a bar with draft beer.  The food didn't look too great-- the person next to me was eating tacos but it had a weird smell to it.. like old meat.  I'm glad I wasn't hungry.. haha.  

I sat at the bar, which was pretty full and ordered a few Draft Stella's.  The beer was good and the bartender was nice.  He informed me that we are allowed to walk around with our beers in the airport terminal which was awesome.  I had the bartender put my last beer in a plastic cup so I could walk around.  Each beer was about $9, kinda pricey but it's an airport so I wasn't trippin.
