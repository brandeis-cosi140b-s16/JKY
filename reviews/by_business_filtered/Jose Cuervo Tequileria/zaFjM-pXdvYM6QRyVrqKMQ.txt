Let's see Burger King or this place ?The server option won out. I lost. I always rate food by whether or not I could tell what it was if I was blindfolded. Trust me with the food here there is no way you would ever guess. My eggs were more like, those were eggs? I still don't know what the pasty thing in the middle of my eggs was. My guess is they would say it's cheese my guess was it was wadded up wet paper. I'll admit that the bacon was bacon flavored but it was definitely more like bacon flavored pasta. 
I think my favorite part of the meal though was the service. 3 x they brought out my order. Trust me I wish I hadn't been served it the once I paid for. Then of course when you're ready to leave you can't find your server. I asked another server if she could get our check and she actually yelled at me because she wasn't.
