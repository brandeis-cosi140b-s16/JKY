Fun spot but blaring music inside a small concrete space doesn't work well. That said they have a decent 70's - 90's mix running on the night I was there. 

The chips and salsa were very good. Crispy chips and spicy salsa. My wife doesn't like it hot and they gave her tomatillo which was also delicious. 

She got a fish taco plus two chicken tacos. She liked hers and thought they were solid. I got the taco platter (spicy chicken, carnitas and carne asada. The asada was basically charbroiled and in would have preferred the pork and chicken to be more unique meat ingredients versus stews. The beans and rice we both fine and avacado ripe. The blood orange margarita was the bomb so that helped everything! 

I would go back and try some more street tacos and maybe a burrito and definitely sample the other margaritas.
