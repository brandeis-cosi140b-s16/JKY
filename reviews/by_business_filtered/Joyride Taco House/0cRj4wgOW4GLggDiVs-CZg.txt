Just tried this over the weekend. Went with a friend of mine and our tacos were yummy! Loved the hip/trendy d√©cor. We each ordered three tacos to get the free side. I ordered the carne asadas and one Baja fish and a side of beans. She ordered one Baja, one chicken, and one shrimp and a side of orange cucumber salad. I loved my carne asada, the fish was fresh but I wish it was more tasty. She didn't like her chicken very much, liked the fish, but said the shrimp was the best. We both liked our sides - actually she loved her cucumber side! My side of beans was very generous and could have been split between both of us. Service was efficient, wish it was a little more friendly but can tell they wanted you in and out.
