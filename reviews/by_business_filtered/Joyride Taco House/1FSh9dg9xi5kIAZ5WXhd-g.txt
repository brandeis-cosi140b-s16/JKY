LOVE this restaurant! First of all, visually speaking, the restaurant is so fun, colorful, and just pretty. Great staff who are ALWAYS so friendly! :) My kids (5 and 3 years old) LOVE going there for the yummy chips and food and LOVE the temporary tattoos they get with their meal ;) The drinks are delicious as well. The carne asada nachos are the BEST as well as their tacos (duh). Highly recommend!
