Great place. Great food. Great drinks. Great atmosphere.  They start you off with chips and salsa which I can't get enough of because it's all fresh.  I usually order the tacos and really like the chicken tinga, braised beef, crispy fish, and carnita. Carnitas is definitely my favorite and I think it's the most flavorful out of the bunch.  I've had a couple of other things off their menu as well, like one of the burritos and enchilada, and everything was good.  One thing I have to say is if you get the Mexican corn (which is also good) be prepared to have it on the cob, it's not in a cup, which is what I was expecting. I'm also big on mezcal so I always get the Naked and Famous, but ask them to make it extra smoky (i.e. with more mezcal) and it always tastes great. Atmosphere is nice and relaxed and we've always been able to find a bar seat or a table so you rarely have to wait (a huge plus) and service is fast.
