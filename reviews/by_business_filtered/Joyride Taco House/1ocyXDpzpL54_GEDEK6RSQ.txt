Not impressed. 

I realize its a holiday but maybe management could have planned better.. The wait wasn't ridiculous it just seemed like chaos everywhere, free for all if you will..

The location and concept are on point though a little over ambitious, it seemed like everything on the menu had one or two too many ingredients making it just a little over complicated.

The reason for two stars is the poor execution of a great idea.. EVERYTHING (nearly, pinto beans were piping) was Cold, eck!! Side of chicken, roasted veggies and tacos all intended to be eaten warm were luke warm at best.  It lends concern to the "danger zone" theory. And why so hot on the beans but so temped on everything else? Microwave maybe? Either way, ew!! Plus side my salad was cold but oddly closer to that room temperature feel (given over 100Â° outside cold to warm food is acceptable, warm to cold is just inconceivable this time of year)..

Lastly I feel like they were a little over priced for the size of tacos we received. Like tiny small, I'm all for quality ingredients but lack there of is kind of a slight at $3-$4 a PIECE.. 

I would be willing to give it one more try, but I won't be going out of my way if I have a choice..
