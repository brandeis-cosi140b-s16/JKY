The horchata and Frangelico with the Mexican street corn, chips and salsa were amazing. We tried three tacos - crispy fish, beef and ahi tuna; and a shredded beef burrito - all were tasty! Jessica and Andrew provided out of this world service! Ended the evening with Mo's special and while a little "liquified", special it was! Thank you Joyride for the treat of an evening out!
