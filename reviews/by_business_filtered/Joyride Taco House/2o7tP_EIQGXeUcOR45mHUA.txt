so after my last review which mind u I said I would be returning back and enjoyed myself there... Management still contacted me offered me gift card to return bc I wasn't fully satisfied w tacos I got.. wow first of all such amazing hospitality. So of course I accepted and went again and this time we had even more fun I love this place bartenders are so cool and knowledgeable and laid back. I ve never been a "regular" anywhere bc I like to try different things too much and no place has I guess has drawn my attention enough but I think joyride did it... Im just in a good mood when I'm there everyone's happy staff and guests. I Ordered cucumber margarita that was really good..I love anejo tequilas and Mackenzie suggested a new one I hadn't had b4 that i really liked. I think my first visit it was just some flook or it was my taste buds bc I tried carnitas again on my nachos and were amazing i kinda consider myself a nachos and carnitas expert bc I'm obsessed w both and I order both a lot! In addition got st corn my fianc√© is Mexican loves corn and a chef and he loved it!! I don't care for corn too much but damn I woke up thinking abt it today is all I need to say I guess and I don't even like corn!! So good on the cob and chz maybe lime on it idk but super good so I definitely definitely recommend this place it's chill fun and good food and service can't ask for anything more :)
