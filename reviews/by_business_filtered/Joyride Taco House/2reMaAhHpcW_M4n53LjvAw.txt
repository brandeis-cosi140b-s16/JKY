When my friend invited me to the Hale theater I asked her if she wanted to indulge in some light bites before the show and she agreed. Not sure what was over there since I live clear over on the other side of town I told her to pick. Amongst the list of fantastic new eateries right at the theater was Joyride.

 Not the biggest fan of Tex- Mex food it takes a lot to get me to want to try Mexican. I have only about three favorites and constant Mexican eateries I will go to in town and they are more of a traditional Mexican. With that said, I had heard how great this place was so I wanted to give it a try. The verdict? Thumbs up! They have a great Happy Hour, good Guac, and tasty street tacos. ( And cheap!) My Raspberry Ancho Marg drink was tasty and again, cheap! 

The place was packed though. On the way out and I got spilled on twice. Pretty tight quarters for sure if you sit inside. I guess that is part of the fun. I had a shoe that smelled like beer all evening. Oh yeah, the servers were all very nice. The food was delivered fast with a group concept. I like group concept restaurants. I'd go back. However, maybe  to the phoenix location closer to my hood.
