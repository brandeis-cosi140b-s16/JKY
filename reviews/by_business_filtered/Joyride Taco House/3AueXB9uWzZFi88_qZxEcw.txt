Seating was fast and easy on a Thursday night. The restaurant pretty full. The salsa was out of this world! The service has been excellent. Very attentive without being intrusive. The wait staff was knowledgeable and directed me to a Non Cilantro meal (thank you Jesus). 

The ambience is very original. Funky modern we will call it. The music was at a perfect volume. My companion and I were able to have a conversation without screaming and saying what every other word. 

The pinto beans are refried. They don't state this on the menu.

Chilaques looks delicious! My companion said it was in every sense of the word.

I had the Carne Asada taco. Very very good. 

They serve a really refreshing beverage called a Agua Frescas . Now we're talking!!! 

To sum it up delicious  and stuffed!!!!

Thank you good folks at Joyride!!!
