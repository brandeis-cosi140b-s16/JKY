I went here with a group of 7 and a set of twin infants. We sat on the patio. The manager and server were quick and very accommodating. Table service was fast on a Sunday night. The carnitas were amazing; the pork adobada was awful-- too salty and...gritty? It was strange. The server was generous in taking it off our bill. Roasted veggies has a spicy creamy sauce on them I didn't like, but I ate around it. I sampled the Orange cucumber salad, and it was refreshing. They make a decent Bloody Mary; based on feedback from the rest of the group, the margaritas and mojitos were a group favorite. 

The misters were turned on per our request, and the babes were happy and cool. 

Parking is godawful, but it's not easy to find it on Central on any given day.
