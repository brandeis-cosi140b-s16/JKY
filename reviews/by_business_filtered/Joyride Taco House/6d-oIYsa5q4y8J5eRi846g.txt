It is very rare for me to give a five but wow. This place is amazing. It started from the moment we walked in the door.  Everyone was very friendly and accommodating.  The environment was perfect. The music was loud but for some reason I didn't feel like it was overpowering. I was able to hold a conversation without having to speak loud.  You wouldn't think music in the background is important, but the music was hip to the times. The lights were very dim but that made for a romantic atmosphere.  The chips and salsa were delicious. Before the food even came I already had a 5 star review waiting to give them as long as the food was up to far with the rest of the experience.  The waitress was very friendly.  When the food came out it was the best food presentation I have ever seen especially for the price of the food.  It was as if you saw the commercial for food and it actually looked the way it was shown on TV which we all know is very rare.  The burrito was huge. The "Beast" burrito was packed full of steak along with fresh cut avocado. It also had pico de gallo and beans inside. It was very filling.  The chicken and carne asada tacos were amazing as well.  Once finished with the main course we had to top it off with some churros.  I couldn't find one thing wrong with this restaurant and I would highly recommend giving it a shot.  I will now be a regular from here on out.
