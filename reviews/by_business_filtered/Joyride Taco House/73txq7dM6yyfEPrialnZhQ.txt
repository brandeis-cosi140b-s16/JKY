So I have been trying to try all the cool new food joints in downtown Gilbert. Today it was Joyride Taco house. It was a weekday, so less of a crowd, always a good thing. Our server "Floyd" seated us quickly. we told her this was our first time here and she told us about how everything is Fresh,  home made . To start they bring out this crazy great salsa, I was blown away by its unique flavor. It was with a hint of sweet, citrus, spice, chunky, which equalled a explosion of awesome flavors!!! We had the lunch special. We each picked three tacos with a free side. The crispy fish taco is insane! The grilled fish taco a close second. The braised beef is good, but the fish is my favorite. My wife too loved the crispy fish and really loved "The standard" chicken taco.The Tacos are not big, but three of them was enough. Me and my wife shared a bowl of Tortilla soup, fresh, and soooo good. We will be back for sure, got to try other things, but it will be hard not to order the fish tacos again. Thanks to our very nice and helpful server, she made our visit even nicer!!
