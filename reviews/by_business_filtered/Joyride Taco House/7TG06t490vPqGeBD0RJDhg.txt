Staff/Managers could use a huge imporvement. Food is excellent but customer service is seriously lacking. My office placed a rather large order (15 people) the day before we needed it, and we were told to call back with payment, even though we were prepared to pay right then. We then called back 3 more times, and were told that the manager was not available, to try back again later. We called the next morning to try and pay for our order AGAIN, and surprise surprise, it was never even written down. It's now about an hour before we need the order to be ready. We order out often, and our business is usually much appreciated, but they made it seem like a huge hassle. We will never order from here again.
