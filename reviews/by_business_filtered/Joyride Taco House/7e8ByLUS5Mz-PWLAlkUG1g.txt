The food is nice. I found the portions to be rather small. The salsa and chips were fresh and tasty. The atmosphere is cute. This is more of a bar with tables, at least it seemed so the Friday lunch I ate there. The noise level was way to high for me. A table next to ours complained but I did not notice any change
