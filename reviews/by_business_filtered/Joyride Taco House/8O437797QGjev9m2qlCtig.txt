Great experience at this restaurant! I brought clients here for a work dinner on a busy Wednesday night. We were a party of 7 and had a short 10 minute wait, eventually getting a table on the patio facing Central Ave right in front of the fireplace! They cranked up the heaters, not knowing half the party was in town from Chicago and quickly turned them down at our request. The blood orange margarita was excellent, not too sweet but smooth. We had the cheese y m√†s (a chunky queso dip) which was awesome, along with ceviche (very good, light and not too acidic) and the guacamole (alright, but not in my top 5). The chicken enchiladas were very good with red and green sauce, spicier than I expected. The staff was attentive but not overbearing kept waters full and cocktails coming. I'd definitely pay this place another visit.
