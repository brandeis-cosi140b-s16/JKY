The owners of Postino, Windsor, and Federal Pizza have done it again!  The food is great, the staff is friendly, and the ambiance and decor were adorable, colorful, whimsical, comfortable, and stylish with a hint of sophistication. 

Favorites menu items include the Street Corn, the Short Rib Taco, the Baja Fish Taco, Minerva's Mix Tape salad (so refreshing and bright), and the Banana Pudding (the crust in the bottom is SO TASTY).  I also had the Bandit, which was kind of like a tamale plate.  Didn't think this was particularly unusual, but I loved their marinated pork - so good. 

This Mexican/Latin based food restaurant even has delicious agua frescas (with or without alcohol) and its own version of a Moscow Mule called the Mazatlan Mule, made with tequila and passion fruit puree. DELICIOUS!
