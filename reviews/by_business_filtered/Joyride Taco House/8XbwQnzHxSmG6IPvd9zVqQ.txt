Pretty delicious! We've tried the gilbert location when they first opened and liked it, so we knew it would be good. We came here with another couple to have some drinks and tacos. And boy did we have those drinks and tacos! Lol $58 dollars later, full of tacos and with a tipsy boyfriend it was time to head out. We tried the carnitas, shrimp, carne asada, and crispy fish tacos. All of them were seriously good. My malibu and pineapple drink wasn't something I'd order again...it tasted like I was drinking flowers, it was odd. But my man drank that along with his two long island iced teas which he said was different but still good. Fyi, in the 5 years we've been together I've never seen this man order anything but a good quality beer, so that was strange! After some hilarious and raunchy wonderings of what "white magic" was (remember, tipsy people) we learned it was a delicious lime aioli-baja type sauce. MmmmmMm. Also their chips and salsa are sooooo good! We basically all filled up on that before dinner. The only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is that their sides are very disappointing, nothing special about them at all and everything is a bit pricey here. We'd definitely be back. This is a perfect place for yummy food while you're having some drinks with great friends.
