The check-in/seating system here is ridiculous. We stood by 3 vacant four top tables while they made two old ladies in front of us stand and wait for 15+ mins, then they finally gave up and sat them at the table that had been vacant the entire time. My mom has a hurt leg and she had to stand and wait even longer because it was too hot outside. Then she all of a sudden they realized they didn't put my name in the iPad, so another two tables was sat in front of us. If it weren't for the good wait staff and food we would have left a lot earlier. They just kept pushing to send people outside and to the bar and saving the tables for special clients apparently. I should mention this was on a Saturday at 1:30pm. The food and drinks were excellent and for that I give it another star.
