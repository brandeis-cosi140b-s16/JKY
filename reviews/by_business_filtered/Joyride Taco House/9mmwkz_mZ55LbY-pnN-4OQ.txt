UPDATE: I had the Carne Asada Taco again.  Very good.  The cheese y mas was absolutely yummy.  The chips were on the burned side and hard, mixed in with a fresh batch.  We asked the staff and the whole batch was that way.  :(  I feel at that point, they should have made a fresh batch and not mixed the bad batch in them.  I got a watermelon Margareta.   If you like Solbe Life water w/tequila, you would like this drink. ;)  very light tasting.  I will give them a third
 try because some of this was very pleasant and yummy and I am hoping it was an off day.....plus the staff is really awesome.




I had a Carne Asada Taco and had them add cheese. They forgot that and I had to send it back. :(   It was a good taco.   My friend had the chicken enchilada with 2 different sauces.  I took a bite and I liked the green sauce better.  They were both delicious but it was just preference. 

I had so many people coming to my table, it was confusing who my actual "waitress" was.  I just grabbed the nearest staff member when I needed something.  They have a nice happy hour but the drinks were on the weak side.  I would like that for my drinks, lol but my friend did not.  Again, that would be preferences.  ;)  

The ambience is casual and friendly.  I liked the staff.  I would definitely go again.
