For starters, the place has a lovely atmosphere. We came in on a Saturday afternoon. They had the large roll up doors open, which allowed a nice breeze in, great way to enjoy a nice day. The service was quite slow. Friendly, but a bit inattentive. The complimentary chips were good, with salsa that actually had a nice kick to it. Now for the main foodz...

I ordered the Fila salad. Very fresh ingredients and nice presentation. Salads are about $10 a pop, then an extra $3 to add meat. It was good, but nothing to rave about. For $13.50 I just wasn't that impressed. BF ordered the Beast burrito, chimi style, with shredded beef. It was surprisingly bland.
