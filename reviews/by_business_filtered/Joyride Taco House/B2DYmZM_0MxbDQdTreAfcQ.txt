Location right in downtown Gilbert is great.  Layout with indoor/outdoor patio is great.  Stick with the taco's.  Nachos are SOGGY (i've had them twice...because i was hoping the first time was a mistake.)  I would encourage Joyride to review the "recipe" on the nachos and come up with a way to keep the chips crisp.  Hours are great as it is one of the only spots open late in Gilbert.
