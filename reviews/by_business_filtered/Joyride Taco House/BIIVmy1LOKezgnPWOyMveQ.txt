Great spot to hang out with friends and catch up on a Saturday night. 

The aguas frescas (with and without alcohol) were delicious, also making it a great place for drinkers and not drinkers alike. We followed the suggested mixings (ie gin and citrus agua fresca), and they were dead on.

The band was fun and loud but not too loud. 

We had the ahi stack, which tasted very fresh. And the chips were perfect. 

Would love to go back. Seemed much more chill and fun than the place (postinos) next door.
