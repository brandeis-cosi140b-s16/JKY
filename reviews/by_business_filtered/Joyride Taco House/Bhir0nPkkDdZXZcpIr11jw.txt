The ambience is very hip and the employees are all very customer service centric. The almond horchata was just the right amount of sweet and the blood orange margarita was perfect! The guacamole was fantastic, creamy with a nice kick! The chips were warm, which is always nice. The carne asada burrito was Devine! Best burrito I have ever tasted. Very rich and deep flavor and the tortilla was very fresh, perhaps made on site. The adobada and baja fish tacos were also very tasty. We finished the meal with the warm Churros and chocolate, which is heavenly! We will definitively be back!
