I'm so happy I finally made it to Joyride last week!!  The patio is awesome!!!  The restaurant has a unique vibe that draws you in and makes you smile!  The food is pretty good.  We're not talking gourmet here - its simple eating, but the flavors are good and its definitely worth checking out.  The Mexican Street Corn is AWESOME!!  This is definitely one of my new weekend spots for some daytime fun!!
