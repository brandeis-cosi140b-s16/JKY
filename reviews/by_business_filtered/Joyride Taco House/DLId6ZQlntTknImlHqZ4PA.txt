Awful service, hit and miss food.  It was a revolving door on the wait staff.  Our waitress showed her face to take our order then everyone else had to pick up the slack.  I had to flag down bus staff for drink refills.  The good taco was the braised beef and the rest was okay.  Really the service is what blew it.  Walked up to the manager to have him tab me out after waiting 10 min with a cleared table.  Then he forgot to return my card.  Not going back.
