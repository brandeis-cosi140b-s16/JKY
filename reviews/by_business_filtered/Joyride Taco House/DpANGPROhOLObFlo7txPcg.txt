Downtown Gilbert is trying to step up their game with all these new places to eat. if tacos are your thing Joyride is a great place to go. They have a taco for everyone and are happy to make a taco any way you want it. My fav is the shrimp and my hubs was the braised beef. The tortilla soup was delish. Nice atmosphere, clean, but service was a bit slow and I was confused about who my server was. Two nice outdoor patios. Ill go back....I like tacos.
