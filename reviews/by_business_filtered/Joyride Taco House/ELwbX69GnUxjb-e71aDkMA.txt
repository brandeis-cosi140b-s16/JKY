This was my first visit here and It was a good one.  I started out with the lunch special of two tacos and a soup.  For the tacos I had a crispy fish and a carne asada.  I added the tortilla soup as well.  

The carne asada was pretty decent.  I've definitely had better.  It was a little dry and burnt on some pieces but good flavor and just enough spice with the salsa they add.  

The crispy fish however was really good.  Great crisp on the breading and the sauces they add give it a great overall taste.  I would for sure get multiples of these again in the future.  

Now as for the soup I had it was lacking in a lot of areas.  It came out just slightly over warm temperature which was my first turn off.  I also had next to no chicken in it with mostly broth and a lot of veggies.  Missing something as far seasoning but I couldn't pin point what it was.  I just know I've bad much better at other Mexican restaurants.  

All in all a good lunch experience and I will be back to try some other items.
