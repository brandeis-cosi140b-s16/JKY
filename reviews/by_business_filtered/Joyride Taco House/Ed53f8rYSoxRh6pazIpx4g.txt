This place always has a long line, but the wait is worth it!

We come here a few times a year, including the last two years for my birthday. I'm never disappointed. The food is incredible, the servers are always delightful and the ambiance is top notch. My husband and I always share The Bandit plate, which is enough food for both of us AND for lunch the next day. The guacamole, which you can order as an appetizer with chips, is also to die for and is a must every time we go.

Yum!
