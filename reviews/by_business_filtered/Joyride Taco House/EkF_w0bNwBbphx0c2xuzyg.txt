What to try: Cucumber Serrano cocktail, crispy fish taco, chicken burrito with the veggie medley, veggie taco (weird, I know), and the beet salad! Awesome lunch special: 3 tacos and half salad under $10. $5 cocktails every day until 5pm.

The one pitfall: although the complimentary salsa is decent it lacks spice. I like spicy and I think it's ridiculous I have to pay extra to kick it up a notch at a Mexican restaurant.
