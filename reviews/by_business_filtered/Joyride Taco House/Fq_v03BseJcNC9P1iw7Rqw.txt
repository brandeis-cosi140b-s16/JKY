Please do not listen to all this negativity.... This place just rocks.... Every time we go there we can't wait for the next time to go back. Bartenders are fabulous. Manager Rocks! They care what how you feel about their establishment. Nachos are to live for. Tacos are to savor... Margaritas are amazing... Ambiance is like no other.... The Ahi Taco was perfect. Yes the UPWARD PROJECTS did not mess up on this one... They just took it up a notch!!!! BAM!!!!!!!
