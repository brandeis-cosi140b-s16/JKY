Came in on a recommendation from a friend, and boy I wasn't disappointed! The Mexican street corn was perfect, I'm a sucker for cotija! The cochinita pibil was great too. Awesome atmosphere and music as well. But the highlight was our server Hayley, my wide and I are both in the industry and can be tough customers to impress. It was honestly refreshing to have her as our server. Great recommendations, super positive and upbeat professional young lady. We will most definitely be returning to try the Adobado she told us was so amazing. Thanks again to Hayley for giving us the best service we can honestly say we've ever had.
