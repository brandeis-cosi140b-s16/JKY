After driving past this place since its opening I figured a visit is finally in order. We had 6 people in our party and it took a while to get seated, which was expected. The table was not wiped down when they came to get us so there was a scramble to get it cleaned off (even though it was "ready"), but eventually it was clean and read to eat at.

The chip and salsa seem endless and are slightly addictive. Service can be a bit awkward as its hard to tell the patrons from staff as the staff have no set uniforms. 

I ordered the fish street tacos, which were very good, and everyone else seemed to enjoy their meal. The Churros were for desire, not a favorite as they seemed a bit dry and I was not a fan of the dipping sauce. We were not rushed out after dinner and had some time to talk and get caught-up, which was nice.

All-in-all its not a bad place if you like this type of concept.
