Tried Joyride today for the second time. First time I did take out and really liked the braised beef taco. Was not a fan of the chicken taco. 
This time I joined a business contact there. They weren't very busy but the service was rather slow. Our server was really nice but I think she was preoccupied on something in the kitchen. 
I'd recommend Joyride as it's in a great spot for work downtown.
