Service was pretty good, spilled salsa and it was cleaned right away. Ordered a non alcoholic beverage (underage) and waitress brought a mojito Fresca drink. Chips were good, guacamole okay. Fish tacos had no flavor. Even tasted gross and overly fishy. I either think everyone giving 5 stars has really bad taste and doesnt know what a good fish taco tastes like, or my fish taco was bad.
