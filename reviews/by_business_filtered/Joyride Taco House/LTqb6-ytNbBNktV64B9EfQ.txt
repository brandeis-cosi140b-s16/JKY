Ok, I am not a drinker and this place has an enormous bar in the middle, but the food was outstanding! We did the fish tacos and whether fried or grilled they were both outstanding. Loved the cucumber and orange salad with pumpkin seeds, and the guac was superior to most. They brought is some comp frescos because the waitress had missed us, and all three flavors were amazing. My fav the cucumber mint. Great vibe and decor and when he service started it was he best. Oh yeah, did I mention the roasted salsa - Wow!
