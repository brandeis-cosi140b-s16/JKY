Love this place. Good service, tasty food and a fun atmosphere. 

The drinks are AMAZEBALLS... Omg. Plus $5 for a pitcher of delicious brew before 5 pm makes this my go to weekend lunch spot. Salsa's have a lot a flavor and good heat and the tacos are delicious. I was not impressed with the Chicken Tinga, it was just OK, the fish taco's are wonderful and the tortillas are handmade. The tortilla soup is really tasty as well, it can be a little to thick, but has great flavor. You have to order the cheese y mas... oh buddy. I could eat that all day erry day!

Overall, you should go here - belly up to the bar, the bartenders are fun and the service is great.
