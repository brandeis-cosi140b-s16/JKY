Went here on a tip and was thoroughly impressed. 

When we arrived we were told of 2 available seats at the front of the bar which we gladly accepted. The atmosphere was very social and lively, a little loud but perfect for a Friday night. After ordering our drinks and looking over the menu, our server/barkeep informed us of the special they were serving. Slow roasted pork shoulder on a bed of sweet polenta, garnished with what tasted like pickled jalape√±os and some sort of adobo sauce and cilantro. What ever it was it tasted like heaven, with huge complex flavors. The pork melted in your mouth, it was unreal. 

The staff was very nice and even engaged us in light conversation which just added to the laid back ambience. When we finished eating we were approached by the manager and asked what we thought about the special. I relayed my enthusiasm and he said it was really nice to get positive feedback on non-menued dishes and would be serving more 1-offs in the future.

Overall a fantastic experience. We will definitely return soon.
