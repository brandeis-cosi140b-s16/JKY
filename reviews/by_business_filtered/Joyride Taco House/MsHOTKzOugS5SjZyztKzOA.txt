I had a group of 6 and a baby and we were all impressed by this non-traditional Mexican restaurant. With items like squash and goat cheese enchiladas and a dozen different tacos to choose from, each was extremely satisfied with their food. I also thought it was a nice, strong but not-too-sweet marg. loved the decor and kid-friendliness outdoors. The only small complaint was they didn't have a dedicated waitress per table, we kept being helped by different people, so you could say requests were a little slow, but the food came out fast. Maybe it was a Sunday night thing. Can't wait to go back.
