First time there and we will be back. I broke down and went out of my comfort zone and had the Crispy Fish Tacos.  They were amazing.  The guacamole was excellent.  The only disappointment was the margarita.  It was very weak and just not good.  Fish taco will bring me back, but the $9.00!margarita needs to be better.
