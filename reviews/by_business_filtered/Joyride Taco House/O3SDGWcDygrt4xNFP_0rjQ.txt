I loved this place! Went for a late Saturday lunch and the house was rocking. Hostess said 20 minute wait, but with a nice large bar we were able to find two open seats right away and avoid the masses who were lingering. I really dug the decor, and there looked to be lots of outdoor patio space to enjoy too.
The house salsa was super flavorful and the chips were the wonderfully thin and crunchy type that I can't get enough of with my Mexican food. I ordered the Baja fish, Chicken Tinga and Cochinita Pibil tacos with the cucumber orange salad side. All of the tacos were great, but that simple, perfect salad was shear perfection. I want some now just thinking about it!
Couple of good draft beer choices and what appeared to be a pretty extensive bar. I plan a return sometime soon for a specialty coctele or two! 
Joyride, ya done good.
