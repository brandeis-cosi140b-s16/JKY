This was by far the best fish tacos I have ever had. I have been to a variety of places in Florida and Hawaii and California, with some killer fish tacos. These rank right up there. I thought only two tacos for sure I wont be full and will want more. I was pleasantly surprised on how full I was.  Their pitchers of beer were very reasonable 7 dollars for premium Mexican lager. OMG the churros were amazing! Must get for dessert no matter how full you are. Very fresh overall!
