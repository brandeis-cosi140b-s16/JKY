Joyride, what are you doing? I was just about to update my review to reflect a much more positive experience but you had to go and let me down again. 

I'm way happier with your food. Garden Variety Burrito is so delicious with the roasted mushrooms, squash, spinach, tomatoes, and corn combined with avocado, queso and "magic" sauce make the burrito just the right amount of healthy-unhealthy, especially if you get it chime style. I'd highly suggest getting it chime style or enchilada style by adding red/green sauce. And you give unlimited chips -- Yes, please!!

However, amazing food can be over shadowed.  On 5/30/15 in the "Gals" bathroom around 1:30-ish pm, the body of one little Ms. Coc K. Roach was not laid to rest. She was on her back, legs in the air, with no life left for anyone who used the bathroom to see. That's a pretty fast way to make someone lose an appetite. So gross! Check those bathrooms! 

The service is finally solid with servers who are knowledgable about the menu and attentive. The food is pretty good but dead bugs in a restaurant, even in a bathroom, is something I would think should be top priority to get under control. They usually say "If there is one bug then there is..."
 
And as per usual, splitting and getting the check proved to be difficult. Why don't you want to take our money? Please, I really do want to pay for my food and I typically like to do so in a timely fashion.  

I hold out hope that one day this review can be sunshine and rainbows but for now it's meh and dead bugs. Sad times, JR.
