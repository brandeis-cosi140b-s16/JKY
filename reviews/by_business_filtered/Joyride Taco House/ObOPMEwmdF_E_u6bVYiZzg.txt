We came here once before, had the nachos and, meh, had better.  But decided to give it another try.  Thursday, 5:00, there were plenty of people but not extremely busy.  It was pretty clear that the waitress was new, but she was pleasant and smiled, she just needs more practice.
We had tacos.  LUV... the shredded beef and the crunchy fish.  SO GOOD, lots of flavor.  So much better than Queen Barrio we tried several weeks ago.  Just thinking about this, I am ready to go back for some more tacos.
