We decided to stop here after finding it on Yelp - so glad we did. The atmosphere is casual, but not overly so. Our server, Taylor, was one of the most knowledgable and bubbly servers I've ever had. She knew about all the food and had great recommendations (based on our tastes) and even made me feel just fine for ordering an item plain (standard taco with just chicken and cheese). The blood orange margarita is phenomenal and not terribly priced. I HIGHLY recommend the "Better than Betty's" dessert - it's brownie, ice cream, caramel, and walnuts but oh man. So delicious. If you're in the area - make it a point to check this place out...ASK FOR TAYLOR (this is extremely important)...and get some dessert. You'll thank me for it later. Ugh...so full.
