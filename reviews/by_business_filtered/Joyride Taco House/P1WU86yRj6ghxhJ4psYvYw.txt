Came here for dinner on a Saturday night. we got lucky and found a parking spot along the street but they have purchased the lot just south of the building with extra parking spots. our wait to sit was only a few minutes although I would anticipate a longer wait during the busy hours. Staff was very friendly and on top of getting us drinks while we waited for our table. Loved the atmosphere here, and I don't know what it is about the Upward Projects but they always play great music. You get complimentary chips and salsa to snack on while your picking out your food. The salsa was very good. We ordered 3 tacos which were all fantastic and they came with a side, we chose the grilled vegetables. Oh my, simply delicious. I will be bring friends here next time.
