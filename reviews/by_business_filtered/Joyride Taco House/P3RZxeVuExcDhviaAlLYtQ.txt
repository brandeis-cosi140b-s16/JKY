I went here with some girlfriends for a girls night out and our service was impeccable.  The menu is pretty small and I am a very picky eater, so I did have a bit of a hard time choosing something (which is why I am only giving it 3 stars), but I ended up with a cheese quesadilla and it was very good.  All in all it was a nice place with great service.
