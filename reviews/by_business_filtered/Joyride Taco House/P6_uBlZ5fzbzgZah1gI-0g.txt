Joyride never disappoints! I always get The Standard tacos, but I've had pretty much everything here and it's all delicious. You could order anything on the menu and end up a happy camper.

The atmosphere is super chill and bright. It's definitely a tight squeeze, but I've never felt claustrophobic or squished. It's like a cozy little family in there! The patio/outdoor eating area is beautiful during the winter months and is a great hot spot during Happy Hour.

Pro tip - I (obviously) recommend The Standard. Plus, if you buy 3 tacos, you get a free side-dish, which I love. Their Blood Orange Mule is pretty awesome too!
