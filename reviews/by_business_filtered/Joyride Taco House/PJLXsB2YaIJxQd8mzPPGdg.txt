Went to Joyride on a Friday night. Cool vibe, nice patio area with a server to get you cocktails and chips while you wait for your table. 

Pros: 
awesome decor, patio. Yummy chips and salsa. Reasonable prices. Braised beef taco was solid. 

Cons: 
Taco's came out cold, nothing hot about anyone's entree's. 
A touch too loud 
Nachos were ok, was expecting more flavor. 

I'd be willing to go back on a week night and try this place again!
