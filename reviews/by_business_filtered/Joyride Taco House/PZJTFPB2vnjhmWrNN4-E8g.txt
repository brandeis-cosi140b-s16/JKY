Just went to Joyride with the man friend ;) and we had an AMAZING time. What they have in limited menu selections they make up for in extreme flavor and unexpected flavors (can you say roasted pumpkin seeds??). Their alcohol menu is great with the addition of the agua frescas and their full bar. Billy is an AMAZING server; her "Indian Jones" hat was very "Raiders of the Lost Ark" and not "Temple of Doom". She was very knowledgable about the menu and made our experience great. Hey manager- keep her in mind! You've got a great one on your hands! 

Thank you, Joyride! We'll definitely be back, hoping to see Billy and her fun attitude and fashion trends. We love you!
