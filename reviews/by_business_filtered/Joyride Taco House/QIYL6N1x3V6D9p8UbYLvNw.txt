This place was awesome! Exceeded my expectations! I had 3 tacos and wish I would have tried the fish taco but figured the 3 would have been plenty. Plus going on $2 Taco Tuesday night even topped my first visit here!  I also tried some of the nachos that my friend ordered and it was very yummy, as well as the 3 tacos that I ordered. The chips and salsa were also great! The waitress was very welcoming and the service was above and beyond! At the end of our meal my friends and I were debating getting dessert, and the waitress paid for our dessert since it was our first time there, how awesome! I will definitely be going back!
