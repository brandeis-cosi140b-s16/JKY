Looking forward to a return visit. We all tried the blood orange margarita's and they were very good. Looking forward to trying the pineapple mojito on my next visit. I loved the chicken, corn and poblano tamale. I wish the rice was more of a mexican rice but the grilled vegetables with the dish were very tasty. My husband is still talking about the street corn. All in all we had a great meal. When the weather is nice the outdoor seating would be great. It was a little loud inside but too hot to enjoy the outside space.
