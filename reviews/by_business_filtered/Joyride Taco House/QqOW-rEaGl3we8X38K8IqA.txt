So it's hard for me to write this review. The only reason I'm giving this place two stars is simply because the service was terrible. The food was amazing! 

A friend and I met for dinner at this restaurant last night. Coming from someone like myself who has worked in the industry for over 10 years now I usually myself pretty lenient on service because I know what it's like. However the service last night was just incredibly slow, and we had to ask for things repeatedly. I watched people running around the restaurant most of the night with frantic looks on their faces. I get moving with a sense of urgency but it's best not to show it on your faces. Especially when it wasn't even that busy. It felt like several times our server kept forgetting things. Our soda was empty twice and each time it took a good 10 minutes to get refills, I even asked once if she remembered our sodas and her response was "it's already working". And when we finally got our sodas they were not the sodas we ordered. She offered more chips and salsa and we said yes but they never ended up on our table. The food itself took a long time to come out which made me think she forgot to ring it in as other tables that ordered after us got their food before ours. I'm not really sure how this place trains on service or what their method of service is but I will say it has a lot to be desired. It really does take a lot for me to frown on service but this time it felt warranted. Considering our entire time for two people to have a meal and dessert took two hours, there is something to be said. 

Again the food was amazing and I would love to give this place another shot, but hopefully the service is much better than what I just experienced!
