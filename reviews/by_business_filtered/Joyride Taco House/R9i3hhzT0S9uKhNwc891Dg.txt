This place was really great.  I loved all the tacos I tried and the atmosphere is really open and colorful.  They have huuuuuge booths that are a great place to bring friends.

I was there on a day when I had a party of 10-15 at any given time.  The server was great at accommodating our group - we were able to pay with several credit cards + cash as long as we divided up the items ourselves.

The only reason I wouldn't give this place 5 stars is because when I called to make the reservation for 10, the manager gave me grief that my party would be arriving & leaving at varied times, and pushed back because 'the restaurant is busy at 4:30'.  At 4:30 when I arrived, half the restaurant was empty and there wasn't a wait until shortly before 6:30, when we wrapped up and left.  I was disappointed at the attitude that a party of 10+ wouldn't be welcomed with open arms.  

On a positive note, the drinks are fantastic and the open doors made this a perfect place for a spring get together.
