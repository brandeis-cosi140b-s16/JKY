Really delicious food,I strongly recommend their chilaquiles. I could eat them everyday and never get tired. The Horchata is also amazing it is refreshing, home made and with an almond taste to it.  They also have excellent service, It does get packed during rush hours of dinner and lunch but that is because the food is top quality and the wait is never too long.
