My wife and I frequent Joy Ride.  The waits are often long for a table but we're usually lucky enough to find a spot at the bar.

We've never been disappointed with the food.  Most of the time, it's really good and occasionally, amazing.  The house cocktails, while not classic, are good in a spiked fruit juice kind of way.

The atmosphere is awesome.  Bustling but not overly loud.  When the weather is nice, the patio is a nice option.  The music is right in my wheelhouse.  

Prices are fair and sometimes a bargain.  For instance, they do a 32 ounce pitcher of draft beer for somewhere around $7.  The beer selection, while not terribly craft-centric, has a few good choices, i.e. Dale's.
