Love this place! It's fun and fresh and appealing in every way.  This restaurant group is the best. Love love the tacos here and the beachy 70's California feel of this place and awesome service. Easy to share a meal with your spouse or friends because you can literally decide how much to get- how many tacos, what sides, etc.
