We were looking for a tasty Mexican restaurant and saw favorable reviews for Joyride. We were not disappointed. Located in the heart of old town Gilbert, Joyride is nestled between two other restaurants. We sat outside on a relatively cool day but were kept warm by the fireplace and space heaters. The salsa is outstanding with a kick and the Cadillac margarita delicious. We had a variety of tacos which are served on outstanding corn tortillas. Wonderful flavored. Impeccable, attentive service; we were brought more salsa without having to ask and were asked if we wanted more chips. Highly recommended.
