Whos got two thumbs and really likes this place.. This guy!

I didnt give it a 5 star because it really takes alot to.... wait. I dont have to justify my Yelps to you or anybody! ;0)

Went with the kiddies. Yummy Guacamole.... (could be a slightly bigger dish.)  Its great place. We had fast service. Pricing is reasonable. Atmosphere was cool. Im a big fan of places that dont have uniforms on the staff. This is one such place.
