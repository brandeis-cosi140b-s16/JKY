Well, it's not bad...but it's not great either. Walking in I was pumped to hear Deltron through the speakers and see the place was not as pretentious as I had heard from the grape vine. Since I'm not one for negativity I'll start out with some positives. A wide selection of aguas frescas with the option of adding booze to it was quite a delight, and the salsa they bring out with your complimentary chips was actually tasty as a mofo. Service was pretty good and,,, well...that's about it. If you are going to be charging around 4 bucks each for mf'n street tacos they better be amazing, the truth is they were not. You could score a hell of a better fish taco at rubios, the cochinito pibil tasted like a corona with a few cigarette butts floating inside, and the short rib was alright...just kick up the seasoning. A few adjustments and this place could be a gem.
