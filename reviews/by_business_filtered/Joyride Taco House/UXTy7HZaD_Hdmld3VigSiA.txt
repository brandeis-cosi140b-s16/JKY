I rarely write reviews, but what I experienced last night prompted a much deserved 5 stars from me. Service and food were excellent. 

I stopped in around 9:30pm. I didn't dine in because I was exhausted from a very long week. So I pulled up, went inside and asked for a menu. The place was very full - always a good sign. The woman who was at the door made me feel super at home even though I was just ordering to go. She explained that I could walk up to the bar and place my order (it was right in front of me) or she could take the order no problem. 

I wasn't starving, so I just ordered two tacos: The Standard (chicken plus the works basically), and Carne Asada. She explained if I got a third taco then a side came free, but I knew I wasn't hungry enough so I declined. She then asked if I would like a water or anything while I waited. I appreciated the offer but my dog was waiting in the car and I needed to go back outside. 

Moments later I went back inside and the same woman immediately attended to me saying my food was ready to go. To my surprise, they included a full bag of chip and a large salsa container with my two tacos!! I'm so glad they did because the chips were crisp and light and the salsa was INCREDIBLE. 

Now, I'm not going to be able to adequately describe these tacos. But I can tell you, I've had a LOT of tacos in my life. The Carne Asada taco was the best carne asada taco I've ever had. I'm not over-exaggerating. The steak was cooked with a perfect char to tender ratio. The amount of steak was very pleasing for a small taco: I could have used a second tortilla (not a complaint)! The toppings perfectly complimented the steak and didn't overpower it. The other taco I got was good too, but the Carne Asada was out of this world good. I'm probably going back tonight...seriously. 

I can't wait to actually dine in next time. I saw the list of margaritas on the menu and I'm eager to have one with my next Carne Asada taco.
