Joyride is so darn good! I have to start it that way, because lets face it, its true!

I always get a Key Largo to drink (this is my favorite drink anytime I go to Joyride). Its so yummy and delicious that you cant just have one. 

Ive had the Crispy fish, carne asada, shrimp & chicken tinga tacos. Now I am the type of person that doesn't need a fancy taco, basically because there are a lot of things I cannot eat because of my stomach. So that being said, I ordered the above tacos with no cabbage, no mexican slaw & no white magic. Trust me, they didn't even need it. These tacos are would be good with just the meat and tortilla, must be those corn tortillas.

Joy rice with tomatillo salsa & the bomb black beans are also good. But, do yourself a favor and order the orange cucumber salad, trust me you will love it!

If you have been to Joyride and did not get dessert, YOU NEED TO GO BACK and order Mo's Definitely

Oh and I cant forget, the service is always outstanding!
