I absolutely love Joy Ride.

The atmosphere of the restaurant is great and the food is even better. I typically go in on the weekends and sometimes we have to wait a little bit to be seated but it is worth it.

The chips and salsa are amazing, and normally I go for the tacos. Crispy Fish is my favorite. Tortillas, batter, and sauces are so yummy.

My only complaint is that sometimes with their style of service (you don't have one particular server, they all kind of split zones and help out), you end up telling multiple people "No, I don't need another refill" or whatever the case is. But all in all, wonderful!
