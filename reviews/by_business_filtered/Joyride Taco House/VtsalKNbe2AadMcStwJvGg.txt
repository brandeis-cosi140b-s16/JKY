This is currently my favorite taco house in Phoenix. Great atmosphere, great service and best of all - GREAT tacos! My wife loves the "Beast Burrito". We're lucky to have this place around the block from our house! The only complaint I have is the limited parking. They get very busy and on Friday nights and weekends. On busy nights, you have to valet or park across the street. Not that big of a deal, but I just can't see valeting my car for tacos... Weekdays aren't as busy. Enjoy! This is a place not to be missed!
