Joyride's Gilbert location started out strong on the burgeoning downtown Gilbert Main Street as one of the best places for trendy Mexicana in the east valley. My first experience there was phenomenal as I was given the full rundown of the menu and even a sample of some of their newer tacos. Since then, it has become a regular spot for myself and my Gilbert dwelling friends to enjoy an afternoon repast of beer and fish tacos. The atmosphere is great, the wait staff is friendly and attractive, and the music they play never disappoints. 

I give four stars rather than five however, because over the last year or so, some of their recipes have undergone some changes. To this day there are a few dishes that remain inconstant, and some of my personal favorites like their pulled pork torta have been removed altogether. 

Don't fix what ain't broke, joyride!
