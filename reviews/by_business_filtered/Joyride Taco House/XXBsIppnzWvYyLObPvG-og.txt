The service is extremely hit or miss.

The first time my girlfriend and I went here our server was great - everyone else ... the other 4 people who brought us something or sat us... were bad.

At first we were going to brunch down the street, but they were on an extremely long wait. Then we walked past Postino's and decided to try something new.

Our server was attentive, yet the chips and salsa were slow initially and for refills.
The food was delivered by what seemed like a manager and she did not ask if we needed anything else or offer to refill our empty waters.

Great beers on tap, the tacos are very good, and the servers make up a little bit for the overall way too laid back service. The decor is nice and the location is great, but get there early on the weekends or be prepared to wait.
