We went in during happy hour on a friday.  Love the atmosphere and how it is open to outside.  We tried the tacos, they are $2 each during happy hour.  The standard was the best one, wish I would have gotten all 3 standards!  Kids meal was good, my daughter loved the quesadilla and beans.  The service was awful!  Had to wait 15 minutes for a check and finally had to flag down a person.  You can't tell who works there because no one wears uniforms.
