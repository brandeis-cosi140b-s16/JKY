Great tacos and TUES nights they have the deal for I believe, $2 tacos? Its been a few weeks since I've been.  BUT it is CROWDED on that night of course so be advised.  Good to great service both times I visited, fair prices even on non promo days.  My only critiques are, the prickly pear marg is GROSS I'm sorry it is just nasty, and I have no idea why refried black beans are a thing here.  When I ordered the black beans, I was not told they were refried and mushed to death.  They were too salty or....SOMETHING I'm not sure what I tasted but NO don't do it.  Black beans are best with salt, citrus, and left whole.  No need to be overly fancy.  GREAT tacos though, good salsa, pretty decent guac although its the one thing on the menu that is overpriced for the portion you get.
