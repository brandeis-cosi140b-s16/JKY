I'm FINALLY writing a review for this place! 

I come here often as shown by my check-ins....so often to where some of the employees wave when I walk in; embarrassing, I know. 

My favorite day to come is Tuesday! Why?! Because of TACO TUESDAYYYYYY!! Taco Tuesday means that you get delicious melt in your mouth $2.00 tacos (try the crispy fish) aaaaand $5.00 margaritas! Now, I personally dislike margaritas or anything that contains tequila, except for the ones here! I love the margs here, especially the raspberry-ancho. You can't taste the tequila, but that devil will sneak up on ya after your 2nd drink. But why stop at 2, right?! 

I also love their lunch special! 2 tacos and 1/2 for $9.95?! Count me in. All their salads are pretty delicious so I can't choose just one!

The staff is really nice and friendly and The prices are good. What else do ya want?! Stop reading and go get yourself tacos.
