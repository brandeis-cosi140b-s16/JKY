Recently had the famous Joyride Taco's. I had a shrimp, carnita and two crispy fish tacos. The first two were good, the crispy fish were fantastic, I highly recommend! We finished off the meal with the chocolate churros which were god as well and perfect for sharing. Overall good experience and solid food.
