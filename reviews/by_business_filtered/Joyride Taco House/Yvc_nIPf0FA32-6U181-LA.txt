I've been here on several occasions and I've always enjoyed the experience. The outdoor area looks like it's current under construction, but if it remains pretty similar, it's an ideal place to hang out and catch up with friends. Inside is a little loud with music. I usually get the tacos but friends have always liked their food too. The churros and the agua frescas are amazing!
