After reading all of the mixed reviews, my wife and I were a bit nervous to try what appeared to be an overly hipster Mexican joint.  It's an understatement to say we were blown away!  Our server Justin was super friendly and provided stellar service. We started with the Shrimp Ceviche which had just the right amount of acidity and copious amounts of fresh plump shrimp.

For our entrees, we shared three tacos: a fried fish, a grilled shrimp, and a cochinata pibil. All were absolutely delicious, but the standouts in my opinion were the shrimp and fish, especially the fresh guacamole which added just the right amount of freshness to the fried fish.  We also split the Enselada Fila which was fresh, crispy, light, and vibrant!  Although slightly overpriced, Joyride Taco House is well worth it with its fresh ingredients and friendly service.  Lesson well learned: never judge a hipster book by its cover.
