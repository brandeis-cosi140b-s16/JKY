Imagine that Jonathan Adler decided to make a taco shop in Phoenix, Arizona, and you've got this place. There isn't enough parking for even the lunch crowd, and I got there a little after noon on a Friday. They were already on a wait list for tables, but I was dining solo and easily got a spot at the bar. I loved the geometric turquoise wallpaper and giant gold lamps, but wondered if the tacos would be as excellent as the interior design. I opted for the lunch special and got a glass of lemonade because I was working that afternoon (although looking back, I should have made it a margarita!). The lemonade was fresh squeezed and refreshing, and a cool breeze came through the open restaurant as I waited for my food, which made me feel like I was on vacation... although coming to the southwest from the northeast in February is a vacation even if I had to work the whole time! 

The server at the bar - a curly dark haired skater-looking girl with backwards hat, was extremely friendly. I heard her recommend the quinoa salad as a side to the women next to me, and I am so glad I was eavesdropping! I got the salad as well as two tacos - The Standard and a carnitas taco. Everything was ridiculously good with juicy tender meat and slices of avocado on top. I don't think I left a crumb on the plate. It was a perfect, quick, and economic lunch, coming it at just over $10! Plus, chips and salsa come for free. I highly recommend this spot to locals and visitors alike.
