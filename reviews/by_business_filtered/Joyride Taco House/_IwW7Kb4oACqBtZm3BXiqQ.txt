Margaritas are fresh and tasty. No mix or fakery going on here. 
I had the grilled fish tacos and I was put off by the strong fishy smell when I took the first few bites. The house made tortilla and condiments made it edible. 
My dinning buddy had the ahi taco and he was quite pleased - being the ahi taco snob that he is.
Counted three curly waxed mustaches so the hipster factor is very high here. They're quite friendly, attentive and even entertaining when they're signing along to Journey. 
Will be back to try the chimichanga and burritos.
