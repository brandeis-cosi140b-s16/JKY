Five star rating is for the great food:  Baja fish taco, braised beef, and carne asada taco--all great! Chips and salsa also fresh and very good.  Service on the other hand was subpar.  Not bad enough to lose me forever.  Since the food was so good I will give them another shot...just hope service is better this time.

Update -  had to bring down to a four after eating at barrio queen--new standard.
