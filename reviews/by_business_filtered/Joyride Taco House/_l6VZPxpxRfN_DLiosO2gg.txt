Yummy food with a great, fun atmosphere. I practically drank the salsa--using the chips as mere scoopers, ha. Try not too fill up too much on chips because the tacos are great. I sampled so I could try more! Street corn was SO WORTH IT! Splurge baby! You'll become addicted to it. I really enjoyed the non-alcoholic drink options. It was fun and refreshing. Don't leave without that banana dessert thing. The name escapes me but the memory of it (in the cute presentation) remains! My feeling is enjoy it all! It's a great, friendly place to eat with friends!
