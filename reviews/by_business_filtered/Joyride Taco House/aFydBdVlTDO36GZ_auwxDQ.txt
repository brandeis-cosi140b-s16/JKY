Everything here was great! Very cool spot, cozy but big enough that we didn't have to wait for a table on a Saturday night. Chips and salsa were addictively delicious and wait staff was unbelievably attentive with refills. Our server was great, very knowledgeable about the beer selection and other good places to check out in the area (since we are out-of-towners). All the tacos we tried were delicious, and the churros were great, definitely recommend adding the caramel dipping sauce. Would absolutely recommend this place!
