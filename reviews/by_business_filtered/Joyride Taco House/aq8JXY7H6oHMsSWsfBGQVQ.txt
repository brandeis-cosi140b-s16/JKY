Went for taco Tuesday, left super satisfied. Some of the best tacos I've ever had for $2 each! I ended up ordering 3, then 4 more to go! The carne asada is some of the best I've had, and that's saying a lot living in AZ. I totally recommend that and the crispy fish! Service and atmosphere was also great!
