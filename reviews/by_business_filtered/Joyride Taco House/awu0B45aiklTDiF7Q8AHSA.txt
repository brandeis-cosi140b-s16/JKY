Took my Daughter-in-law out for lunch, we both had passed this place and were curious about it. Stopped in. Will for sure go back. Food was great, we tried a few different tacos. We were unable to try and fru-fru drinks as we had an appointment to go to after, but saw quite a few come out of the bar.  

We sat outside, a very nice patio behind the building, helps you not hear the street traffic. They have a section w/ real grass, we saw a few customers w/ dogs show up. that was ok as the dogs were kept on leashes. 

We ordered 2 tacos each to start. received the chips and salsa... and couldn't stop eating them!! we finished the basket before our tacos came, and they brought another one. we ate them too. Our tacos arrived. based on the price, I felt they were a bit small, but they were very good. Fresh ingredients, that's for sure.

We both ordered two more tacos (and more chips and salsa) and enjoyed them.

Our server was friendly, a bit busy as it seemed he may have been the only one and the place was packed. But not a problem, it was a nice relaxing time. 

However, as we sat outside and the sun moved, we went from in the shade to in the full sun. they need a few more umbrellas, as the 3 they had were being used by those on the grass. speaking of those on the grass, a group of about 10 showed up and sat in the lawn chairs on the grass, enjoying each others company and a few drinks. Nice idea!  

Didn't go inside, so can't review on that. For sure we will go back. When we stood up to leave, the manager came over and asked us how it was. We told him great, as it was, and that we wish we had ordered 3 tacos to start off instead of 2. he suggested that if we like a certain type of taco, and are very hungry, order the burrito, it's much larger, and costs less than 3 tacos. will try that next time.
