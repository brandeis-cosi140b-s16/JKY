Cool vibe, great service. But the food is expensive and not that good. Today I had the "The Beast" burrito: carne asada. It was saucy and tasted like teriyaki beef--so sweet! Come on you guys! That is not how you make carne asada. I will say that the tortilla soup is delicious ... but for real tacos and burritos, I'll go to Phx Burrito House or Mi Patio.
