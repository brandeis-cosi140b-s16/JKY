After driving past this place and looking at the menu online, I thought Joyride would be the perfect taco place for me. They have a few vegetarian options, cool sounding drinks, and the atmosphere looked fun. I was a tad disappointed however.

There were some things I really liked about Joyride, and some things I did not like so much. One good thing was the service, the servers were very attentive. Even a few servers who were not our server for the night came up to check on us, which I thought was nice. I also liked the decor, very mod and I like the color scheme.

I ordered three veggie tacos with the cucumber orange salad as my side. It is nice they you get to have a free side with three tacos. The tacos were good but not great. The first one I ate had a soggy tortilla, the other two tortillas were fine. Also there was a tiny piece of something hard and inedible in my first taco, which was unpleasant. I wish I would have ordered the black beans as my side instead too because the salad was kind of gross. Also the side would have cost $4.00 which is ridiculous for like 3 cucumber spears, 2 mandarin orange segments, and a few seeds. I tried to like it, but I just couldn't! Also my boyfriend got the Key Largo drink, and I am glad I did not order one because I was not a fan. He thought it was too vanilla-y, but did not totally hate it. The chips and salsa were yummy though, so there is a plus.

Another downside was the price. Mine wasn't too bad, but my boyfriend's meal was nearly $30 for a drink, burrito, and a taco. Overall, Joyride is not bad, but did not quite meet my expectations.
