This is has a nice atmosphere both inside and outside. My boys got the kids meal with the chicken tacos. They did not care for the tacos that had beans mixed in them. We ordered the standard, carne asada, and the fried fish tacos. The tacos were ok along with the Mexican cold slaw. I think I was looking for more of a Mexican taste. The food is healthy but just not for was. The place was nice to try...
