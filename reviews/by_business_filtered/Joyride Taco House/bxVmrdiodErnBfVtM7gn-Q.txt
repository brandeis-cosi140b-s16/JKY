Dated unadventurous menu. Service was good.  Food wasn't bad but wasn't memorable and we will probably not go back anytime soon.  We were hoping to find a cool spot in central Phoenix and it was just O.K. Would love to see them take a few risks with the food with not only this restaurant but their others as well.
