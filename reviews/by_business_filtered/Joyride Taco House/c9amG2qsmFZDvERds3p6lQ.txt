Aghhhh... I really hate to give this a 3 star review. I wanted to love Joyride. My friends love Joyride. I love all the other restaurants in the Postinos family. I had a lukewarm experience with Joyride.

We went with a large group of friends. Started out with cocktails and chips and salsa. I had an aqua fresca with gin. It was good but light on the gin. Salsa was boring.

We then ordered our food and another round of drinks. I ordered the veggie burrito and a beer. My husband ordered tacos with a side of beans. My veggie burrito was just okay. It wasn't bad but I have had much tastier. I was excited about the "white magic" sauce that came in it but it seemed non-existent. I doused a lot of hot sauce on my burrito. My husband liked his tacos a lot. We both thought the beans were very bland. My beer? Well, it took 40 minutes to come out. 

I have a hard time with the value at Joyride. Mexican food should not be this expensive... if it is then it should be very special. I wasn't feeling it. I love the atmosphere, servers were nice. They comped the beer they almost forgot. I am willing to give Joyride another try.
