I am becoming a big fan of Upward Projects. I love Windsor, Federal Pizza, Churn, and Postino. Now I can add Joyride to the list.

Parking is much easier with the addition of the lot next to Windsor. You can also park along the street right next to Joyride if it isn't peak meal time. There's several doors around the perimeter of the building; someone will gladly point you to the host/hostess.

You can sit at a table, at the bar, or at a community table. Restaurant is large, has nice geometric patterns on the walls, and there's interesting light fixtures by the bar.

Chips and salsa: thin crispy warm chips yum, and delish spicy salsa

Cheese y mas: lots of nice fresh toppings on a bed of warm queso; simple flavor and really good

Veggie and goat cheese enchiladas: a little limited on the veggies in the enchiladas, and a lot of goat cheese so if you aren't a fan, get chicken. Also, no sides. That being said, the verde sauce is tangy and delish, and everything is well seasoned for a delightful harmony of flavors in your mouth.

The beast: made it enchiladas style with verde sauce. Delicious, tender beef and a nice mix of beans and avocado inside.

Good drink specials, as with all the Upward Projects restaurants. I can't wait to try the agua frescas and margaritas.
