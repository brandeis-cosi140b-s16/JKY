Great atmosphere. Drinks are refreshing.  My wife loves their pineapple mojitos and the mazatlan mules are tasty. 

The tacos are pricy (about $4) for a tiny taco but they are good. The crispy fish taco is the best fish taco I've had in az. I also had the braised beef tacos which were good as well. 

Definitely worth going back
