Absolutely love Joyride. Both times I've been there, the service has been good, staff has been laid back yet attentive, and the food? Exactly what the doctor ordered! Excellent margs, a nice deviation from your basic margarita, but nothing too bizarre or fancy. Great tacos (check out $2 taco tuesday!), and truly inspired flavor and ingredient combinations. Definitely worth a return visit, and another, and another.
