I really love the decor & the feel of this restaurant! The servers are all pretty nice too! I wish I knew the name of the server who took care of our big group of 23 people- she was awesome! 

I had the Lola Grain salad (It may seem crazy that I had salad at a taco place). It was DELICIOUS! One of the best salads I've ever had really! It tastes healthy & full of flavor! (I had it without the bell pepper!) 

I've tried a couple of the tacos- they are a little too "different" for my taste, but they aren't bad- just not for me. 

I had the mango-mandarin margarita & it was very tasty! Many people love the prickly pear margarita, they are bright pink & really attractive for a cocktail! 

I highly recommend the salad, chips & salsa & drinks here!
