Since our first visit to Joyride Taco House on July 7th we have been there numerous times.  We are huge fans of Upward Projects restaurants.  It's one of those restaurants where you just like "being" there.  Great music, great service, yummy food and don't get me started on the Mazatlan Mules-hands down my favorite current drink!!
