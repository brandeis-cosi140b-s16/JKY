Up until last night I would have easily given Joyride 4 stars, however, after last nights dinner service (or lack thereof) I had to drop them down to 3 stars. Its unfortunate, because their food is absolutely delicious. My fiance and I have eaten at Joyride 3 times within the last month and the only thing that has stayed the same is the quality and taste of their food. The service seems to be very hit and miss. Our first experience was fantastic. Our waitress was kind and attentive. Our second visit was at the bar. The service was good, nothing outstanding like our first visit, but not bad. And then there was last night..... Talk about a catastrophe. Our waitress had little to no idea what she was doing. Multiple times throughout the night we were sure that we had been forgotten about. Our waitress took our dinner and drink order after we had been sitting ready and waiting to order  for over 15 minutes, it then took another 10 minutes to get our teas, and then she completely disappeared until it was time to pay. She never came back to check on us. When she presented us with the check, it was incorrect, so she had to go back and try it again. It took her another 15 minutes to come back with the correct check. Our dirty dishes and empty chip trays were never cleared off of the table, everything just sat there stacking up. The manager passed by our table several times, looked straight at us sitting there waiting with dirty dishes all around, and just kept walking.... 
Again, the food is wonderful. We absolutely love the shrimp, braised beef, carne asada tacos, and chicken nachos but wow the service keeps going downhill with each visit. If the service continues to follow this same pattern I am terrified to see what it would be like if we decide to go back....
