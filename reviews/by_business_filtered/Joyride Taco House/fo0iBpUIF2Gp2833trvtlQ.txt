This review is coming from a new vegetarian who grew up eating amazing Mexican food cooked by my Nana in a town with great authentic Mexican restaurants . So first our sever who did a pretty good job brought out chips and salsa . The chips were good but salsa was pretty lame and reminiscent of pace picante sauce (mild) . My girlfriend and I  shared  veggie enchiladas , A veggie burrito and a side of rice and beans . The veggie burrito which we ordered enchilada style lacked flavor even after drenching it in a salsa I paid extra for . The rice and beans were on the same level as the veggie enchiladas . You want to know what that level is ? Well I guess it's best compared to the Mexican food I had at Disney land to be nice . Nice atmosphere though .
