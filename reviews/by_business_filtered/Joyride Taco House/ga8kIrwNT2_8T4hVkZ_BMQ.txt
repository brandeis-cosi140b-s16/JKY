Came here for dinner, tried the blood orange cocktail first... Way too syrupy. Tasted fake. Not a fan. Ordered the Ahi tostada for appetizer, and weren't pleased either. The pineapple on it tasted like it was fresh from a can. Dessert-like sweetness. Not very good. We actually decided to head to another place for our entree. Quite disappointed, because we're all big fans of postino and Windsor. Won't be back here anytime soon. On the upside, the service and atmosphere were great.
