Ahi tacos are incredible. All the fish is fresh never frozen. The staff is super friendly and the music doesn't suck (usually). Today I made a minor (solicited) complaint about a taco and the staff went WAY out of their way to make me happy. The chef himself brought me a  new taco, they knocked it off my bill anyway and even gave me a free drink. I always sit at the bar, so I can't comment on the wait staff but the place looks like they only hire attractive tattooed people. No complaints here. Drinks appear to be strong too... Still typing.
