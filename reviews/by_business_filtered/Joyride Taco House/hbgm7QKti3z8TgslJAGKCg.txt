Had dinner here with my bf. We were craving tacos and he found this place through yelp cause we wanted to eat nearby. The weather was nice so we ate outside! I had Carne asada, shrimp, and crispy fish with Spanish rice on the side. Everything was delicious and tasted fresh! So much flavor and I was satisfied with every bite. Their house salsa and chips were good for starters.. My bf had braised beef, shrimp, and crispy fish tacos as well with grilled veggies which he enjoyed very much. All we could say is MMMM! Service was great and they were all friendly. Thanks for the great experience on our first time being here. Definitely will be back.
