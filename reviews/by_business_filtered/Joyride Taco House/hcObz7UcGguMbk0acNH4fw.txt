Amazing tacos! ! You get a free side with an order of 3 tacos. I had the  carne, standard, fish, Shrimp, adobada and carnitas. The cucumber and orange salad is super fresh and tasty. James the bartender was friendly,  helpful and nice.  Definitely try the pineapple mojito, fresh and not super sweet.and if you like Margaritas try the blood orange. And close it off with some churros and add the caramel  sauce.  Won't be disappointed! !
