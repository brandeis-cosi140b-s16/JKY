I love love love the ambiance of the restaurant. It is fun and funky, great youth for Gilbert! The margaritas are great and you can't really mess up chips and salsa!

Having worked in restaurants for 6 years, I have probably sent food back less than 5 times in my life. Joyride would be one of those times. Very bland carne asada. Management was great in offering me something else and giving me coupons for my next visit - I really appreciate the customer service. 

So basically, I will go back, but I will stick to drinks and apps :)
