The. Best. Tacos. 
I've tried a few tacos in my day. It usually consists of driving to a stand somewhere on an intersection where car exhaust penetrates your nostrils and the local bums are looking at you as they salivate after your every bite. 

Enter Joyride. All the delicious flavors of your local stand without all the unwanted toppings! 
Amazing drinks! Awesome service and crew! And the  funnest eating environment. I highly recommend their braised beef tacos and the serrano cucumber margarita! OMGizzle! Fo shizzle!!
