Wow!  Great food, attentive service and all the beautiful people you could ask for.  Seriously.  Everyone in the place was stunning,  I loved LOVED the crispy fish taco and would probably just keep ordering those if I returned.  Why mess with a good thing? My husband had a variety of other tacos and he enjoyed them all.  I am also now obsessed with their orange cucumber salad.  Since I don't live in the area I will be trying to replicate it when I get home.  Not a cheap meal, but worth the price.  It doesn't get any better than this!
