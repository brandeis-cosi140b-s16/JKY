What a great dinner! First, let me start with the salsa and chips, which is the first thing they bring you. Nice heat, little sweetness and acidity. Really some good salsa. Actually, I was a little bummed I didn't try it before getting appetizers since I would have tried some of the others.

For apps we had the shrimp ceviche and mas queso. LOVED the ceviche. It was so stinking good. Little jicama in there with a pico type mix. The queso was good. I'm not a huge cheese fan but my husband really liked it. 

Entrees, I had 3 tacos from the happy hour menu. Totally suggest doing that since they are $2 each. Ordered the traditional, pork adoba and carne asada. There was a mix up and I got the fish instead of the traditional but that was fine with me since I was debating that one. Fish and carne were fantastic. Adoba wasn't quite what I was expecting. It was okay but not near as good as the other two. Husband had a burrito with eggs and beef in it. Name escapes me but he really like it.

Over all, awesome meal. Best of all, whole thing cost us $33. Can't really beat a nice meal out for that price.
