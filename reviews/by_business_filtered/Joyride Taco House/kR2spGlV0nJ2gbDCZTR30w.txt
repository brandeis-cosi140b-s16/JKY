Well after a few recommendations and some yelp reviews we decided to try it. Over all a disappointment for all the hype. 50 minute wait. 30 minute wait from the time we ordered appetizer until food arrived...uhm before the appetizer. I had 3 way overpriced "street tacos" crispy fish, shrimp, and shredded beef. Both the fish and shrimp were cold, the beef barely warm...wife's were adequately warm. Over all tacos all kind of tasted the same was my wife's comment. I agreed. Appetizer finally came...ahi tostada (on the house at this point) it was good...but nothing to write home about...was not seasoned at all. It's amazing what a little salt and pepper can do for a dish folks. A double rum and coke set me back 14 dollars wtf? The moes definitely desert? Uhmmm runny and grainy boxed pudding, a clump of sliced banana, Carmel and salted pecans...pecans and Carmel were the best part etc...thrown together...but tasted pretty good...not worth 6 bucks. Our server was pleasant enough but forgetful apparently. Short term memory problems? Lol

All said and done ? 64 dollars for one app, two entrees, one desert and two drinks. 

I don't know what the uber positive reviews are all about I'm thinking you waited a long time and had a few too many by the time your table was ready hence..."everything was so good"...really over priced, under seasoned, poorly executed simple food. Trying to ride on the hipster local and decor  and forgetting that the food and service is the thing. 

 We decided we will go try it one more time just make sure it wasn't an accident. Will update after.
