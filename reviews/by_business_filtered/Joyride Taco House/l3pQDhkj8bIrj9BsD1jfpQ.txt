This family of a restaurant always exceeds our expectations. They all share in the responsibility of making sure we are comfortable. The wait was slightly shorter than quoted but the waiting area with misters made life easy, even with the infant. There was a second overflow wait area with similar accommodations on the other side of the bar. Someone brought us waters and chips while we waited. A server came buy to grab our drink order. Once we had our table the host met us on the walk over there and our tab was combined without question. EASY! This happens every time we come in. The food was perfect. Bean burrito and rice for the little one, enchiladas for myself and tacos for the lady. Had a little elote as a snack and life was good. Love this place.
