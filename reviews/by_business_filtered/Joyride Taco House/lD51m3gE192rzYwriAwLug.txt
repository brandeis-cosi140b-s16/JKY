This place has better tacos than its neighbor barrio queen. I recommend "the standard", just a solid taco, yummy. Bartenders were nice. Kind of small dining area so if you're claustrophobic, it may be a turn off. It's also always super packed and busy. Only been here once so I will update with future visits.
