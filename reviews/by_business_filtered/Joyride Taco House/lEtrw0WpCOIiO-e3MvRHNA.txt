I have now been here twice.  Both times with groups 6-10 in size.  I love the restaurant group for their fantastic decor and mood, but the service is TERRIBLE!  Both times now it has taken 20+ minutes to get a drink.  Our waitress tonight never asked if we wanted appetizers (which we did because they are fantastic).  Drinks were never refilled.  I had to flag her down to order a second drink.  I wish I ever got her name so she could know how horrible she was.  

The tacos are very good.  I had a sandwhich tonight and regretted it.  I would go back to tacos next time.  They are overpriced for what you get, but they have great flavor.  

The appetizers are all fantastic.  I don't know if I would even order of the real menu anymore.  I want this place to be so much better, but it just isn't.
