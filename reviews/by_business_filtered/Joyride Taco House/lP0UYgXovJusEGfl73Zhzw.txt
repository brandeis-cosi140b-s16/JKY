They have amazing vegetarian Mexican food. I would call it Mexican nouveau rather than authentic Mexican. Way more interesting than the beans/rice/cheese places you typically find in the Phoenix area. We sat at the bar and the bartenders were very receptive to suggestions and imaginative with the drinks.
