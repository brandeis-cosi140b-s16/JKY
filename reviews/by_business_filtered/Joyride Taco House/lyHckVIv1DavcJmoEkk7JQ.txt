While the dessert was fabulous, the service was not what I would've expected from such a nice restaurant... One of our waiters brought us the wrong drinks, the other one came back only once out of the 2 hours we were there, and a third waiter filled my glass with water and pored it all over our table and kept going. Three stars for the food and zero stars for the rude service...
