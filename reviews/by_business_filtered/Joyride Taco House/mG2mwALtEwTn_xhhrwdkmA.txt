Thought overall it was an expensive meal for Mexican and have had better for sure.  The margaritas overall are average, but expensive at $9 a piece.  Better off with the pitchers of beer as those are cheaper.  Ordered the rockfish ceviche for an appetizer, which was nice and fresh tasting.  I have never been to a Mexican restaurant before where chips and salsa were not free of charge.  Not at this place and would not pay extra for salsa.  Got the Beast burrito, which the meat was flavored well, but with no typical sides was kind of disappointing.  Too much hype for a new restaurant.  Think you are just paying for the ambience.  In my book, Mexican should not be an expensive experience.

By the way, I like how Yelp filtered this review even though it is real.  I've had this happen before when writing negative reviews for places.  No doubt I ate there yesterday at the restaurant!
