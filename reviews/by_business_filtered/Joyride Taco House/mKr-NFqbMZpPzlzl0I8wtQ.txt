'hip' taco joint, really? gilbert is not nor will ever be in the least bit hip. Told it was a 20 minute wait on a wednesday nite and waited for an hour. strike one. Waiter asked if we wanted to see the menus, seriously? don't they teach you this on the first day of training? strike two. chips were way too salty and only one kind of salsa was chincy strike 2 1/2. i have had better tacos off of taco trucks in Yuma for 1/3 the cost. if you really feel that you can open a restaurant catering to 20-30 somethings and forget about everyone else I can envision the 'for rent' sign on your window much sooner rather than later. and finally, booths that seat 6 with 2 people sitting in them.  who ever designed this place should immediately be fired. poor layout, fair food, clueless servers. make that one star. want real food with knowledgeable service at fair prices? try si senor on alma school in chandler
