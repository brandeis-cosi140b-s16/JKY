Our party of four decided to try Joyride's Happy Hour and have an early dinner. We arrived at 4pm on a Saturday and were seated immediately. They offer their regular cocktails (not bottom shelf) during happy hour for $5. I had the Cucumber Serrano and it was the perfect blend of smooth and spicy! We enjoyed the house salsa while waiting, which had plenty of kick while still bursting with flavor. We ordered standard tacos, battered fish tacos, shrimp tacos and the nacho plate. Each dish was fresh and perfectly balanced. The white magic sauce makes the nachos out of this world! There is also ample bar and outside seating. I will definitely go back the next time I visit Phoenix!
