Went to Joyride Taco House for the first time last night for Taco Tuesday! Took a seat at the bar which is always my first seating preference.  The bar tender offered up a recommendation which I went with.  Had 3 tacos; carne asada, pork adabado and Baja crispy fish, plus a heaping bowl of guacamole garnished with slices of fresh Serrano chilies.  My friend had four tacos which included an extra carne asada!

Excellent bar and although the bar tenders were busy they took the time to chat with us which made us feel very welcome but most importantly the G&Ts were well made.  We Got there around 5 pm, there was already a nice crowd with positive energy.  I really liked the food here, great flavor and good variety.  Give it a try and let me know what you think!
