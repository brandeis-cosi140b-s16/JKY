We put Joyride to the ultimate test - Taco Tuesday on Cinco de Mayo! It was EXCELLENT! Of course there was a wait, which was to be expected. We weren't the only geniuses going for Mexican on Cinco de Mayo! The service outside while we were waiting was spot on! Drinks kept coming, along with the chips and salsa. When we were seated our server was happy, excited and in a genuinely great mood. Then you could really see how the entire place was all in! The hostess was running food, servers were delivering drinks and managers were clearing tables! And the food, top notch as always. No sacrifice in quality and no eternity wait times. Awesome place and fantastic experience!
