Enjoyed a nice lunch here with friends when I was in Gilbert on a recent weekend. We just walked up. No reservations. We waited just a short time (maybe 5 mins) for our table out on the patio for 9 to be set up. Service from the hostess to our server and the countless others that either brought our orders or refilled our drinks was friendly. They have a lot of young college-aged staff and I thought their customer service was excellent.

chips and salsa on the table as soon as you sit down... I went with a pineapple agua fresca. it was refreshing. kinda perfect on a warm day. 

I ordered the 3 taco combo. I went with pork adobada, crispy fish and braised beef. The pork adobada was deliciously guajillo simmered pork served with cabbage, radishes & onions. no cilantro for me in any of these orders. it was a real good taco especially with all the handmade tortillas. the crispy fish taco was excellent, it was a white fish beer battered & fried and served with guacamole, slaw in a white flour tortilla. yumm. the braised beef was served with avocado, cabbage, radish and onions. it was also very tasty. i was happy with all that i had ordered. my order came with a side and i went with the tomato rice but i found it to be a bit lacking in flavor. that was the only downer. everything else was great. 

we celebrated my nephew's 15th birthday at joy ride and we ordered him a caramel brownie. i didnt have any but it looked great. im sure it was as delicious as advertised... i look forward to eating here next time i'm in town.
