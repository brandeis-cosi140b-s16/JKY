So I previously posted a excellent review, but I will have to rescind that review for my dinner experience.
We had a less than enthusiastic waitress who was rude. This was clear as she sighed after every request and made it seem like it every request was super inconvenient. 
We weren't impressed by the salsa so we asked if they had other salsas. She brings out three and never mentions that she is charging us two dollars for every small bowl of salsa. We didn't like any of these any better than the first (but were charged $6 for the three salsas). 
Because I had had such a good experience before, I was hoping my friend would be equally impressed and love the food. 
We ordered the Bandito thinking that would be plenty of food for us to share. It was and it was delicious, but we were disappointed that we were charged $2 for every plate of four small corn tortillas when it's clearly evident that four is not enough. (Also not told about this charge).
For desert, I decided to spurge and get the churros. Churros were average, but you'll want to skip the chocolate and Carmel sauce ( which has no resemblence  of a sweet taste and tastes a bit what I would imagine battery acid to taste like).

I was shocked at the bill and decided to pay it and leave. We were not told about multiple additional charges on my bill. I was not in the mood to argue, but my friend was and the manager did a good job of attempting to make it right. 

 Joyride has great food. Still bad services overrides any desire any desire to come back to this restaurant and I will not be back.
