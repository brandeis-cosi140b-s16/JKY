Went to this spot a few months ago, had seen some pictures on Instagram someone posted. Tacos looked delicious in the picture. So as a craving(I was 5 months pregnant) we decided to go immediately. 

Loved the place, decorated very nicely. But if I am going to a restaurant that is rated 4 stars on yelp! I figured food would be amazing. 

Unfortunately it was not the case. Their shrimp tacos tasted a lot like charcoal and were cold. Definitely not tasty at all, couldn't really taste the shrimp flavor. Had their fish taco which seriously? Fish taco with a flour tortilla? Was awful... These tacos were simply not good at all. And were very small for the price.

Their horchata had a good flavor; but they give you a small cup and very little ice. You finish it before your meal gets there.

We had the cheese y mas. This was delicious. But as an appetizer I guess it would be a nice place to go just for a couple drinks and an appetizer. Other than that I don't recommend this place to go out and have a good dinner.
