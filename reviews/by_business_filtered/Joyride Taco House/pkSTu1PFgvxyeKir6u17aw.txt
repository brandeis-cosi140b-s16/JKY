My fiancé and I had a great experience here!  I had the short rib taco and the crispy fish taco. The crispy fish taco was amazing!  Absolutely loved it!  I was not as excited about the short rib taco though. It was ok. I will come back just for the crispy fish!

My fiancé had the three different kinds if ceviche and he loved it!  It was excellent!  He also ordered a blood orange margarita that was wonderful!  He did upgrade to top shelf tequila so I'm sure that made a difference. I don't normally get excited about margaritas, not my thing, but the blood orange one was delicious. I had a few sips, and I really liked it!!!

We sat out on the patio. Sun was going down and the misters were on, so it was cool enough. The atmosphere was nice. A bit loud but they play a good mix of music.

We will definitely go back!
