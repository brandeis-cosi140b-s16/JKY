I was actually trying to go to postinos- my AZ friends won't stop talking about it. I accidentally walked into joyride instead, So glad i did!!! Everything I had was insanely good. I love the funk decor, great music, very friendly (and good looking) staff. Service was quick! There's outdoor and indoor seating- it's comfortable and aesthetically pleasing. The food was yum. Yum YUM!! I had 3 tacos- braised beef, Tinga, and pork. First off all it's awesome that they even have Tinga on their menu. But the fact that it was good?! I'm grateful for being so tired after work to make this restaurant mistake. Oh!!! They serve aguas frescas too- they're take on them anyway. I had a cucumber one and I wish I had that recipe. I only wish I lived locally so I can return over abc over again.
