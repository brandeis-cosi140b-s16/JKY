Food was good but there was a mistake with the original pitcher of beer for my wife. This was corrected but obviously took time and then when the check arrived it contained the mistake pitcher as well as the correct one. We had 4 pitchers in total but were charged for 5, took a little more explanation than necessary but eventually I was thanked for pointing out that I was being overcharged. In a class establishment at this point I would have expected not just the removal of the beer we did not have but either a comp on one of the other beers or removal of a higher priced beer instead. That didn't happen so the tip was $4 light to reflect my displeasure
