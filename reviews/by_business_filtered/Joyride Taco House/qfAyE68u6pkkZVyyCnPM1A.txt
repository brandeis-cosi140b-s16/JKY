One of the best customer service experiences in a restaurant ever! Thank goodness for good servers & bartenders to guide me through my traditionally awkward journey to a new eatery. Upon existing my car I do remember saying "ah, shit they're playing techno, do you want to go somewhere else?" Also weary because the dirty word "hipster" was used to describe the place. But ALAS! The drinks were fantastic and I'm overly pleased with the beer selection. I personally got a cucumber mint tequila "juice" and loved it! I'm looking forward to trying out the different combinations of flavors and liquors (hey there's a logical excuse to drink more!). Food was fantastic as well. I ordered the standard the Baja fish tacos. They are served up in taco stands and I could have managed to polish off one more. The flavor combinations are classic enough to please a skeptic and creative enough to satisfy the more adventurous such as myself. The date got a chimi-style carne Asada burrito and claimed it to be the best he's had in Phoenix this far. And that says a lot, trust me. His burrito and my tacos had fresh sliced avocado to top off our foodie perfection. Even the restrooms were an aesthetically pleasing experience. Prices were reasonable, and like I said, our server and other employees eased our social anxieties and earned their 25-30% tip to boot. I will quote, "If this is a hipster place then I guess I will join them."
