Yummy food ! The enchiladas are the best that I have had . Margaritas are good but a little pricey. 
The patio is awesome, spacious and cool, funky decor.
Service is good, nothing to write home about.
Go for the enchilada and margaritas for sure!
Good chips and guacamole also
One of downtown Gilbert's best choices!
