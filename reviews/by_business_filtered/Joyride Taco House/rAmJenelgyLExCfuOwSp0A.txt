I like the food, but they have something wrong with the way they seat people.  I don't know why it is all wrong, as Federal and Windsor don't seem to have a problem.  First off, they say they are on the app "No Wait" - but they aren't.  For a while, they showed up, but where listed as 'closed' all the time.  Now, I get a text from 'No Wait' but when I go on the app, I can't find them, and even when I use the link - not there.  Last night I never even got a text that my table was ready.  I am guessing the hostess deleted me.

Anyway, we showed up and there were literally (I counted them) 12 empty tables, and we were going to have to wait 45 minutes.  I guess they were short-staffed - but it is only a guess because she wouldn't tell me why I couldn't have one of those tables.  She was kind of rude.  

I have never been there without there being some fiasco surrounding getting a table.  How could they not have this figured out?  They aren't new at this.
