We had a great experience at Joyride taco!  We went on a Friday for lunch after hearing about it on the radio.  The location is central and the restaurant decor is fun and casual - a great fit with all the hip new restaurants in the area.  Our food was delicious!  The elote corn appetizer was great and the churros dessert was amazing.  But the service was truly what sets this restaurant apart.  Our server was friendly and attentive, and at least 2 of the managers stopped by to check on how our meal was.  In fact, I guess our main course took longer than usual to come out (although I didn't really even notice) and the manager picked up our entire bill!  That's great customer service.  We will definitely be back!
