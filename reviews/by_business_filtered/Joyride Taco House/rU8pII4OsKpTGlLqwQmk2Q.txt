Packed and for good reason.. Went for taco Tuesday and great prices on a variety of tacos ($2) and margaritas. Best taco is carnitas, best margarita is the pear.. Just my humble opinion.

Great atmosphere and feels a bit like old town Scottsdale, except that the bartenders and staff actually give a crap about their patrons.

Come and see for yourself!
