We were seated 5 minutes to 6 pm and they honored the happy hour prices so we tried 1 of each! It is nice to have someone who likes the opposite of you so I loved the veggie and fish tacos and she carried on about the fried fish, beef and pork. The blood orange margarita hit the spot as well. Great service, fast and friendly.
