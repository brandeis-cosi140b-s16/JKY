This place is really good. I ordered three street tacos, two chicken and one carne asada. The chips and salsa were so good i didn't want to eat my tacos when they arrived. The atmosphere was young and hip. The music was was a little loud but i kinda liked it. The best part of this place was the service. We had our cups constantly refilled and people asking us if we needed anything. They kept on bringing chips and salsa to our table the entire time. The only reason why I'm not giving this place a 5 star is because the price was a little high. It was just me and my husband during lunch. We ordered water and we both had the street tacos. Our bill was in the thirties YIKES!!
