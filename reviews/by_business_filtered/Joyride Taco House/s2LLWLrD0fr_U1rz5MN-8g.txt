Great concept, fantastic food and warm, open, laid back feel.  If I lived close, this could very well become my regular watering hole...

Their spin on Mexican fare is pretty damned good.  Everything my friends and I had was awesome. I highly recommend the crispy fish tacos and the blood orange margarita!

The parking is a tad weird, but it should not be enough to deter you.
