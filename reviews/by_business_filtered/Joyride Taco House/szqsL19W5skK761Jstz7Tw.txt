I really liked it here.  Nice atmosphere, friendly waiters, cute decor, The Clash playing on the loud speakers (a wee bit too loud for my liking), and best of all - prompt chips and salsa delivery (for those of us who are famished and just don't like to wait).  Indoor and outdoor seating - with the choice of 2 patios.

Chips were good - not burnt or too thick, house salsa was nice with a little smokey flavor and not too spicy for those who are spice-challenged.  I ordered a cucumber mint agua fresca which was really light and refreshing.  Also got the nachos with a little added corn.  The server was right when he told me, "it's like a meal."  Totally filled me up and I definitely had a lot left over.  

Will definitely be back to try different agua fresca flavors and their veggie tacos!
