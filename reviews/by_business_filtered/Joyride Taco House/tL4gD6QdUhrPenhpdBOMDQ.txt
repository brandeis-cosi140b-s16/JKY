Wowzers! This place's food is Rock&Roll in your mouth. Great service and great ambiance. The food is obviously prepared with fresh ingredients and you can tell. The meats they use in their tacos are slow cooked to perfection with love. Small portions on the street tacos and higher then expected price point but satisfied nonetheless. 

My only mark down comes from when we requested some cucumber slices instead of chips for the salsa. The cucumbers they delivered had mold on them. They were very apologetic; however, it should have been noticed (appeared the cucumbers came from the bar not the kitchen). Not to take anything away from their chips as they were really good and salsa outstanding.
