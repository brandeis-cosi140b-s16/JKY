Don't get me wrong, this place is good. If you have not been here, come. They have very good carne asada, and their food is full of flavor. If you want authentic Mexican food, do not come here. This is a great blend of authentic and modern. 

This location had decent service, but it is laid backed and chill like the other location. I can never really understand this concept. I am not a fan of waiting for drinks to be refilled, or having to flag down waiters for service. 

All in all, we enjoy Joyride once or twice a year. Worth trying out.
