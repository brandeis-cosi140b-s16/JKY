Another great addition to Central Phoenix!  I absolutely love the atmosphere and decor of this place...wouldn't furnish my house this way, but totally appreciate and love it!  

The staff was super friendly and helpful with suggestions.  The food was great - we tried 6 different kinds of tacos and ordered a few sides too.  The agua fresca was amazing...combo of pineapple and strawberry - yummy!
