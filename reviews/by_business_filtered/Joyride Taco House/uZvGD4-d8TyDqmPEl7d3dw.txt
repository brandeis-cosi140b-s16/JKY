I keep reading about people going to Joyride for Taco Tuesday but they neglect to mention that the $2.00 tacos are not available until after 2pm.  I went last week at 1pm for lunch and was a bit disappointed that I couldn't get the tacos for the Taco Tuesday price.  

I found the food to be on the spicy side, which some people like but I don't.  The chips they brought out was good and the salsa was fine-but again, it was too spicy for me. 

Good atmosphere.
