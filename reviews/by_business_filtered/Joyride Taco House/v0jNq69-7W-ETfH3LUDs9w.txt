Honestly, I don't understand all the positive reviews this place has. I've been there twice now and both times it was truly the worst customer service I've had at a restaurant/bar in recent memory. 
Both times we've waited at least 10 minutes after sitting down for anyone to come by and take drink orders, had at least 4 different people serving us through the course of our meal and felt like total inconveniences for the staff. 
The last time I was there I ordered a vodka cranberry and I kid you not, the waitress said "is that on the menu?" I just stared at her and said, umm.. I'm not sure. I didn't look at the drink menu". A vodka cranberry? Really? 
The only things I like about joyride are the location and the food is great too. However, with such terrible customer service I'll eat food I like less elsewhere.
