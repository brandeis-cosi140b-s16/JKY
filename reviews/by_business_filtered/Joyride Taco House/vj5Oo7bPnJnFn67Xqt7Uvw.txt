We came to try the tacos, but they messed up our appetizer order so to correct the order we kept the carnitas nachos and they still gave us the carne asada nachos. Soooo we got too full to order anything else. We'll have to come back for the tacos because I'm confident they'll be as delicious as the nachos were! Both dishes were flavorful, the meat was tender & not chewy, And the portions were huge - enough to share for 4 people. The cheese didn't get dry, the creme wasn't too runny, it was simply tasty!
We also had the almond horchata w/rum in it. DEE-LISH-OUS lol
