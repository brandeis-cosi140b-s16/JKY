I like this place despite the fact that most of my friends told me never to go here. However, I like it mainly for the atmosphere and cute decor. I went here for lunch last weekend expecting mediocrity and was pleasantly surprised, but mostly by the atmosphere and decor. The food is mediocre. There are definitely better Mexican and/or Southwestern food spots in Phoenix, but the patio and location are great. Service was just okay, but that is to be expected from most places in Phoenix these days anyway. Our server was nice, but looked as if she was on her way to the YMCA to workout. Not a deal breaker, but she definitely did not dress the way I would have  expected for the decor. It just did not match and that was the first thing that I noticed. She wasn't overly friendly nor was she standoffish. She was just okay, and I got the feeling that is the standard for this restaurant. I know that this place is a part of a grouping of restaurants owned by the same people  and this is definitely one of my favorites of their pursuits. Their cocktail list was really good, and, again, the ambiance was good. Would I come back? Yes. But, probably not for a while and not until I scoured Phoenix for a better alternative. Yet, it is close to my house so they will have my business again solely because of proximity and the fact that is was average relative to other spots close to me.
