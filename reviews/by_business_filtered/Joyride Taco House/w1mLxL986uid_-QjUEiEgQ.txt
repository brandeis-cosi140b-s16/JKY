4.5 (but can't put that.) Why the 4.5 and not 5 you ask, well cilantro was slightly in my girlfriend's taco after she stated she didn't want it. Service awesome-check!

Food awesome-check. I got 'the beast' burrito and it was GREAT. She got the fish taco-alright. Not knocking her socks off but good enough to suit for a little snack.

So come in, give it a try. Cool atmosphere, good staff (as I see so far, very attentive) so worth a try.

Cheers!
