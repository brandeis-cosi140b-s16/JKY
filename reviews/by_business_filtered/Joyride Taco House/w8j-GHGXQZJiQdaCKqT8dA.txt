Soooo, I made the trek out to Gilbert to give Joyride a whirl and I am pleased to say that my gasoline was not wasted. Everything was fantastic! The atmosphere is cool and the staff were completely helpful and friendly. We arrived for an early dinner and were initially blown away by the street corn and the ceviche. They were so fresh and damn near a complete meal all by themselves. But I was not to be cheated out of some meat (and no, fish does not qualify as meat).

For our entrees we ordered the Beast burrito along with three street tacos (carnitas, short rib and carne asada). The carne asada was flavorful and moist - so unlike the tire rubber you get from other places. The carnitas and short rib were also awesome. We rounded out the meal (and ourselves) with vanilla pudding and I almost had tears in my eye it was so freakin good.

We shoveled everything back and doused it with some Cucumber Serrano mixed drinks along with a Corona - the coolest looking 32 ounce beer bottle I have laid eyes on in some time. So tasty. 

The patio looks amazing (although I can't say that I even contemplated braving the 112 degree temperatures when we were there) and should be stellar when the weather creeps down. Will definitely be back!
