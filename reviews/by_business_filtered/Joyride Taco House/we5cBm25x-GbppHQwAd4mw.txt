We love Joyride and had only been to the Gilbert location until today. The service (Vanessa and a nice gal who wanted to buy my necklace-lol) was great. 

I tried the cucumber Serrano margaritas which were awesome (not too sweet and rimmed with a chipotle salt)  and the tacos of course were amazing, Yum!
