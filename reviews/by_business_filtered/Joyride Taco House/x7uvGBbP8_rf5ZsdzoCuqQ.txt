This is how a restaurant should operate. Amazing staff, amazing food, amazing atmosphere, and amazing rolls of toilet paper with their logo stamped on it.  

Gabby, Daniel, Ashley, Jeremy (501), all take care of us very well every time we visit!  Even the new faces working there make us feel at home.  

If you come to town, are planning a trip to uptown, or just need a nice place to dine with friends without hassle, please come take a Joyride!  You won't be disappointed!
