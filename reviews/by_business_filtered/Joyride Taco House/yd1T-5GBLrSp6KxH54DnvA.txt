We decided to give this place a second try after poor service the first visit. We were let down once again, so we won't be back. Food was lukewarm (veggie enchiladas), service was extremely slow (again)  and even though it is clearly noted on the website menu,  NO ARIZONA WINE. Too bad. Going forward  I will spend money on a real local first business.
