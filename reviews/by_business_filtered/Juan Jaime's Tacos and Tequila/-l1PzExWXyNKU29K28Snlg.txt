We have lived in area for two years. We go there at least once a week. The food is good and the service is great. Great salsa bar and outstanding tacos. Their taco salads are really good too. The most expensive item on the menu is like $10. They make a skinny margarita that my wife loves.  The best wait staff is Eric, Danny, or Tia.
