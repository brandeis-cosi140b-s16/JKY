JD and I stopped in for a late lunch on Superbowl Sunday.  The first thing that I noticed and loved was the salsa bar!  I am a salsa fanatic and always ask for a trough of it at every mexican restaurant I visit. How nice to be able to help myself! So we wasted no time ordering chips and a plain cheese quesadilla. I was in salsa heaven! We got every kind they had and mixed up some tasty concoctions. Chips were thin, crispy and great with salsa and our quesadilla was good too (I think it'd be hard to mess one up really)! 

I had a chicken soft taco and a cheese and onion enchilada, JD had a chicken burrito. The enchilada was the very best, covered in a spicy red sauce with just enough cheese. My chicken taco was fine but JD's burrito was pretty blah. He said it tasted like mush. I tasted it too and agreed, I think because all you could really taste was rice. There wasn't a whole lot of chicken in it. We agreed that the salsa bar and the enchilada saved the place from failing (in our eyes) and agreed to give it another go in the future.
