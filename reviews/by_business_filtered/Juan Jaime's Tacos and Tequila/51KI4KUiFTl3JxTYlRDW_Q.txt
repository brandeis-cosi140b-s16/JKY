Cool salsa bar and good tacos are the staple.  My wife likes it as do our kids.  This restaurant really works for us.  We are usually seated right away, the waiters and waitresses are helpful and friendly and the food is consistently good.
Every now and then the bartender is a little slow, and I wish they had a better beer selection.  Other than that, this place is one of our regular spots.
