Had dinner on Friday night. Restaurant was crowded but we were able to get a table quickly. Service was friendly and attentive. Margarita was average, but the food and salsa were excellent! The saut√©ed vegetables in the vegetarian burrito as well as the quesadilla in particular were fresh and tasty!
