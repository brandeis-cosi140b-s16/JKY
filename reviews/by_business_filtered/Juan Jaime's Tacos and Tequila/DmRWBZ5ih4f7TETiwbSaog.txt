This is a really great casual place, with a decent size patio and bar that opens up to the patio.  Its a fairly limited menu - mainly burritos and tacos - but they are great!  And very reasonably priced.  Our favorite is the enchilada style burrito, with red sauce.    

And they are dog friendly, so we'll often walk over with the pup.

They also have a great flavored vodka selection, in addition to lots of tequila choices.
