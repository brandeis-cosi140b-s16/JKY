Don't let the residents of North Scottsdale keep this place all to themselves... 

JJ's (as the locals call it) is an inviting little cantina style restaurant --- with lots of big windows, high top tables, and garage style windows that open up to the delightful patio. It's the perfect stop for a casual family dinner or happy hour with friends after a long day at work.

The Margarita... fill it up again!!!

I'll start by saying that I am a very picky margarita sipper. It can't be too sweet, but definitely not too sour... and I like to taste the tequila but not get punched in the face with it. Juan Jamie's is home to my favorite margarita in Scottsdale.

The secret lies in their homemade sweet and sour concoction made daily with fresh squeezed lemon and limes. Marry this with a little triple sec and tequila of your choice and POW! I can't think of a more refreshing drink on a hot day... or a cold day...

The "Tres Amigos" - 3 parts AWESOME...

The "Tres Amigos" is an edible trio of homemade salsa, warm cheesy queso, and authentic guacamole served with a basket of house made tortilla chips.  I dare you to find a bad combination. Salsa with the cheese, cheese with the guacamole, guacamole with the guacamole... you get the picture. ;-)

I could eat these tacos all day long...

So simple, NOT boring. JJ's serves several kinds of tacos including white meat chicken, grilled mahi mahi, carnitas and shrimp... but I can't get enough of the perfectly seasoned ground beef!! You get your choice of flour or corn tortillas. 

Each taco comes with two tortillas bound together with special cheese blend --- they keep the toppings simple with a little fresh cilantro and white onion. Garnish till your heart's content with one of the 6 homemade salsas at the salsa cart...

Juan Jamie's makes everyone feel at home. So whether you live in the neighborhood or not, it's worth the trip. You'll be glad you did and I'll bet it won't be your last. :)
