Had the three taco lunch special.

Service was friendly and prompt.

Offered chips and salsa and the salsa that comes with the dish, albeit very mild, is good.  Tried an assortment of other salsas from the salsa bar.  The "taco sauce" was somewhat bland, the salsa verde was very good (and spicy) but the other salsas I tried were lacking punch.

Ordered one carne asada, one chicken and one carnitas.

All three tacos didn't quite have enough onions or cilantro for my tastes but the bartender brought some extra when I asked.

Carne Asada really needed more marinade as it was bland.

Chicken was good, but certainly benefitted from the salsa verde and a couple shakes of salt.

Carnitas, a little over greasy, but flavor was good.

There's not a huge beer selection, which is a positive, but had he standards and a good selection of mexican beers.

Hopefully they can get the spice levels set correctly and I would be more than happy to give it another shot.
