This place just never seems to wow me. Been there a few times but it is always just meh. Not great, not awful. The last time I went the server seemed a tad annoyed with my table. Not sure as to why? Though she did provide good service. 

The food: Chips and salsa are good! Absolutely love that they are free, and there is a nice little salsa bar which is cool. I ordered the vegetarian tacos the last time I went and they were just alright. Kind of basic and bland. Also not a big fan of their rice, and I usually like rice from pretty much anywhere. 

One big pro for me is that they are very reasonably priced, which is nice in the expensive area of North Scottsdale.

This place is just okay, not somewhere I crave the food from, but not awful.
