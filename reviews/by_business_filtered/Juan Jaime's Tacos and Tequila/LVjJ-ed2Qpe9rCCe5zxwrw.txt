Mediocre lunch spot. Reasonably priced. I had the taco salad with carnitas (pork), the salad seemed fresh and the pork was really good there just was not very much of it at all. The chips were cold and not very crunchy but fine. My husband had the steak burrito with no complaints. The service was fine and fast.
