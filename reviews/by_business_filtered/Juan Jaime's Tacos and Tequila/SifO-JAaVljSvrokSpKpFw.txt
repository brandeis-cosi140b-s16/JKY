The name honestly says it all, it's about the TACOS AND THE TEQUILA! If you are looking for a place to go with the best happy hour margaritas, you've come to the right place! The margs are a steal, not to mention they are made with fresh ingredients and pretty strong too !!  That's a rare combo to find, so while you are filling up on said margaritas, you eat some chips and order a hard shell taco with beans and rice and BAM your night is a win win.

For the people who bashed on this place pretty hard, don't let their reviews scare you into passing up this place!! If you plan to come to JJ's (abbreviated because this place is near and dear to my heart) to get some fancy, elaborate Mexican food with tons of options of the menu, you will be disappointed. BUT ! if you come to JJ's to watch a game or two, listen to some interesting music choices, have some drinks with your friends, meet some interesting characters and then eat a taco, you won't be disappointed in the slightest  !!!
