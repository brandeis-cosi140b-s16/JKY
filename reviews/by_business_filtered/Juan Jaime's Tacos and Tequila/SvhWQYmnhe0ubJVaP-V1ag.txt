Stopped in here for a quick lunch bite with my friends before we were off to get our hair done at Primp and Blow. Loved the green salsa best (hotter which I prefer), I enjoyed my cadillac margarita, one of my friends ordered a mango margarita and the other two-house. Considering we were going to be having a big dinner later that night, I opted to have their taco salad with chicken. Loved it!! Included with guacamole, very flavorful and filling!! Also the house chips are light, warm and crisp!!
Definitely plan to return here soon!
