To me 5 stars are for when the service, atmosphere, food and drinks all add up to be a great experience.

Well the service was top notch....our waitress was wonderfully friendly, helpful and happy.

The atmosphere is clean and simple but that is what adds to the charm, especially in the afternoon.....when the sun comes filtering through during happy hour it really is a magical spot....one of the many reasons I love the desert.

The food was very tasty...I tried the grilled chicken tacos and my husband tried the ground beef tacos....both very good.

An ADDED BONUS to this place is definitely the extra station they have set up for you to choose your condiments. What is an even BIGGER bonus is that you are free to take home any ones you particularly like. BUT WAIT....what gets even better is that is is all prepared on the premises....and I must say delicious....there is always a huge taste difference between "previously prepared" and "home made". 

Another added bonus I must point out is their Margaritas ..... I was hesitant to order one (even though they were only $3 during happy hour) ... because I can't handle sugary drinks....the waitress assured us these would not be sweet as they use NO pre mixers...YAY....she was right ....these Margaritas tasted real! Equal levels of sour to sweet.

So service, atmosphere, food and drinks were all wonderful....hence the five stars.
