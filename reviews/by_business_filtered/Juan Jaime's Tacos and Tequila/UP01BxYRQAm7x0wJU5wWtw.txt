I've been eating here for a long time and the first thing I want to mention is the rice and beans. They are the closest to my moms flavor out of any restaurant. Nobody does it like mom of course but these guys are close. So why did they only get three stars from me you say? Because they're very expensive for the portion you get. Not the rice and beans but the lunch specials of two tacos with rice and beans. It's two mini tacos and boy are they small. The other complain is that they have a bad turn around and the new employees can never hang. The one female that's been there for a while is good though.
Yes food is good but portions are not IMO.

I don't recommend taking kids to this restaurant during lunch business hours. It gets packed and busy so the wait can be too much for any kid.
