I don't even yelp, but this experience called for one. The worst service I have ever experienced. 

We sat down and were brought chips and salsa and water. The blonde waitress then came to take our order and said she forgot her pen and would be right back. 10 minutes later after she took the table next to ours order (who came in after us) and brought them drinks we decided to move to the bar. Maybe we would have better service and luck there. 

The bartender, Martin, was just as bad, if not worse. We sat down and tried to order all at once. He only let us order drinks. 10 minutes later I said we are ready to order when you're ready, his reply "I'm not ready". Never heard someone refuse to let me eat before. Another what seemed like 10 minutes passed and he said you're next. We were not next. After we were finally able to order and eat I just wanted to pay the bill and leave, which of course took him another 5-10minutes. He swore behind the bar and sat in the corner talking about everyone sitting at the bar with the waitress. 

The place was not even busy. Terrible service and rude workers.
