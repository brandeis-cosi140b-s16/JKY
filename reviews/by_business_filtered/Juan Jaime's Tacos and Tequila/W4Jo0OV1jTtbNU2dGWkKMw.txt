Do not understand why Jaun Jaime's Tacos and Tequila would rate 5 stars. 

I ordered the chicken burrito "enchilada" style. Which means they pour some sauce on top and charge you a couple of more bucks.  Pass on that.  The sauces are uninspired and you will do better at the salsa bar.

It is weird that they charge for chips but you could probably make a small salad at the "salsa bar" for free. Did not try the margaritas, so maybe thats the key to enjoyment. 

Fast and friendly service. Uninspired but edible food.  I'd meet friends there, but I wouldn't suggest it.
