I have had a great experience almost every time I have gone into Juan Jaime's.  Usually, I have gone in for lunch, and I have been greeted with a smile and quick service by the staff.  It is seat yourself, which is nice (except for when it is very busy). The have a spectacular and diverse menu...hot dogs really??? hah. I love their cilantro and white oinon on top of the steak tacos.
seriously cute waitresses too.
