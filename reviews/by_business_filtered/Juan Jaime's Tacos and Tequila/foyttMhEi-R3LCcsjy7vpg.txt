This place is the best! I eat here once a week at LEAST with my family. The prices are low and the menu is basic and easy. Their kitchen is open until 2am, and it tastes the same no matter what time you go. I can't stress enough how great this place is. The service is good, the food is better. (Try the shrimp burrito enchilada style!)
