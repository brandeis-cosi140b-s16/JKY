Walked in got some free chiqulee. Let's start off with the good. The queso dip and the guac was very good. The margarita was also a good deal because it was happy hour on Saturday. 

Now let's get to the bad. This place use salt like a salt refinery. The food was awful. I got the ground beef and I feel like they made it out of salt. The soup taste like salt water with a little bit of tomato. How the hell does this place have 4 stars. Don't ever eat here.
