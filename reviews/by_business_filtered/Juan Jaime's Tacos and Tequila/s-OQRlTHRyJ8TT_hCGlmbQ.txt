Mexican bar with some class in North Scottsdale. Open atmosphere, large patio, with a dual sided outside-connected bar. The chips are thin and hot with a salsa bar with 5 different types of varying heat levels. I usually get the tasty street-style tacos with a big portion of quality meat filling. Good selection of mexican beers on tap. There is one negative, their house margarita is a little weak, in a small glass, and was filled with too much ice. I hit up this place often though because of the combo of quality, quick service, and price.
