Let me just say that this has been a long time coming...

Living across the street for over two years now, Juan Jaime's is my go to place... Really it is the perfect fix for 'anytime' food or drink. 

Shane and Martin (Marteen) are the two guys that make this place what it is... Ask anyone who comes here consistently and they will tell you that its these guys will take care of you at the bar and make you're night more memorable, regardless of how it started!  

Coolest reasons to come here? ** Always, ALWAYS open until 2am. Most places close up shop around here if the heartbeat drops but you can always count one Juan's to have a drink left for you. ** Loaded quesadillas and chips and salsa are worth the trip in itself, ask Martin to spray some salt and lime juice on your chips to get that 'little extra'
