Always always always going to pick local establishments over corporate dining, and Mexican food is no exception. Juan Jaime's is a quaint little spot next to the corporate powerhouse that is Outback Steakhouse but next door to my favorite masseuse. Atmosphere is A+, Drinks A+ (i love a variety of tequila), and the food is a solid A. I've had the opportunity to work for another local Mexican food restaurant that I won't name for respect purposes but I'm sure you've been "UP" the street from one no matter where you are in the valley, and that combined with my childhood filled with great Tex-Mex cuisine can tell you that Juan Jaime does things right. Mexican food is a hard cuisine to perfect due to the variety of preparation techniques, and he nailed it! Salsa...amazing! And it's not overpriced food or drink! 
I truly hope that Juan Jaime continues to provide a service and product that makes Chefs like myself feel comfortable supporting local business!!

SUPPORT LOCAL...THEY ARE YOUR NEIGHBORS!!
