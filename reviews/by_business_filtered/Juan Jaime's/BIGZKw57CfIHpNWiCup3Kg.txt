I went last Sunday with a friend n I was really surprise about how many tequilas they have for not a big place not a big fan of it but it's nice the fact a mexican place has that. 

For other part they have clamato and squirt!!! How many bars have that???? Actually one of the only ways I drink tequila is with squirt :) so I was really happy .....

My friend had the tacos n they looked amazing they looked like real tacos def have to come back to try those!! And come back for a great service with Aaron....
