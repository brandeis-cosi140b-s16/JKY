The one and only reason I am giving them one star is because the cooks have no clue what gluten free means.  As of 2013, it was reported that 1/3 of the population in the United States is gluten free.  Anyplace that serves food needs to understand what gluten free means so they can inform their customers of their food choices.

Otherwise, the environment seemed comfortable.  The bar looked like a good place to meet someone for a drink.
