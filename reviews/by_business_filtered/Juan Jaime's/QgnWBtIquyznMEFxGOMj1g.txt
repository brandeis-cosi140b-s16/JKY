JJ's is a staple for my office. It's close, consistent, and well priced. Their Happy Hour is also a great value, and goes later from 4-8 pm DAILY. Beat that! $4 house margaritas pack a punch along with the value. Not a ton of flavor - but take a trip to the salsa bar and add your own. I feel like it's healthier with less grease and maybe that's the flavor compromise. One of the best choices in the shopping center, by far.
