Went there for Friday night happy hour based on Yelpers' reviews and the suggestion of a friend.  Close to home, so figured why not?  Did not expect how wonderful it would be.  We got there close to 7 and were able to score a table in the bar area.  Had the $3 house margarita (rocks with salt) and was delighted that it didn't suck.  It was actually quite good for the money.  Had the two taco dealie - one grilled chicken, one steak - in the crispy shells ... I think about them daily and cannot wait to go back for more!!!  Is it wrong to daydream about tacos?  LOL!  Yeah, we had to pay for our chips and salsa, but it was bottomless chips and they were fresh and crispy, and the salsa was very fresh and oh so tasty.  Good variety on the salsa bar.  Highly recommend!  Oh, and one of the bartenders is total eye candy ;)  Bonus!!!  Oh!  And I also love that their happy hour runs until 8PM which is great for people who get off work late.
