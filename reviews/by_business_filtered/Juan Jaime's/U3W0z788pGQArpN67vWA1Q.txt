I don't "Yelp" much but this place deserves a good review! We strolled in a few weeks ago after shopping at Nordstrom Rack and enjoyed their happy hour, and then went back the next night for dinner. This is the one Mexican place my husband and I can go to and not feel sick afterwards. Their food is super fresh and the 3 servers we have had on the 3 different times we have visited have all been great -- attentive and welcoming. After living in Chandler for 2 years now, I'm just bummed I didn't find this place sooner!
