Just went here to celebrate my mom's birthday with our whole family of 15 people.  The service was great, always had a full drink and basket of chips.

The chicken tacos are about as good as they get!  Absolutely delicious!  The salsa bar is amazing as well.

Didn't drink on this occasion but definitely looks like a great place for happy hour .. $2.50 domestic drafts, $3.00 margaritas.

The server even brought my mom a margarita with a candle lit in the middle of it! Would definitely recommend this place to anyone who's looking for a great taco and happy hour!!!
