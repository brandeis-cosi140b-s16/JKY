**UPDATE** Totally earned more points in my book that the owner cares to read the reviews. The menu said they charged for chips. Its good to know that they don't. I will definitely be coming back. Overall it was a nice place.

This was the first time I had ever been. I found it online and decided to go to happy hour. The atmoshere was lively with a variety of people eating, drinking, and talking. The food was great. I got two tacos (steak and carnitas) which was delicious. The beans and rice are ok, I have had better. You also can't beat the cheap and strong happy hour margaritas. I was feeling good after two. The salsa bar was a nice touch. 

Now for what I would suggest. I think its crazy that you have to pay for chips but the salsa bar is free??  Also, please get more waiters. Our waiter has several tables to wait on and it took forever.  Poor guy was running all night. While the table next to us had their own personal waitress. 

This is a nice place for happy hour with freinds. Just be prepared for a long dinner waiting on the server.
