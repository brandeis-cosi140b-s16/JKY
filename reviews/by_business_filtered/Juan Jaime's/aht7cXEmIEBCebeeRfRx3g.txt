I typically go here for a quick bite of Mexican food with friends or just to get a drink. I like to order out due to the countless times I have had bad experience with one guy behind the bar. He acts like he has a hang over and he couldn't get someone to cover his shift every time I go in. LOL Decent food but small portions. I want bigger burros!
