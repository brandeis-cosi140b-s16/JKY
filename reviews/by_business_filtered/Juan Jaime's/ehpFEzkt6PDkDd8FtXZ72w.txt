Place was really good.  
Went here cause someone recommended it to me.  Tacos were good.  I had the charizo and eggs and the carnitas both were great.  Carnitas wasn't too spicy wasn't too plain. Refried beans are amazing. Nachos were good.  Killed it quick.  Service was friendly but not as fast. Best Arnold Palmer I had to far though.
