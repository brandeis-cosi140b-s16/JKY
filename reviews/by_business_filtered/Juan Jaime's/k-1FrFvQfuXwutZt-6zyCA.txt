Very underwhelming... I used to really like Juan Jamie's, but now that I've experienced Canteen on Mill Ave I realize it's just not that good. The margaritas are pretty weak, the chips and salsa or chips and whatever you might order are grossly overpriced and the tacos are just not all that flavorful... totally "meh" in every way.
