Nice location - okay food.  This place took over ChopSticks according to a friend and kept some of the decor ha! I can dig - recycle!  ChopSticks to Juan Jaime's?? Go figure!  Food was decent I'm not bashing it but if I can order the same at the Baja Fresh com'on!  They have great happy hour prices and for a long time too 4pm to 8pm!  Service was lacking....and the place can get kinda loud...what? I said LOUD!  I think if you're hanging with the boys tonight for happy hour I would recommend this place -- otherwise go elsewhere for food.
