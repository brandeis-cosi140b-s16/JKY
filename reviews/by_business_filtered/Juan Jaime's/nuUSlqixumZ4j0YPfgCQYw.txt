So we came to this place and it's actually really good. Their salsa bar here is small but has amazing tasting salsa. We ordered the nacho Grande with no jalape√±os and simple delicious. Very basic like most nachos but yet it wasn't. The for my dinner I got the tres taco plate with the fillers of grilled shrimp, grilled steak, and mahi mahi with refried beans and rice. Each taco by themselves were simple tasteful. But when you add the lime that they offer. It releases this excellent flavor for each one and made them taste better even though they were great in the beginning. The atmosphere is perfect, amazing music that plays and just awesome. We'll probably come here for more food and some possibly drinks :)
