Unfortunately I wasn't impressed... And I really wanted to be! Because it's so close to where we live- but it wasn't anything special. 

I had the tacos... And they were just "eh" They have a salsa bar... Which sounds cool, but again- it's not really anything impressive. Service was fine! No problem there. We had a really nice guy serve us-
