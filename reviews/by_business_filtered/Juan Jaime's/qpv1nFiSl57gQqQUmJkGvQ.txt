Ashley was a great server. She had a suggestion for everything on the menu. We were there for Happy Hour which is everyday from 4PM-7PM. When we ordered the fish tacos, she suggested adding a great verde sauce- which wasn't on the menu. 

I ordered the house margarita on the rocks. They're made from a mix and the first one was tasty and the second one seemed a little heavier on the mix. Happy Hour margaritas were $2.50.
