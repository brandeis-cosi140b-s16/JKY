This location is a little tricky to find... It's in the back of the shopping center, right next to the Cox Communications store. 

This place is very good. They have a great selection of authentic Mexican food, and they also have a very great Tequila bar. 

If you are planning on drinking, make sure that you go for their Happy Hour. They have some great drink specials. 


What's nice about this place is that the charge for the food is based off of what you get, not the meat. You can get a burrito with Grilled Mahi Mahi, and it is the same price as their Grilled Steak. Very tasty. 

Also, make sure that you get some Chips and Salsa. They have a great salsa bar with very fresh salsas and toppings. Their chips are cooked right there, and they have that great thin and crisp texture that makes eating them quite addicting. 

If you're looking for some great Mexican food right around the corner from the Chandler Fashion Center, look no further. This is the place to be!
