One of my meetup groups decided to have a meeting at Juan Jaime's.  I had driven by the location and never even noticed it!  Parking is a little crowded even though it is in a strip center.  We were promptly greeted and our server was wonderful - very attentive during the 3 hours we ate and drank.  We all tried the house Margaritas and not only are they strong, but they have a wonderful taste!  Chips were light and crunchy - I like that style even though they are oily.  Many salsas to choose from, all ranging from mild to medium in heat - nothing too spicy.  I had the tostada and taco plate and really enjoyed it.
