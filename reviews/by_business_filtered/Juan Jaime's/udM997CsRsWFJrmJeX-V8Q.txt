My company just moved to a new office and this place is really close so because I'm unfamiliar with the area I decided to give it a try.  At first glance it seems okay and I like that they have a salsa bar but that's where it ends.  Being someone that doesnt eat meat I was basically left with cheese enchiladas or the vegetarian burrito, so not feeling like eating a half pound of cheese I ordered the burrito.  After waititng about 15 minutes the waitress and some guy from the kitchen come back to inform me that the rice in the burrito is cooked in a chicken stock so they wanted to know if it should be included.  Okay, so thanks for letting me know that I guess, but now my burrito is going to consist of some black beans and bell peppers...Here's an idea, dont call it a vegetarian burrito if one of the main ingredients in it is cooked in chicken juice!  Or you could simply have some non-chicken stock rice on hand for this exact situation...just sayin'.  On top of that they gave my co-worker black beans when she ordered refried and it seriously took 35 minutes for them to whip up and a burrito and an enchilada.  We alsomost had to just get it to go.....needless to say I will be exploring other lunch options in the area.
