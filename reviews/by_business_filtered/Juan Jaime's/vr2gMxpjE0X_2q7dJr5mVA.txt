- the food is bland
- their wildly-touted "salsa bar" is boring, and 4' by 4' large
- the waitstaff is, sigh, boring
- the bill is 50% higher than you'd expect for bland food/service/atmosphere

It's unlikely that things will get better, so it's unlikely that I will recommend friends/family.  The signage and hype are cool to see, though, and their location is excellent.

Bottom line:  don't bother
