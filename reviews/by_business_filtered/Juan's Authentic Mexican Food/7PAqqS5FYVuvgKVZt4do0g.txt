After reading the revues its really kinda a mixed bag.  I mean if you don't want to wait for a table, don't go at peak hours.  I've never had any thing stale or old tasting.  They have a huge menu serving alot of different dishes.  I have to admit, I usually order a la cart because I cant finish a combo.  Right now I'm stuck on the cheese enchilada, side of beans, and a large flour tortilla and they are huge!  The service is always excellent and I have never had any long delays in getting waited on or getting the food.  There is nothing I know of on the menu that isn't tasty.  But, one the I would like to mention is the things you can take home: such as tortillas2.45 for a dozen that weigh over 3 lbs.,  hot sauce very reasonable, beans at a good price.  Just a thought.  Oh and I can't remember being made to feel as welcome as I do at Juans.   Ciao
