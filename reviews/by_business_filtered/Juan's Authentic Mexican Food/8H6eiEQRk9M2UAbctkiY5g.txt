I went to Juan's yesterday with some friends from work. When we got back they asked us how it was. It was okay. 

I was pretty underwhelmed with the service, chips, and salsa- all pretty bland. My chimichanga was okay, big and beefy, pretty difficult to mess up. The guacamole was weird though, really thin and pureed, possibly from a mix even. The beans and rice were standard, and everything came in very big portions, including the soft drinks which are roughly the size of a small bucket! I liked my friends green chile plate much better than what I got, which is why Juan's gets a generous third star, otherwise, this place would be a solid 2 stars. 

It is really, super cheap and they don't scrimp on the AC (it was about 60 degrees in there!) Some people probably like that, I think it makes my food go cold way too fast. Would I go again? Meh. Maybe. If I was in front of it and felt like big, cheap Mexican food- otherwise there are many other places I would opt for.
