We used to go to Carolina's regularly, but after reading reviews on Juan's, I thought I would give them a try. Have never gone back to Carolina's. 
The food served at Juan's is delicious and cheap. Their nachos with guac and machaca are the best I have ever had. The service is quick and I always feel at home there. I try to go once a week, and I never walked out disappointed.  For me, that's great atmosphere. They sure sodas in huge glasses, as is their generous portions.
Their green corn tamales are the best, as is their green enchilada sauce. Also a favorite are their cheese crisps, machaca enchilada and ground beef tacos. Try their sopapillas for desert.
