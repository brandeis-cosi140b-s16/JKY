Great cheese enchiladas, shredded  beef tacos are sooooooo good and price is right. Chips are ok salsa is a little more watered down then what I like but it's ok. The best part of this place is food is very inexpensive. Staff is nice. My order has always been accurate. The only thing I don't like about this place is parking. It's such a busy place therefore parking is tight and there's not enough spots to park. Aside from that I give Juans 10 STARS
