I work close to Juan's and have been here on a few occasions. I often find myself wondering why they are always so busy or what makes them so popular. The food is good, not great, but still good. I'm not convinced that the guacamole isn't made from powder. The beans are runny, the rice is pretty average and the service isn't the fastest or the best. Funny thing is I still go back from time-to-time. 

If you want a decent meal at a good price then by all means this will do the trick. If you are going for lunch give yourself plenty of time or call in advance and pick it up. The parking lot is small and fills up quickly.
