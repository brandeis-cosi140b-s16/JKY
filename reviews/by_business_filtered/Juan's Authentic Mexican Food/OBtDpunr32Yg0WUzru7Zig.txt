If you have been looking for a true hole in the wall Mexican restaurant for cheap tasty authentic Mexican cuisine, this is your place.  I must have driven by Juan's a thousand times on my way to work without ever noticing it.  It is a totally non-descript cinder block building with no windows or obvious entrances.  It's a little scary looking, especially since it is right next to the 51.  Trust me.  You need to check it out.  Inside is a bustling family run restaurant that feels like home.  The food is really good.  I have already been back several times since being introduced to Juan's by a friend.  It is destined to become a part of my restaurant rotation.
