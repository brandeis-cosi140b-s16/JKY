I originally gave this place 4 stars. In hindsight that may not have been appropriate and I'm downgrading it to 3 stars.

I haven't been for a while now as the last time I went I had a tamale that was just not good.

So I have had not-so-good food there now and felt I should revise accordingly.

3 stars is A-OK which I think is a fair rating for a place with such great prices and good service.
