Let me start by saying that I didn't really like this place at all the first time I went. It was divey and I couldn't get passed the salsa. My wife is a big fan and would make me go and I just didn't dig it. Oh but how things change as Juan's grew on me. Since I first started going 2 or 3 years ago it has undergone a renovation and is a bit more appealing now than it used to be. 

From torta's to tamales to cheecrisps I've never had anything I didn't like. The food is solid, the prices are great. I can't think of any place in central Phoenix that's as clean and friendly with prices as low. I love the rice, the beans are okay too. The only thing I don't like is the salsa which I can get over for the quality of everything else and the price. Even my kids love the "little Juan's" menu, they always get the cheese enchilada and love it. Not too spicy and pretty darn good.  Juan's is a jewel of central Phoenix and after a little convincing I'm glad I found it.

Cons:
I don't like the salsa
Not open on Sundays

Pros:
Friendly and speedy service
Great prices
Good size menu
Beer
You can watch them make the food
