This place is great. It is divey and cheap, yet it has fresh tasty food coupled with outstanding service. It is also very clean. This full service restauraunt has nothing on the menu over $10 and everything is wonderful including some of the best rice and beans in the valley. the food is authentic and everything is not covered with hot melted cheese. The tamales, burritos, carne asada and enchiladas are great. This place is always crowded but has lots of tables and  I have never had a hard time geating a seat and I have no problems saying this is one of the best mexican spots in the valley.
