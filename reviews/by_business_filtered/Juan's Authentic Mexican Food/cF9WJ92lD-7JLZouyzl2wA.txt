Mexican Food Diner. 

That's the best way I could describe Juan's Authentic Mexican Food.

I definitely was expecting more... not in quantity, but in quality. The food is just good enough. One or two steps above fast food Mexican. I think what makes Juan's appealing is the atmosphere, friendly service and prices.

The salsa of the complimentary Chips and Salsa is different. It tastes like it has a tomato sauce base with herbs and such added to it. The consistency is very thin, not chunky. It was okay. 

I got the carne asada burro for dinner. The steak was tender and actually very good. I liked it. 

For dessert, I excitedly ordered the flan and sadly that excitement ended after the first bite. I unfortunately have to say I wouldn't get it again. The texture was a little grainy, and it was too dense. Definitely not like the silky, soft caramelized sugar sauce covered custard I love... 

Anyway, like I said, the food isn't great. It's okay. But on a positive note the service is very friendly and attentive. I also like the laid back, divey-diner atmosphere. The prices are reasonable as well.

Would I eat here again? Eh... probably... but there's no feeling of urgency.
