Juans is a diner style Mexican Restaurant. It looks sketchy from the outside and also on the inside but the place was packed with people so I had to try the food.

I had the number 10 beef enchiladas w red sauce.  The plate comes with rice and refried beans.  They started me off with chips and salsa.  Being a bit of a salsa expert, I think the salsa was a bit watered down and had too much garlic.  However it was about a 2 out of five stars.

The imported bottled beer is only 3.50 a bottle so that was a nice price for a Pacifico beer with lime.  

Upon the arrival of my food, the plate was very hot and the food was fresh.  The rice was awesome and had a great flavor, and the refried beans were among the best i've had.  The enchiladas were three stars out of five as the sauce was bland and appeared to be out of a jar.  However they were able to salvage the plate by adding fresh onions on the enchiladas which raised the taste to a 4.  The prices on the menu are very reasonable and overall was a good meal.  

Would like to try some of their other menu items to give it a better rating.
