This was supposed to be the best Mexican food in town, but I was not impressed. It seemed like your basic run of the milk - nothing special Mexican place. The food was good but it was not super amazing authentic style Mexican. The flavor was very blah. I was disappointed and to be honest the service was not great. Our waitress was friendly but the cashier was obviously wishing she could be anywhere but there. She didn't even try to fake a friendly smile.
