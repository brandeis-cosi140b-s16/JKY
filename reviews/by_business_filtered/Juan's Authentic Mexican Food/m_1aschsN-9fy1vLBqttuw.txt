Just Not For Me

The staff at Juan's Authentic Mexican Food is warm, friendly, and extremely accommodating, which is why I feel terrible for calling out their Mexican food as bland. I really wanted to like Juan's so badly, especially after reading so many positive reviews. However, the food in my opinion just isn't good.

This was my second visit to Juan's Authentic Mexican Food Restaurant, and for me the food is just so-so. Just one step above what you would be served in a fast food establishment.

I enjoy starting my meal with chips and salsa just like everyobe else.  The salsa at Juans is like a watery tomato puree posing as salsa and the chips tasted stale. For my entr√©e I choose the Beef Flatas and Mexican rice, both of which had very little taste.  The meal was just very disappointing and took over 30 minutes to serve.

Juan's isn't the worst but I'm not in a rush to visit again
