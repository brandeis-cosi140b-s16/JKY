Hands down, this is some of the best tasting Mexican food in Phoenix. The staff is very friendly, recognizes just about all of their regulars and make you feel like family while at their restaurant. At times, the wait can be a little lengthy but it's worth the time and it allows you to enjoy more of their delicious salsa and chips. I recommend the chile relleno or red chile tamale.
