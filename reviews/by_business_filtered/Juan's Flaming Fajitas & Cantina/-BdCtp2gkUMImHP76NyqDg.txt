it was AWESOME! we went for dinner on 5/5/14. The was a wait, though not long.  Only 30 min. And it was 20 or 25 minutes and we were seated.  My wife had a chicken taco salad,  which she said it was "Awesome". The boy had a chirzo, eegs, and potatoes burrito.  And I had Beef Fajitas, which was amazing!  Definitely going to be back soon.
