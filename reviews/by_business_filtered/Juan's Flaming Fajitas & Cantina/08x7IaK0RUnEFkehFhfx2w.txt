Just great! First time here and I gotta say this will be my new spot. We had a pitcher of Cadillac Margarita ($33) and then we order a regular pitcher, all I got to say is pay the extra $9 bucks. Its well worth it! 

The food is great, we had the Chicken and stake fajitas and it was Amazing. The kids had Rice, beans and a cheese quesadilla. They loved it! 

The staff is great and very kind. The manager offered us an order of free churros. Those were so good, next time I need to try the fried ice cream. 

Over all my experience was great!
