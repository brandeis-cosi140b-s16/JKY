Amazing, I'm obsessed. The staff is always super nice and on top of refills. They have vegetarian options for about everything! I always get the shrimp fajitas and my boyfriend gets the chicken and steak combo and we both are more than happy each and every time. I do not know what they do with their proteins, and I don't care all I know is it's nothing short of amazing.
