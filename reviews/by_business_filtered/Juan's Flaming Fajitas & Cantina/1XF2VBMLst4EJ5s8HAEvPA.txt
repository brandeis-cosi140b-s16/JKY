I pretty much think God invented Mexican food to make up for M-F work weeks.  Because my BF is such a Lindo fan, it wasn't easy convincing him to come here instead.  After our awesome lunch, he was very apologetic for doubting my Yelp abilities.

I came here when this was Buzz, and Juan has really transformed the place.  Looks like a legit Mexican cantina.  Juan himself greeted us at the door and sat us at our table.  3 big screen tvs are visible in the dining room.  Always good, especially during the NCAA tournament (if you are not a Kentucky fan like myself).  Negra Modelo on tap = Sunday Funday.  Although I am a Lindo fan, the chips and salsa at Juan's are much better.  So is the fideo soup.  We decided to split the flaming chicken fajitas because it is the namesake.  Because I will always be 10 years old, I was overly facinated with the tableside flaming fajitas (see pic).  In addition to the show, the fajitas were great.  Came with the aforementioned fideo soup, guacamole, salsa, sour cream, cheese and tortillas.  The only thing I wasn't wowed by were the tortillas, but when your BFF is a latina rockstar and her fabulous momma hooks you up with decilious tortillas, your standards can be pretty high.  Don't worry Lindo.  There's room for two great Mexican spots in the Southwest.  Welcome to the neighborhood, Juan.
