Took my parents and boyfriend here last night and left highly impressed!! Delicious food, great presentation, killer prices, good service. Both couples had beef & chicken fajitas with all the fixings for 2 people for $24.99. Chips, salsa, bean dip and soup come complimentary. Happy hour until 7. We had tons of leftovers. We all stuck to fajitas so I can't comment on the other food. Although, my mom's margarita was so-so and the chips could've been better warm. Very casual atmosphere. Will definitely be back!
