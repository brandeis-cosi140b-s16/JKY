Came here because of Yelp reviews and we were not disappointed! The best salsa ever. Chips were good though they could have been served hotter. The service was super friendly and the kids menu had lots of options. Small guacamole was worth the extra expense and the bean dip and grilled onions they serve with the salsa were excellent. The only reason I couldn't give it 5 stars because the fajitas were a bit - well - boring actually. Very well made and fresh ingredients but lacking the seasoning and juiciness I've had from other places. But still - overall an excellent meal and I will definitely be back the next time we are in LV.
