This place is fantastic. Great tasting food. Excellent service. Staff were very warm and welcoming. Got chips and salsa as well as these delicious grilled peppers and onions as soon as we sat and ordered our food and beers. When our food came.... It was so good.. Will definately be back!!! They have great football specials too!
