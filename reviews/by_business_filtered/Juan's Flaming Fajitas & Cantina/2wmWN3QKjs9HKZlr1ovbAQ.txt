Our new favorite Mexican restaurant! I made my mouth so very happy by feeding it New Mexico enchiladas! What flavor! Chicken wrapped in a blue tortilla surrounded by New Mexico chile sauce. mmmmm-mmmm-mmm! I love it when I meet such wonderful medleys of flavor provided by an array of well-balance spices. Didn't need to drown it in salsa. Didn't need salsa!  The table next to us order their specialty, flaming fajitas. That's what I plan to order next time!
