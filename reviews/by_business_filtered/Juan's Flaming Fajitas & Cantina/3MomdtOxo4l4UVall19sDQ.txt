I have to admit that I was skeptical of all the great reviews ... I must qualify that by saying I am very picky about Mexican food. ... Because I love it & eat it all the time!!

1st visit: I had the chorizo tacos ... Excellent!
Rice and beans were good, too
I was especially impressed with the fideo soup ... very tasty broth.  I don't usually like fideo [Lindo you better step up your game]

Service was excellent ... I came after work, and got no grief for asking for a booth even though I was solo. 

I'll probably give 5 stars after trying a few more items!!

2nd visit: less than 1 week later, I'm here after a hard day's work. Happy Hour ... YAY!

Enjoyed the HH classic margarita on the rocks. Today, I tried the Juan's sampler which included taquitos, nachos & quesadilla with sour cream, and guac ... Again enough food for two meals. 

Excellent service, upon arrival I was asked if I wanted my usual booth ... Of course I did, glad the host remembered me.  

I wish they were close to home, but they're close to work so that's OK too
