I really enjoyed this place and the great service.  The food overall was very good but the rice and beans were kind of in small portions perhaps due to the size of the plates.  The flour tortillas were extra good as was the butter I put on them.  So, only three stars.  Well I've had carne asada all over the place and this piece of meat was the worst by far.  Granted it was overcooked for medium but beyond that it looked like a large, thin Wendy's burger expect it wasn't as good.  For over $15 I expect a really decent piece of meat and it just wasn't.
