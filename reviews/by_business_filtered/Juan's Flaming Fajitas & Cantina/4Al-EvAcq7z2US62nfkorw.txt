After coming here a few times, I think the best time to come here is during happy hour, which goes from 4:00pm - 7:00pm daily.  Some of the highlights:

Import Draft Beers: $3.50 for 16oz or $4.50 for 20oz
Well Drinks: $3.50
Margaritas: $3.50 for 12oz or $4.50 for 16oz
Fajita Quesadillas: $6.95

Come in during happy hour, and for around $20 or so you can have quesdillas, free chips and salsa/beans, and three drinks.  Not bad at all.

Outside of happy hour I've had their fajitas: beef, chicken, pork, and shrimp.  The fajitas are decent, but not necessarily something to go out of your way for.  The fajitas for two combo is about $25, which really can be enough for three people if you keep snacking on the chips and dips.  Again, not really good enough to warrant going out of your way for, especially since they close pretty early.  Fridays and Saturdays they close at 10:00pm, the rest of the week they close at 9:00, so unless you're in the area you'll want to be sure to come here early.
