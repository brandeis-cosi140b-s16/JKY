Wow,  first the grilled onions and chili's served with the chips as well as the refried beans made just sitting down awesome.  Then we got with our meal the Sopa soup,  excellent and unexpected at lunch,  but it is what they do.  Now on to the Fajitas,  beef and steak combo for two: they were great.  Beef and chicken was tender and tasty.  A must try. .
