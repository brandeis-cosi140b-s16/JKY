Got there friday at 7 -had to wait about 30 - 40 min. We ordered beef &. Chicken fajita with margarita. Chip and soup were served with grilled vegetables. - nice :)  Our server was very friendly. Food was good - steak was not tender but seasoning was good- not the best fajita i ever have but good enough. Yes i will recommend this place and will come back. It deserve 5 star overall - service and food. Looking for reasonable - not over priced Mexican food? This is the place.
