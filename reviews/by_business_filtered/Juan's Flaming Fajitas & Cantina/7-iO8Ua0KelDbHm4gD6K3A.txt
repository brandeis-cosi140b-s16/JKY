This place was excellent - high quality, authentic, and with lots of 'extras' - bean dip in addition to salsa provided with chips - AND with grilled jalape√±os & onions on side as well.  Portions are huge - 2 people can share many entrees and the fajitas for 2 could probably serve 3.

I don't normally leave reviews, but after the absolutely overwhelming mediocrity of the Border Grill at Mandalay Bay last night (all except the price overwhelmed), I had to review Juan's given it was spectacular in its own right, and spectacular x 100 in comparison to the bland, tiny, over-priced fare at Border Grill.

This was the Mexican fix the family was looking for before our vacation ends - I'll be leaving a recommendation with our hotel concierge.
