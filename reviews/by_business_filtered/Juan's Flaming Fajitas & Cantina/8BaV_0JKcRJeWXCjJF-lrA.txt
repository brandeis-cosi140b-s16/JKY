I don't even know where to start, this place was the best Mexican Restaurant I've ever been to. I have very high expectations for Mexican restaurants since I am Mexican and it's very rare to find one that has legit authentic Mexican food! From the moment we walked in the ambiance and the staff was amazing very attentive and on point! We order drinks and they literally took like 5min for them to bring them, we also ordered the adobado burrito and the chicken shredded chimichanga, we were so impressed on how fast our food came, they were delish and very worth it!  I'm so impressed with the service the people and the restaurant overall! I highly recommend this place if you're in need of a good Mexican restaurant! Ps: Happy Hour half hour alcoholic beverages between 3pm-7pm ;)
