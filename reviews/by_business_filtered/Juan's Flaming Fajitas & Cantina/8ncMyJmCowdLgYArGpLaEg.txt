The food is good. The fajitas are put on fire at your table, but are already cooked when they arrive. But I had a margarita, frozen, and was good. It really put me in a good mood for the food. The bean dip you get with the chips is good, get the pork fajitas because those are the best. I can't wait to come back. 
The down side of this visit is that there were two large parties right by us. The music from the man with the guitar was good, it really entertained us. But this white lady was the best. She was super friendly and smiled the whole time. Will come back for sure. Large parties welcomed.
