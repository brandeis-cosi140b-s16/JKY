Food/Service AMAZING!!! The portions were huge and they even have a great Happy Hour too! We came in with 4min remaining and snagged a Steak Quesadilla for $3 and change! They bring warm chips, warm refried beans, salsa & roasted jalape√±o and onions as you arrive.  A tomato based broth soup comes with your entree... So so good!! 
Needless to say we will return!! We also had enough left over for dinner the next day.
