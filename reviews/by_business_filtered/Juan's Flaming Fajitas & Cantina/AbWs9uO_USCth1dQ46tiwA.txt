I frequent all varieties of  Mexican restaurants, from Roberto's to Mundo, but Juan's Flamin' Fajita is on the do not return list after my meal. 
Many of the items that came to the table were not made in house. The chips were not fresh, some store bought variety. The salsa, despite many other reviews, was not fresh and pretty spicy. The margarita was the worst margarita I have ever purchased. The mix they use is super sweet and just plain terrible (and probably old). I tasted very little tequila and even less lime, odd for a drink that consists mainly of those two ingredients. It was so sweet  that my girlfriend couldn't even drink it (and this went completely unnoticed). 

I ordered some of their "Flamin' Fajitas," and was not impressed. It reminded me of something you could find at Chili's. The flame they give you at the table, while fun to watch, is terrible to taste. The protein was cooked beyond well done- chicken being super dry and steak being very tough. 

I will say the service was pretty good.   The manager did notice our apparent dissatisfaction with the food, but at that point we knew we were not coming back and did not even bother explaining everything we found wrong with our visit.  

Overall, it was not the worst meal I've ever eaten, but our experience was no where near five stars. 

And on an unrelated note about Juan's, the font on their menu is horrendous. It is childish and ugly, I think they should change it. However I will not be returning to check.
