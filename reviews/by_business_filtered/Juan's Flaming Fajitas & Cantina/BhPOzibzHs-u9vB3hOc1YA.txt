We should of known when we walked in on a Saturday night and it was nearly empty.  But seeing so many positive Yelp reviews we had to try it... what a mistake.. ugh.  So the question is?.. "How do you ruin Mexican food?!"

I'll tell you how...

store bought chips
store bought tortillas
store bought re-fried beans
store bought rice
store bought pre-mixed margaritas
pico de gallo so old it looks grey
bland fajitas
awful atmosphere
luke warm service

Now I know why the place was nearly empty.  Don't eat here.
