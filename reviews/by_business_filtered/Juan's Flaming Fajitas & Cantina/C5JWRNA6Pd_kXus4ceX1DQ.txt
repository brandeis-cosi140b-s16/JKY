My wife and I have been here many times and we are never disappointed. The service is great and the food is some of the best in town.  

This last visit we were in the mood for some authentic Mexican breakfast, so my wife ordered the huevos rancheros and I ordered the huevos con chorizo y papas plate. These items are under the Brunch section of the menu and a drink is included from soft drinks to a draft beer, mimosa, or a margarita.  Both of our plates were fantastic and the beers went down nicely as well!! The portions are generous and you also get chips with salsa and beans to get everything started. 

During football season, Juan's also has all day football specials that include $3.50 pints of their Mexican beers on tap and an assortment of appetizers and taco plates. On top of that, they have an awesome Happy Hour from 3-7p everyday that also has similar specials. 

I haven't tried the actual flaming fajitas yet, but I plan on doing so on one of my next visits. I recommend this place to anyone who wants to enjoy some killer Mexican food in a fun and relaxing atmosphere!!
