My husband and I came here for lunch on New Year's Day. Everything was delicious; from the complimentary bean dip, chips and salsa to my amazingly good ( and $9.99!) steak fajitas to my hubby's 3-item combo plate of carne asada, carnitas tacos and cheese enchilada ($10!). Our guacamole was delicious.  I love this place!
