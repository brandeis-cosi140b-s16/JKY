I was impressed. The atmosphere was fun and the food good. Our server, Omar, was spot on; friendly and attentive. Like many others, really enjoyed the grilled onions and jalapenos that accompanied the chips, salsa, and bean dip. Nibbled off the niece's beef fajita (someone had to get them) plate; really tasty. The shredded chicken in my sister's chimichanga was flavorful. That surprised me as many places that I've tried seemed to have boiled the chicken leaving the diner to season with sauces and such. Liked the fact that a plate came with a grilled vegetable option versus having to have beans and rice. Also liked the fact that a cup of fideo accompanied each entree. I'm a carnitas fan and that was my only let down; I like bigger chunks of pork versus the small diced version. Had no complaints about the taste or tenderness of the meat though. Portion size was great. Definitely deserves a return visit next time I'm up that way.
