Some of my family came here for dinner when we were visiting my uncle. Despite the great Yelp reviews, this place was not really busy on a Saturday night. That might have been because it was a long weekend but it was fine as our part of 7 got seated immediately. From the moment we walked in, the service was really friendly and excellent.

They give you bean dip, salsa, and chips to start. The chips were okay; the salsa was good but pretty spicy, and the bean dip was a nice alternative to the spiciness of the salsa. The drinks are really reasonably priced (like $5-6 for margaritas and less for beers) and looked good although I didn't order anything. The menu is pretty extensive and has a ton of options. Everything we ordered looked awesome and what I tried was really good. They light the fajitas "on fire" which is a nice presentation. More importantly, I tried some of my mom and brother's fajitas and they were really well seasoned and perfectly cooked. My cousin had one of the platos, shrimp with the mojo de ajo. He liked it a lot but I found it way too spicy. 

I had the enchiladas de mole. I liked my dish, but I found the mole sauce a bit disappointing. I think it had peanut butter in it did not compare to other mole sauces I have had. A bit too heavy and sweet, but it was alright with sour cream and I liked the chicken inside it a lot. 

Based solely on my dish, I would probably give this place 4 stars but I think it definitely deserves 4.5 based on the other stuff I tried, and I round up because of the service. They have a little stage so I assume they have live music from time to time and their happy hour looks good also. I would come back again when visiting my uncle.
