Came in with a group of four coworkers for their lunch menu- several plates available, along with combinations consisting of tacos, burritos, flautas, tamales, and such. Nothing too complicated, most dishes $10-12.

Interior of restaurant is nice and service is polite but painfully slow.
Complimentary chips, salsa, and beans stave off hunger, but after half an hour (and being one of few tables, early on a weekday), no one had been served. We let the staff know we would need to get our orders to go, and it still took an additional 15 minutes until we were brought our food and checks.
No one ordered anything more complicated than tacos, burritos, and a chicken breast. We were never given an explanation for the delay. 

CHILE RELLENO: overly battered but tasty, not spicy, quite cheesy.
GREEN CHILE PORK BURRITO: wrapped in a flour tortilla, dry, more like an enchilada than a burrito. Didn't care for this.
Side of GRILLED VEGGIES was an odd assortment of broccoli, cauliflower, and squash- considering this is a Mexican restaurant I kind of expected onions and peppers, maybe mushrooms and squash, so it was an odd but tasty.

Restaurant entrance has several posters with their daily specials, and they also offer a HH and MNF specials. Seems like the fajitas are the best thing to get here, given the name and the fiery presentation.
