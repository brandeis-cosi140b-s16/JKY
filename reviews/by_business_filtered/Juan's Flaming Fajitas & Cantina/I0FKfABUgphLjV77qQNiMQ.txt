If you guys LOVE mexican food, Juan flaming fajitas is the place to go. 
One of the best mexican restaurants in town. Best service ever - fast, friendly and right (if you know what I mean). Make sure you call in and book a table, cause usually the wait time for a table is like an hour or so. Busiest restaurant that i know!! Amazing job Juan!!!
