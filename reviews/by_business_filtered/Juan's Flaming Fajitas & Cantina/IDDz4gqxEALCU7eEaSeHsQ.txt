Great guacamole made table-side.  The soups are wonderful, so far i have tried the fideo and posole, both were outstanding.  I also had the special Margaritas and they were perfect.  We enjoyed the flaming fajitas and ended the evening with fried ice cream.  I can't say enough good about our new favorite.
