Just finished a quick lunch here and am totally impressed. I ordered the steak fajitas and the chicken fajitas lunch specials with my wife. Both were excellent. The chicken and steak were flavorful, juicy and tender. The onions and peppers were perfectly charred. The accompanying rice was fluffy and great by itself. The refried beans were some of the best I've had. 
Service was excellent. Totally attentive without being obtrusive. 
To top things off, I just received the bill. The place deserved five stars at twice what it cost.  This may be my new favorite restaurant!
Only downside - it's a bit of a drive from my house.
