This place is still going strong!  Excellent service, great quality food.  Whenever we cannot agree to a place for lunch, this is always the peacemaker. 

Their taco salad is delicious and a go to item for me.  Their free chips and salsa with bean dip are an appreciated bonus!

I always ask for Diet Cherry Coke and I get it with no problems whatsoever. 

Clean restaurant. Awesome food.  Entertaining with TVs where ever you look. The staff is top notch!  One major reason we come here. They remember us!

If you STILL haven't tried this place you really are missing out.

Go.

Now!
