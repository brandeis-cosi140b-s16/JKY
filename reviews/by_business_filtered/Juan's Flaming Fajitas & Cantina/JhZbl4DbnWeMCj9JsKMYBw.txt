I have had a hard time finding a place that serves posole or menudo and the mexican places I've been to haven't impressed me. From chips and salsa when you sit down, to the sangria, to the menudo and the chile relleno, this place is the best Mexican place I've ever had. Ever. Thanks for the good service juan!!
