I love fajitas. When I hear that sizzling sound coming toward my table, I am a happy camper.
Unfortunately, in every Mexican restaurant in which I've eaten, the fajitas cost twice as much as the combo plates, so I've been eating combos because I get 3 selections, and they fill me up.
What separates this place from the other Mexican restaurants are the fajitas.
They are reasonably priced, AND the portions are bigger than most other places, so for me, it's the best of both worlds.
I can't fault them for being on the other side of town, so I'll just eat my combos closer to home, and when I'm in the mood for fajitas, I'll drive the extra 15 or 20 minutes and go here. It's worth it!
Really, really good!
