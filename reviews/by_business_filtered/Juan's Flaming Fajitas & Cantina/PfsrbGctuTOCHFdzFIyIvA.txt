Had to check this place out with such a high rating!

After a fun filled day of adventures we were starving driving back into Vegas so I went into my bookmarks and decided we were going to finally come here. I have to say this place is doing it! Lots of people waiting to be seated when we came in and when we came out. That's always a good sign!

It's crazy loud. Lots of celebrations going on everywhere and tons of tv's all around playing multiple games. I wasn't into all the tv's and it made it feel somewhat of a sports bar and the decor wasn't my favorite either as it was a tad on the commercial side. It reminded me of visiting the super touristy spots in Mexico that I didn't enjoy too much. But everything else was great.

The service is very friendly. The food was delicious & filling, especially if you're extra hungry and the best part was the older gentleman walking around singing Spanish songs with his guitar. What a nice touch! Also ~ all Yelp check-ins receive 15% off! Thanks Yelp! 

We of course had to try the fajitas and they are cooked in front of you sparking a fire that warms the entire room and I had a cheese enchilada with a hard chicken taco that were very flavorful. Everything was great and it's definitely a very fun and energetic place. Expect a possible wait time as this place is very popular.
