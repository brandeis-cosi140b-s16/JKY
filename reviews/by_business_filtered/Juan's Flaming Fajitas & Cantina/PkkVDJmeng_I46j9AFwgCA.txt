This place is the best.... And they have modelo on tap. The fajitas are great, so is the taco salad and nachos. They bring out chips with bean dip and salsa, as well as a delicious soup. I'm satisfied every time I come here, and I crave it. It's amazing. The service is fast, but I have noticed the place getting busier. We got the last booth tonight. They remembered us too, which I like.
