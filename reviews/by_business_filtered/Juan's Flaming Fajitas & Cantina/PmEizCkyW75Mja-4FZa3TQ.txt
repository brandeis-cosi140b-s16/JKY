We always have an enjoyable meal at Juan's.  Personally I love the Carnitas so much that I often don't stray away, but I did order the Juan's sampler last time.  It was terrific. The staff is so friendly from the minute you walk in the door to the time you leave.  You get a lot of value for your dollar.  I give it a thumbs up, all the way.
