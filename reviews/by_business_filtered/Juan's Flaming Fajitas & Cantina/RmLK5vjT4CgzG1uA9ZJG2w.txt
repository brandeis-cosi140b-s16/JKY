I love everything about this place.  Greeters were super friendly,  service was excellent, and the food is terrific!  In the last 2 weeks we have been here 4 times!  Jose is our favorite server.  Our family has a lot of allergies and Jose gets it right and is very accommodating...  It is our favorite Mexican food in Vegas now!
