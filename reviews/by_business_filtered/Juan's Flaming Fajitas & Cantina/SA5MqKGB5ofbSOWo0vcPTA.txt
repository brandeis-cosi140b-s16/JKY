There are a ton of really high reviews here, and I love mexican food so I was excited to try this place out, but my experience doesn't reflect a similar experience. 

The chips were okay, kind of thin and tasted like some cheap supermarket chips. The salsa and beans were alright, not special but not bad at all. The non-custom standard guacamole was really good, but that was about the only thing I had that could be called really good. 

My main meal was the flautas combination plate with grilled veggies. The veggies included broccoli which was absolutely ruined. It was grilled fast on high heat, which ended up just burning and charring the florets, and that's a very bad flavor to add to broccoli. The flautas themselves were okay, not special, I just kind of ate them until I was tired of them and didn't take home any leftovers. I feel like that's almost worse than giving me bad food. At least make me have an opinion about it, right? The shell was also cooked a bit too much, so was hard to cut through.

The wife was also unhappy with her meal, I forget what exactly she got but the tortilla it was wrapped in was super soggy on the bottom and not all that pleasant to eat. 

The staff, however, was great. They were very attentive and treated us great. I'll definitely give this place a second chance for sure, if for no other reason than to try their custom guacamole option made table-side. Hopefully this was just a bad outing and they will live up to all these other high praise reviews next time.
