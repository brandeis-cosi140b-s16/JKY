Im originally from El Paso TX and therefore very picky when it comes to mexican food! I have grew up with Juan at another place he used to work at in town for at least 10 yrs and when I found out he had his own restaurant we now come here on a weekly basis instead of the old place I went to for years. It is the BEST mexican food in Las Vegas and the service is AWESOME!! Ernand is my go to waiter but the others are nice as well!! Love the fajitas the enchiladas the free soup and chips and salsa they serve with every meal and they also have other variety of salsas as well if u like more spice I love the habanero! My whole family goes here from mom dad sisters and husband and kids all love it!!!
