Very good food! They've always given us a lot for our money's worth. I love the shrimp fajitas and I find myself craving their signature soup. We've ordered take out a few times, but when we've dined in, the service is great and the manager (owner?) comes around to the tables making sure things are up to par. I like the decor and the atmosphere is relaxing. Will have to try out the bar area for a margarita or 2:)
