We've come back to try this place out again and again, I think we'll just by pass it from now on.. The chips and salsa are so so, the chips themselves are flavorless and fried a bit too long, the salsa is ok.. I had the fajitas , the presentation it self is cool, but the meat is so well done its almost like having jerky, and really there's not that much meat , mostly veggies.. Since they flame as they come out maybe they shouldn't grill them for so long since they recook at the table.. The service was ok, nothing to wow about. The tacos were hmmmmm, just tacos I guess.. With so many Mexican restaurants around this place won't miss us...
