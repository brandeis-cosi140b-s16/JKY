Wonderful. Staff service is excellent. Friendly, warm and attentive. All we've had so far are the fajitas and the guacamole. Both were excellent. Plenty of televisions, bar area is great. Just can't find anything to complain about. 

Oh, and the fideo soup they serve before every meal is fantastic. Have had a lot of different fideo soups, and this is number one without a doubt.
