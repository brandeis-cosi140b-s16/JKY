I'm not the biggest fan of Mexican but this place was good.

Free chips, sauteed onions and peppers, and soup!

I ordered a taco salad... I asked for no rice and they offered to replace it with steamed veggies. I was very happy.

They were able to make a dirty martini and it was only $5.50 which is half of what I was expecting it to be (grey goose vodka too)

The service was very good. The workers were definitely hustling... Very quick to refill water, chips, and take away finished plates. 

The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is because my boyfriend asked for the steamed veggies too, but was given rice instead, and some of the chairs were cheap and looked like they belong in a cafeteria.
