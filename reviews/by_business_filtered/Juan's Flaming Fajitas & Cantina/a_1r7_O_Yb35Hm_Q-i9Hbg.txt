As the name describes it, they server flaming fajitas. The concept is great, the taste is just decent. They bring your fajita in a skillet and they set it on fire on your table, it was actually pretty cool!  I feel like the meat needs some more flavor, it was a bit overcooked and under seasoned. Chips, salsa and guacamole were very good. I really do not have a lot of bad things to say, but I was really not impressed. The service was good, the atmosphere are price are excellent! Fajitas, rice, beans, guacamole and sopa de fideos with two choices of meat for just 24 dollars! It really sounds like a good deal.
