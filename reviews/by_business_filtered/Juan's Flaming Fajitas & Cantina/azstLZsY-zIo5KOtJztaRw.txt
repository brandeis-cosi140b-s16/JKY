We have been looking for good Mexican food in Vegas for 10 years. We found a great place. The best food we have had in a long time. Sunday football specials cant be beat.  We ordered street tacos, quesadilla,and fundido, with drinks under $30. Flavorful and authentic. Great staff great place. It will be our go to place.
