Skeptical I decided to give Juan's a try. I was presently surprised! The service was flat out above and beyond your average restaurant of this type. The food was delicious, at least the enchilada dinner I had. I here the  fajitas are off the hook also. "Next trip" never had a dry glass or empty chip bowl. The manager or owner not sure which came to the table at one point to ask how everything was I kinda felt like a celebrity! Ha. This is how all restaurants should do buisness.
