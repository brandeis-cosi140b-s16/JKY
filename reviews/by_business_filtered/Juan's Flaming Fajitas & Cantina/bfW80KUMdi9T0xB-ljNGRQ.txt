For years my favorite place for Mexican food has been Lindo Michoacan. Upon reviewing Yelp, the high ratings led me to try Juan's Flaming Fajitas & Cantina for dinner. I am really surprised by the high ratings this restaurant has received because my experience was good - but nothing special. 

The guacamole is ok, but doesn't taste freshly made. It tasted pasty. I was talked out of the table-side preparation of the guacamole because our server said that he felt that the guacamole made in the back was the same as what is made table-side with half the cost. 

The fajita's came out "flaming," which was great entertainment. The chicken and beef fajitas were good although the veggies were a bit oily. I liked the cast iron skillets and huge chunks of flavorful meat. I wasn't crazy about the Spanish rice.

The restaurant was noisy when I was there. I am not fond of this whole great room concept when dinning. But, I enjoyed the Mexican music and the painted walls.
