Had dinner there tonight. Flaming Fajitas, chicken and beef, flour tortillas and rice & beans. Two beers too. Soup was good. Grilled onions and jalapeno are great with chips and salsa with bean dip. Omar was on his game. Watch the Angles play the Twins. I would go back and you will get a good meal. Can`t wait till they get the homemade tortilla machine cranking out fresh tortillas. Still like Roberto`s hot sauce. Maybe i`ll bring some next time. 9/5/14
