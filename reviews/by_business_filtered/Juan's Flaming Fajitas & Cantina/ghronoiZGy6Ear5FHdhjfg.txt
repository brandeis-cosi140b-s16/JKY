After shuffling through the 279+ reviews I talked my husband into driving over 10 minutes to this place. I am CRAZY for Mexican food, so I was excited. 

We walked in and my husband was won over by being placed in front of the 80" LED t.v. with Monday night football showing. 

Not only were we presented with warm tortilla chips, but they also gave refried beans and grilled onions and peppers as well. 

My husband ordered chicken fajitas and I ordered steak and enchiladas. YUMMY is pretty much how I can sum it up! Best meal we had in Vegas out of a total of 4 days.

The service was second to none! Friendly and attentive staff was the big fat cherry on the top of it all! Go!!
