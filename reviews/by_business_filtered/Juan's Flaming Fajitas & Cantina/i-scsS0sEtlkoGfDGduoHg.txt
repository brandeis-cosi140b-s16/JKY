I was skeptical to try out this place because of the weird name. It's kind of like judging a book by its cover - I'm really good at that. So as we're driving into the parking lot of the Flaming Fajitas I quickly pulled out the Yelp app and checked some of the reviews. Norm K. recommended the flaming fajita so I decided then and there that that's what I'm getting. 

Immediately upon sitting down, a waitstaff came over to our table and laid down a plate of grilled onions and jalapenos, chips and salsa. I absolutely loved the grilled jalapenos and the bean dip that came with the chips - so much that I asked for extra servings of jalapenos! 

The flaming fajita serves two people. We shared that and had plenty of leftovers. Normally I find that beef served at Mexican restaurants are always on the tough side. But at Juan's Flaming Fajitas, the beef was very tender and flavorful. 

Over all it was a great experience! I will sure to come back to try out the flan, more grilled jalapenos and more flaming fajitas!
