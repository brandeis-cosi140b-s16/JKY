Underwhelming. The entrees (steak fajita salad and veggie enchilada) were bland and mostly, well, whatever a good synonym for bland would be: tasteless, flavorless, dull...beige. It's basically Mexican food for people who like Mexican food but don't like all the flavor and spices and all the other stuff that makes Mexican food worth eating. At least the steak was stringy and the choice of vegetables was odd. (Who puts broccoli in fajitas?) 

I will say this in Juan's favor: True to their name, the fajitas were indeed flaming when they got to the table. But once the flames were extinguished so was our enthusiasm for the food.
