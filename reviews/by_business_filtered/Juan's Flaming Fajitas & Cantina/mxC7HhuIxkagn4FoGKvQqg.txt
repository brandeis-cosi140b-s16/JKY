This place was delicious!  Along with nachos they also give you a cheesy bean dip, salsa, and hot peppers and onions to start with!  The peppers and onions were certainly a treat for my husband and I.

My Margarita was great.  The Chicken Flaming Fajita and Cheese Quesadilla were both very good.  The Chimichanga was not as crunchy as we're used to (that's part of what we used to like about it) and we got the regular one, which tasted like they just boiled the chicken in water and was VERY bland and gross.  The chicken that came with the Fajita was grilled and delicious.  Our waiter suggested we should have gotten the Grilled Chicken (Pollo Asado) Chimichanga instead and then it would have tasted better - wish they had recommended it back when we asked what Pollo Asado was!

There were so many other authentic looking Mexican dishes on the menu that we can't wait to go back and try something new!  Overall a nice spot with good ambiance - oh, and the busboy walking around singing to himself while he wipes down the tables is a HOOT!
