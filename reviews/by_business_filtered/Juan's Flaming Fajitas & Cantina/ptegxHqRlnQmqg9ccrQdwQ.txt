The name makes me laugh, the experience left me smiling :)

When a restaurant first emerged in this space when I first moved here, there have been at least 2-3 restaurants that have tried to win over the hearts of the locals in the Southwest, but unfortunately they did not succeed. So when we first walked in and saw how busy the place was (there was even a wait!) we were quite surprised!

We were seated within the quoted 10 mins and the moment we sat down, we saw why the word "flaming" is in their name! As you can see from the photos, their fajitas are literally shooting out flames up toward the ceiling! They're quite delicious, I guess the flames add a flavor only a flame can add :)

Also on the menu: Table side guacamole, raspberry margarita and a coronita. Good, bomb, and meh. I'd definitely have the raspberry margarita again, damn thing tastes like juice!

We loves. We're returning.
