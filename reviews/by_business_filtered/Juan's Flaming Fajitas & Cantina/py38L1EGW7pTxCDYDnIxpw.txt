We have come back here a few times since my original review and we are still fans. So far I have stuck with the fajitas, which are still consistently good. I still feel like this is the best mexican place I have found in Vegas, but to be fair I haven't tried anything but the fajitas so far. My husband has had the nachos on the happy hour menu before and enjoyed them. They have been busy each time we have gone, but we never have to wait long and everyone there goes out of their way to greet you, ask you how everything is, if you need anything else...etc. Top notch customer service for sure!
