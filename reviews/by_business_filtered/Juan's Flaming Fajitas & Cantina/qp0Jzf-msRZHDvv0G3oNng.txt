Im a Dallas native and I have been living here for over a year. I have yet to find such a stellar Mexican food restaurant. The food was absolutely great and the customer service was AMAZING!  Not only were they so gracious and sweet, but they waited on his hand and foot with a smile! I will definitely be bringing everybody that I can for happy hour and food here I cannot wait to go back and I'm so glad I found this little hidden gem!
