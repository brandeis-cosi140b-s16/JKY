I had almost given up on finding a good Mexican restaurant in Vegas until I stumbled upon this amazing place! 
First we were given delicious basket of chips, salsa and beans before ordering. We ordered the fajitas and it came with a ridiculous amount of yummy sides. The roasted jalapeños were out of this world and so was the fideo soup that came with the entrée. 
You have to check this place out! Best Mexican food in Vegas.
