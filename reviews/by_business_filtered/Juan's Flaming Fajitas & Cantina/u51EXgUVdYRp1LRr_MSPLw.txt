What a nice surprise coming off a 5 hour flight from NJ. Did a Yelp search for Mexican restaurants and Juan's came up so in true Las Vegas fashion we rolled the dice only this time you stand to win a delicious meal instead of losing a couple of grand. The service was excellent and the Fajita for two was a great value for portion , quality and overall flavor. I think we'll pop in again before we go home on Saturday. Go Now !
