Been here several times and it has always delivered solid food and service. 

The chips, salsa and bean dip here are to die for. You can probably just order an appetizer and the chips, you are good to go. 

Their combo for two people is a good deal. For $25, you get their famous flaming fajitas (choose from chicken, beef, pork and shrimp), rice, refried beans, pico de gallo, guacamole and a soup. 

The service here was also great. Fast and very attentive. 

This is one of my go to places now for Mexican food.
