We love this place! I'm so happy my fiance' and I found our favorite Mexican restaurant. After moving out here to Vegas, we have realized how many mediocre restaurants there are and we haven't been "wowed" with any place but this one. The service is fantastic and the staff is so friendly. The complimentary fideo soup is always good. We usually order the beef fajitas which are never disappointing! This is by far the best Mexican restaurant in Vegas!
