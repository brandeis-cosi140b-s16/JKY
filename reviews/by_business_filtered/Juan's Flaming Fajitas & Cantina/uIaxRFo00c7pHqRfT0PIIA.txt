And I had just about given up hope of ever finding any decent Mexican food in Vegas! 

As a transplanted Central Texan and used to having good and plentiful Mexican food around, I was very pleasantly surprised by the quality of food in this restaurant. I must give credit to my daughter, who on a recent visit, decided that we MUST have some Mexican food before she heads back East. So, she set to researching and discovered Juan's. We got there for lunch, and were immediately greeted, seated in our booth, and were provided with delicious salsa and bean dip to go with the chips. Very shortly later, we were given a small bowl of a sort of Mexican relish that contained onions, peppers, spices and cilantro. Again, very tasty. Another table was enjoying the fajitas, while yet another was just wrapping up their meal to go. It was tastefully and simply decorated inside, with ample seating, a bar, and overhead TVs. What a great place to watch the game.  

On to the meal!  My daughter ordered the veggie enchiladas and I ordered the veggie tamale (just one - which was the perfect amount for me). We started off with the fideo soup, which was flavorful and just right, temperature-wise. We did not wait long before our meals arrived - they included rice, beans and a romaine lettuce leaf garnish with a dollop of sour cream and pico de gallo. After having experienced the tamale and the enchiladas, I can't wait to go back and try some of the other delicious-sounding dishes. 

As for the service, it was excellent! The owner and waiters came by our table several times asking how we liked the food and making sure we had everything we needed. 

One other plus - the restaurant is located only about 10 minutes from my home - does it get any better than that? I think not. A+++++++++++++!
