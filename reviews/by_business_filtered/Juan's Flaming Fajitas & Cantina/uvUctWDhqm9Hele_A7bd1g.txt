One of my favorite spots! Chips n' salsa are tasty, I enjoy the jalapenos and onions they serve with them, love the complimentary soup (squeeze some lime in it, so good) and LOVE the sopapillas for dessert. I've tried a few different entrees, and wasn't that impressed with them until I tried the fajitas... now that's all I order!  Service has always been great. If you're looking for something easy, casual, and tasty, definitely recommend this place.
