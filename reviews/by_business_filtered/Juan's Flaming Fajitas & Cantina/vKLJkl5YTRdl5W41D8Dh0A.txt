This has to be the best Mexican food in Las Vegas, I'm convinced. First off they start you out with complimentary chips with salsa, beans, and a plate with grilled onions and peppers. (Delicious!) Next it gets even better with their house margs. They have happy hour everyday from 4-7 so a 16 oz margarita on the rocks was under $10. For meals, my boyfriend and I had the shrimp enchiladas and the pollo asada tacos. Both were absolutely delectable! Each entree came with a Mexican soup as well as beans and rice on the side. The portion sizes were just right, not too much and not too little. To finish off our meal we ordered the fried ice cream for dessert, definitely recommended! Love this place! Great service & great food!
