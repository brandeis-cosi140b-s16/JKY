This place is a great spot with great food. I came here with a buddy and we were on limited time, the prompt service and quick turn-around on our order was just what we needed. Of course, right off the bat when we were served Hot Chips, Salsa and BEAN DIP, I knew we were in the right place. Any Mexican Restaurant that goes a little beyond to satisfy their customers is a winner in my book. 

Food was awesome. We both ordered Fajitas, Steak and Chicken and man oh man.. it was tasty. The homemade tortillas... Whoa! If I lived in Vegas, this would be my go-to Mexican spot. I'll be back for sure!
