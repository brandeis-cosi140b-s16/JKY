First timer but I'll be back! Awesome shrimp fajitas, great Margaritas (no high fructose nasty sweet and sour), can't wait to come back and try their other stuff. The owner Juan is present and making sure his guests are happy... very personable and it looks like it's paying off, the place was very busy. next time I'll sit in the bar though, too many kids, it's like chucky cheese in the diningroom.
