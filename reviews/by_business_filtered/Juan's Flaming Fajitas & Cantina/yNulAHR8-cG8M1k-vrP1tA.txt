Great Drinks!!! And great food!! After a wonderful hike at Red Rock we were famished and looking for a "prep" beer although it wasn't on the menu our waiter assured us he could get it done!  And he did! We ordered an assortment of ceviches, a burrito and tacos!! Did I mention we were starving!?!? But everything was great authentic Mexican and very flavorful!
