Reading the yelp reviews prior to my visit, I was expecting a lot more. While the hostesses were friendly, the waiter I had was not. He was short, despite me being very polite, and that frustrates me when I am patronizing a business. 

I ordered the vegetarian fajitas, but was dismayed when I was offered a side of rice. As a precaution, I asked if the rice had any meat in it or if it was cooked in a meat based broth. Indeed, it is cooked in chicken stock. Okay, why, then, was I offered it if I ordered off the vegetarian section of the menu? 15 minutes later, I was brought a complimentary appetizer soup. Again asking the same question, I was told that this, too, had chicken stock in it. Hmm.

My suggestion to Juan: please tell your staff to not offer meat-based items to those guests who order off of the vegetarian section of the menu. Or, offer them, but indicate right then that they are made with meat-based ingredients. 

When my entree came out, the pan was barren and a couple veggies that were listed on the menu were not served. And the taste was nothing to get excited over. There are two other Mexican spots in town that have delicious veggie fajitas, and these ones just left me yearning for more.
