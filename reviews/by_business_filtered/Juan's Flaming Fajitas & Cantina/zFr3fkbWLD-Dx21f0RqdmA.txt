The food was good, but don't order fajita for 2! Just order a single.... It's not worth the extra $10 because it comes out on the same platter. My friend ordered a single version and it looked exactly like a double. You just get an extra plate of rice/beans/soup. Wait staff was mediocre, had to ask for refills a lot on drinks. They water down the ice tea. I watched the guy poor water then add a little tea.
