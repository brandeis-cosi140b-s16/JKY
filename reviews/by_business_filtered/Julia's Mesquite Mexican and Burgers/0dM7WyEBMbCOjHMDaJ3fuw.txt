Great food, it tastes very authentic and fresh! The people who work there are nice and friendly. The prices are decent too. I loved the variety of meat that they had, and the Chipotle-like setup. Atmosphere was okay, but I don't expect anything fancy for fast food. I would definitely recommend this place. Will definitely return in the near future.
