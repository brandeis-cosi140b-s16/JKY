Had lunch here the other day with the hubby (as usual ). The line was so long but it moved quickly. Found this place on Yelp and it does not disappoint. I tried the cheeseburger and fries and hubby got the four taco plate so we could try each others food. Hey, it says tacos AND burgers :-). My burger was very very good and the tacos were excellent.  We tried chicken and asada. Asada rocked. The burritos that they were making looked so good and huge! Oh and the ice tea is  good as well. Will definitely be back for great food at great prices.
