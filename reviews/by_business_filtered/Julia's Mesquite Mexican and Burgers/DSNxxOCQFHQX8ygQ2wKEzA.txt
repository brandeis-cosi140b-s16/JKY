Went in for the first time on Taco Tuesday but ended up getting a bowl for some reason.  Well worth it anyway at a price of $6.99 for a huge bowl probably comparable in size to Chipotle.  I love my Chipotle but this place probably has it beat with their super flavorful marinated meats and top-notch prices.  For $6.99, I not only got the bowl but also a side of chips...and then a free refill on the chips.  They have a help-yourself salsa bar on the side.  Great value, I would return often if I lived closer to Chandler.
