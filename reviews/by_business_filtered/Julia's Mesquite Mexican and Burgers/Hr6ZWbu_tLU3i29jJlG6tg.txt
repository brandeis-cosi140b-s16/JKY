Burgers and mexican food.
Six meat choices plus vegetarian.
Beans, rice, potatoes, french fries, peppers, guac, corn, whatever they got it and it isn't extra.
Daily specials to eat cheap.
Prep work going on by the mesquite grill causes drooling.
Place smells AMAZING due to the mesquite.


The guy before me had the most complex questions and requests for his two burritos and they didn't even blink.  It's set up like a tacqueria and you get whatever you want in your burrito, taco, nachos etc.  Breakfsst burrito at 5pm?  No problem.

Today we had 10 tacos and drinks and with tax it was just under $20.  We had baracoa, marinated pork, marinated chicken, and chili verde tacos.  On the tacos, we had them throw on cheese, salsa, pico, grilled corn, guac, lettuce, and some cream cheese on different tacos.

The guy before me wanted a breakfast burrito with 3 different meats and then a 4 meat burrito with french fries and beans and both of them were THE SIZE OF MY HEAD!  The guy after me ordered steak, pork, chicken and bacon on his burrito.

F yeah!
