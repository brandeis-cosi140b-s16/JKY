I'd give this place more stars if I could!!! Everything about this place is A Amazing. The food is so fresh and that smokey scent when you walk in crawls up your nose and welcomes you back everytime! I eat here at least 3 times a week and never get sick of the steak. The quesadilla is what originally got me hooked. LOOK, if your looking for " your little spot" for lunch or what have you, no better spot than here. I have yet to find another place for lunch and if this place keeps up, I never will :) KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK GUYS!
