There's a lot of places you can get Mexican food.
Especially in Chandler, AZ. However, this place stands out as one of the most unique to me. It has to do with how the food is cooked, and their true to their name-no fake grill marks here. Lol. You can really taste the mesquite smoke and flavor, and I could see flames coming up from the grill, since you can get a pretty nice view from behind the counter. 

The service is always great here. Also, they run specials throughout the week. You don't want to miss Taco Tuesday! :)
