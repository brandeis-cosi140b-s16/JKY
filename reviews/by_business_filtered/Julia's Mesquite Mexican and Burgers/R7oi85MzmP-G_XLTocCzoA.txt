DELICIOUS! Came in for some tacos on a Tuesday and walked into an amazing mesquite aroma.  Wound up with a green chili burger and 1 taco, both were  amazing! They let me taste all the different meats before making my choice and let me tell you it was a hard one. A+ customer service,  Plus I love the fact that the are Family owned and operated! Definitely  a hidden gem!
