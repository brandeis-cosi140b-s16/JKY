this is a nice family owned place.  I had a marinated chicken burro with black bean and guac.  It was huge and really tasty.  My daughter has the carne asada chicken tacos.  The hardshell tacos are not greasy like most places.  The carne asada is simple and tastes like mesquite grilled steak.  The place was a hit and we will be back.
