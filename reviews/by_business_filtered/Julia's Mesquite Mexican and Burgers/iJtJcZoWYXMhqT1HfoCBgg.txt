Trying to find real good Mexican food in Arizona is next to impossible. Every time I hear "hey let's go to filibertos", I puke in my mouth. Growing up in the valley in California has really gotten me spoiled when it comes to Mexican food. Julia's is the answer to my long awaited prayers. My first time in, I got to sample all the meats . I am there at least 4 times a week now. I love it!!!
