I figured I would give this new place a shot (It was formerly Flame Burger). When you first walk in the smell of the Mesquite grill is great. They have a nice selection of homemade salsa's at a self serve station. There's probably 6 different salsa's to choose from. I sampled 3 of them and they were all nice and fresh ranging in different heat levels. I ordered a carne asada burrito enchilada style (approx $8). It was really good. You can really taste the mesquite in the meat, the refried beans were amazing, they tasted like grandma made them from scratch. I'll definitely go back to try some other items!

As a bonus this place is family owned and I always like to support local small businesses.
