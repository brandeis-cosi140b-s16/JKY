Tried every breakfast taco on the menu cause they were cheap,  I was particularly hungry and couldn't make up my mind. Wasn't disappointed on any one. I surprisingly ate the lot!  Lol.  The homemade salsa bar was really good, a lot of flavor With just the right amount of spice. My wife had the cheeseburger and loved it.
