So good! We tried it on Taco Tuesday when tacos are only $1.50. They're street taco sized. There are 7 different meats to choose from and the incredibly nice & helpful employee offered us tastes of any we wanted. I got green chili pork, carne asada, and marinated chicken. All were good but the chicken was my favorite. My husband tried all 7 and liked all of them with his favorite being the marinated pork.

They will dress the tacos however you want at the counter with lettuce, cheese, pico, salsas, etc. or there is also a salsa bar by the soda machine where you can dress them yourselves. I recommend both green salsas! There was a red one that was crazy hot too if thats something you're into. I'm too wimpy for it.

They also have breakfast tacos/burritos/bowls that I want to come back and try. Breakfast tacos are only 99 cents before 11am! I'm pretty interested to try the burgers as well. The mesquite smells so good! They have some sort of special on Wednesdays for the burgers. Not sure on the details of the special but its on my list to try!
