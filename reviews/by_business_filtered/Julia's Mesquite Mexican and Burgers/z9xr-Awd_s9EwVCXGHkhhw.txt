Quite good.  They'll give you a sample of their meats.  All are good...maybe even great in some cases.  Real nice salsa bar with lots of choices.  We had carne asada burrito and carne asada tacos.  Burrito was huuuuuggggggeeeee...and good.  For whatever reason we ordered the tacos in hard shells.  They weren't bad, but I would go with soft shell in the future.
