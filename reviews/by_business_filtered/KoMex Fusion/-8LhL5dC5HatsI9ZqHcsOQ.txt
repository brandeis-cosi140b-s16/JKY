Went with a group of 4 and we tried a few different things.  I had Tofu Fried Rice with a side of Kimchi.  Was super tasty and big portion.  Others had Quesidilla & Tacos.  Everyone liked their meal.  Price was right, service was great, owner super friendly.

What more can I say, a solid option if you find your self in that part of town.  

Will definitely be back, planning to try their other location as well.
