Nothing bad to say about this place. Nachos are outstanding, bulgogi burrito is superb, and spicy pork tacos are phenomenal! The flavors here from Korean to Mexican food mash so well together.. It's like they perfected it. Never once have been disappointed in ordering something from here. This is the tastiest fusion and prices are very reasonable for portions. I really wish that one day this place opens up on some busier street corners with late night hours, because I can see this being a popular late night muchie meetup spot! I highly recommend Komex if your looking for guaranteed good food and to try something new.
