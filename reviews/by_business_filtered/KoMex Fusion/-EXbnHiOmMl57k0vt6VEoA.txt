Kind of a throw back joint.  Food was pretty good.  Some of the things that go to me were a few soggy tortilla chips and the beef taste over marinated,a little to salty.  But over all the service was great.  Again, it is what it, simply great.  So when you approach the door of this local "hole in the wall" joint leave your pretenious thoughts ouside and prepair yourself for great food truck style food, in a sit down restaurant. Mmmm, mm...
