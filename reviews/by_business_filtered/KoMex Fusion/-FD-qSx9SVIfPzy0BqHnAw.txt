In my travels, restaurants out of the "norm" are hot on my radar.  Korean-Mexican Fusion is always a sweet spot for me.  So, when I found Kormex on Yelp I was excited.  I was not disappointed.  The menu is full of amazing food, and I wanted to order more than I did, but I had a plane to catch, and extremely full does not go well with 30,000 feet.  I had the Bulgogi Beef Burrito.  It was delicious!!!!  The staff was very friendly, and took the time to make sure I was taken care of despite a busy lunch rush.  Next time I am having the Bulgogi Beef Fries, and shrimp tacoma.  Yes, I will be back, and I have already planned my order.  Go here!
