I love both Mexican food and Korean food.  Nothing can really go wrong here.  I love the menu, the food, the price and the service at KoMex.  I wish it's closer to home and work but beggers can't be choosers.  I told my boss about it, and it's one of her favorite places for lunch now.

Favorites:  Pork Tacos, Beef Tacos, free chip & salsa starter, prokkimchi fried rice
Friends' favorites:  Pork Tostada, Fulgogi Fries
Taste great but look like a heard attack:  Chimichanga
