What a surprise! The food was excellent.
Seeing the place from the outside and the plaza brought serious doubts about coming all this way to eat in this place. Boy was it worth it!
Korean-Mexican fusion is something you are not likely to see often, especially in a small place that looks as if it only does take away!
We ordered fusion tacos, fusion burrito, fusion quesadilla and fried rice bulgogi.
The best was the burrito - it was stellar! I would have skipped the quesadilla - in such a place I rather fill my tummy with better things than molten cheese!
Service was extremely nice.
