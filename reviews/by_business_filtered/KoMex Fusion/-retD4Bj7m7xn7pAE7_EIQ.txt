I reallllly wanted to like this place :( I came here with the expectation of tasting tacos like the Kogi truck and bulgogi chimichangas like Cha Cha Chili-flavored food (both LA-based Korean-Mexican eateries), but man were we disappointed. The only thing that was spectacular was the attentive customer service, but that's where it ends :( The free guac and chips were nice, but their chips are the super-hard thick kind of chips. I ordered the bulgogi chips/fries combo, and neither tasted good. Pork belly taco was okay. The flavors in my bulgogi chimichanga didn't complement each other at all. I tried mentally convincing myself to like the food, but I just couldn't. 

Maybe if this was my first time trying Korean-mexican food, I would enjoy this place. Komex has a lot of fans, so they must be doing something right! It just didn't jive with my taste buds. The waiter and waittress were very attentive here, though!
