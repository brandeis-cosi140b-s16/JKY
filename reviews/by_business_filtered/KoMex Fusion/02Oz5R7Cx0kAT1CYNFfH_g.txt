Insanely good!  In a town with so much overpriced crappy food, I needed a fix like this so dearly. Without a doubt, the very best thing I ate while in Vegas was a Kimchi burrito. The wife had the chicken tacos with kimchi. She couldn't talk... Just kept saying "mmmm" with a full mouth. I went here on a whim after reading some Yelp reviews on my way to the LV airport. Thanks Yelpers!!! I'm so glad I went here. You're definitely not going here for the ambiance - just so damn good cheap eats.
