I had a bul-gogi burrito with a chicken fusion taco. Everything was amazing. The thinly sliced beef was absolutely delicious. Loved the chicken on the fresh corn tortillas. i was also served complimentary chips and salsa and guac, which was awesome and unexpected. I all this... plus a bottle of water for 6.48. Unreal. Go here. You will not be disappointed.
