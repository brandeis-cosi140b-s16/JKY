I LOVE their food! I've had quite a few things on the menu, and I've never been disappointed. My favorite dishes is the bulgogi tacos and bulgogi nachos. But explore, because they make good food!!

This is a mom & pop type of place so don't expect the fine dining experience. But honestly, some of the best foods I've had have been at these type of places.
