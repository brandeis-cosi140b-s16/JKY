Apparently the owner listened to guys like H.K.L. and decided she needed to raise her prices. Maybe I was just spoiled on her really low prices but now her prices are about average and it takes the wow factor out of it for me. I loved the fact that I could come and order a couple of entrees for 10 bucks. Now that time has passed. The real turn off was finding a hair in my chips. I took them back up to the owner and she apologized and offered to bring me another basket. At that point I just paid the bill and left. I really loved Komex as you can tell from my previous reviews. At this point I just feel like the success has turned to greed and I won't be back.
