KoMex was out of the way but it was an anticipated foodie stop on a weekend Vegas trip.  I had just read a magazine article where their Fusion Burrito was actually rated one of the very best in the entire US!  Now that's really setting a high level of expectation.

We stopped by for a midafternoon mini meal to just share a couple of items.  The Fusion Burrito with pork bulgogi was good but it didn't blow me away by any means.  Maybe I'm jaded by the numerous good burritos from SoCal. The Fusion Fries with beef bulgogi were slightly disappointing.  I didn't enjoy the fries themselves and the toppings were on the skimpy side.

The service here was very nice and friendly and that counts for a lot. 

I've had Korean fusion food in SoCal too and I thought I've had better back at home.  I highly recommend Urban Seoul in Irvine.    

I've crossed KoMex off of my Vegas Eating Bucket List and it's now on to other places!
