This place has the kimchi fusion burritos I literally dream about. Once you have them, all other burritos will feel incomplete!!

This is one of my top places in Vegas. It's a little hidden gem of a place where you can get food unlike anywhere else that will tantalize your taste buds and not break your wallet.
