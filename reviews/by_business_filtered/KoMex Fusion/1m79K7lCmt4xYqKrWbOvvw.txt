KoMex Fusion Express, the name says it all. It is perfect for those that either can't decide between Korean or Mexican, or simply wanted both for their next meal. Not to mention that these two cuisines with their affinity for their optional fiery kicks just pair well together.  In case that is not sufficiently enticing, there are some Chinese (friend wontons disappeared quickly off the plate here) and American added in for good measure.  Did I mention that it is reasonably priced too. 

First timers should test drive their Fusion Tacos or Burritos, prepared with Korean BBQ inspired fillings in traditional Mexican corn tortilla shells or flour tortillas.  Optional Kimchi can be added to the order, but I think it tasted better on the side and not in the tacos or burritos.  I rarely order nachos, but their Fusion Bulgogi Nachos was worth deviating from my customary ordering habits.

This small mom and pop restaurant is operated by a nice couple.  It is located in what appears to be a rather worn out looking strip mall, but don't let that deter you from what will most likely be a surprisingly good experience eating out. Enjoy!
