Where is the 10 star rating????

I have been to komex but none of my friends have, because we do not live around there. BUT it IS so worth the drive!!! I took my friend after a day of shopping. I think she was a little freaked out by the sketchy hood. I ordered a bunch of different things to share. Wonton soup, flautas, musubi, tacos, fish tacos and a torta to go for hubby. All that plus tax and tip was $40.  Sooooo much food!!!! It was ALL fantastic.

Besides the TERRIFIC food, I like that you can get a variety of different things. I had never had musubi, cuz I hate spam, but it was good. But then I am able to get the Mexi food that hubby so loves. It is PERFECT! I wish I lived closer, LOL.
