Dubbed as our Vegas weekend cheap eat, the marriage of Mexican and Korean was a good concept that suffered from poor execution. Komex is located in a strip mall and is a bit of a hole in the wall with paper napkin drawings taped to the wall and a dark, dirty water? line that made its way along the wall, counter, buckets, etc. The floor is chipped and dated as is much of the remaining decor.

But hey, I came here for the food right? We ordered a few beef bulgogi tacos, a few pork bulgogi tacos, the half order of loaded fries, and a chimichanga to split for two. We received complimentary chips with guac and salsa. Chips were oily and needed salt, guac was quite bland, and salsa not memorable. The tacos were the highlight of the meal albeit a bit messy. Fries were super soggy and execution of the dish was straight up poor. The chimichanga was equally as meh that we left half of it untouched. Of the beef, pork, and chicken bulgogi meats we tried, chicken was the worst.

Good for a cheap eat that is not Chipotle or Taco Bell, but not worthy of the accolades it has received. Cash money = 5% off.
