I ordered takeout after work, and Komex makes the best fish tacos I've ever tasted!  Generous portions of lightly, crispy battered fish in a flour tortilla and topped with even more scrumptious mounds of pico de gallo salsa, which I also personally topped with a sweet chili sauce that I have at home, yummmers!!!  I have yet to try  their other menu meals, but I don't think I'll be too disappointed if they're half as good as the fish tacos!  ^_^
