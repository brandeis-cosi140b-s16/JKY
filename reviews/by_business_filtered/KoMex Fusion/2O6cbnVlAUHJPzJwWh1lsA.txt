I am a HUGE fan of Komex. I've been going to their other location for a while. Everything is so amazingly amazing. When I moved into my new condo and found out their was a Komex within walking distance it was a HUGE selling point. This location is a lot bigger than the other location. They also serve a small selection of beers. They have a little bar area as well.

 However other than that the same old Komex amazingness. If you haven't been there stop what your doing now, and go. I recommend the wontons, bulgogi (fries or nachos), tostada, as well as some of the entrees. If you don't have a huge appetite I recommend going with the half portion.
