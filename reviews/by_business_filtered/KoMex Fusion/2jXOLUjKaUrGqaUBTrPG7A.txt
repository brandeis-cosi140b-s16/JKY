We ordered the fried rice, chow fettucine, and tacos. All were delicious. Huge portions and inexpensive. It's a hole in the wall but the food was really good. I think their tacos are actually better than the Kogi taco truck. The tacos don't have as much filling, they're small but flavorful and only $1.30 a piece. The other entree dishes are huge - sort of a Chinese style share dish. I am definitely going back to sample other items on the menu.
