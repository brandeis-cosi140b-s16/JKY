Komex Fusion is doing big things in Las Vegas. The creation of Korean, Mexican, Chinese, and American infused dishes is pure genius.
When I hear of great places to eat...I am on my way! Hidden in a small mini mall, I found food greatness! Today was my first time eating Komex Fusion and I will admit, it's the best taco I had in about 5 years. Yes...5 long years. Of course, I didn't just eat a taco...lol.
The wontons-Spicy beef and pork, stuffed inside a wonton wrapper and deep fried, served with a spicy dipping sauce!
The Bulgogi Fusion Burrito-Thinly sliced spiced beef, Mexican Rice, Green and Brown Onions, Pico de gallo, and Cheese, wrapped inside a fresh flour tortilla shell. The meat is seasoned to perfection, I really have no words, it's so good, it shut my mouth!
Lastly, but not least, the Bulgogi Beef Tacos is it! Spicy Meat, cabbage slaw, melty cheese. They taste like it was marinated in Korean spices, then cooked on the flat top, creating little bites of crispy, tender, joys of beef!
