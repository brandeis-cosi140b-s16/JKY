At first I was a bit skeptical about a korean-Mexican fusion restaurant, but this place had great reviews from other Yelpers so I gave it a shot. Boy am I glad I did! This restaurant is superb! I had a taco with Korean beef and all the fixins' of a regular Mexican taco. The beef literally melted in my mouth...sweet and spicy at the same time! My friend and I also shared the beef fries...comparable to carne asada fries, but with Korean beef. This place is amazing. The service was a bit slow which is why it gets 4 starts instead of 5. Komex...you are on to something magical!
