I Rarely give  a place 5 stars!!!  

I do have to mention that Ko-MEx is not new to me.  My daughters are Ko-Mex!!!  Seriously.  My daughters are Korean and Mexican mixed and they turned out to be Hawaiian looking!  I would have imagined if you fused Korean and Mexican food you would have wound up with Hawaiian food???  Yes - no... anyways.

Reasons why this place is 5 stars;

You cannot beat the price!  GEEZ.  I felt guilty!  I had 4 fusion tacos, fried wontons, chips and salsa, bottled water... $5.85!  

The fusion tacos really are that good.  Korean style pork, chicken, beef in a taco!  The kimchee on top is optional at no charge!!  A perfect orchestra of grilled meat, fresh cabbage, tomatoes, onions, kimchee and I have to guess but a hint of sesame oil... 

The owner is running around waiting tables!

This place makes me happy.  I wanted to take my shirt off and rub the taco all over my chest...  I wanted to jump up and throw a corn tortilla 2 tables down hitting Seabass in the back of the head!!! ... is anyone reading this???

The place is in a bad location and quite frankly it is a dump - but the tacos were really that good!!!!!!!!!!!!
