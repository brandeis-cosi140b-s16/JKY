Came here because I had a craving for Mexican food.  I decided to try KoMex.
First off the customer service is excellent.  They are prompt and very friendly.   The meat used is also very lean, tender, and not fatty at all.    
The meat is marinated Korean style.  

That being said it just didn't satisfy my Mexican craving.  
First off the rice was fluffy, bland  and not flavored as Mexican rice.  The beans also did not seem to have much flavor and was a bit on the dry side.  The chips and salsa they give you while you wait  though was excellent.   It was very fresh and tasty.  I just think I was expecting the fusion to be a lot more Mexican tasting.  

Next time I think I'll will try the Korean side of this restaurant. since the prices here are great.
