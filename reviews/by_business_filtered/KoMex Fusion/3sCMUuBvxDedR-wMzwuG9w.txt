Seriously - run, don't walk, to get some insanely good fusion tacos at KoMex!

Don't be scared of the hood it's in, or the strip mall location, and don't be put off by the lack of decor or a/c - just go in, grab a seat, and get ready for insane flavor delerium!

Worth it for the free freshly made guacamole & freshly fried chips alone (dude - I wanted a vat of that guac to take with me), but it gets so much better!

I had four of the best freakin' tacos I've ever had for $5. FIVE BUCKS! Completely worth it, totally delicious, and super, super fresh & tasty. These people know exactly what they're doing.

PS - you HAVE to get the in-house made hot sauce for the table, too - you will not be sorry!
