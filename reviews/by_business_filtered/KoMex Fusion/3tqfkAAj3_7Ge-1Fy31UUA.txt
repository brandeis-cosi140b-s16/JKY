this place was really good! i had read a few reviews just to see what to order and my group of 6 had 3 orders of everything they wanted and nothing disappointing!! it was all flavorful. the place looks dingy but dont let that detour you. the owners are VERY courteous and help with any thing they can.

A MUST GO. off the vegas strip great food!
