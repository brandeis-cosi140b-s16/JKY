Went to KoMex for the first time for my friends birthday...one word DELICIOUS. Once my friend mentioned the place I checked it on yelp and the ratings were 4 to 5 stars so I was pretty excited to check the place out and try the food. 

For starters we ordered the bulgogi fries and nachos both half orders. Beef bulgogi kimchi fried rice, combo fried rice, spam musubi that we all shared. The fries were worth trying, as for the nachos they were good as well. But if I had to pick between the two to try its would definitely be the fries. The kimchi fried rice was delicious, especially being a kimchi lover. The combo fried rice came with veggies, beef, and shrimp which was good. 

If you haven't been here you definitely have to try this spot out, worth spending some bucks on.
