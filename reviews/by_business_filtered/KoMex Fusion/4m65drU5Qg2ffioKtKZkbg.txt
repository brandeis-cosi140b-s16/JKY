Whoa Whoa Whoa Whoa Whoa... Komex, where the heck have you been all my life? Ok, maybe it's a good thing you're 250+ miles away... or I'd need a triple bypass and a lifetime membership to the gym and Overeaters Anonymous. 

1/2 Nacho 1/2 Fries Combo. Talk about having your cake and eating it too. I couldn't decide between the Fushion Nachos or the Fusion Fries... but luckily this isn't a dilemma because I can order 1/2 of each. Komex, you're the real MVP!

Ok, seriously, who came this dish? According to my waistline, you are the devil. The nachos are the star. They're fresh outta the fryer - but not super oily at all (which is surprising.) The bulgogi, the cheese, the secret sauce... OMG. I'm drooling on my keyboard just thinking about it. Run 3 miles, come eat these nachos (and if you get the fries, request them WELL DONE), and then run another 13. It's worth it, trust me. 

Oh, I ordered some other stuff too - but who cares. Get the damn fusion nachos!
