I don't know what it is, but I really enjoy checking out fusion places. 

I've been to KoMex a few times now. This most recent visit I brought some first-timers with me & of course I had to order the bulgogi nachos to give them a taste of this place! My friends had a fish taco, fusion enchilada plate with chicken & a fusion burrito with bulgogi. Sadly, they mixed up the meats for the burrito & enchilada. One friend got a nice surprise, the other.. not so much. Yours truly decided to order the pork belly musubi & a (yes, singular) fusion flauta. I was a little disappointed with the pork belly musubi. Two pieces took up the whole plate. I could barely hold it, so I used my fork & picked at the pieces. My fusion flauta was pretty tasty though, so I was satisfied.  

I love the bulgogi nachos/fries! I'm glad that you can order half orders now. Definitely coming back when I have my next craving for them.  ..which might be soon.. :)
