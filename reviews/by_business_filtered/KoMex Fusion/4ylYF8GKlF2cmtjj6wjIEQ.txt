This place is worth 10 stars!

I always take guests here from out of town because the korean mexican fusion concept is intriguing, yet so deliciously logical!

Food is simply amazing and the prices are so reasonable, especially for the large portions they serve!

This restaurant is hands down worth a trip if you are visiting from the Strip, and equally a hidden gem for locals looking to impress visitors!
