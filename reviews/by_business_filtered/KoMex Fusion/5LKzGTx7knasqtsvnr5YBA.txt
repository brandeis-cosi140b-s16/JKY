Sweetness overload.

Ordered the bulgolgi fries and taco. Everything was soooo sweet, I barely got to half of my meal. The sauces were sweet too!  It's suppose to be a spicy sauce, but there was no hint of spice.

When I think of Mexican and Korean food, I think of spicy & this was none of that. 

My friend had the bulgolgi cheesesteak and she said it was alright, but also claimed that it was sweet.

Overall, I wouldn't recommend this place, it's nothing near to Mexican or Korean when the flavor of everything was just sweet and nothing else.
