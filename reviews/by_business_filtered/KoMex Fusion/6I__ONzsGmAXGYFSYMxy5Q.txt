HATE  Nothing.

DISLIKE  Decor in different parts of the restaurant don't really work well together (ie: bamboo wallpaper vs. Korean-Mexican cartoons). 

LIKE  Larger space than the other location which means little to no wait at all. Location is closer to home. The complimentary chips with guacamole and salsa.

LOVE  The fusion concept. The amount of food for the price. The kimchi fried rice. The musubi with fried egg. The knowledgeable and energetic server. The different options for almost each entree.
