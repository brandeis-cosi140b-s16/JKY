Somehow the best way I can describe this place is CRAZY, UNLIKE NO OTHER.  What's better than Chinese Food and Mexican Food?  How about the 2 mixed together:)  Tacos topped with Bulgogi, Burritos filled with Bulgogi and a side of fried rice (WTH), fries topped with Bulgogi.  Oh man my mouth is watering writing this review.  Fun, Friendly Staff and A MUST for all Food Adventurers.  Until Next time KoMex
