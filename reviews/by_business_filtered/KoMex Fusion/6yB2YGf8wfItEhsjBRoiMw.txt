Dammit, I really really wanted to like this place, and I still do want to, but it just didn't hit the mark for me. 

The restaurant is clean and neat, and the service was good. We were the only table in the entire restaurant for a good while before a few other tables shuffled in. We ordered the enchiladas with beef, pork AND chicken, a spicy pork burrito, beef bulgogi flautas, and kim chi fried rice. Everything was JUST okay, but I didn't get the fusion part at all. Other than the fried rice, everything tasted just plain Mexican to me, and not exceptional Mexican either. I didn't get the Korean fusion in any of our dishes at all.  In addition, all of the meat in the enchiladas tasted the same. I couldn't tell the difference between the pork and chicken at all, not even by looking at it. 

The kimchi fried rice was the best out of everything we ordered. It was flavorful with a hint of kimchi and the fried egg on top was a great touch. 

Sadly, the meal was extremely forgettable and I probably won't be returning. :(
