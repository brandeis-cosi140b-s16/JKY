Love the bigger restaurant, I can bring my kids in for a meal.  Our prior visit was to the other store and we had to get it take out.  Highly recommend the tostada, so unique.  We are really enjoyed the fried wontons and at $1.50 for 5, they are a great deal.   The kids really enjoyed the chicken quesadillas, the chicken was super moist and tasty.  The wings were another hit with the family.  If you are wanting a unique experience and some great flavors, this is the place to go.
