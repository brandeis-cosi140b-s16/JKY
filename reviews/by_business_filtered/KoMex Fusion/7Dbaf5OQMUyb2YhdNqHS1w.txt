Ate there the other day, and best description of their food.. "wow".

Instant seating, ambiance & location would only rate 1 star at most.. but the food makes all the diff and that IS the point of a restaurant.  

I had 2 Fusion Tacos, one with chicken and the other with pork.  I had no idea so much filler could fit on those little tacos, but they were both excellent - I especially loved the chicken one.  Hubby got the Bulgogi burrito and I could have sworn I saw little hearts fluttering around him when he bit into that monster.  I'll admit, I was surprised by the amount of damage he did to that, since I think there are countries with less land mass than that thing had.  And yes, I had a taste of it.. definitely a winner.

Oh, and I had made the mistake of ordering the Spam Musubi - not that there was anything wrong with it, just no room left to fit it into my tummy after the tacos.  Once I started on them, the musubi just kinda got forgotten about.. I took it home, though, and had it the next day - still tasty despite being a day old, so I'm betting it would have been fantastic when it was fresh.

We will definitely be back, and soon =D
