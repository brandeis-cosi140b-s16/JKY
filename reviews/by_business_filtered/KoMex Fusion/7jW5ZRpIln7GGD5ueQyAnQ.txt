food is good.service needs improvement. i think they are short staff. my boyfriend and i went last night around 6pm was seated right away. the lady i think might be the owner took our order after 5 minutes. we waited 15 more minutes for water and 10 more minutes for the salsa and chips. when the chip and salsa finally came i show the lady the special check in deal on yelp for the free wanton she said ok.  my boyfriend love their special sauce which he had to go up to the counter to asked for.they were so busy. we didn't get any type of service till the bill.at this point we still didn't get our free check in wanton but didn't want to wait any more.they usual give you  a orange and fortune cookies at the end of the meal. the lady apologized  they had just run out of orange and left us with ONE fortune cookie for the TWO of us. i was disappointed. overall, it's good food for the price. they give a large portion but for sure need improvement on their service.one more thing, i'm sensitive to MSG and  i think they do used MSG in their seasoning.
