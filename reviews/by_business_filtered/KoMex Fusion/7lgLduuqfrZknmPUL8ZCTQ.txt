Sooooo so so good. I've never experienced Korean/Mexican fusion before so I don't have anything to compare it to, but this place nails it. A true hidden gem in the outskirts of Vegas. Very friendly guy, fair prices, and amazing taste. A must try!!! And try the fusion guacamole!! BY FAR the best meal I had in Vegas.
