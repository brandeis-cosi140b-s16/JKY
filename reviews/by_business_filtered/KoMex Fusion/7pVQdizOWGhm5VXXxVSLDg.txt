We just wanted to see where the place is, but ended up having a small lunch snack.
Lunch consisted of 1 fusian taco with pork belly on corn tortilla, 1 fusion taco in lettuce wrap, 1 bbq pulled pork slider, 1 pork fusion slider, and a half order of Bulgogi fries.
The service was excellent, the food was great, and it is very reasonable.
Las Vegas needs more places like this!
