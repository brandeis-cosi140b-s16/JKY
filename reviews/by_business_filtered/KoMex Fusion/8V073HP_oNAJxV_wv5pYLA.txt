I am so late on this bandwagon.  Writing a review for this now is like just getting into the "Lost" TV series yesterday.   

Loved it all.  Kimchi was a must have for my tacos.  I enjoyed the pork, bulgogi and chicken in that order.  I wondered what their regular Chinese or non-fusion dishes are like but I will never know.  If I'm trekking it all the way up Decatur to get here, I'm getting the fusion goddamit!  My wife got the bulgogi burrito which was a monster.  That could be lunch for two.  Free fried wontons with a check-in.  Afternoon lunch coma sets in upon completion.  

Corona or Hite beer would compliment their stuff perfectly.  Maybe they let people byob?
