I went in the other day just to take a peek at the menu while I was waiting for my insurance agent. They offer a full menu at competitive prices. They made upgrades to the dining area since that last time I've been there. ( got rid of those seat pads) The house fried rice and boglie ( spell check) nachos are a must. I will be back very soon.
