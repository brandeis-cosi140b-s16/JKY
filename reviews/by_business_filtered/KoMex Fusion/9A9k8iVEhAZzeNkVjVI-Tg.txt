I just can't tell you how much delicious Korean/Mexican fusion food they have. I love the various fusion tacos. You just can't have one. I've been going here for quite some time now and it has never disappoint me in any way. It does get busy sometimes and you might have to wait for a few minutes because they have about 20-30 seats for people. It's small in there but the food is worth the wait. Customer service is very good. I love trying new fusion food. This is must try place for locals and tourist.
