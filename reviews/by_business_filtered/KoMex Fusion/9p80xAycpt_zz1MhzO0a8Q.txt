Here's the thing:  I liked the food at KoMex and thought that all of the food was solid.  I'm just a little confused at the overwhelming amount of support that comes off of the Yelp-o-sphere at how amazing this place is.  I mean, it's good, but is it really earth shattering like so many Yelpers make it out to be?  Perhaps it's because I'm a resident of LA - the undisputed progenitor of Korean/Messican fusion food - that I've become somewhat blas√© to the whole scene...  for reference, your humble author cut his proverbial teeth on Jose Bernstein's Kimchi Burrito in 1996, a full 10 years prior to the inception of Kogi tacos.

Anyway, since Corazon and I had an early dinner reservation at the exxxcellent Lotus of Siam, we split a couple of tacos (bulgogi and pork belly) and a half order of the bulgogi fries.  As I said, the food was reasonably priced and everything was tasty.  I was surprised that they actually had table service at this restaurant, but all of the wait staff were friendly and approachable.  I am almost 100% certain that they are all close friends or family members of the owners.

In summary, it's always great to see local restaurants succeed and it seems like KoMex is on their way up after reading signs of future franchise options.  Despite not being blown away by the food like many other Yelpers, I was pleased with the quality and price and I hope continued success in their future endeavors.
