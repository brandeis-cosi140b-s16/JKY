KoMex...I had so many expectations for you and you know what you did?! You exceeded them. Congratulations.

Delicious and affordable food. Tried all the tacos and a half order of bulgogi fries, my favorites probably being the samgyupsal taco and the fries. They also give each table nachos with guac and salsa in the beginning (sweet!). We asked for more guac and they just gave us some! Free guac is the greatest thing in life, I swear.

Service was great and food was bomb. I can't wait until they open up their newest location near my house! I'll go there all the time.
