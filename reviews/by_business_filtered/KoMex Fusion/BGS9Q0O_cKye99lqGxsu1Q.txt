Let me just start out by saying, this place is awesome!  It was packed on a Saturday night when we arrived.  We had to wait a bit to be seated, but we didn't care after tasting what we had waited for.  My table and I went crazy for Bulgogi since this is what you should do when trying Korean/Mexican/Chinese/American fusion (phew!)  We ordered the Bulgogi fusion tacos, the Bulgogi fusion burrito, and the Bulgogi fries.  After seeing pictures of those fries and living in San Diego for years where carne asada fries are like crack, I couldn't resist.  Everything was delicious!  The tacos were cheap and had great flavor.  We ordered kimchi on the side which was a nice accompaniment.  The burrito used similar ingredients but could definitely fill you for days.  The fries came out on a huge plate and we could barely make a dent in them, although we did try our best.  The server was very attentive and friendly.  Plus, she didn't stare in disgust as we sat before this mountain of food, which was much appreciated.  I will definitely be back Komex, but next time I think I will venture onto the Asian side of the menu.
