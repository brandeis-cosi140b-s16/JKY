So I stopped in here the other day because I heard SOOO MANY great things about this place- better than Kogi?! I had to try it. I ordered a carne asada taco in a corn tortilla and 2 bulgogi lettuce "wraps". I gotta say it was yummy and very good, but I don't know if it was better than Kogi. Kogi is pretty innovative; their tacos have bulgogi and kimchi and really emphasize that Korean flavor. These lettuce wraps had pico de gallo in them, and it wasn't super reminiscent of the flavors I was expecting. The carne asada was pretty solid, no complaints there. But what's up with Vegas Mexican restaurants putting rice in their burritos?!
