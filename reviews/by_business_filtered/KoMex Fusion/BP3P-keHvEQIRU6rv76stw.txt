The service is friendly. Price is ok. Food, on the other hand, is not impressive.

Highly overrated!!

Maybe I was there on a bad day. I definitely think this is a overrated place. Most of time Yelp can be a very helpful place to find good recommendations. But once a while, you find highly overrated places posted by hyped up yelpers posting with peer pressures. I guess nobody like to be a party pooper.

To justify my little speech, I have to talk about the food. Well, the bulgogi in my burrito tasted just like regular meat. I couldn't identify the Korean flavoring. The chicken and pork tacos were dry. You have to take a sip with almost every bite. I think it's because there was not enough salsa. 

Salsa should be fresh made fresh,not from cans if you are serving it in a restaurant. Especially if it's a restaurant with Mexican food. And if you use cabbage instead of lettuce, you will lose the watering effect when lettuce is being chewed. The problem can be fixed by putting more chopped onions and tomatos.

Anyway, just a little suggestion.
