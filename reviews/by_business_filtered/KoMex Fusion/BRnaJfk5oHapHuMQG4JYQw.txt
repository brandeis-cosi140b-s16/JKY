This is a tiny little hole in the wall in a strip mall on North Decatur. I have been reading about on Yelp for a long time, finally decided there was no time like the present to try this restaurant. 

There are maybe about 10 tables. We came early which is good, because as dinnertime approached it became much busier.

All the food was absolutely wonderful. I had the bulgogi plate with chicken and pork belly. Very nice. The carne asado tacos were so good I'll definitely have to order them next time we come back. 

All food is prepared completely from scratch, to order. So, it may take a little while to get your food, but wow, well worth the wait! Service was fantastic, very efficient, and prices were beyond reasonable for the quality of food we enjoyed. We'll be back!
