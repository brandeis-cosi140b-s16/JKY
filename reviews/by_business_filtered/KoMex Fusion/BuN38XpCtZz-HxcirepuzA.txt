I could not believe there was such a fusion out there. It's a very small restaurant but comfortable. The ladies there are very nice but when busy is hard for them to keep up with their customers. The good is amazing. I had the burrito... I will never forget how amazing it was. We also had some tacos and they made good for our son since they didn't have a kids menu. Great overall. You have to try it!
