all of their food is good. i like the flavors and the different types of sauces you can get. being korean the flavors are familiar to me but everything works well. the fresh guac is always good. i always get some tacos and a bulgogi quesadilla with kimchi, cant go wrong with that. i dont know if im really sensitive to MSG but i always get the MSG symptoms really bad. 

thirsty and sleepy

and the amount i eat is usually moderate. so its not the itis. the only time i seem to get that way is when i eat at a chinese place that loads up on the MSG. maybe they add a lot of salt. NO MSG!
