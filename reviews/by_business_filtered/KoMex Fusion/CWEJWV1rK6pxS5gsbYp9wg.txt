It pains me to give my beloved komex three stars, but it's what I felt was deserved on my lunch here.

Overall the same yummy food. I mean seriously how they do make the perfect creation of fries each time I come. Their bulgogi fries are to die for, and like I said it's one of the best fries you can get in Vegas.

But sadly, it is not the same as the original komex. Maybe its the lack of workers? But it seemed like it took FOREVERRRR to get my food here. Along with re fills of my precious water. Maybe it's because I came in during lunch and there was only one person working. But still there were probably only three customers in total. That and the prices are totally raised up from what they were two years ago.

Still....those damn bulgogi fries hold a special place in my heart.

Prooo tip: If you're in a rush call in advance and you can pick up the food!!!!
