I love this place because I don't have to compromise anymore when I want to eat Asian food. If my husband wants a burrito  or a hamburger I can say " Let's go to  KoMex!" The only bases they are missing from my husband's cravings are lasagna and pizza. I think those are pretty good odds! 

We were served chips, salsa and guacamole while we waited for our meal. I thought that was pretty cool because usually guacamole is extra at most restaurants. The guacamole was fresh and chunky.  I also had free won tons which were crisp with my Yelp check in offer. 

I ordered the Bulgogi Beef Plate (marinated beef) for $6.99. The beef was tender and flavorful. It came with a nice side of white rice. My husband had the Carne Asada burrito for $4.99 that comes with Spanish rice and beans. He said that he could tell the beef was a better quality than what they use at  Robertos because there was less fat . I'm glad we both enjoyed our meals. 

I like that the menu has a wide variety of choices, the food was yummy and the prices can't be beat!
