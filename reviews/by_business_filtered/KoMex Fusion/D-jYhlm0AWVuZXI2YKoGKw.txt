I had a terrible experience here and will never be coming back. The only good thing about this place was the tortilla chips and green tea. The bulgogi meat is flavorless, our order was made completely wrong. Who doesn't know how to fry an egg for crying out loud? The spam musubi was completely dry and tasted like the nori was old. Even the fortune cookie was stale. Not just disappointing, I feel robbed for having to pay 20+ dollars just for tea and a few chips.
