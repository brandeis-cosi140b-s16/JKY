I have now eaten here at least five times more and my five star rating still stands. I still havent dined in, which I would like to do eventually, especially since they remodeled and replaced the booths with tables, chairs, and benches. Oh, and they now have a new server to help the owner who speaks english, which helps things move along! My favorites continue to be the fusion tacos with kimchi. I also love their chicken fried rice, its become a staple now. I'm a big torta fan in general, so I finally tried their fusion torta... Yumm! But I definitely need to order that when I dine in, cuz the bread gets soggy by the time I get to eat it when I do takeout. So in conclusion, I have yet to be dissapointed, and hopefully will never be.
