Whew, let me tell you, if there is an open parking space: 1) park 2) Dash inside 3) get a table!

This place is really popular.  So unique, too. On the surface, Korean/Mexican/Chinese fusion does not sound like it should work.  Well, as you can tell by the reviews & ratings, it does work & work well.

Also, come hungry, because the portions are, ahem, large.  Cheap, too!  Lotsa food & cheap, what every growing boy needs, right?

I had a Pork Bulgogi taco & Chicken bulgogi fried rice.  The classic, eyes too big for my stomach situation.  The taco was tasty & spicy, with a mild sweetness (bulgogi, of course). It was pretty big for a street taco, but, I think that is becoming the trend for street tacos. The chicken fried rice was more than plentiful, with chicken, egg, carrots, peas, & scallions.  Some ginger & garlic in there, too I think.  Light on the soy sauce which is a welcome change from street corner Chinese fare.

The place itself is pretty tight on space & the food takes a bit to prepare, but this is not fast food.

If you're in the area, you owe it to yourself to drop in & try.
