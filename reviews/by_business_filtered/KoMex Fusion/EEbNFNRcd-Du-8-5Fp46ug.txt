What can I say, besides great. After reading all the reviews on here, me and my coworker decided to go on an adventure and boy was it a good decision. Now just to be fair, I did not try many items on the menu, but the Fusion tacos were amazing! I am Mexican and these tacos are, in my opinion, better than any you can buy at a regular Mexican Restaurant! Yes, the location is not attractive at all but who cares if the food is soo good. 

Please note, the place will be closed 
from Dec 15- December 26th for the holidays:( 

So here is my final analysis: 

Pro: 
1)Asked for water and instead of getting tap water, we got to free bottled water. 
2) Chips, Salsa, and Guacamole, all free! 
3) Checked in on yelp and got an order of Wontons. 
4) The tacos we very good. Meat was juicy and soft. 
5) VERY Cheap!  Our bill came out to 8 dollars! 
6) Fortunate cookie and orange. 
7) Very good variety of food. 

Cons: 
1) I feel like I stole some food because it was that cheap! 
2) Might take a bit if you go during lunch hours.
