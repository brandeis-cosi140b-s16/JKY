We waited over a year to try Komex, as the few times we were North, the place was swamped and we didn't have time to spare. That was our hint. Yesterday was our day. Summed up in one word. F A N T A S T I C. Now I learn they have a SW location at Buffalo/Flamingo, so YAY, much closer to us. We will be regulars. We each had burritos, which were tasty alone, but made divine by 4 homemade chef's sauces. So good, I might have to dine there again today...cravings...
