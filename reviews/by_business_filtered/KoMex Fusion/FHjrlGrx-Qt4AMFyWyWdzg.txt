I usually don't do yelp reviews but this new husband & wife business deserves a great review. 

There's been a lot of comparison to the LA Kogi tacos so I had to try this new spot out... it looks like just another ma&pa place from the outside. We were greeted by the wife. She served us complimentary chips & salsa. By other reviews, we already knew what we wanted to order: bulgogi burrito and bulgogi & daejigogi tacos. Nowadays, everyone knows how the value of a dollar is slowly going down. And that is why the food was incredibly cheap!! $5 for the burrito and $1.29 for a taco!! WOW... we definitely got our money's worth! Quality of the food was great! the meat was marinated very well and tender. And they also give you the option of the kimchi on the side (as it maybe overbearing for others) or in the food itself. The portion of the food was huge but I still managed to eat it all!! yea.. it was that delicious!! Later, the husband served us complimentary pork skewers! OMG! More tasty food and free?? Don't mind if I do. And when they presented our check, they gave more complimentary food: peeled & sliced oranges. The total for 2 people was only $17.. included 2 sodas, 2 huge burritos and 4 tacos. Seriously, we probably ate $30 worth of food!

We usually don't meet a lot of restaurant owners. The wife, Linda, was very nice and personable. She told us the history on how they opened up the place and asked where we were from.  And, by the time we left, she greeted us by our first names. 

I am definitely returning back this week!! they've got us locked in!
