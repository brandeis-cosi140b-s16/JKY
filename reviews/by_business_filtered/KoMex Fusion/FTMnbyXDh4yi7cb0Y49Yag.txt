Two words: So. Good.

KoMex was recommended to me by both a Korean friend and a Mexican friend, so I knew this place had to be legit.  I called to place an order for pick-up for dinner for the bf and I.  The staff member I talked to was really friendly and helped me when I told her I had never been there before and wasn't sure about portions and what not.  I settled on the bulgogi burrito, chicken tostada, and pork belly taco since it was a special that week.

The chicken tostada was AMAZING.  It was so good.  I love that the tostada is actually made out of rice and it has this deliciously crunchy sear on the outside of the rice patty.  I'm definitely hooked on that.  The pork belly taco was super tasty too.  I had a bite of the bf's burrito; it was huge and delicious.

Just a note, the hot sauce they give you is legit. That stuff was super spicy, so I'd use it sparingly!

The food was amazing and I'll definitely make the drive to go back.  My car did smell like onions/garlic/food the whole next day and I did notice the same fragrance inside the small restaurant and it lingered on me even though I was inside for only 5 minutes to pick up the food, but that was about the only negative I could think of.  Amazing dinner for two people for $13? I'm sold.
