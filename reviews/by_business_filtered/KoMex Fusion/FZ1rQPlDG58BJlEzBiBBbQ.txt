Paid a visit to Las Vegas and searched for Mexican food and this place was in the results. Then I filtered by rating and this place went to the top. Wow, lots of 5 star ratings so I just HAD to go down and see if the food was REALLY that good or did they just have 88 friends that put down great reviews for them. Well the answer is, the food is REALLY that good and now they have a NEW friend  (89th) to put down a great review for them. I don't think I can add anything to the reviews that hasn't already been said regarding how GREAT the food is so I wont bother to reiterate. But I will say this....I DON'T KNOW how these people make any money! The FOOD is SO good, and the portions are SO HUGE and the PRICES are SO CHEAP, I just could not compute how they do it. I even hinted  that the GIGANTIC 4.99 burrito that was STUFFED with tons of meat would cost at LEAST 8 or 9 dollars where I'm from. Hell a Chipotle burrito with sour cream and guacamole is around 8 bucks and the food here is MUCH more worth the money and MUCH more flavorful. I would go here over Chipotle any day! So, bottom line, go there, get full, enjoy the flavors, and you will be very very pleased that you did.
