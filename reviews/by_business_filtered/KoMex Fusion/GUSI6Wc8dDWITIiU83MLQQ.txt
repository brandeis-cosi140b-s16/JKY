I ate at the Decatur and Washington Location on 7-23-2014.  It is hidden in a small strip mall and parking is at a premium.  The business was small but clean.  I arrived just before the place became busy. I was hoping to have a great eating experience, as the reviews I read, indicated others had enjoyed the food and service.  I ordered the (1/2 Order) of Bulgogi fries which was about $6.00 and a Diet Pepsi (which was bottled and cost $2.00)  The bulgogi fries tasted old and luke warm.  The meat, cheese and jalapenos were tasty but were also dry and by the time I finished them, were  cold and stuck together.  I was disappointed as I had driven quite a ways to eat there and it really wasn't worth the drive.  I ordered a burrito to go ($7.00) and it had it latter that day at home and it was only average.  I do not have the great experience that other reviewers seemed to have, nor did I find the food to be the "bomb" as  others rated the food to be.   The people running the place were friendly and I was happy with the service, but I came for the food and I will have to think if I want to go and try this place again.
