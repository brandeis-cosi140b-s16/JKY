This place is amazing. A small restaurant with a great mexican/korean mix.  Anything with the bulgogi meat is delicious. There is a reason it's rated so high on yelp and it's not because of the high population of a korean/mexican mix. 

If you don't try this place at least once while visiting Las Vegas you have significantly diminished your experience there. If you are a local and don't go here on a somewhat regular basis, move to Idaho. 

Trust me, you'll love it and if you don't then you don't love america.. or mexico... or korea.
