Mouth-watering, delicious, Korean-Mexican fusion.

I could make a meal out of their Fusion Bulgogi Nachos (even in its half order size), and their prices are so reasonable you can never turn this place down.

It's a hole-in-the-wall sort of setting and the water they give you in your cup is from large, gallon, filtered water bottles. AWESOME, considering that Las Vegas' tap water is bad enough to ruin any meal. (IMO)

I have returned to this place numerous times with my boyfriend (who is very hard to please, food wise) and have always had a great experience.

Their Fusion Tacos are so good! I always opt for the spicy pork. I've also tried the Fusion Burrito, and the sheer size of it even made my boyfriends' mouth drop. 

I love Fusion spots, and this, right here, is the epitome of a fusion flavor explosion!
