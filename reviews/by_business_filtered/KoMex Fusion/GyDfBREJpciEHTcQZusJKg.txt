Who'd a thunk to mix mexican style foods with korean flavors... FRICKEN GENIUS!!! 

This is a hole in the wall that needs to be mounted on a wall. Food is always on point from the bulgogi fries to the ghetto ramen (saimin for my island brethren). 
Portions are huge and well worth the price. 

The service is always exceptional. Brittany is one of the friendliest servers I've ever had. Shout outs to her.
