Good food. I ordered the Fusion Chimichanga...it was bbbiigggg. Every menu item was a pretty good sized portion. For $8 I'd say it was definitely worth it. The meat was tender and flavorful. Only thing I would say is that they're food wasn't really that spicy, I wouldn't even call it mild for my taste, so make sure you get some siracha or add some if you want that extra heat. 

They had good service, and fast too considering we had a really really big group. They gave us complimentary chips, salsa, and guac. Good stuff.

Next time I'm definitely going to try other stuff on the menu because everything looked and sounded good.
