Dayamn! I love this place. The place was a little run down and there wasn't a lot of parking but damnit I didn't come here to stay over, I came here to eat! The lady that was taking my order was extremely nice and very attentive despite being the only one in the restaurant and having at least 6 other booths to deal with she was super amazing. As for the food, I had three tacos, chicken, beef, and pork, the kimchee fried rice (huge portion even for me) AND two spam and egg musubis. I know, I'm a fat kid but don't worry I burn it off in the mornings. The tacos were good, not memorable but still did the trick. The kimchee fried rice had spam in it and was so amazing, perfect amount of spiciness and small pieces of spam so you didn't get big chunks mixed in with your rice. If you're hungry order this, it could feed at least five people or two of me, either way it's a lot of rice. Also if you're sensitive to spiciness, then you should still order this but stop off at the store and grab some Tums. 

What I really gave this place extra points for is the spam musubi, wowsa this might be the best spam & egg musubi in the city so far. The rice and egg in the musubi tastes almost like a garlic-y fried rice and egg mixed in that grease and the seaweed holding it together doesn't fall apart after one bite. So perfect. Definitely a fan of this place but if you don't like spam and Korean food but only Mexican food you just might find this place as okay and then ask yourself why you went to a KoMex spot as opposed to just a Mex spot.
