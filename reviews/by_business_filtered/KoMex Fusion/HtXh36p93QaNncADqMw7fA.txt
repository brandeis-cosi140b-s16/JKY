I can't say anything different about this gem.  Most of the reviews for KoMex are 5* for a reason.  It's a great little mom-and-pop place for well-executed fusion comfort food.  It's NOT a fine dining establishment!  Upon entering, I thought that it was like walking into one of my childhood friend's kitchens (and yes, an Asian childhood friend!).  Decor is on the spartan side (minimalist?) but everything else -- staff, food, etc. -- is full of personality.  We were greeted warmly and given menus right away.  Our tacos and burrito were fabulous, full of warm marinated bulgogi and fresh veggies.  The sauces were wonderful.  The FREE chips and guac/salsa were great and a total surprise.  We got a cheery "thank you and have a good night!" upon leaving.  So cute.

We'll be back.  We live in the NW part of town, so that's sayin' something.
