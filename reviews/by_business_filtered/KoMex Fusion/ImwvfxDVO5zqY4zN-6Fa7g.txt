I met one of the owners , she was very welcoming and has a great smile. The fish taco was tasty, so was the spicy pork taco
I dined in, so received the chips salsa and Guacamole all very good. The owner gave me a free second helping of the Guac and a free sample bowl of a seafood soup they are experimenting with and thinking of selling, it had kimchee and seafood lt was like a fusion of Mexican seven seas and spicy cabbage soup my tasty buds where whirling in confusion hehe.
