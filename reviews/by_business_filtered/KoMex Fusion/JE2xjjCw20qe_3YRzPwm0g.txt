I had the burritos and tried their tacos. It's really good Korean bbq meats
that are paired as a burrito or taco. I think they have bowls as well.

The quality of meat matters a lot to me, and they did well in that department.
The condiments and spices were interesting and definitely enhanced the meal
even more. This place is a winner in my book.
