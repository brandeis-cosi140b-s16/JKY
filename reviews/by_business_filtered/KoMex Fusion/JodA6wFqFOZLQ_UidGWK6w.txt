I hate hate hate fusion places but my girlfriend wanted to try this place out so I agreed. Why do I hate fusion? I'm a firm believer in foods tasting better as they were intended to be eaten, and boy was I right about KoMex.

Arrived to a empty restaurant wandering around looking lost for any sign of life to be seated, few minutes later a lady popped her head out of a curtain asking if we would like to be seated, 'um yes?' We decided our order through the pictures already pointed out on yelp and ordered the Bulgogi Fries, Chicken Fusion Burrito to share. The chicken burrito was tasty 4/5 but the Bulgogi fries were soggy and didn't scream fresh ingredients in any way. Had mushy salty pickled jalape√±os I would love to have seen some fresh on it and it was drenched in some liquid that tasted like sugar water. Maybe a double fry on the fries to combat this issue? Idk it just wasn't for me and while the chicken burrito was decent I don't think I would go out of my way for it. Service is nonexistent but this might be due to no patrons and having only one girl run the whole operations. It is fairly cheap $20 for two $15.81(food)  $4.19 (tip).
