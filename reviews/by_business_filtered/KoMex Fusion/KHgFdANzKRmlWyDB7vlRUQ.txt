As a former-local, this is hands down my favorite restaurant in Vegas. Family-owned and made to order, you can taste the care out into the food. My recommendation is to order from the fusion part of the menu as opposed to the just Korean or Mexican parts though there isn't much you won't love on the menu. The fusion burrito is my go-to and a crowd pleaser. This place is good for vegetarians!
