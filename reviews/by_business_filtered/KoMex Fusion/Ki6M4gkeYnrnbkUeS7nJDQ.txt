Great place for a quick lunch. Parking was tight. I ate here with my family several months ago and we enjoyed the bulgogi burrito and bulgogi fries. I stopped here during a work lunch break and tried the bulgogi fried rice. I ordered a half order and it was surprisingly big. The dish was tasty. They gave chips and salsa and guacamole while I waited for my food.
