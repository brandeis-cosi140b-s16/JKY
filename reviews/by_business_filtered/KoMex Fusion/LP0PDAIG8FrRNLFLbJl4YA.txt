I love this place so much. Can't speak to the entire menu, but fusion tacos are maybe one of the best things to happen to mankind. Seriously. And you can get them in a lettuce wrap. Yessssssss.

Additional fantastic things about Komex:

Not only do they bring you chips and salsa but the chips are delicious AND come with a side of guacamole

They have four different hot sauces that they bring to your table and let you experiment with.

Your check comes with a fortune cookie and an adorably cut up orange as a palate cleanser

Did I mention that tacos are crazy inexpensive?!

Did I mention that lettuce-wrapped pork tacos are maybe one of the best things I've ever eaten?!!!!

Also, everyone that I've encountered working here has been completely lovely.

I'm sold.
