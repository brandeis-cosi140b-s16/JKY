Really liked this restaurant, good price, and great quality of meat. Most places use really fatty meats, not this place! We came here during lunch hour, and we were seated within 1 minute. It was a large group, but they had no trouble. The service was good they filled my water multiple times (which is important, since I drink like a camel when at restaurants). They brought out the food, fresh and hot! 
what we got:
1. Fried rice with tofu! So good, it was a half portion and $6.5 and more than I could handle
2. The Nachos--nice favor, bolgogi meat plus pico de gallo, jalape√±os cheese. Would skip next time.
3. Spam musubi--large portions! Very good!
4. Bolgogi meat, rice and chicken

Will come again, would recommend it to others
