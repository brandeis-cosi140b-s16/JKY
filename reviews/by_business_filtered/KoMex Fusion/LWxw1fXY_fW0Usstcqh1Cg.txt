Oh man, this place is the best!  Stopped here with the family on the way back from CA to Denver. I can't even begin to describe how great the flavor is on the pork belly and bulgogi tacos. My wife got the bulgogi nachos and they were also out of this world. While they have straight Korean and Mexican dishes I highly recommend getting the fusion items with bulgogi or pork belly. The kimchi fried rice with an egg on top also cannot be missed. It's spicy but not so much that you don't enjoy the dish. A perfect balance. The service was also superb. I didn't get her name but the woman taking everyone's order was upbeat and really friendly and accommodating.  I also recommend, of the 4 sauces they bring you, to try/use the one with sesame seeds in it. 

Not sure why this place gets anything but 4 or 5 stars.
