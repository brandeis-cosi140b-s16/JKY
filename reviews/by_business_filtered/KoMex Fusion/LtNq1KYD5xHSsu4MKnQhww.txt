Ordered takeout.  Service was fast and not a long wait at all.  Ordered a chicken teriyaki bowl, Fusion sliders with fries, and the Fusion Fries with bulgolgi and added avocado.  Overall, the food was just ok, based on the reviews I expected to be blown away, but really it was just ok.  Ive had really good Korean bbq so I was expecting a little more flavor, but it mightve been the dishes I ordered.  I'd definitely come back and try something different.
