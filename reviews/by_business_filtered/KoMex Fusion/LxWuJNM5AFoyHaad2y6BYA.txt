Having previously been a big fan of the KoMex location on Decatur, I met up here with a few friends for dinner.

For starters, this location is a lot larger and more comfortable. The servers are attentive and nice. I ordered the beef enchiladas.

To be honest, I was a bit disappointed. The enchilada came out a bit cold, the Korean-style beef wasn't evenly distributed within the enchilada, and parts of the rice tasted a little dry and overlooked. It might have been the dish, or the fact that we were a large group, but I wasn't a huge fan and wouldn't eat that dish again.

As a note for large groups: I appreciated that they split the bill for our table without issue, left us with a pitcher of water, and gave us (like at the old location) delicious orange slices, with plenty extra for the whole group, to munch on afterwards.
