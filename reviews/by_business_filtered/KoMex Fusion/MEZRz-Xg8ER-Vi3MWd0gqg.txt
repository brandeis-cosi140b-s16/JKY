Having just moved to Las Vegas from The Bay Area, I wanted to try something new and delicious. Enter KoMex. Now, I am as Mexican as it gets. And being so close to San Francisco's Mission District and San Jose's East Side, I was blessed with some of the best Mexican food in the United States, so of course my palette tends to be a bit critical when it comes to Mexican dishes.

That said, this place was actually really good! We were seated promptly and during out stay we were approached twice and asked if everything was fine. Now that's pretty awesome customer service. 

My friend ordered the fusion flautas and I ordered the bulgogi burrito. I had a flauta and it was delicious. Very crunchy and flavorful. My burrito was pretty big and it was really good but I felt that it was missing sour cream. I mean, who the hell eats their burrito without "crema mexicana" or failing that, normal sour cream? Not a bad overall burrito but definitely not game changing and not amongst the best I've had. But again, my standards are ridiculously high.

They ended the service with orange slices and fortune cookies. Which was a nice touch. And over all the meal ended up being less than $20 for the two of us. Score!

I'll definitely be back. Maybe next time I'll get some of those flautas or try something else on their really yummy looking menu.
