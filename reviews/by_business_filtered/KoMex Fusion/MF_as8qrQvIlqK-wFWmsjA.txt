We originally planned to go to the other location but that one is closed on Sundays. Good thing we came to this location because they have special bar menu items that are not available at the other one. Let's just say the bulgogi burrito and grilled cheese are two MUST tries. I'm sure everything with beef in it will be good since they marinate their bulgogi very well. We tried the chicken with quesataco and it was good but nothing special. Chicken is tender and the flavor is average, however this is probably one of the healthier tasting item we ordered. We also tried bulgogi half fries and half nachos. I personally don't think getting the nacho was a good idea because they give you free chips so if you really wanted to you could just mix that in with the fries. But overall that dish was okay. The flavoring wasn't as good as the rest of items we tried and it probably will never order this again now that I know what it taste like. There are still some items on the menu that we would love to try but didn't get a chance to. Definitely will be back again next time we are in the area.
