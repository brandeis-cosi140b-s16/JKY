And this is why you shouldn't put your trust in humanity. How could such a mediocre food establishment obtain the coveted 4.5 stars with close to 1,000 reviews? Coincidence? I think not. Upon reading the 4 recommend reviews tied between extreme love and hate, I decided to trust the consensus.. Mistake. I should've have trusted Mandi L's pinpointed summary of this joint. 

Upon browsing the menu, a feeling of uneasiness began to set in. Fusion? What fusion? The only condiment separating this spot from a Los Betos was a Korean slaw-- your typical vinegar slaw, disguising itself as an Asian stalple via soy sauce. 

We ask the waiter/cashier for his recommendations-- he says the chimichanga and cheesesteak. A man at the table next to us is praising the cheesesteak so we oblige-- obviously electing beef for the cheesesteak, and pork for the chimi, per recommendation. The plates walked down the aisle to our table with a salsa platter-- two Mexican salsas, and two Korean sauces. Upon first bite, I hit a void of flavor. For the remainder of my meal, I found myself dousing each bite with both sweet and hot Korean sauces-- craving to make my sad Mexican/Philly meal reach the fictions land of fusion-- but I was left in limbo. 

I didn't mention the stacks of cheap-ass 80pack corn tortillas lining the kitchen window, nor the weird pita chips that served as "fusion" chips and salsa, or the fact I didn't get my 8oz water glass filled once during my meal-- because they didn't affect the overall mediocrity of this meal. Unless you want to help diminish Komex's star rating to something more accurate (2-3 stars) and prevent future yelpers from being led astray, don't go here.
