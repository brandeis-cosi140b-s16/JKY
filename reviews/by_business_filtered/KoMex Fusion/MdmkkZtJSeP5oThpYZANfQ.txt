This place is great if you cant decide what to eat, mexican or Korean food?  This place combines the two.  I had three fusion tacos, one with bulgogi, one with pork belly, and the last chicken. They are topped with Asian Cole slaw (kind of like a mild Kim chee) and They were delicious.  They also have traditional items on the menu if you don't want to fuse mexican and Korean style foods together.
