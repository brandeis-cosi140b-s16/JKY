Went here on a whim - was looking for somewhere to eat and found this place on Yelp.  Korean and Mexican are two food types I'd never have imagined worked well together, but they do!  Would definitely recommend the pork belly fusion fries (something like that - not the nachos, but the french fry nachos with pork belly.)  We got the fries/nachos combination and the fry side just seemed to work/taste better (also, FYI, this combination is HUGE - great for sharing!).  I'd also recommend the calamari fusion tacos - again, wasn't sure what to expect, and it blew my mind!  Prices are reasonable, service is a little slow so not really good if you're on a time limit, but definitely worth checking out.
