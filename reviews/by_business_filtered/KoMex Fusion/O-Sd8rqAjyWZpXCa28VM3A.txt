I have been anticipating trying Komex for quite some time. I have tried to come on two separate occasions and have been disappointed that they were closed during my previous attempts.

My fella and I were having a very busy day of errands and were in the area when our tummies started rumbling. "Finally," I think to myself. We are seated and I immediately let our server know that I have checked in through Yelp to redeem my check in offer of free wontons. YUM! The wontons and complimentary chips with salsa and guacamole were my favorite parts of the meal.

My fella and I ordered the Bulgogi fries and a fusion burrito to share. My fella was really not feeling the food at all. He left feeling very disappointed. I found the food interesting but the concept not fully realized. The flavor profiles seem great together, but the execution was lacking the flavor I was hoping for. Their food seemed to lack flavor a little, almost bland. There were so many sauces and salsas to put on top of everything it didn't really help as much to round out the flavors as I would have hoped. The Korean meats were tasty but not the greatest quality or cut and it showed. Just too gristly. I know the price is right, but I'm not certain that the quantity over quality fared well today. I added Kimchi to my burrito for more flavor, it helped a bit, but something was still lacking. I like the Korean and Mexican fusion concept, but there was not enough of either to really give it a kick.

I had high expectations of this place, maybe too high. I still want to give the place another try, since the menu was definitely interesting, well-priced and the service was excellent! I'm just not totally won over after my first visit.
