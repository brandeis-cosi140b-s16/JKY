Wow!  Amazing food experience.  My taste buds were happy.

I read the yelp reviews and couldn't resist trying KoMex for lunch.  It is a very small restaurant so my family of six decided we would do take-out and eat back at our hotel.  It was about a 20 minute drive from the strip about 8 miles away. 

I am a foodie, so it takes a lot to impress me.  I was impressed with the quality of the food.  It was a flavor explosion, like nothing else I have ever eaten.  We ordered all of our food to go and I still gave it 5 stars.  I knew we would lose some of the texture on the way back to our hotel.  I ate the food about 30 minutes after it was cooked and it was still amazing.    

We ordered from the fusion menu; beef chimichanga, chicken tostada, chicken wings and Bulgogi Nachos.  We also added the tofu fried rice.  The flavor combinations where like no other.  

I would highly recommend this restaurant for the food quality alone.  The restaurant itself is very small but take out worked great for my family. 

Thank you KoMex keep up the quality work.
