Korean/Mex fusion is not a new thing. But this place has got the recipe down. I came with Angela and we both ordered some bulgogi tacos and shared the nachos.

The nachos hands down is amazing. Really amazing. You can absolutely come here and just order this as your only meal. Or, get some bulgogi tacos. Yeah they're good. Not the best I've ever had. Wish they made their own tortillas but almost no does in the States. But you get a ton of food on one taco.

Oh yeah, take a look at the pic I took. Its unique, I was amazed that no one else has taken this pic and posted it. It's not food, it's the sign about KoMex not being fast food. Seriously, this sign says it all. I think out of principle, I'd eat and support any place that has an equivalent sign.
