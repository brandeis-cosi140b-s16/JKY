Decided to try KoMex because of all the reviews. The food was very good! Complementary salsa and chips! Salsa was delicious but the chips were thicker than I like but that's just a personal preference. I had the kim chee fried rice and my boyfriend had the wings and cheese steak. We both enjoyed it!
