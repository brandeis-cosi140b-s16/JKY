I don't think I'm going crazy. But KoMex was just...ok?! For the longest time this place was THE #1 place to go to on yelp. My gf and I decided to make the trip out there because we have been on a taco bender for weeks. Plus, Korean and Mexican food fusion...I was convinced that I would like this place no matter what.

Welp...Although the service was top notch.  The food was very underwhelming.

I tried the Steak, chicken and pork komex tacos along with a big heaping plate of kimchi fried rice.

Chicken Taco - Lots of meat but I felt like I was only eating texture and sauces. Nothing at all stood out.

Steak Taco - I enjoyed eating these but compared to all the other taco shops I've been eating, this is one of the weakest steak tacos I've had during this run. I can't put my finger on it, but something was missing.

Pork Taco - Pretty good taco, everything was tasteful and I have no real complaints. Heck, if you stop by, I would definitely get one of these.

As for the Kimchi rice - I don't really know...it's a mindfuck to try to figure out why it was  subpar. No matter the amount of spices and sauces I would try to add, nothing brought out any real flavor.

I don't know if everyone is suffering from groupthink or if I'm becoming a pseudo-hipsteresque "I go to great places before they were cool even though I never talked about it until after the fact" nerd, but there are many other places better than this. 

I don't think I'll go out of my way to try this place again. But I wish I had a $500 shirt for them to spill water so I can yell, "HOW DARE YOU SPILL WATER ON THE ROCK's $500 SHIRT? so everyone can know how hypothetically important I am.
