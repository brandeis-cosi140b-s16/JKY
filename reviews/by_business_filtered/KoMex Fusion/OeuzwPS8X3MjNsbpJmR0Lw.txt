My daughter and I went and had a late dinner here. We were immediately greeted and were told we could take a seat anywhere we wanted.  The lady came and gave us placemats and the menus.  It took us a while just to order, not because service was slow, but because I couldn't decide what I wanted! There was so many yummy choices! 

My daughter ordered the Spam Musubi which were HUGE. She liked them and couldn't finish the 2nd one. One order comes with 2 musubi. There was an option to get them with egg, but she declined. I would have ordered it with, but that's neither here nor there. 

I ordered the chow fettuccine with beef bulgogi. I forgot to ask if I could get it without onion or bell peppers. I didn't mind it having it. That part was not overwhelming. The noodles were perfectly cooked and the whole dish had a black pepper and sesame oil taste to it. It was so delicious. I only ordered the half order after the server say it was actually more than half the size of a whole order. Needless to say, I still took half of it home. 

I ordered the bulgogi burrito for hubs when we ordered our food and asked her to make it "to go." Our server did not forget. She brought me a box, the check and my husband's burrito. 

This place is really good. The prices are really too good to be true.  I don't want to say cheap because to me that sounds negative for such delicious food. We will definitely be back here.
