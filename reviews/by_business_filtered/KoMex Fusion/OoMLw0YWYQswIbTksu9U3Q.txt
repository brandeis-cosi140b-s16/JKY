Thank God for my overly check-in happy, texts like a 14 year old (but in his 30's) friend. Without you and your 12,000,000,000,000 check-in's to every flipping place that you go to, we wouldn't have known about this place, this one was worth the Spam. Now, STOP IT!

Not knowing what to expect, considering I've never really been in this particular part of town, we walked in, were greeted by the staff and we were seated right away. Feels like a Mom & Pop shop, love those! Fine dining is for the other word for CAT.

I had a vegetarian taco in a wrapped in lettuce vs. the tortilla. And the hubs had a bunch of other things that I can't remember, let's just say, I wasn't as hungry as he was that night. My taco was UNbelievably flavorful. No, it's not Korean and it's Mexican, it's FUSION, so everyone expecting one or the other, wth is wrong with you? Look it up in the dictionary!  It's a freaking mixture of BOTH, some of you need to quit being angry and just enjoy the dang food because it's GOOD, stop lying.

Staff was friendly. They were on top of drinks and checked up on us often. 

Haven't been back purely bc it's a bit too far from where we live, but we will be back, I think I'll have a craving soon...
