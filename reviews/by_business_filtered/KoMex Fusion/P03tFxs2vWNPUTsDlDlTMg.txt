I had the chicken bulgogi and it was very good.  The flavors were all new to me and very enjoyable.  The service was a little slow, but we did have a larger group and we were not in a hurry.  The prices were pretty cheap for the amount of food I got.  Everyone in our group enjoyed their meal.

I would definitely go back if I am in that area.

If you are looking for a very filling lunch you've come to the right place.
