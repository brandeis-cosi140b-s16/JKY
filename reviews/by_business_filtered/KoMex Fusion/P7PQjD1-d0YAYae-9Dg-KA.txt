I used to eat carne asada fries but I don't see a point now that I can get bulgogi fries here. To be honest I was very skeptical being a fan of both Korean and Mexican food and didn't see how they could mix the two, but now I'm wondering what I've been doing with my life before hand.

The tacos are amazing and even better if you order them as a lettuce wraps. Pork belly, fish, and bulgogi beef were all great though the calamari ones are a bit lackluster IMHO. I took the fam here when they were in town visiting and even though my dad has never been a fan of Korean food he's itching to come back just to eat here again. 

Not far from the house so I've been hitting this spot quite a bit.
