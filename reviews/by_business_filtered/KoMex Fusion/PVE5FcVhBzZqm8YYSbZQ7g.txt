So happy that they decided to open up a Komex on my side of town!! Always a good place to go to for a quick bite. I also come here when I wanna introduce this place to people from out of town or if they've never been here before. I come here strictly for the fusion tacos. The spicy pork tacos are my favorite. Delicious!!! I have tried some of the other items on the menu on the other hand. They're alright.. nothing too "fusiony" or special I would say
