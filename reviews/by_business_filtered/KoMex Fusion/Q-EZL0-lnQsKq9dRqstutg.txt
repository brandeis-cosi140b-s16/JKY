Back to get wreck, all respect to KoMex who break
Their neck to keep their service in check
'Cause oh they combine Mexican and Korean majorly
Free chips, salsa, and guacomole keeps amazing me
She tell me there is bulgogi, on the torta or french fry
But I order only a half order of bulgogi fries, I gotta take it easy
Hate to sound sleazy, but I tease me, with a pork belly musubi
And when I grub it, I got a problem saying bye bye
Just another hazard of a fat guy
 
You ask why, don't matter, my pockets got fatter
decent prices got you looking at the menu for the latter
But Im a little greedy
I have to order extra bulgogi cuz I like my fries meaty
Food cooked to order so it won't be there in a jiffy
My girl is picky, but she ate the chicken burrito in a quickie
If you want fusion, you can't tie this place down
But for strictly Korean, I look around
