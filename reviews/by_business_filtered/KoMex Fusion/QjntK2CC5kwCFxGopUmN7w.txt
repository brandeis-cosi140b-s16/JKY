If Guy Fieri hasn't already reviewed this place on Diners, Drive-Ins, & Dives, somebody needs to let him know ASAP...

I've heard about this place for a while and I finally got a chance to check it out.  And let me tell you, this place did not disappoint.  I can be an honest critic of Korean food, because I've been eating it since birth.  Let me first start off by saying this place is a true "mom & pop"/ "hole-in-the-wall" type restaurant.  I was expecting this from other reviews and what I was personally told about this place.  

The place is small, very busy and crowded for lunch, and a longer wait than expected.  But the food and the prices were amazing!!!  I had the Fusion Burrito with Korean pork, Bulgogi tacos, Fish tacos, Fusion chicken tacos, the bulgogi fried rice, and the bulgogi fries.  Everything was delicious.  The chicken was very tender and the pork was excellent, but mildly spicy (I'm used to very spicy Korean pork).  But blend that Korean meat with Mexican flavor, and you have yourself savory piece of heaven in your mouth with every bite.

The portions are great for what you pay for.  The Fusion burrito is $5, and it's bigger than the carne asada burrito you get at Robertos. I definitely recommend this place to anyone who lives or is visiting Vegas.  When you do go, bring some patience with you and take it for what it is.  It's a busy "mom & pop" shop, with the mom running around as the only hostess, server, runner, buser, and cashier.  But the food and prices more than make up for it.
