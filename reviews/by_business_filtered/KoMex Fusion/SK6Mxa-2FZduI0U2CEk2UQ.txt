2 stars: Meh. I've experienced better. 

I've started to identify these restaurants that are Yelp hype-magnets.

They have super high ratings, are generally budget friendly, yet aren't very good when you actually go there to try the food. 

I suspected this place was one of these places. 

I ordered a few different tacos, the kimchi fried rice, and washed it all down with a sidral mundet.

So you get little tacos and a big platter of fried rice.

The meat quality was average, the seasonings were basic, and the fried rice was copious in quantity, but the kimchi was pretty pathetic and the dish wasn't very good. 

There are so many hole in the walls that are truly excellent.

This isn't one of them.

Maybe it's because the place has blown up that it's resting on its yelp laurels? 

When I went, there were a couple Mexican families and a few hipsters eating there. 

And from what I've noticed, hipsters don't know good food if it smacked the horned rim glasses off their heads. 

If it had been truly a good spot, I'd have recommended it, and returned time and time again, but it really was very basic food and not really worth making a special trip that way to go eat there. 

If you live down the street, you can praise it to the skies, but for anyone in town for just a few days, this place is an easy pass.
