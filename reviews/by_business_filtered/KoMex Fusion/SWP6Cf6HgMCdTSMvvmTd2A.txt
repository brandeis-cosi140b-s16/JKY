Not fast food, fused food.

Picking up some toys from the "Toys for Tater Tots" drive, I figured I should at least take a break and see what this place is all about, I mean, I'm a sucker for any place that serves burritos. 

I went with the "Fusion Burrito" with every intention of eating this while driving around Vegas, but when I saw the size of this bad boy I knew this was a sit down snack job. The Fusion Burrito is a monster filled with your choice of meat and Mexican rice, green & brown onions, pico, cilantro, and lettuce. I went with the bulgogi spicy pork and it was delicious, the lettuce was crunchy and the meat had great flavor, but I do feel the burrito had more filler than meat. I need more meat Komex!

I should have gone with the double your meat option and I do recommend anyone to do this when getting a burrito from Komex. Was it good? Of course it just needed more meat and less rice. Plus, the house made hot sauces are the business, seriously, If I was allowed I probably would have just poured the green sauce all over my burrito. Nummy nummers!

A great place for a few beers and a quick bite, but next time I'm running a train on some of their famous tots.
