If it weren't for Yelp, I would've never discovered this place! This place is just full of delicious food. Before this, I had never had Korean-Mexican fusion food, but KoMex has made me a convert! 

If you eat there instead of ordering take-out, they give you free homemade chips and salsa/guacamole. The fusion items come with a choice of 3 different meats (beef, pork, or chicken), fish, shrimp, and vegetarian. Kimchi can be added on to any fusion dish if requested, but I'm not a fan of the sour element kimchi adds, I'd rather add lime. I always get the fusion tacos, burrito, nachos, or bulgogi beef fried rice. I usually prefer chicken, but there's just something about their bulgogi beef that has me coming back for more. Portions are huge and prices are reasonable (although I've noticed they recently increased their prices by a small margin). I admit I haven't tried their Asian or Mexican dishes yet, so that'll be on my list next time I go. All in all, every friend I have brought to KoMex has loved it!
