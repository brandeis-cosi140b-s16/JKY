Wonderful srvice, the owner insist on giving customers bottled water instead of the usual tap.  I've had the bulgoki sliders with kimchi...which was relish, and the Korean beef tostada with the fried rice patty instead of the usual torta.  Accompanied by an awesome beef taco and the best beef bulgogi fried rice I've ever had!  The prices are unmatched for the quality of the food and the service, it's amazingly delicious!  I recommend this place to everyone I know.
