What can I say I, this place has over 300 reviews and almost a 5 star average! Is this place great? Yes! It's better than great!  

I had a friend recommend this place.  I said, "well I like tacos and kimchi."  Sounds good.  So we walked in this place with high expectations.  Let me tell you this place lived up to the reviews.  I don't always give 5 stars to restaurants.  They have to really blow me away with the food and SERVICE to get it.  We were promptly seated and our waitress was incredible.  I mean I wish other wait staff would just come observe to see how to do this job.  She went over the menu with us and offered suggestions.  We ordered 9 tacos 2 orders of won tons a basket of fries, and a couple drinks.  Our bill was only $16!  This place is incredible!  Street tacos with kimchi on them.  Every time I have an out of town guest we are going here!  You have to try this place out.  They are well aware of Yelp, which every business should be and they live up to the hype.  Cheers!!
