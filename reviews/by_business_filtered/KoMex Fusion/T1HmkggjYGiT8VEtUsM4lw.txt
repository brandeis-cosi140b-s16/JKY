I ordered the nachos with bulgogi, fusion enchilada and wontons.

Food-only ate here once but i love how they mix it up with korean and mexican dishes.  First timer and it was pretty good.  Nachos is awesome.

Ambiance-Felt good nice place to chillax and watch the game as well.

Customer service- on point! Super friendly and efficient.  Very helpful and patient.

Food 3 stars, customer sevice 5 stars.
