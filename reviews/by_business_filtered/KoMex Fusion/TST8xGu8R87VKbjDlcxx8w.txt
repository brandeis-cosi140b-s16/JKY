Despite the shabby appearence, this place has some really fantasic food. I recomend trying the fusion tacos, although I have yet to get something bad from them. And be sure to get an order of wontons for only $1!

It can sometimes be busy 12-1, for the lunch crowd. But off hours get you the best service, and if you wait for the busy hours, it WILL be worth it.

I ordered beef fusion tacos on flour this visit, and they are great.
