Great service, great food, great prices!

They'll start you off with complimentary tortilla chips with salsa and guacamole (Delicious!). Something to definitely try are their Fusion Fries! I like bulgogi (Korean marinated beef) on it with extra jalapenos. Also, their Fusion Fried Rice (Chicken, Spicy Pork, or Beef). Tacos are good and so are their burritos. The restaurant is always clean and the staff has always been great to me. 

I've enjoyed the gritty Korean/Mexican fusion food trucks like Bool and Kogi since I've lived in L.A., and even though Komex's tacos and burritos aren't as good, they still do other things really well.
