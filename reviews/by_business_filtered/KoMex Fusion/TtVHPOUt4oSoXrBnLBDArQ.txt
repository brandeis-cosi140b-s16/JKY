We were three starving people driving into Las Vegas from LA and wanted something delicious to eat AWAY from The Strip. KoMex exceeded our expectations and I'm so happy we went!

* I had two Fusion Tacos with Korean Beef and Kimchi. They were amazing and I could have had ten more.
* My boyfriend had one Fusion Taco, (Chicken) with kimchi on the side and an Enchilada plate and could NOT stop talking about them after the fact.
* Our friend had the orange chicken and loved it as well.
* We also had chips guacamole and Salsa.

Our Total was :::: $17.31 Where can you eat all that delicious food at such a good price?! KOMEX is a gem and I hope everyone goes and tries their delicious food.
