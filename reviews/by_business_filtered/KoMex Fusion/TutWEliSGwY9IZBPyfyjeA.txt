I didn't get to tryout their other dishes. Especially their main entrees BUT I can tell you if you want a fusion and you love Korean BBQ you can't go wrong with the Bulgogi fries! It's a shame I live in California and that it was my first time going to Las Vegas. Hopefully I go again soon, I can tell you I'll be more excited to try this place again (:!
