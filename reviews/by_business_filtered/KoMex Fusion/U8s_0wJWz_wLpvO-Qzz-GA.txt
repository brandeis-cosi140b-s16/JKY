Visiting Vegas anytime soon???? Leave the $9.99 rib-eye specials @ the strip. This place is worth the ride. KoMex is a small, quaint, family-run dive. But, your taste buds and wallet will thank you. We took a taxi(not recommended unless you schedule them to pick you back up)  Nevertheless, we waited happily for 30 minutes chatting up on how great this meal was.  In the end, taxi never showed and the owner Linda graciously offered us a ride back to our hotel.  I've never rated on yelp before and this may just be the beginning of more to come.  KoMex will be tough to beat on budget and value.  I see a bright future ahead for these folks.  THANKS AGAIN!
