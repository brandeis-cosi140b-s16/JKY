Enjoyed the fusion tacos.  The place was empty when we arrived for lunch but quickly became packed and there was a line of people waiting for a table out the door.  It's nothing fancy on the inside but the food was delicious.  Planning on going back to try some different menu items.  Just remember they aren't open on Mondays!
