Great food. Very customer friendly. Nice and clean. I will be back for sure. I love the bulgogi fries. Might try a burrito next time. Kinda small tho inside so if it's busy it can be a little annoying. The prices are great too. The $2 tacos are a great bargin. They could charge more for them. This place has a lot of high reviews for a reason lol. Enjoy!
