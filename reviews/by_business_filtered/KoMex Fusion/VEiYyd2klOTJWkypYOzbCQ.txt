First Korean Mexican fushion I've ever went to!

In the morning, it was empty - the waitress was very nice and kept checking up on us and talked to us sweetly; really brightened my day!

Ordered the dak-bulgogi burrito with kimchi: And OMG, the kimchi was really good, pretty authentic kimchi - just like the type my grandmother makes :)

The burrito was HUGE - (And not in that way, for the minds in the gutter lol), and stuffed with friend rice, lettuce, tomatoes, cilantro, pico de gallo, cilantro, and dak-bulgogi (which is korean chicken). 

Only wish that the hot sauces were more spicier, they didnt have any form of spice to me! But will come back again :)
