We had the pork torta, gulgogi nachos, shrimp and fish tacos, and fish/shrimp lettuce cups.  This was way too much food for two people but we wanted to try a little bit of everything.  The pork torta was insane, seriously good and HUGE.  I will definitely order that again.  The nachos were pretty good too, worth a repeat.  The other items we had were tasty but pretty standard.  I will go to this little place again for sure.

11/24/12 Update - Been going here pretty regularly for about a year...never disappoints.  I love it; the fusion pork torta is legit.
