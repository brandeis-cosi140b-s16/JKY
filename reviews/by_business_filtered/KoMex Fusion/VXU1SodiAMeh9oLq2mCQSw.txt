I love Mexican food and I love Asian food, so why not eat them together! This place is great because it combines both cuisines into various fusion dishes, but you can still get strictly Korean or Mexican food if you're not into the combo. One of my favorite dishes was the pork lettuce wraps. It was an Asian lettuce wrap but then they added pico on top! Great combo! The beef bulgogi chimichanga and fusion fries were also awesome. If you want great food with innovative combinations, check this place out!
