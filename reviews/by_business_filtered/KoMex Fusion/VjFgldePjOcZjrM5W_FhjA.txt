What.  Are Vegas Yelpers so used to crappy restaurants, this one seems terrific in comparison?  

My H and I landed at North Las Vegas airport at about 2:00 PM and were real hungry and thirsty, so we Yelped something nearby. Wow 4.5 stars so we made a bee-line to KoMex. 

One thing that attracted us to KoMex was, a Yelper wrote that you get chips and salsa. Not so fast, turbo.  You get your chips AFTER you order. So if it takes them a while to take your order, too bad, you get to wait. 

After I ordered my Bulgogi Plate and Gary his Chimichanga, our chips and salsa arrived with tiny plastic cups of salsa and guacamole.  The chips are more like fried wonton. Fine, ok but no big deal. 

I ordered iced tea and Gary ordered a Diet Pepsi. My tea arrived with no offer of sweeteners.  I dug into mu purse stash of sweet n low. Gary's drink was in a bottle. Really?  No fountain?  Sigh. I hate that. Did you guys know that fountain formula is different from bottle?  Very different. Bottle is full of phosphoric acid. 

Our food was fine. My spicy pork Bulgogi was not unlike I've had in other Korean restaurants. Gary liked his chimichanga and ate it all, but he didn't do two huzzas and a backflip. 

I had to ask for refills. The place is a little grungy and painted a mint-bile green.  An employee sat behind the service area eating a cucumber like a banana. The benches are wood but their backs are upholstered. The floor is dirty. 

I'd go back but overall, I'd say KoMex is only OK.
