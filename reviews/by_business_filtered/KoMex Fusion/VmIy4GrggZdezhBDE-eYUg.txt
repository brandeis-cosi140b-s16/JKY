I would give this place 5 stars without hesitation!!  Me and My T try to make it out here at least once a week, it's amazing.  

Must haves:
Bulgogi tacos
Fried rice with Bulgogi
Wonton soup (My favorite)

The tacos are incredible.  The beef is so tender.  The portions are great.  The price is great.  I would honestly pay much more for the food, there are few places that I would make this statement.

The fried rice is addictive, that's the only way I can describe it.  I seriously can't stop eating it.

The soup is a must have.  Again, portion is big, a lot of people can share it.  Such a comfort food, wontons bursting with flavor.  You can even order 4 fried wontons for 1 dollar!  They are just as good.  

By the way, a little disclaimer:  On the wall there is a newspaper clipping.  There are two handsome men featured in one of the articles!!
