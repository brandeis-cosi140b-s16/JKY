Bulgogi nachos are amazing.  It's a Korean fusion restaurant, and they definitely did it right.  

It's not fancy. It's in a small strip mall way off the Las Vegas strip. But if you're in town and willing to venture off the strip for some good eats, this is definitely a place I would recommend.  

Service is sub par, but I didn't expect anything fancy from a tiny strip mall restaurant. The food didn't disappoint.
