KoMex Fusion-fusion Korean/Mexican food. It's unique, cheap and most importantly, flavorful. Parking is terrible here but when you are lucky enough to find a spot and enter Komex, all that stress and frustration is out the window. What you might stress over is that you forgot your elastic pants on to fit all that food in your system.

SERVICE
Fairly slow but they give you complimentary chips which comes with salsa and guacamole. Enjoy those chips while they prepare your food. 

FOOD
My favorite is their fusion taco. I like mine with beef and or chicken. I also like to substitute pico de gallo for kimchi which adds a nice kick. These things are $1-$2 and is off the hook. Make sure to order 2 or 3 of them since each taco is small and won't fill you up. 

I've also gotten their bulgogi cheesesteak. Flavorful bulgogi but too much cheese for me personally. Huge portion. 

Burritos here are humongous. Half of this will fill you up. It just means you have the other half of burrito to take home and enjoy the next day. Packed with goodness and it's so good. 

CONCLUSION
Perfect as late night food except they are not open late. You definitely get the bang for your buck. Good food with slow service = 4 stars.
