How does this place stay in business - seriously?!

I went with a party of 3 and we shared 9.......i repeat......NINE tacos and a chicken chow fun for less than what you woud pay for fast food.  With tax, less than 15 bucks.  INSANE value!

We ordered 3 of the bulgogi (beef), dakgogi (chicken), and daejigogi (pork) tacos.  The beef was by far the best but they were all very tasty.  Be sure to dip in the Mexican, Korean, and Chinese hot sauces.  

The chicken chow fun is not the flat rice noodle but reminds me more of lo-mein but with much more texture.  It had the perfect bite and if there were a food competition, I would tear that sh1z up!

This place is awesome - they serve you bottled water (Fo Free), chips and salsa and guac , and bring out fresh oranges, and fortune cookies all for free.  I've had better chips but with all the freebies, quality of the food, and service I can't really complain.

The service was impeccable as the owner stopped by to ask about out experience.

This isn't Kogi but it's pretty damm good and you won't have to drive to LA and fight the traffic.  This place does well because it serves crack addictive food for a fraction of the price while delivering great service.  This place will thrive on their loyal customer.  Definitely check them out!

****SPOILER ALERT *****

if you haven't heard, they are exploring expansion in the SW....will be by Blue Diamond/  Fort Apache.   She also mentioned maybe another location so be on the look out.
