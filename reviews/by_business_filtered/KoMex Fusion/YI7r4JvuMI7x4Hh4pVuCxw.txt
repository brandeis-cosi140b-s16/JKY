Unbelievable! My husband had wanted to try this place and I just couldn't imagine the Korean-Mexican combo... so I was dogging it. Finally gave in and can't believe the melange of flavors and how they worked so well together. 

The Bulgogi nachos, a combo of crisp tortilla chips covered in mozzarella, beef, jalapenos, korean hot sauce and pico hit all the taste buds at once... Zowie... I'm hooked! Got the special of 3 soft corn tacos, topped with marinated green/purple cabbage, cilantro, pico and onions at an incredible $5 (including a drink) and they were down right mouth watering. The have several hot sauces, some bottled and some homemade, which I partook. One of the homemade sauces was a sweet/hot combo that set my portion of the nachos on fire... just the way I like it. YUM!!!! Get there as soon as possible!
