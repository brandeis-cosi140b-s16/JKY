Thank you yelp software man.  'cha-ching'. This place was close to my son's soccer tournament in Las Vegas's Summerlin neighborhood. I needed a break from 'team food'. I pulled in and got 1 order each (two in each order) of spam and spam/egg. Large musubi with an 'obi' of wide nori seaweed. They were excellent and a meal unto themselves. 

2 kalbi kimchi taco's were double corn tortillas fit the bill. It was more than Max and I could eat, late night back at the hotel. I would want to try their soups, if I was eating there. The hotspots and soups of Korea and Mexico go hand in hand with their use of spice and acidity (read vinegar). Next time.....

Highly recommended. Almost very table was full when I was there. The Korean gentlemen running the place does a great job! Thank you!!

Summerlin, NV and the surrounding areas have been easy to navigate - pretty community. For you futbal fans, perfect pitches!!!
