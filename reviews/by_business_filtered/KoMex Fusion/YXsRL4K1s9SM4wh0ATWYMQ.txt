Speechless! We now have a reason to come to Vegas! This is a small hole in the wall place in a small shopping plaza. We were kind of skeptical at first just because of the restaurant itself but we were very much surprised when the food came out. The bulgogi meat tacos were made to perfection, all the ingredients tasted amazing. It was something I had never experienced before.... I was in taco heaven! We were kind of disappointed because we were not able to try their pork tacos, they apparently were waiting for their shipment.  But next time we are in town we are definetly returning to KOMEX!
