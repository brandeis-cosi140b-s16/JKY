This place is amazing! One of my top 5 places in the valley to eat. The bulgogi fried rice is so good! Everything is! And everything is SO reasonably priced. My hubby and I always leave stuffed and usually for about $20. And the staff is so nice. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask. You can tell that they love what they do and love talking about their yummy creations! 

OH! And I just saw someone mention that drinks are canned/bottled... this is true.... but they have the most delicious unsweetened iced tea (I think it is mango flavored) and there are free refills on that one! It is soooo good! Just go check it out... you won't be diappointed.
