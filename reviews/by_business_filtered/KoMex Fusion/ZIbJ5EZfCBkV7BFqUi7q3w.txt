We just beat the rush, but the line can get pretty long. We saw it build up while we were there.

Korean and Mexican fusion. Sounds a little weird right? Maybe, but the food is good!!! I'm not as high on it as some of the other Yelpers,  but I still put it pretty high on my list.

So what's actually pretty awesome about this place is that they have ZERO problem splitting checks for you. Unlike other places that say they will but give you this reluctant only-if-I-get-a-good-tip attitude, our server split up our party of 12 with NO problem. Go in, eat,  pay your bill, bounce. You don't have to sit there for 30 minutes trying to figure out what everyone ordered and how much they owe for tip.

Bulgogi Burrito ($7.50)
Pretty huge burrito. I had to split because it was too big. The bulgogi portion is plenty, which is always nice. However, the taste of the bulgogi wasn't anything spectacular to me, just "pretty good".

The tacos were pretty popular at our table, so I'd definitely recommend getting that.
