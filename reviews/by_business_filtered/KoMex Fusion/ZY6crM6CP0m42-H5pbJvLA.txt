I was really looking forward in trying this place. I have to say I was little disappointed in the the value. The tacos where priced well but the other items where a little pricey. They should spend some money on the decor and the sign in front of me reminding me that it's going to take longer should be not be blasted of front of me. I recommend a simple sign or simple verbal reminder. A quick cleaning goes a long way. But try the lettuce pork belly tacos.  The asian guy was not really happy to see us! A smile goes a long way:)
