Several visits later and you still uphold the standard of Awesomeness.

But this time your awesomeness had me feeling guilty.  

Ordered the usual, fusion pork burrito and fusion pork tacos.  Pork burrito was actually a chicken burrito.  No, no, no.  Please ma'am, may we have the pork burrito?  Why of course you may and let me give you a discount for us messing that up.  5 minutes later pork burrito arrives.  No harm done but you still give us the discount.

A discount for mistaken identity of meat.  Are you serious?  How can you afford this on your already low prices?  Things are always perfect when we come here.  There is no need for a discount.  It was an honest mistake.  Now we feel guilty.

We love you Komex.  You know what customer service and satisfaction (and food) is all about.
