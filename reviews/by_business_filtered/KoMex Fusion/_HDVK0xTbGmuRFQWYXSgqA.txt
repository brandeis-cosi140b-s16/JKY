I wanted to try Korean-Mexican fusion. Ordered me some taquitos, but instead of guac they added some creamy sauce over the top with a powdered cheese. It was delicious. For my meal I got the Dak-gogi(chicken) burrito. The portion was huge. Too much for me in one sitting. 
The place is family-owned. The staff was very friendly, so much so that their customers greeted me as I walked in. My first time there, but I already felt like a regular. I was so hungry, and I wanted to eat fast. The problem is that anything Mexican only takes 5 min to make. So if you wanted to eat any of the Asian side of the menu, the wait is 20min for your order. My plan for a return visit is to simply order ahead.
