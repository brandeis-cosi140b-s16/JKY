WHO: To all of you Korean food wrapped in tortilla goodness lovers!

WHEN: I'm not too sure when they open, but I do know they close at 9pm.

WHERE: North Decatur, sooooo far but soooo good! =/

WHAT: It all began one night at about 8pm. My friend and I were thinking of a new food place to try. This one suddenly popped in my head (not knowing where it was even located), I called to see if they were still open, turned on GPS, and then realized how far we were supposed to travel (we were coming from the Southwest side of town)... We ended up getting there around 840pm.. I pretty much felt bad bec I saw they were closing and 9pm... Yes, I was that customer... lol

When we entered, there was a Korean lady who greeted us (I think she was one of the owners). I appologized about coming in and ordering super late. She said it was just fine, with a smile! =) We then looked through the menu, and I wanted everything!! She helped us choose and we ended up getting...

-The Fusion burrito: which consisted of spicy pork & kimchi wrapped in a burrito. Sooooo good
-Pork belly musubi: which was the special going on at the moment. Sooooo good!!

We were then greeted happily & we went on our merry ways... I love that place! I need to go back ASAP. Like NOW!!
