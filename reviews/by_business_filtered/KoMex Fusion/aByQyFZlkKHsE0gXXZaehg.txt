The Korean/Mexican fusion thing has been popular for a couple of years now. Some places do it better than others, and KoMex definitely does it right. If you are new to KoMex fusion just remember to keep an open mind. The experience is not like going to a great tacorilla, nor is it like going to a nicer Korean restaurant. It's different, but delicious. The wife and I always order way too much food trying to sample as many dishes as possible. But just like Chief Lone Watie, we always "Endeavor to persevere." http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csEzTwKemwY
Today Tacodillas were on special. Kind of a taco inside of a quesadilla. Fantastic!
Bulgogi Tacos came next. Also absolutely delicious. And we finished up the night with the massive Bulgogi Nachos. A great meal, with drinks, all for about $16.
