I am from So Cal and live in an area where there are a lot of wonderful Mexican Restaurants but I have never had anything like this. I was in Vegas this past weekend and went out of my way for the second time to enjoy a wonderful meal at KoMex Express. The food is great and the prices are very reasonable. To quote a former
California governor "I'll be back".
