Girlfriend and I went to Vegas for a weekend getaway an decided to hit up KoMex for the first time. On to the review.

Service: 5/5 The second we walked through the door we were greeted with smiles. The server told us to sit anywhere we would like and promptly came to provide us with the menu and answer any questions. Throughout our visit she would frequently stop by to check on us. Very attentive.

Food: 3/5 The food was decent. We had the bulgogi burrito and taco. The burrito was ok, but none of the flavors really wowed me. I also had a bulgogi plate with white rice just to see how it stands against other Korean places. It wasn't up to par. Their wonton soup, however, was amazing.

Price: 4/5 You can fill up your tummy without emptying your wallet. There are cheaper options around, but of course you came here for Korean/Mexican!

Overall: 3/5 stars based on my first and only visit. There are other dishes on the menu that I would definitely want to try, so this is not my final visit nor is it final review.
