This place isn't attractive at all, what-so-ever. But who the heck cares as long as the food is hella good, right? Plus, I'm no snooty booty. This was our very first time at this place. I read a lot of the Yelp reviews and decided that the good completely out weighed the bad. My boyfriend and I ordered so much that we actually had the lady, whom I think was the owner and was super nice, actually stop us mid-order just to tell us that this was a lot of food. LOL! She was soooooooo right. We ended up taking a lot of it home with us. They first came out with chips (homemade and awesome) with salsa and guac. Then they brought out our spam musubis WITH FRIED EGG :9 Then, came out our humongous burritos. Bulgogi (beef) for my bf and Duk-gogi (chicken) for me. The fusion between korean and mexican flavors was something I've never experienced before. It was genius. It had rice, our choice of meat, pico de gallo, beans and cilantro. Then came our tacos. I had pork, my bf had chicken and fish, which was fried and hardly any breading at all (such a breath of fresh air). I ate one taco and just a third of my burrito. Again, it was HUMONGOUS. So that was two burritos, four tacos, two spam musubis, a Voss water bottle, and lemonade for just $25!!! Can't beat that! And we used our check-in prize of fried wantons (also delicious!!)

Definitely going to hit this spot up again! :D
