i love good fusion.  i predict i will only eat off their fusion menu , but i will always wonder how good their  pure mexican or asian items are. beef bulgogi sliders were my favorite .  i like their chips, salsas, enchiladas & tacos.  i wanna try their fusion chimichanga & fish tacos/burritos. no music/radio.  a unique, rare treat w/nice decor & staff. 
 i won't go here after dark.  bad neighborhood = great pricing
