After my first KoMex experience, I have driven out of my way many times to eat at this place. The food is that good! I recommend just about anything on the Fusion section of the menu. My favorites include the following: Bulgogi Cheesesteak, Fusion Burrito, and Fusion Tacos.

The only food item I have disliked here is the Fusion Chimichanga. It was too greasy for my taste. I felt a bit nauseous. Other than that, everything else is gold.

The new location on Buffalo is also much bigger than the Decatur location, but it seems understaffed. However, the food is just as delicious.

Tip: Put kimchi on everything!

The service is usually great, and I am happy to see this local family business succeeding. I highly recommend it.
