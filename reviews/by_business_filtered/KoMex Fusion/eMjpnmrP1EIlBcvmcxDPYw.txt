Why am I reviewing an establishment that already well over 500 reviews?   Simply said, it is because KoMex has to be one of the best hole in the wall establishments that Vegas has to offer.

The kitchen here is very small, and service can be slow. Call ahead if you are pressed for time and budget between 20-30 minutes just to be safe.   However, the amazing food well makes up for the transgression of slower service.  I have yet to have a dish here that disappoints. 

The thing I love most about KoMex is that they are locally owned and have not abandoned the neighborhood, even as it has become a little on the gritty side.  I work very close to here and have a special spot in my heart for this part of town.  

I guess I could best describe this restaurant as "El Seoul" food.
