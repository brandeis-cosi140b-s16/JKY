My friend took me here before we went to watch a movie--we patiently waited for our food with that bowl of fried chips that they give out! 

I wasn't sure about Korean and Mexican food being blended until I had that Fusion Chimichanga..omg. It was messy and delicious and awesome! My friend vacuumed her meal right up! My other friend had the Kimchi Fried Rice..holy crap was that excellent. 

Most interesting mix of food I've ever had in my life. I would recommend this place a million times!
