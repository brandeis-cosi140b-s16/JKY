Finally made it out this way and brought my two brothers with me. 

This place is very laid back and the staff is friendly as well. All the items on the menu looked very good, I couldn't make up my mind with all the choices available! After about 10 minutes of hard thinking I ordered BBQ Pulled Pork Sliders and 2 beef tacos, 1 fusion the other Mexican. 

Before we received our food, we were served chips, salsa, and guacamole. This was the best guacamole I ever had, no joke! The salsa was very good as well, great start so far. 

The food arrived very quickly. First came my BBQ sliders. They come in 3's and consist of pulled BBQ pork with cole slaw on top between two toasted buns. The sliders were awesome. I ate them with ease and awaited my tacos. The tacos I ordered came with all the toppings and I even tried all the salsas provided with my Mexican beef taco. Once I found my favorite salsa, I used only that one for my fusion taco. Both were also very good, but I did like the fusion slightly better. Maybe it was the salsa I liked best??? 

The food my brothers order also looked very good. One ordered a beef fusion taco as well and the burrito. My other brother got an enchilada plate. I got a chance to try the burrito and enchiladas, both outstanding. 

I will definitely be back soon to try some items I didn't the first time around and more fusion tacos!
