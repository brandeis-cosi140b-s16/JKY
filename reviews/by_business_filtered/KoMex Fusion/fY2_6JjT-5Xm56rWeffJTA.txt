The Fries! Get the Fusion Fries!

This place was a PERFECT blend of Mexican and Asian fare. The fusion dishes are really creative and they blend together in perfect Korean-Mexican fashion. The place is not fast food, it is very high-quality food, but you still won't wait long for your meal. I think it took less than 10 minutes for all our food to come out, and we ordered a lot.

The fusion fries were my favorite, and a half order is big enough for probably 3-4 people. The pork lettuce wraps were a great appetizer, they had a little pico from the mexican side, and the meat was from the korean side. Another perfect blend. The bulgogi chimichanga was huge and delicious, and you definitely can't go wrong with this order.

I was very happy with everything I ordered and really want to go back the next time I'm in town!
