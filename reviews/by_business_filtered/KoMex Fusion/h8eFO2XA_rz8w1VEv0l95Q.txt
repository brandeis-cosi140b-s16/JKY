I have been coming here for a few years. There was a point in time where this place was almost a weekly must have due to craving it's deliciousness so badly. My absolute favorite was the bulgogi beef burrito and fried wontons. My boyfriend loves the spicy pork enchiladas. 

However, the last few times I have gotten food from here which were spread far apart, it has been a disappointment. I definitely see a lack in not only meat in my burrito but also flavor! My last burrito was so stuffed with overcooked/watery rice that I didn't even eat the whole thing. The beef was scarce and so bland when I could find bits. 

This really saddens me bc this place was something I could really count on for a quality meal and now I don't know when I'll go back if ever.
