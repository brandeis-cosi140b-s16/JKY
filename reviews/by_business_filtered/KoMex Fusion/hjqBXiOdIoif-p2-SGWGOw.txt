Marketed as a Korean/Mexican fusion joint.  KoMex is somewhat lacking at both of those aspects.  They essentially are a standard Roberto's style restaurant quality that also serves fried rice, noodles (chow mien, etc.) and Mexican entrees with korean style meats like bulgogi, pork belly and the sort.  They also have pork belly saimen.  

I had the kimchee fried rice with shrimp.  All the ingredients were there.   A bit spicy and there was a good amount of shirmp in it.  It was pretty good, but then again how can you mess up fried rice really.  3.5/5

Members of our table ordered the fried fish plate w/fried rice.  A bulgogi enchalada, bulgogi tacos, french fries and the spicy wings.  All of these were of bar grub quality.  Fries were light & crispy but could have used some salt.  The wings looked like buffalo style wings with a touch of Thai chili.  The bulgogi enchelada and tacos were sub par in flavor and there literally was nothing else in the tacos but thinly sliced meat.  No sauce no onions or veggies.  Nothing much stood out. 2/5 overall

The restaurant itself was lacking in ambiance.  Very cafeteria-esque.  Too bright.  Much less inspired than similar places like L&L or Aloha Kitchen for example. 2/5

Not much of a chance for a return visit.
