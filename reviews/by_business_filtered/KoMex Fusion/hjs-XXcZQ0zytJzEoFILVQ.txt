Komex is fantastic!  Went for the bulgogi nachos which were great.  But, the fusion tostada with the pork was amazing.  The shell is rice just crispy fried on the outside with the meat and this asian slaw on the top.  The server recommnded the pork as the meat.  My husband got one bite of this and one bite only.  The three tacos with each of the three meats is a good way to go to taste them each.  The guys next to us got the bulgogi fries which also looked and smelled great, but I am a nachos girl.  We went at lunch and it was quite busy, but we got a table and the service was friendly, quick.  Delicious! ...  that sums it up.
