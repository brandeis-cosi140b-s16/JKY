I am an addict. They opened komex across the street from me and I started out on the pork belly tacos, the bulgogi burritos, and the chimichangas, but I have escalated to a full-blown fried rice addiction. their pork fried rice is some of the best fried rice I've ever eaten, I don't know if it's the sesame oil, or copious amounts of crack cocaine. But I eat the fried rice at least once a week
