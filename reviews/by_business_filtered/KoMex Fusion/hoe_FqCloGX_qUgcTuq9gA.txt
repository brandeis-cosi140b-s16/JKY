First time going here and I was blown away! Entered and was greeted immediately. We got to choose where to sit and their menu is clean and simple. Me and my friend ordered the:
Fusion (beef) Enchilada Plate $8.00
(3 Rolled Tacos in Corn Tortillas topped with Red Sauce & Cheese) with Mexican Rice and the Fusion Nachos/ Fusion Fries combined 1/2 Nacho - 1/2 Fry COMBO $11.00 Meat, Mozzarella Cheese, Pico de Gallo, Jalapeno & Korean Hot Sauce

While waiting we were given a basket of chips, salsa, and guacamole. Chips were stale and the sauces were okay. Food came in within 10 minutes and the portion sizes were not too big yet not too little. It was perfect! Nacho/fries fusion was so delicious. You can taste the marinated bulgogi and the mix of cheese, korean hot sause, and pico de gallo. It was the perfect flavor combination. We ate the plate clean ;)
As for the enchilada plate, it was also good but not my favorite. Bulgogi was spot on and the rice was okay. 

Paid $21 for a very filling, satisfying lunch for two. Not bad I must say! Going here more often now!
