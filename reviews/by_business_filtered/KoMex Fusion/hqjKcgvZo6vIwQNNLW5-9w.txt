I know I wrote a review for this...WTF?

My first visit was decent, but it had a few hiccups that made me not too sure. I thought my tacos I had ( al pastor, daegji gogi and bulgogi) were good. We were first served by who I think is the owner and she was friendly and nice then there was a new girl and when tabulating our bill (they hand write it) it was way over. Also there was dustbunnys at the corner of our table. I'm okay with hole in the walls, but really, a dustbunny? 

We decided to try again and this time it was much cleaner. Food was still consistent. Now they have vegetarian options which is a plus so I had a tofu fusion style and a rice/beans and vegetable. The tofu was good, the veggie one only came with rice on mine but the veggies on it were fresh (stir fry mix- think broccoli, cabbage, carrot, etc).   BF loved the shrimp fusion style so now he says anytime we come here he has to get that. There is a check in special for free wontons. They are little meat filled ones (4 pcs) with some sweet chili sauce. 

The BF and I thought his family would like it so we brought them and they enjoyed it. Mom got enchiladas and she's a green sauce girl and with our luck brought them when they were making some but she said it would be better with it. The surprising standout was grandmas mongolian beef. I took a bite and that was really tender and flavorful. BF and I stuck to the fusion tacos. 

Overall, I think this place is solid cheap eats with a little something for everyone.
