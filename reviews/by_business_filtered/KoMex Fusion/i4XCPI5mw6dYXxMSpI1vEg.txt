This place lives up to the hype.  Reasonably priced Korean Mexican fusion.  The bulgogi enchiladas, Korean nachos, and Philly cheesesteak are great.  Service is good.  This is not a health food, arugula, anorexic chic restaurant.  This is a place for people who like food and are ok with the fact that eating involves calories.
