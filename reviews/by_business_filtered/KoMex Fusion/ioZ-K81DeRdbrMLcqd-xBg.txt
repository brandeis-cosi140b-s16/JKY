Ordered the Vegetarian Chow Fettuccine noodles ...stir fried fettuccine noodles with bell peppers, cabbage and broccoli. Delicious! Also ordered the Bulgogi Flautas- comes with guac and salsa, the crispy tortilla was my fave. 
And last but not least...also shared an order of Bulgogi Fries- hit the spot! I would definitely come back to this place.
