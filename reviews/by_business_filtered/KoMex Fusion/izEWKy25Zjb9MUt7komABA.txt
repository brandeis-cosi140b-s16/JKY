This place was amazing. I would like to thank the yelping Elite community for recommending this place because I have a few family members adding this to their itineraries for their next Vegas trip.
We ordered a variety of items like their chicken wings and fries which had a great sauce and the size were similar to a Buffalo Wild Wings which is good in my book. Also I had their order of pork belly Musubi which went done good with some teriyaki sauce and their red hot sauce. Then we added the chicken fried rice and the Bulgogi Plate with white rice which my boys loved. My mom really enjoyed the fried rice and she is not easy to please. Now what do I say about their Chow Fettuccine other than it was very good but nothing similar to a chow mein dish from a mall but it seemed familiar which is delicious and comforting all in one bite. Lastly my sister had their fish tacos which she said were amazing. I also tasted them and I did enjoy but I swore I would go back and try their Fusion Chimichanga because I was so impressed with everything I had. 
The service was amazing and the place is just a hole in the wall that does their food right. They sat us in less than ten minutes on a Saturday afternoon with a party of six so we did not lose out on our vacation time. Also this place is a short freeway drive from the Strip which is why we were in the area. All in all a must try and definitely a must return on our next trip.
