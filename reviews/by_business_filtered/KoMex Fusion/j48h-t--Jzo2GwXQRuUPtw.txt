For the price (or for a price that is twice as much as the prices in this place) you WILL NOT find better food...anywhere.  I bought $20 worth of food from here for me and my wife and I'm pretty sure I will be subsisting off of it for the next 3 days (I have gargantuan appetite).  My first reaction when I saw this place on Yelp was (1) what a crappy part of town; and (2) NO REALLY what a crappy part of town this can't possibly be that good.  I was wrong.  Even when you first walk into the restaurant the building and decorations look like some budget Chinese place that chops up cats in the back alley.  In reality this hands down the best Korean Tacos in town and some of the best food period I've had in Vegas.  If you have $5 and are REALLY hungry go here, because you will get a pile of some of the best food around.
