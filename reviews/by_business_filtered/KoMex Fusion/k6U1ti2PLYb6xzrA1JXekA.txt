Excellent fusion for a cheap price. I had the bulgogi nachos (get the bigger size, only $2 more), which were fantastic. We also tried the Calimari tacos and the pork belly tacos, both of which had excellent toppings and were very tasty. 

I personally liked the pork belly ones more but my friend liked the calimari. 

All in all, great food and great value for a very low price. I would go back here again.
