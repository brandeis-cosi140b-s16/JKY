Like most places in Vegas, KoMex is in a random little strip mall. We ordered the tacos, bulgogi burrito, and fettuccine chow mein. All of them were good, but nothing blew my mind. 

The tacos were probably my first choice of what I would order if I were to go back.
The burrito second. It was good, but the bulgogi wasn't as flavorful and wasn't nearly as saucy as I was expecting.
The noodles (to me) were the most disappointing, so we took these to go after our meal. I personally thought these tasted better as leftovers.

I do like the complimentary chips & salsa (though this is purely mexican and not korean at all)

KoMex has a great concept going, but I believe that their large menu leaves a lot of room for improvement. I'd like to see them narrow down the items they offer, and improve on those.
