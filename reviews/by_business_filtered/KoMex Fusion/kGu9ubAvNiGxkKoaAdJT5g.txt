OMG, So freakin' good!  We had the tacos and the fries with beef.  Everything was extremely flavorful.  The condiment containers were divine!  The chunkier, red salsa was off the chain.  So very spicy and so VERY good!  Next time we will order the fried rice.. The guy next to us ordered it... HUGE plate of rice with beef.  The owner is a really nice lady.  She took time to explain the menu. (I'm allergic to MSG and sesame seed oil and seeds).  It was worth the antihistamine taking and praying to counteract any adverse reaction.. This place is wonderful!  WILL DO IT AGAIN!
