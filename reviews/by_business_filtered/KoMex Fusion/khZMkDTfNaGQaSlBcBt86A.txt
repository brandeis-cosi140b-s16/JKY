I've been to their other location a handful of times and love it every time I go there. But since I was closer to this location, I decided to give it a try.

The food is the same. Its always just as delicious, but the reason for this two stars was the service. The waitress made it such a bad experience. 

She had an attitude the whole time! From the minute we stepped in, she wasnt even welcoming. She had zero patience for us when we were deciding on chicken or beef (a 30 second discussion). She only refilled our waters once while there were only two other tables here. Not even a smile from this lady!

I love KoMex and I will continue to go, but definitely not this location.
