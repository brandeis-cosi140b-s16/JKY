Looks are deceiving.  Komex is a prime example. Buried admist a poorly lit strip mall just off the 95 and Decatur, Komex has a handful of tables and really no decor to speak of.  Sure they have chinese horoscope placemats and trays of sauces but without the name, this could be any type of restaurant.

Back to the theme, looks can be deceiving and they are.  What Komex lacks in decor, this Korean/Mexican Fusion restaurant delivers in taste.  After reading so many positives and receiving recommendations from a friend, we stopped there late last night and had ourselves a 32 dollar feast.  We ordered Bulgogi Fried Rice, Bulgogi Nachos and Won Ton Soup and two drinks.  

ADVICE - PORTIONS ARE BIG so either split a plate or go just for an entree.  We took a ton of food home.

The fried rice was excellent.  The beef tasted great and the spice was just right.  The wonton soup also packed a lot of flavor.  The nachos were enjoyable and filled with lots of different items unlike some nachos in other establishments where you have to hunt to find the meat.   

The price is right, the food is delish, the staff friendly and even accomodated a 15 person party despite having few open seats left.

Its on the rotation!
