This is my new go to place. Everything was delicious. The fusion wings are to die for, the fusion fries are also to die for and we had the cheesesteak which was excellent. You get a basket of chips guacamole and salsa the soon as you sit down. We had a calamari and shrimp taco that were so good probably some of the best tacos I've had in Vegas. And make sure you ask them for the little turntable of hot sauces because they are also to die for. I will definitely come back over and over again.
