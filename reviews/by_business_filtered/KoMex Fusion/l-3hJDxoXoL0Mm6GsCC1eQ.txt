Love this place! My aunt and uncle introduced my family and I to this spot while vacationing in Vegas a while back and this by far is one of the best restaurants ever! The customer service is great, the food is fantastic, and the price isn't bad either! I recommend it to anyone looking to try something new or just simply experience fusion dining.
