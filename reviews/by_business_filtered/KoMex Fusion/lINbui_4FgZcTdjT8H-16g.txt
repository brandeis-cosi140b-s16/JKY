finally hit KoMex - not even close to my neighborhood, nor do i seem to have a reason to be in this area but i driven a heck of a lot farther for less quality food.

Tried the fusion tacos ( beef, chicken and pork - $5 includes a canned soda ) , beef fusion burrito and the beef fusion quesadilla.  All great but i give the Gold to the burrito - great stuff, reasonable prices - this place is worthy of expansion to the rest of the valley !
