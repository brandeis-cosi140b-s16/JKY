This broad had it right!  I just ordered the chimi and it wasn't a mini.  That's for damn sure.  In fact, I had to take a break while eating it to write this.  This about that, ladies and ladies.  I put down the fork, turned on the laptop, went to yelp, and made a comment.  Yeah... f@ck right that's what I did.  This place is awesome.  Everytime I go in, the owner recognizes me.  Okay, she doesn't know my name, but the fact that she can pick me out of a police lineup, that's something impressive.  Most places couldn't give a sh*t less who you are.  

For people who haven't heard of Komex, let me digress.  The neighborhood (in which I live) is kind of crap.  The decor isn't great.  But the people and food are the best.  I will seriously take coworkers and clients alike to this place.  

I only wish that they needed a CPA so I could work for burritos...
