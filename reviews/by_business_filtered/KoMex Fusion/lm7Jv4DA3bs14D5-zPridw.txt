This place f-ing sucks balls! As soon as you walk in this place it reeks of mildew dirty water!! The floor plan is horrible, the food server is forgetful and is overwhelmed with work. Whatever you do don't eat here I could've had a V8! I had the bulgoli cheesesteak with fries and it had no flavor whatsoever! Fuck this place!!!
