This second location simply does not compare to the first location, which I love.  My fiance and I went there the day after the "grand opening" and ordered kimchi fried rice and bulgogi burrito.  Burrito - we were not sure if the meat was even marinated.  Kimchi fried rice - just meh.  I might have had the food poisoning - I puked up everything that night.  Also, there were only 2 other tables, but the service was still agonizingly slow.  I really can't think of anything nice to say and not sure why there are so many glowing reviews.  NOT RECOMMENDED.
