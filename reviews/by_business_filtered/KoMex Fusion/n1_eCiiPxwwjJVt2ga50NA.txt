Holy cow- pulling into Komex I seriously started to doubt the hype of this place, until I cracked open the menu and saw a large selection with low prices. 

I had the bulgigi sliders and burrito. The two combined cost less than $10! The bulgigi is a very tender meat, similar to a pulled pork. I wouldn't have tried it without the several suggestions from Yelpers!

This is definitely a place I will go back to, more and more to try new things! Bring $10 cash (+ tip) it will be more than enough!
