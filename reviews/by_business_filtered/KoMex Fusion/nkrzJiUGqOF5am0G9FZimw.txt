I honestly don't know how people eat here. These people leaving nice comments must be friends or families member of the owners. My husband and I ordered take out. When we first walked in it smelled like old rotten food like they don't refrigerate their food. Once we got home and opened the food it smelled the same way. My husband got the kimchi fried rice and as soon as he took a bit he spit it out. I can't believe these people make a living off of this shit. I'm usually not the one to be picky but my gosh this place is the worst. I thought I should give you guys a heads up before you order from here. If you don't believe me just walk into the place and see how it smells.
