Had another great meal here yesterday! 

I'm still in a phase of trying out different things here since everything has been really good thus far. We started with their yummy chips, guacamole, and salsa. 

It seems like I always start my meal off with 2 bulgogi tacos. This time around I also order their Fusion Chimichanga, also with bulgogi. The tacos are always great and never disappoint. The chimichanga was really good, covered with red enchilada sauce and some pico, spot on.  The ratio of meat to other ingredients was really good, never tasted too much of anything. 

Good tasting food at an awesome price, will be back.
