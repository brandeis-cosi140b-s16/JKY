I checked out KoMex the other day.  I got the kim chi fried rice with chicken.  It was saucy and spicy and in a way...comforting.  It was nice to remove myself from the hustle from the Strip and sit down in a nice little hole in the wall restaurant.

I also tried the burrito.  It basically was any other burrito that I would have gotten at a mexican restaurant, but with bulgogi.  I kind of wish there was a sauce to go with it though.

The crew is really nice and attentive.
