The Mongolian Beef was the BEST item on the menu, but they no longer serve it because of Franchising issues. This hole in the wall still offers great food such as the calamari tacos and the bulgogi fried rice. However, dont take the service personally from the asian male since he is not qualified to be in the front line. The ladies are nicer and have front line experience.
