A friend of mine turned me on to this place when he said he went 3 times in one week. 3 times in a week ? ? ? This place, I have to try. 

I had 3 Fusion tacos (pork, chicken and beef) ala carte. I ordered 2 with a lettuce wrap and one with corn tortillas. And at $1.25 apiece that was a bonus. I really liked all 3 of them and the combination (fusion) of Korean with Mexican was awesome. Korean flavored beef tacos with cilantro and Korean Hoisin type hot sauce was just over the top. My wife had the Bulgogi Fusion Burrito (and it was enough to feed 3 of us). My boy had the Boneless Kalbi plate, and my girl had the taquito plate. 

So not only can you order good Fusion food but they have a pretty good selection of Mexican food and Asian food also. 

I'm going to try the Mexican Chow Mein next time. That one sounds interesting. 

A place has gotta be good when I have to drive out of my comfy confines of Summerlin to try a place in a questionable area of town. Decor is urban (looks like a converted laundromat) but who cares! The food is definitely worth the trip and I'll be back.
