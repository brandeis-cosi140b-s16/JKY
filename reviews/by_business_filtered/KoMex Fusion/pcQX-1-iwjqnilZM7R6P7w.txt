This is a place I frequent on the regular. about once a month, we love the combo fried rice (beef and shrimp only). We get 2 beef lettuce wraps and 1 beef corn taco to share in addition, which leaves my boyfriend a good sized portion of rice to take to work. The food here in phenomenal, the only place we frequent more often is our sushi joint!

On the other hand, one of the nice things about this small family business when it first opened was that they really appreciated the business, the service was really friendly. The last time I was there, the entire staff was incredibly rude, especially to guests placing to-go orders. One gentleman was seated at a table near us, and was asked to get up and go to the counter to order, the woman at the counter was also very rude to several other guests placing orders. On this trip, we were never asked how the food tasted, nor were we offered any condiments (I walked over and grabbed the sauces myself). 

Overall, the food here is really great, but the service has started to go down hill tremendously. When the staff treats customers like they aren't important, it makes me want to find a new place to go.
