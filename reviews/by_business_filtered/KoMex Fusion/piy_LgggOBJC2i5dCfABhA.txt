For my husband's birthday he couldn't decide if he wanted Mexican food or Korean food.  I Yelp'd Mexican and Korean restaurants nearby us just to see our options and KoMex was the first to pop up.  I didn't expect to find a fusion restaurant with both foods combined but I was so happy we did.  

The food is delicious (bulgogi fries are my favorite) and nothing we have ordered was ever wrong or bad.  This quickly became one of our favorite places to eat.  

It's very small and usually when we go there is a short wait.  They don't apologize for taking time to make your food (it's not fast food) and they don't have fountain drinks (cans of soda or water).  

Prices are very reasonable and staff is super nice.  

I would recommend this place to anyone that likes Korean or Mexican food.
