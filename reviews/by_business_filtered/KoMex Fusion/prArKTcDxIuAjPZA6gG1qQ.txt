I had their bulgogi rice bowl. Just amazing! It's a small little hole in the wall place in a small little shopping center. But the staff was super friendly and on top of it and the food was amazing. My friend got the calamari tacos and I couldn't believe how tender the meat was, cooked to perfection!
