Wow!!!
Yelpers are right! This place is good.

We flew into Vegas from Atl and this place is quite close to the airport, about a 15 minute drive.

And the food is so good!
We had the fusion tacos in all three flavors.
My dad liked the Korean hot sauce cuz it's sweet.
But I liked the Chinese hot sauce, so many layers of flavor.

The hostess was very sweet and amiable and the owner came out to talk to us and tell us about how Komex came to be and how they've been growing in large part thanks to Yelp.
