Love this place, they have the best tofu & veggie tacos ever, even better if you add kimchi. Also have awesome veggie fried rice (one of few places that is generous with the veggies), amazing complimentary chips with side of guac & fresh salsa. There is an  exceptional array of host made sauces- so good we get one of them to go and enjoy with all sorts of food at home (Korean hot sauce). Lastly, their prices rock & they recognize their regular customers.
