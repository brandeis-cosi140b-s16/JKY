Had to try this place after reading all of the awesome reviews.  I went on a Saturday afternoon around 3pm and all the booths were full.  The owner quickly mentioned there would be a 45 minute wait once our order was put in since they had so many before us.  We were able to snag a small table by the door and it took a little while for them to come take our order.  We ordered the Bulgogi Nacho's, which were absolutely amazing.  They were so flavorful and we were able to demolish the whole plate quickly.  I liked their homemade chips and guacamole as well.  Next came out our Daejiogoi Burrito with fried Kimchi, which we ended up taking to go since we were so full from the chips (burrito was good, but I will try it with bulgogi next time and without salsa).  I was also pleased with the egg Musubi and chicken taco.  The price and flavors cannot be beat!  I will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu!
