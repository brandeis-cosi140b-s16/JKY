I have been hearing how great this place is.  I'm here to tell you that it lives up to the hype.  The pork bolgogi was really great - super tender meat with just the right amount of seasoning.  My friend ordered the Korean tacos - one chicken and one pork and a fusion burrito. He gave the thumbs up to all of it.  The service was great - very fast for the place being filled to capacity and a line of people waiting outside to get in.  The portions are big and the prices are low. I think the tacos were about $1.29 each. I can't wait to go back and try more items on the menu.  

Go support this oustanding small business.  You'll be glad that you did!
