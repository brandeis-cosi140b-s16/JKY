This place is very slow. We went the first time and left after waiting for almost an hour and we still never received our food. The second time it looked like we would be in the same situation so sadly we didn't stay. We have been to the original location and had a totally different experience. Maybe it's timing but I've about given up on this location. May have to just do take out. 

But they do have a sign that basically says they reserve the right to be slow because the food is made to order but not worth an hour wait.
