Bulgogi all around! Those who have gone to KBBQ with me know of my love for bulgogi. Take that love and throw in a blend of Korean and Mexican style cooking, and you've got yourself a winner! I love this place! Each bite I took was an explosion of deliciousness that had the right amount of spice and a perfect balance between Korean and Mexican flavor.

I think my absolute favorite dish are the kimchee fried rice. I went with my family and we ordered two plates: one with spam and and one with beef bulgogi. They were both equally good and despite having our own entrees, we cleaned up the fried rice because it was just irresistible. It's as good as any of the best kimchee fried rice you'd have at, thrown in with meats that were cooked to a savory excellence. The fried rice was definitely more Korean so you won't find much Mexican fused into this dish.

For my own entrees I split fusion tacos with my cousin. We had beef bulgogi (duh) and pork belly. These were definitely a split balance between Korean and Mexican style. I couldn't decide which one I liked better but I certainly recommend going with the fusion tacos because you have a lot of choices depending on what kind of meats you like.

I felt really bad because we showed up at 7:30 (they close at 8) and I was worried we might encounter some annoyance with showing up so late, but we got none of that. I really appreciate them being very welcoming, not showing any annoyance with us and still delivering quality food. Can't wait to come back here!
