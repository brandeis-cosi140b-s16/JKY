awesome idea! i love all the options it presents. ive been here a few times, and its one of my favorites of vegas so far. most of the stuff ive tried has been good (sadly not everything though) i would advise staying more towards there mexican stuff since i havent had a bad mexican dish. (the asian dishes have been hit or miss). the chips at the beginning are worth the trip alone (there awesome!) will def be going back many more times.
