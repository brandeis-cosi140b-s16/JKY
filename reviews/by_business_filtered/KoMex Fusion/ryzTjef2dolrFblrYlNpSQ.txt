Went for lunch today and the place was absolutely packed. It is a fairly small location, but certainly worth the wait. The hostess was friendly despite having to work a very busy floor.

I had the pork burrito and my friend had the 2 meat platter with rice. Food was much better than expected, hot and fresh. They also bring over a little sauce tray for you to try a variety of sauces on your food as you eat.

Overall, a very pleasant experience and judging from the line of customers waiting to get inside, well worth the wait.  I would highly recommend this place.
