Less busy than the original site, but all the great flavors are still here.

Ordered fusion tacos and chimichanga as well as a bulgogi plate and kimchi fried rice. Everything was absolutely flavorful and delicious, achieving the balance of mexican and korean. 

Portions were huge for the price too.

I Highly Recommend planning to make a stop here if you are in Vegas.
