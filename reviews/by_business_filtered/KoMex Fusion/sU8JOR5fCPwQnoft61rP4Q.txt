I'm going to be a bit of a party pooper, but I wasn't ecstatic to eat here since I've had food at their other location prior. I was hopeful that spring valley would be different. 

Bulgogi burrito- 3 stars. It was the size of my face, but I just think that I'm not a huge fan of the fusion Korean/Mexican food. I LOVE Mexican food, and something about the bulgogi just didn't do it for me. 

Bulgogi rice bowl- 3 stars. This was okay for me as well. I didn't quite get what was the big deal. I'd rather go eat a bibimbap. 

Pork bulgogi tater tots- 4 stars. How the hell did that happen you ask? I love nachos, and sour cream. This was a spin off of it, hence I loved it. I really think it was the sour cream though. My friend swapped the bulgogi for pork bulgogi, which was a good choice. 

Pork belly skewers- 2 stars. I didn't like the pork belly quality or the marinade. 

Interior is a bit "hole in the wall." They serve alcohol, accommodates bigger parties, but the place is not all that huge. Service was 5 stars. They were very organized, able to do separate checks for a party 16 people.
