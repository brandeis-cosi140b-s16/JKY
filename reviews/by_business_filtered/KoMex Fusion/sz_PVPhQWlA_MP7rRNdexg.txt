Good flavors, cheap prices, huge portions. What else do you need?

There's really not a lot to criticize at the prices are their food is offered at. When you pay 7 dollars for an entree, you generally don't expect that your food is going to be particularly special. However, they've got the fusion thing down here.

Korean food and Mexican foods go surprisingly well together - though it is hardly a secret anymore. My buddy and I tried out three dishes.

1. Bulgogi Burrito with kimchee
2. Bulgogi Nachos
3. Enchilada Plate with spicy pork

We were poorly prepared for the portion sizes. We could easily have taken 2/3 of every plate home, but we stuffed our faces full of the delicious food. The nachos in particularly are strikingly large in volume, and would require a number of people to down it as an appetizer. A half order would have been better... but hey, it's only $2 more for a full sized leftover!
