Wowooo they mix Koren and Mexican cuisine and let me tell I never tested food so bad.i ordered chicken chow mein- the easiest dish to make and even on cheap Chinese restaurant it taste good! 
But this is was horrible !!!! Taste like they made it 5 days ago and keep reheated that. The chicken was full of unknown bones/fat/ cartilage! 
AVOID THIS PLACE EVEN IF ITS $6 for a dish!!!!!!!!!
