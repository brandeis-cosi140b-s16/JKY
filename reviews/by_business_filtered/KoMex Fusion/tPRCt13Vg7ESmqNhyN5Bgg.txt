It's actually been over a year since my last visit to Komex, so I apologize for the lack of detail in the review. However, my last update doesn't reflect how my current opinion, so I needed to correct my rating. Suffice to say, it was more than a little disappointing.

I went with a friend over an extended lunch. It was his first time, and he was pretty impressed. Unfortunately, I didn't feel the same way. Looking back on my at-the-time basic photos, I had some bulgogi fries and a chimichanga, most likely pork given my tendencies to vary the protein. There weren't any salt or cooking issues, but the levels and layers of flavor just didn't appeal to me very much that day.

I did greatly appreciate the sweet, fresh orange provided for dessert and the complimentary chips and salsa presented as an appetizer, but nothing has motivated me to make the trip from Henderson. I'd recommend sticking to more flavorful Mexican tacos or waiting to try the Korean-Mexican fusion concept elsewhere.
