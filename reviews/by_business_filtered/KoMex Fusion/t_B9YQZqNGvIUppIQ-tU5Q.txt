Just ok.  But I'm used to the real deal Korean BBQ tacos off the trucks in LA.  I didn't taste any Korean flavor in the Mexican food. Their fusion was that there was both Mexican and Korean on the menu.  I'm used to it being a fusion of flavors.  This is good strip mall spot but it's not going to knock any foodie off their feet like the reviews suggest.
