Total hole in the wall type of place,but such a treasure. It looks pretty sketchy out front but inside is quant. Food is very reasonable and inventive! Being of mixed heritage descent I love fusion! Well as long as it is not too Americanized. This place was recommended by a stage hand from the iHeart Radio festival. 

So good! I had the spicy pork chimichaga and my sister has the pork nachos. My brother in law had a few tacos which the meat in each was delicious (i cant remember which he got, a variety). Average taco sizes. Huge portions and would have been under $30 if we didn't order a drink. Would definitely go here again, YUM!

Also side note, the crowd is of all ethnicities and seems to be generally non touristy which is so difficult to find in Vegas.
