I remember first discovering this place some months ago when it first opened. I have to give Yelp credit for always being my guiding light ;-) We literally ate here once a week for a couple of months and I eat out pretty sparingly. It felt like an addiction that only those fusion nachos can cure!  The bulgogi nachos are the star IMO. The freshly fried chips, sweet and salty bulgogi beef, fresh pico and a drizzle of spicy sauce is fusion perfection. And who would have thought mozzarella cheese over korean beef would even be appropriate? The full portion is so large I always share, throw in a coupla fish tacos and call it a meal. I really like their version of the fish taco. The shrimp is ok. We've also tried their fried rice. It is extra fragrant from the sesame oil and very welcoming at first, but after several bites and a cooler temp it the sesame smell and taste becomes overpowering. I have yet to try the kimchi fried rice but after the nachos there is just no room!  The complimentary chips and guac is a nice addition to the already affordable pricing and the fried wontons are really cheap and good as well. I think there are 5 for like $1.50!!

Their homemade salsa and sauces are really good
 The salsa verde-ish one is my favorite. Green in color almost like salsa verde but some pungeant asian notes in it as well. The sauce caddies used to be on the tables but now I notice that you have to ask for it. Even then, each jar is only a bout a quarter full. I think some people got a little too crazy and wasteful  with the sauce.  I wish they would add in a soda fountain and stop serving cans of soda. Other than that, I really love this place!
