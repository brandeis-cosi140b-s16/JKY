Why is KoMex so good?!? 

For this visit, we spiced it up with some Bulgogi Fried Rice and then ordered a few tacos. 

Hot chips, salsa, and guacamole served right away. 

The rice was awesome and too much (should have gotten the 1/2 order for $1.50 less). I love the bulgogi beef at this place.  This time we were able to try the pork tacos and they were worth the wait (when we went 2 years ago they had run out of pork).  It was spicy and delicious on the tacos. 

There is a reason this place is so highly rated on Yelp.  If you're in Vegas, tear yourself away from the Strip for just one meal and just go to KoMex!!!
