its really just OK. not really worth the gas money to drive all the way out north for me. I had the tacos, nachos and fried rice. the ingredients are fresh for sure, but both the tacos and nachos looks better than they taste. something about the flavor just wasn't quite there. the fried rice was the winner out of the three, but i can easily get better fried rice in Chinatown, closer to where i live.
