Korean fusion with Mexican. What the! But wow, it's pulled off nicely. My wife and I split the meals and had a lot left over, big portions at good prices. The service was pleasant and attentive, the restaurant is small, basic, but clean. But onto the food: 
The chips were delish! Not your basic thin chips. And they include guacamole at no cost. 
There are three menus, Korean, Mexican, and Fusion.
Fusion flautas with bulgogi meat. Heavenly. Three large flautas and seasoned guacamole & sour cream side. 
Fusion Burrito. Good, not knock your socks off, but good. I'll just eat more flautas. 
Bulgogi fries.....Yummy! More like nachos but with fries and Komex goodness. 
All this, and a coke for $25. We'll be back. Oh yes, we'll be back.
