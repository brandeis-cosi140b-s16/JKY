What can I say? This place is great!

Korean-Mexican fusion. My review will focus on two items on their menu: Pork Belly Taco and Bulgogi Burrito.

Pork Belly Taco
This dish was amazing. In no way did they skimp out on the taco itself. It was full of meat and veggies. The pork belly was deliciously succulent but not too fatty-feeling and the combination of lettuce to spices complimented the pork in the corn tortilla. perfect.

Bulgogi Burrito
Sweet, moist and succulent! yes this burrito was awesome. It had just enough sweetness from the bulgogi's marinade to accent on to the mexican rice within the burrito. Ok i'm getting hungry just thinking about it.

If you're in vegas this is a must try!

It's missing a star because it closes at 9 pm :( boo I wish it was open later!
