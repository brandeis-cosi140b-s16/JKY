I've had this place book marked for a while and finally got the opportunity to give it a shot. I'm really happy I took the time to come in. The service was quick and to the point. I went with the bulgogi nachos ( they came highly recommended by Paul W.). The half size probably would have been enough but I'm always up for a challenge. The meat had a sweet taste to it like Colby beef or teriyaki jerky but it was super tender.

The only minor thing about this place is the size. They are tiny so a large party will have problems getting in here.
