Compared to the KorMex Fusion restaurant Vatos Tacos in SOUTH KOREA, I came here with high expectations after falling in love with Korean Mexican fusion food.
However, KoMex here in Las Vegas did NOT live up to its potential. 

The areas I rated that lead me to the 3 Star rating was first the food, the menu selection and the ambiance of the restaurant. 

The food was a hard 3 stars.
The bulgogi fries were made with what looked and tasted like Grocery Store frozen thick cut fries then topped with block cheese that just hardened if not eaten right away when hot. 
The Kimchi Fried rice tastes good at first but quickly looses its appeal after about four bites leaving you with a bland plain taste that makes you wish there was something to smack your taste buds out of your mouth. 
I ordered the Fusion Chimichanga which was a disaster. Waaaay too much vegetables on top of the mess and little flavor on the inside to keep you going for more. 

With dishes that were presented to look good the flavor was subpar. But it was ok if it's your first time trying Korean Mexican fusion however I will say this is MORE MEXICAN than Korean. 

The menu selection is basically a Mexican food menu with Bulgogi and other Korean meats to choose from. 
And compared to Vatos Tacos in South Korea where the restaurant shows elegance as well as style and class right when you walk in the door inviting you to not only come back for dinner but also bring a date, this KoMex restaurant seemed like the place you take your 4 person family or group to when you honestly just don't want Taco Bell and want to "spice" your lunch up for the day. 

Solid 3 stars. Would have given it 2.5 but I don't know how to do that on yelp.
