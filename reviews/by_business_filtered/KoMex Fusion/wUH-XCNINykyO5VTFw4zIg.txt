You have not lived until you have ate KoMex!!! I use to eat at the Decatur location ALL the time and I am super excited that this new location is less than a mile away now! That can be either good or bad :-/ it's not the most healthy food but it for sure hits the spot every time! Tonight I placed a to-go order which seems to be the more efficient and time effective way to get your food without much of a wait! I do know that they are a fresh to order kind of place so it's not like you can walk in and anything on the menu is already prepared! Tonight I ordered the Bulgogi quesadillas and the musubi with spam and a fried egg! Delicious! I usually get the Bulgogi fries but tonight I switched it up! This place is a MUST! If you're looking to order a cocktail they do have a bar in this location which is most definitely a PLUS! Go KoMex!
