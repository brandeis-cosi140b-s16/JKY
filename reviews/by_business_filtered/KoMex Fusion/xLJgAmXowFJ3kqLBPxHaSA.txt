WOW!!! I ABSOLUTLEY LOVE THIS PLACE!!! I have to admit when i saw the way it looked i was skeptical but man when they say don't judge a book by its cover this is defiintely on e of those places! AMAZING! The food was just awesome i had the fusion burrito that was gigantic for the price! It took me 3 sittings to finish that burrito! My husband had Bugogi and wow he was ready for seconds and even thirds the next day! i am so glad that it is close enough to if he wants Korean and i want Mexican all we have to do is go to KoMex!
