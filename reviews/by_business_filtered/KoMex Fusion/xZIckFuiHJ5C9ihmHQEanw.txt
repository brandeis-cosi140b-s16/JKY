this place is a hidden jewel in vegas! i kid you not. great fusion of korean and mexican foods. had the nachos and sliders and portions are amazing for its price. i actually wonder of they make profit when i see the portion of korean meat since it's expensive. anyhow, service was great and owner was really nice. wish they have one in cali!
