I broke my Komex cherry yesterday. Went for a late lunch yesterday so I kept it small. We split some Bulgogi nachos which were Fan Tastic! I had the fusion sliders(with Bulgogi). Two nice sized sliders loaded with meat. Bulgogi is well seasoned and so flavorful! I need a return trip to try the spicy pork.
