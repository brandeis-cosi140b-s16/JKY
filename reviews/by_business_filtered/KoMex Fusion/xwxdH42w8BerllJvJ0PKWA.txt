FINALLY, I got the chance to try KoMex.  I hadn't known that they had one near my work, so I was exciiiited.  My hubs has been wanting me to try this place for the longest.  He works up North, but we live on the opposite side of town so I never agreed to going there until we were on that side of town.  Well that never came around, but here I am at their other location.  We came right when they opened and I have to say that this restaurant gets really busy.  So if you are in a rush, they even put a sign up saying that there will be a wait.  

Well I had every intention of trying one of their fusion Tacos or Burritos, but I basically had my mind set when I saw the Bulgogi plate.  I was so thankful that they brought us chips, salsa, and guacamole.  I was so hungry.  Guacamole was awesome!  On to my main dish.  

Can I tell you that I was impressed?  I would be the type to try what their best known for, but I went on a limb and just did Korean.  The bulgogi is flavored right, the fried rice is a great option to compliment your choice of protein, and if you think thats too much carbs and protein you can add on veggies which is what I did.  Oh, the hot sauce, on point!  I'm pretty sure its made there.  It has a really nice kick to it.  

I want to return and try their bulgogi fries and a burrito, however, I'll need my husband to assist on finishing their large portions.  LOL!
