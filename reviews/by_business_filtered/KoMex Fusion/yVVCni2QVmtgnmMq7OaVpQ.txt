Def as good as it gets.
Remember, it's a hole-in-the-wall with limited seating serving common-man food.
If you want haute cuisine, go elsewhere.
First night in town, "Gotta try something new and different." We're from Burlington, Vt and while the quality of food ingredients are second-to-none, there are lot of options when it comes to ethnic cuisine. And it can't really get weird, it is Vermont, after all. 
Anyhow, KoMex Fusion sounded adventuresome. Having spent time in Seoul and being a big fan of winter-style kimchee, was looking forward to reacquainting myself. 
First of all, do NOT order a full order of the nachos unless you're sharing with four or more. Half size nearly did me in. I had it with the bolgogi beef. Hope I spelled that right. Good chips, fine bolgogi, way enough cheese. Had the bolgogi beef burrito as a main course.

Let me tell you, one of the finest burritos I have ever had. Ever. Lots of beef, lots of slaw, great flavors. I am not ashamed (well, maybe a bit) to admit that I hurt myself finishing it off. Kept dipping into the hot sauces, little of this, one bite. Well, how about a little of that. Ummmm. How about a little of each. 

Another sign, I did not try the wife's tacos. She might not have let me. 

Looking forward to a return visit.
