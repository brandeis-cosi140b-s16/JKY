My family loves this place.   I have tried everything and loved it all.   Linda is so nice and the other staff are very polite.   This week we came in 3 times!  My kids get the regular Mexican style and I have to tell you that's really good too.   We love places that take care to make good food!!  If it looks not so busy in here, it's because they do a lot of business by take out.:.
