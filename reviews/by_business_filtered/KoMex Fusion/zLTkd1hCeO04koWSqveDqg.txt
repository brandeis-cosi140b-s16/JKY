Round two!

I had an inkling that the fusion burrito might not be the best idea from last time, so I chose a fusion torta with pork instead. I'm so proud of myself! It was really good, and while I'm not a big jalapeno fan, I really liked what they did to that sandwich. I wish that they had sliced the avocados into thinner or smaller pieces, but I modified my bites accordingly.

I also had a bulgogi fusion taco as the appetizer. It was pretty good, although the lime was hard to extract juice from for some reason. I wish that they had wrapped it in foil instead of throwing it in a foam box because the filling was all over the place by the time I got home. Overall, still pretty good, although the pork is still better at Komex.

Bring cash if adventuring alone, or order more than (I think) the minimum of $10 for credit cards. This is now a must-try recommendation, and also a must-return to explore to other fusion items.
