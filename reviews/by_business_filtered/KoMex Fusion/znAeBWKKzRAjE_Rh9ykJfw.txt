Anyone who gives this place less than 3 stars either had an off day or just doesn't appreciate great food for cheap prices. 
The majority of Yelpers legitimately gave this place 5 stars for several reasons. Freshly made food that is full of flavor, huge portions, cheap prices, great quality ingredients, friendly service, and not your average food items. All of these factors more than make up for location and decor.
I revisited this little gem during lunch & had the chicken bulgogi tacos with a side of Mexican rice. The corn tortilla tacos were overly stuffed with juicy, flavorful chicken, marinated cabbage, & I got kimchee on top. What an explosion of goodness it was. The rice was pretty good, moist and better than average. Lunch came to just over 6.00 total for 3 tacos, side of rice, & a can of soda. Nothing to squawk at.
By the way, as everybody mentioned, free homemade chips with salsa & guacamole, little cute orange dessert & fortune cookie, ALL included!! 
Its not often that you can find a place like this. 
Try it!
