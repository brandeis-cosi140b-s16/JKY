Yes I'm updating but keeping the same rating.   Man has this place really gotten busy since the time they opened!   Came back to dine-in for the first time in over a year, and there was a 10-15 minute wait, and this was later in the afternoon (1:30).  Service was friendly, but they really could have used more help.  The waitress seemed a little frantic and it seemed like several people were at all times trying to get her attention.

The food was as good as the first time I'd eaten there and the price still can't be beat.  Got 3 tacos and a Voss water and it was roughly 6-7 bucks total.   From my standpoint and from what I've had, the tacos are definitely the way to go still.   Choose your three meats and make sure you have the condiments at your table and go to town.   

Maybe their new location will help the overcrowding and MINOR service issues which are the only things keeping this last visit from being a 5 star experience.
