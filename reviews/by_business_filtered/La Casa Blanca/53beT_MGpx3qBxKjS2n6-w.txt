We used to come here for dinner all of the time and then started to come for Breakfast after church.  It has been going down hill for some time and we, unfortunately won't be going back.  Service is horrible, food is less than average and is going down.  My wife had to wait ten minutes for her toast after she already had her meal.  The eggs were cold by then.  When we asked for a refill on coffee, it took a long time and then they ran out of cream.

Come on guys, you are better than that.
