This is a great out of the way place that is Authentic! I hate Chains! The patio is very romantic and big and the food is really good! I've had the shrimp enchiladas, chicken chimi and many more wonderful dishes.  The fajitas! The servings are large and sometimes after all the chips and salsa which is really good I can only finish half my meal! There are two dining areas I prefer the one with the booths as its a little quieter. TIP: on Fri. and Sat. night there is a long wait so if you need to be at a movie or something go early about 6pm. Also the patio fills up fast! I have since moved to Boulder, but every time I come to Phoenix (which is a lot) I make the trip a little further south to come here and have never been disappointed.
