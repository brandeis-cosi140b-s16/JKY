Came here last night for Cinco de Mayo and had a great time. They have an awesome patio and we sat out there for hours under the freakishly bright moon. They had an really rad dj that was playing a cool mix of American pop and hip-hop, latin salsa, and raggaeton music. The servers were all super friendly, even though it was obvious they had had a long day. The food was pretty good; it was  fantastic idea to have a guy set up a grill outside to make carne asada tacos. Those were extremely tasty and only $1.50! This is a family restaurant so the crowd was very tame and the party started winding down around 9pm. But we are not big partiers so that was exactly what I was looking for.

I look forward to coming here again on a "regular" night and trying more of their food.
