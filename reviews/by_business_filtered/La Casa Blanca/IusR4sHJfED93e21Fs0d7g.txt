We visited La Casa Blanca for a family night out.  The chips and salsa were very good, and they brought plenty.  But, the best part was their bean dip - it is the best bean dip I have ever eaten - I normally don't like bean dip and I could not stop eating thestuff!  I had a relleno for dinner and it was very tasty.  I hope to go back soon when I am not driving and help myself to a few glasses of draft beer, chips, salsa, and maybe some Nachos.  Also, on our visit we had excellent service.  Let's hope the management continues to keep this restaurant good by listening to those who visited and were disappointed in the service.  Viva La Casa Blanca!  I would like to see them add guacamole tacos to their menu selection ... mmmm, guacamole!
