i like the food here at La Casa Blanca. The staff is always friendly. The atmosphere is older in decor and could use some updating. 

I really like the Pollo dish wrapped in a tortilla with cheese and sour cream. It was delicious. 

I have been there 3 times and not disappointed yet. And its close to the house.
