I have been to La Casa Blanca over 8 times and this time was the last.  They have had some consistency issues before-sometimes the food is flavorful and spiced right-other times not.

As usual -the chips came out-this time they tasted like they had been sitting around for who knows how long or they were bought from a store.  Our entrees came out right away.  I ordered simply a chicken enchilada and a shrimp taco.  The shrimp taco was incredibily spicy to the point I could not eat it.  After flagging down the waiter, I told him that we had been here many times and that I had ordered this before, and that it was too spicy.  He replied that he would check with the chef.  He came back and made some lame excuse that it was the pico de gallo - I said no-the whole taco was too spicy and it was inedible.

The bill came out and lo and behold- the waiter didn't even have the decency to take the taco off the bill.  Forget it- you just lost our business-another loser restaurant here in Chandler.
