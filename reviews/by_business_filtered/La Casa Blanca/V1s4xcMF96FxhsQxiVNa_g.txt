La Casa Blanca is a desert isle -- a stand-alone adobe surrounded by dirt and fields and housing developments under construction. I'd love to give La Casa Blanca 5 starts -- really, I would -- for their effort and ambiance. But sadly, the food is simply average. 
 
The setting and service here are really very nice. The Old Mexico theme is carried off well, with weathered wood-and-metal lighting and wall decor, colorful woven rugs on the walls, and rustic tile underfoot. The patio is even nicer, with strings of twinkling lights hung from the Palo Verde trees, and misters in the summertime and plenty of heat lamps to make cool winter evening comfortable. Our service has always been prompt and pleasant. 

Now for the downside... the tortillas taste store bought, the salsa is mediocre, and the meat rather blah. But if you're looking more for an overall enjoyable dining experience more than killer-food, a visit to La Casa Blanca will be worth your trip.
