I love the building, I'd like to love the atmosphere, but very loud and noisy inside.  The result of concrete floors and walls, and no partioning walls.  The food is very mediocre, something my cousins from Chicago would probably "think" is real Mexcian food.  Couldn't be further from the truth.  Food is extremely gringo-ized.  It's edible, but defintely doesn't satisy my lust for good Mexican food.  The outside patio is awesome, but have never seen anyone using it.  Which is a shame... Has the potential to be like "the Tortilla Factory" in Scottsdale which really capitalizes on its awesome outside area.  I really wish they would cook real Mexican food, do something with the interior boringness and noise, and utilize the great patio!
