I used to live right down the street from La Casa Blanca and my wife and I used to visit once a week but that was 3 years ago. We moved to Gilbert and didn't visit until tonight. Walking in on a Friday night in the past you had to wait but now none of the tables in the front room had customers only the booths were used and the back room didn't have anything going on. 

I read the past reviews and I was stunned because it used to be a 4 star eats. But now I didn't believe it was possible to have food there without flavor and how do you make Mexican food bland? Is it even possible? But yes it is possible but man they did a great job and the wait staff was just blah. They could not care if we were there if we there. They were not rude just not engaged at all. 

I'm very sad at what happened to this place. I don't know if it changed owners or management but we won't be returning. 

Good Luck out there.
