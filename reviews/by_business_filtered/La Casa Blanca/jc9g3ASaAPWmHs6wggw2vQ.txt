Word on the street is that they were shut down by Sheriff Joe for 3 weeks after a sweep and took that long to get new employees.  So we thought we would give it a try again because it is so close to the house.  We thought they may have gotten a competent chef.  It was about half full and everyone seemed to be running around in a panic.  Asked for a table of 8 on patio.  Waited 15 minutes while we looked at all of the empty tables and chose to leave again without dinner and headed to another Mexican joint a few blocks away.   We would have been happy with a few margaritas and a sever to acknowledge us.
