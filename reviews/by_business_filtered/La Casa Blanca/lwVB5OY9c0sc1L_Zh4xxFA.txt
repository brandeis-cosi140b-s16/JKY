I've driven past this place dozens of times and wondered if they were any good.  I found the existing reviews inconclusive so we decided to drop in for dinner one evening.

When we arrived we immediately liked the outdoor area and the warm decor inside.  

A couple came in behind us and we inquired if they had been there before.  They replied that they had and we asked if it was good.  The husband shrugged and uttered, "Meh.  It's gringo."

We stayed and shared an appetizer and an entree.  We were served a small dish of frijoles and a small dish of salsa.  To our surprise the frijoles were rather hot.  Not terribly flavorful, just spicy.  The salsa was ok and spicy as well.

As if to continue in the same vein, our enchiladas arrived and the filling was very spicy.  Again, not terribly flavorful, just spicy.  We had one pork enchilada and one beef enchilada.  I couldn't tell which was which for sure.

The tacos el carbon appetizer that we shared had so much fresh, raw onion on it that we were tearing up and picking it off.  Strange.

Well, now we know and we won't wonder about it when we drive by but we certainly won't be back.

I like spicy food that is flavorful not just hot for the sake of being hot and nothing else going on.
