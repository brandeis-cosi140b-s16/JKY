WARNING THEY ARE CLOSED - CHRISTMAS EVE

La Casa Blanca is losing a grip and/or they JUST DO NOT CARE ! - we live in the neighborhood and usually walk there because we have a drink - we checked Yelp to make sure this establishment was open before heading out (it stated they are open until 8 PM) - we got there just at 3 PM and they are closed - not to open again until Saturday - saw a couple leaving checking their phones probably to find another establishment - saw a man a employee heading back into the buidling ask to make sure they were indeed closed and ask him why they didn't make this clear on Yelp and he just shrugged his shoulders - good luck to them in the future, it seems they will need it.
