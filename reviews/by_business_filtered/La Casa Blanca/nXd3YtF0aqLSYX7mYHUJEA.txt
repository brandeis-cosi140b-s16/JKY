I have never had anything but a good experience the many times I have been to La Casa Blanca Authentic Mexican Restaurant.  Immediately as you walk in, an classic Mexican aroma is set with a beautiful, inviting traditional Mexican painting in the entry way.  You are greeted as soon as you walk in, and in my experiences seated within 10 minutes.  

The place itself is very clean and the staff is very friendly and quick at serving you.  Right as you are seated, freshly baked chips, fresh salsa, and piping hot bean dip is served to you.  The entrée items are delicious and a good portion size, with sometimes something to take home depending on your hunger.  I would recommend the Mini Enchiladas with Red Chile, they are just spicy enough to set off your taste buds and heavy enough to fill you up for days.  As far as dessert, I was too full to figure out what was good!  The prices are moderate, at about $10 or more an entrée.  

Just a reminder that this restaurant is almost always busy, so be ready to experience a lot of people, and a lot of noise.  It may also take your server more than a few minutes to serve you, but the wait is worth it! Hidden on McQueen and Riggs Road it is certainly worth stopping by for an authentic Mexican meal.
