La Casa Blanca has amazing food! Every time I have eaten here it has been good. Everything is fresh and they have fresh tortilla chips and salsa before every meal. The cheese enchilada's are very good as well as the crunchy shredded beef and shredded chicken taco's. The service has always been very good and our servers have always been attentive. 

I would highly recommend this restaurant as a great authentic Mexican option in Chandler.
