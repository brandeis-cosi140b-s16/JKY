BY FAR... my favorite Mexican restaurant to eat at. My sisters and I absolutely LOVE the bean dip that is served with chips and salsa, and when I brought my boyfriend here for the first time, he asked if he could bring a tub of their salsa home because it was one of the best salsas he's ever tasted. I brought two of my other friends here just the other day and they ordered the House Quesidilla and said it was sooo delicious. But my all time favorites are the mini chimis (with a side of rice) and the Pollo Fundido. To keep it short sweet and to the point, anytime I'm craving good mexican food...I think La Casa Blanca!!
