I wanted to love this restaurant, I really did.  The outside patio looks like a place I'd like to be at.  But the food is mediocre at best.  I had the carnitas chimichanga, and it was just ok.  The chips and salsa were good, but chips & salsa do not a meal make.  Wont be back, and I really wanted to kick it on the patio.
