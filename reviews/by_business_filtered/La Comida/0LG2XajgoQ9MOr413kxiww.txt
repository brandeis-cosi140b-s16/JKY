Ok let me start off by saying the staff was friendly but that's the only good thing I will say about this place. First off it's soo loud in there you can't even hear what anyone is saying. Then there food is disgusting. Defiantly not Mexican that's for sure. They really should change the name of this restaurant because it doesn't fit there food. I had the carne Asada salad and let me say this . They didn't serve me carne Asada . It was more like steak saturated in soy sauce BARF!!! It was gross ! I didn't even finish my food I was soo disgusted . And then there beans were hard not cooked right at all and had a weird after taste . Even the ice tea was nasty. Seriously don't waste your money and your better off going to a fast food Mexican restaurant than here. It's like they made up all there food . No authentic Mexican restaurant would serve ANY of the food they serve . Ok rant over.
