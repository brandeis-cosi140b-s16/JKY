My wife and I love to hang out Downtown Las Vegas. New places are just popping up all the time, and the area just has a good vibe about it. 

We recently decided to check out La Comida. Our friends who had been there before had different experiences, so we weren't quite sure what to expect. Luckily, it turned out to be a great idea to visit La Comida. 

First of all the interior is really cool, with the big bar and the high ceilings and open room. The booths next to the end walls are nice to sit in, but the tables in the middle are fine too. 

As per usual the chips and salsa was complimentary, and it was very mouthwatering. Since it was our first time at La Comida, we asked our friendly waiter (sporting an awesome beard) what he recommended. He suggested the Puerco Ahumado (mesquite smoked pork shoulder) and Camaron Del Golfo (Gulf shrimp and butternut squash), and neither of them disappointed us.

La Comida also has a great selection of tequilas, and a wide range of different Margaritas. In other words a great place to start the night if you're planning on going out Downtown - or for a nice date night.
