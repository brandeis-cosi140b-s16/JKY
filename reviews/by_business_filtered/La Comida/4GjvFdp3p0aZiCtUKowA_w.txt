Came here with colleagues for lunch. Ordered the Sea Bass tacos, and some chile verde tacos to go for another colleague who could not attend.

Chips and salsa - bland at best. Really tastes like tomato paste with salt and pepper in it. Sea bass tacos were mediocre and COLD. And for $14 for three street tacos (which is all you get) it's too steep for the quality you receive. The service was lackluster and I had to ask for my water to be refilled three times while there. 

Upon asking for the check, I waited for 20 minutes for the waiter to bring it. They also forgot (completely) the chile verde tacos to go. So I waited an additional 30 minutes for them to make the tacos - again, 2 VERY SMALL street tacos for approximately $10.

Summary: mediocre food, mediocre service, and not worth the price or the headache!
