Its kinda loud for my taste, but their drinks are good and so is the food. 
FYI...Portions aren't great so if you got a healthy appetite, this ain't the place for you! Caveat: the chips and salsa are fresh and somewhat filling. A possible solution to the small portions? You decide.
I think they've got an interesting location, and a building with great possibilities. I think they haven't quite hit their stride yet.
I'll keep checking in to see what gives.
