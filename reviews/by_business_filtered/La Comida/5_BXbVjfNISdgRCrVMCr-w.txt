I ordered the Ceviche de Camarón. The ceviche was way too salty and I did not like the plantain chips that came with it. They needed to be crisper and sweeter. If the plantains were sweeter it would have balanced out the  saltiness of the ceviche. Maybe they were going for a sweet and salty kind of a thing but they definitely missed the mark. My husband ordered the fajitas. I tried a bite so I could taste them, and it was very good. The chicken had a very smokey flavor to it and the vegetables were not over sautéed and still retained their crispness. The tortillas were corn or a mixture of corn and flour.  I would have preferred all flour. And for dessert we got the Tres Leches cake which was one of the better Tres Leches cake I have had.  It wasn't too soggy and just dusted with a light layer of cinnamon.
