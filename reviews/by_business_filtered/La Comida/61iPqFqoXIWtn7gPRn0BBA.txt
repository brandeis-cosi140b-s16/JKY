I love happy endings, so when I heard the story about some old abandoned building that was turned into a cool Mexican restaurant in downtown I felt the urge to give it my support by letting then run my card through their reader, and of course enjoy some of their wonderful comida.
To start we had the tortilla soup and some guacamole and both were decent. We ordered enchiladas de camaron, they were good with plenty of shrimp filling and cheese, it comes with two enchiladas and rice and beans to share. Also ordered the pollo al horno which it was very flavorful and juicy, it came wrapped on banana leaves and in a paper bag. Authentic? Who knows, it all depends from what area of Mexicos food you're accustomed to, all I was hoping for is some good food and I was not disappointed.
Service was great. We were greeted by almost everyone in the building, we were served in a timely manner and glasses (mason jars) refilled constantly, no problems there.
I love what they did with the place. Modern industrial look with exposed ducts and brick and imported Mexican tile. The cool bar with some gothic touches and saints, giving it a feel of a religious altar where I could just pray all night to the agave gods.
 I do have a little problem with the rest rooms. Saloon swinging doors don't really work in bathrooms, I really believe that bathrooms doors should completely seal all bathroom activities from the rest of the restaurant, and also using Jesus and the Virgin Mary as marking signs for men and women is going to far, a bit insulting.
 Prices are a little high, but the experience is worth it, I doubt I'll be a regular since this place is far from where I live and parking is not abundant but if I find myself in downtown again I'll make sure to stop by and try other items on the menu. I hope by then I find Jesus in the dining room or by the spirits. I pray to that.
