I really wanted to like this place and I hate to give bad reviews.... The decor was great and the bartender was very attentive. The food was horrible! We had the fundido and it was not good... Then I tried to give it another shot and decided to try the tres leches cake which was even worse... Sorry to give a bad review but it wasn't even ok... It was bad.
