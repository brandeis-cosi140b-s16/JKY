They rolled out the red carpet for the grand opening event on May 15th, complete with a giant metal "fire breathing" sculpture (locust?) and more margaritas than you can shake a pinata at!
Pros-
Lovely interior with rustic decor and a bar. YUMMY ribs with salsa verde- the best app. of the night. Mini burgers were OK too. 
The ceviche was so-so, as were the margs and sangria. They were making the drinks en masse which may have been a factor. We didn't go hungry and they passed food just about non stop.
