Margaritas are good for you, right?

Well, I hope so. Because I'm definitely coming back to La Comida for my fix of margaritas. 

My friends and I just came here for some margaritas and some snacks and to just really talk and hang out.

I had gotten the blood orange margarita and my friends got the prickly pear margarita. 

Totally worth it.

My margarita wasn't as blood orange-y as I would've liked, but it was still fruity and full of tequila. The prickly pear margaritas were great! They were sweet and very refreshing. 

Other than that, we just got chips and salsa and queso fundido. Chips were seasoned well and the salsa had just enough heat. The queso fundido was hot and the chorizo gave it a nice heat. 

Overall, this was nice place to hang out and grab a few drinks and snacks.
I would love to come back here for more margaritas.
