What a great little spot on the north end of the strip. Fantastic margaritas in a variety of flavors- we tried a few and liked them all. The prickly pear margarita is bright and tasty! I recommend the tuna appetizer, the corn-cotija side dish and the chicken cooked in parchment. The pork is delicious- very spicy. Save room for dessert- the tres leches cake is fantastic.
