Fremont East is really coming to life. Food and drink options abound and seem to get better each year. 

Love La Comida. I rarely eat twice at the same place but during this short three-day trip, I had to hit this one twice. 

The food is excellent. I went with something called the Torta Grande, with egg added. This is a HUGE sandwich and, although I have a large appetite, could not finish it all. Took half out in a to go bag and gave it to a guy on the street. 

The Torta Grande was outstanding, as were the chips & salsa that came with it. Went back for the Pozole and it was outstanding as well. 

There is a lot of indoor and some outdoor seating, as well as a spacious bar. Staff is awesome. Professional and helpful if, like me, you're having trouble deciding what to get. 

First class act all around. 

And bonus points for playing Depeche Mode in the background. 

Looking forward to a return visit here.
