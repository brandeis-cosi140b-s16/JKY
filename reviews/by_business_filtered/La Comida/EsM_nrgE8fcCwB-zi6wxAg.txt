I love this place. I didn't eat here for awhile because of the reviews, and after I finally went I feel like one really can't trust the yelp reviews. Thankfully I didn't! The food is innovative and fresh. The service is some of the best I've had. The margarita happy hour from 3-5 makes me so happy. The portions aren't out of control and I always feel like I got an excellent value for what I've paid. Every single thing I've had here was well prepared and excellent. I hope that people support this business because its so difficult to find a decent neighborhood restaurant in Vegas and the staff is phenomenal. The only thing I didn't like was the folding chairs. Even though they are pretty I don't like sitting in them. Lucky for me I haven't had to yet. I always get a booth. Can't wait until I can sit outside!
