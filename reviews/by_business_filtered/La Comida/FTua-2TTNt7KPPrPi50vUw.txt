Not really sure what to say about this place. It has good intentions but it's jumping the gun on thinking downtown people are stupid enough to pay those sorts of prices. The only reason locals hang out downtown is to avoid the strip, and the strip prices. The food is A-Ok. Small portions, big prices. The queso fondue basically went back to a solid pile of cheese in less then 2 minutes. The shrimp tacos were very small. My boyfriend and I both had a margarita and an entree - our bill was around $80 without a tip. Not sure what La Comida thinks they are doing.
