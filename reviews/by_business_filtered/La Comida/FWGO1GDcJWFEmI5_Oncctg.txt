Favorite Mexican food of Las Vegas, both Halloween drunk and sober! Friends brought me here on Halloween to eat and drink tequila while running around Fremont.  We ended up with a tequila flight and a prickly pear margarita, queso fundido con chorizo, the ceviche with plantain chips.. now I just crave the ceviche really bad sometimes.  Came back another time and got the biggest tequila education in two minutes, sipped a tequila flight, enjoyed a lovely sangria, more ceviche and queso fundido, tacos, this plate of family style rice and beans, they were good but there was so much omfg on the table the rice and beans were barely touched.  Just flavor, and melting cheese, the right amount of lime, sangria, shenanigans.  So happy.
