Went for lunch. If the truth be told, I had been avoiding this restaurant because I had heard the food was average. When our first choice restaurant had a 20 minute wait, we came here. Unfortunately, my experience confirmed what I had been told. Friend had carne asada salad. I had carnitas tacos.  Service was horrible.  Friend asked for avocado for her salad three times and it never arrived.  Carne asada salad was lots of lettuce with a few strips of steak.  Friend was underwhelmed.  I have a personal mission to sample carnitas around Southwestern U.S.  These carnitas tacos were underwheleming.  Carnitas were bland; almost tasted frozen and then reheated.  More fat than meat. Tortillas were soggy.  Salsa that came with chips did not taste freshly made-- almost tasted like it came from a jar. Rice and beans were average.  Do not plan on returning again.
