If I could give 4.2 stars I would. Why? The food has always been good when I've paid La Comida a visit. The first time I went I had the fajitas. They give you a lot - you'll definitely leave full with leftovers. Extremely flavorful as well. The second time I got the carnitas tacos. You get 3, they're kinda small but surprisingly filling. Very simple - just meet, salsa fresca and onions, but again, extremely flavorful.  
The aesthetics of the restaurant is on point if you're into that "mix-match", sugar skull, mason jar kinda look. Personally, I love it. Its got a very warm feeling to it. 
The only downfall? The service is HORRIBLE. Ironically, I was reading reviews of this place before my boyfriend and I went last night and once we were seated I brought up how surprised I was regarding the reviews. Well, they kept true. Took us about 15 minutes to get our drinks, about 15 after that for someone to come take our order. You can imagine how the rest of the night went. The waitress was not the friendliest gal around either. 
Bottom line, love the aesthetics. Love the food. I'll go back but they need to hire new staff.
