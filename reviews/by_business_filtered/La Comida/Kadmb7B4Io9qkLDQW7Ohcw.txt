Boyfriend and I ate there last night. Food was decent but the service was absolutely horrible. We were ignored. We didn't receive refills on our sodas, and it wasn't even busy! The waiter passed back and forth, servicing other tables and never came to us to make sure we were alright. Never going back there again...
