Was totally surprised by this place - in a very good way.  A couple Vegas residents proposed this place in between nights of meals at Carnevino and Raku and my skepticism at a downtown Vegas Mexican joint began melting away right as we entered the first courtyard leading in.  

The building/d√©cor is spot on.  Perfect.  Ambience is top notch.  Outdoor seating, casual yet sophisticated take on traditional Mexican flavors.  Good drink list heavy on tequila and the jefe margarita was the best I've ever had.

Ordered the guacamole, which was chunky, flavorful and one of the best iterations I've had.  Queso fundido was a winner as well although if you're torn between the two - go guac.  Had the gambas (shrimp) on an intensely flavorful bed of squash, chorizo and tomatoes which had everything I want in a dish.  Shrimp were perfectly cooked.  Also sampled the tuna tostada which, while quite good, could have stood for a little more seasoning.

Service was friendly but slow.

All told, I felt a strong connection with downtown Vegas in general (check out the container park - hours of drinking fun) and this is a fantastic alternative to the glitz and glamour of the strip, with relatively subdued pricing to match.
