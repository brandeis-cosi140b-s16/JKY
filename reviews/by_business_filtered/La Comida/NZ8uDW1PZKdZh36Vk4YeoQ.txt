I've eaten here at least a half-dozen times and won't hesitate to return many times more.  I'm a fan of Downtown Las Vegas and the greater Arts District, and La Comida is an example of why.  Sitting on 6th Street, just off of Fremont, it's a great place to grab a bite for lunch or dinner if you're in the downtown area.

Sure, it's Mexican food and there are plenty of places to get good Mexican food in Las Vegas, but La Comida stands out.  The place has a look all it's own.  You'll never really tire of seeing what's on the walls, or looking at the bar which is a piece of art in itself.  There's ample seating inside, limited seating outside and when temperature permits, the entire front of the restaurant opens up to connect the indoor and outdoor seating.

Then you order and the real experience begins.  Everything on the menu is delicious and when the food is the focus, you feel like you're being served dishes created in your best friend's mom's kitchen instead of in a restaurant.  This is what makes La Comida stand out for me above most of the other Mexican restaurants I've tried.  Anywhere.  The wait staff reinforces the feel that you're a special guest in someone's house.  The attention is always courteous, friendly and frequent, but not so frequent that you feel bothered.  And don't forget the bar.  It's full and the bartenders can serve up just about anything you need to complement your meal.

If you're downtown, give it a try!
