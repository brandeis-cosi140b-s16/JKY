We REALLY wanted to like this place. The decor both inside and out, is by far the best thing aboout this place. We sat down at the bar, so excited, thinking we may have found our new go to place for food & drinks. After ordering 2 different margaritas, the drinks proved themself to be "meh"..nothing special, on the weak side. As we were watching the female bartender pour other patrons drinks, we noticed that she not once measured the ammount of alcohol she was putting into the drinks. She just screwed the cap off, poured some in (and no not with the little silver measuring things). For the price, and the appearance of the resturant, we expected better. 
Next, we ordered an appetizer. We asked the female bartender what the most common & best one was..she suggested the creamed corn. She claimed it was "As good as crack cocaine...I just can't get enough..I eat it everyday!"...We thought this was a weird comment to make to a customer, but whatever, its Vegas. BTW, the corn sucked. 
We left after this. We might go back in a few months and see if they have replaced that bartender..haha. Like I said earlier, we really wanted to like the place.
