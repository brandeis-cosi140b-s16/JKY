Service was outstanding! Every Employee in the restaurant  spoke to us,including the executive chef( she is a delight and passionate about her creations) the carne asada melted in our mouths, the salads were so fresh, crispy and perfectly dressed. The execution of our entire visit was impeccable. A true gem in our desert. Thank you Raphael for the amazing guacamole, soooo fresh and made by hands that care, can't wait to return!
