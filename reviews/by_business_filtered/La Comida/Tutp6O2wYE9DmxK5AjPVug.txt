Love the "secret", Christmas bulb lit, alleyway-esque entrance. Mis-matched chairs, hanging rosaries and mason jar table settings lend a rustic feeling.

*** forgot to mention the bathroom- a surprise I won't spoil here.  

House salsa is bland, slightly sweet and near the consistency of tomato paste. * chips are obviously not house made. 

Food is bland and needed salt. Service was slow. Waiter seemed grumpy to refill water glass - the 1 time. A different, younger waiter was snagged for napkins and refills. Disappointing to be utterly forgotten. 

TIP: house made hot sauce is good. Have to ask for it. 

Beans look house made- with good flavor. Rice is standard. Fajita veggies were sweated, but not grilled or caramelized. Nachos were laded , but too few chips for toppings. 

VERDICT: meal was ok, but I don't see a reason to come back.
