Stumbled upon this place while walking Freemont Street and after my experience I wish I would have kept walking. The margaritas are decent during happy hour but don't plan on feeling a buzz because the alcohol content is so low u feel like your drinking a virgin fruit drink. During Happy hour theres no food items available for the happy hour price and the food and drink prices aren't worth ordering anything unless it's happy hour,what poor marketing! The manager seems uptight an had no personality which may have been due to the fact the place was basically like a ghost town. The bartender seems friendly but beware his job is to hustle you with their extremely pricey guacamole. I believe it was $8 which was more then the drink at happy hour. The salsa was a joke and since your forced to eat tortillas due to their pricey menu at happy hour guacamole sounds better then what it taste. This place has potential due to it's location but management needs to take a marketing class and a hustling bartender at least needs to be pretty. What a rip off, I will not return!!!
