Not sure where to begin here.  This is not a very good restaurant but I need to explain.  The restaurant space itself is awesome.   Really well done design.  Service was fantastic too.  Problem being is that the food wasn't any good.  This is a wonderful bar for drinks and ok finger food but in no way a place for dinner.  Would definitely go back for drinks but wont waste my money or time again on the food.
