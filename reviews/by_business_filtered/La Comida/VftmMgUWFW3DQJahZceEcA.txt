We decided to start off here with a few items to nosh and to partake of their infamous margaritas.  Firstly, the Passion Fruit margarita is Oh-Holy-Cow good.  The chips and salsa are fresh and really nicely done.  We also had the frijoles - creamy, savory goodness.  The hit was the ceviche!  So cold, crisp and fresh!  I'll have to have it again, next time with an ice cold beer.
