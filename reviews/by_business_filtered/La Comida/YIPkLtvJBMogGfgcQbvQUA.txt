The first thought that flashed through my head was another new "Pipster" inspired corporate rollout complete with ass-breaking uncomfortable communal style tables and Jelly Jars.  Jelly Jars, the Kim Kardashian sort of popular official gentrification bar glassware and lunchroom like seating...heavy sigh!

My second thought, RUFKM!!!  If I'm going to order a $19 margarita I want gold flecked tequila slowly dribbled into my mouth by a libation slave.  I was pretty convinced that that was not going to happen, since I couldn't even get a glass of water, so I insulted my palate with a Boone's Farmish tasting sangria that had a few slices of orange floating in it like a dead goldfish.

My third thought, WTF!!!   I could have gotten a better meal at a Del Taco drive thru without the maybe I should refinance my house prices!!!  

Pollo al Horno - dry and bland 
Chicken Burrito - dry with a undefinable overabundance of a spice that made it close to inedible
2 Chicken Enchiladas with Mole - more dry chicken, the mole sauce tasted like a cinnamon paste, dreadful!
Communal rice & beans - Meh

We were ironically glad about the kid sized portions, because all our meals ranged from poor to fair at best.

My fourth thought, Really!!!  Haphazard, inconsistent and totally inattentive service, no water, no chips, no follow up.

My final thoughts, get me the heck outta here and never ever again.

The star is only because the neon monkey was cute
