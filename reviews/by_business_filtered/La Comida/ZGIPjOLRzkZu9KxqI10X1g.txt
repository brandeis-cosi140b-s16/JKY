A friend took me here Saturday night and what can I say, the decor, the ambiance, the atmosphere, everything was right up my alley!  

The place was packed so we sat at the bar and the bartenders were awesome, super friendly, funny.  Definitely made for a good dinner.  

We had a couple margaritas, I am a margarita snob and these ones were decent.  A little on the sweet side but nothing to complain about.

I will definitely be going back, if anything just for the cool vibe and music.  Prices were good for being anywhere near the strip or Fremont.  Obviously us locals know things are more reasonable when you are out of the touristy parts of Vegas but if you are a tourist, you definitely cannot complain about it.
