We were brought here by my cousin Ivy who lives in Las Vegas.  We are so glad we agreed to try something in East Fremont!
The restaurant is open and airy... Great atmosphere!
We ordered the puerco ahumado in a red sauce, which was recommended. We made soft tacos out of it and it was awesome!  The shrimp tacos were good, but became excellent when we topped them with their salsa and fresh guacamole.
The kids had a chicken burrito... They ate every bit.
Our drinks were made fresh.... No bottled margarita mix here!
We will definitely be back when we are living it up on Fremont!
