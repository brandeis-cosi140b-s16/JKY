So I went downtown on the weekend and spotted this place!!! It's kinda kidney but the decor is too cute!! Such an origin setting and great atmosphere, the had little main jars as cups too cute! However I had the tacos and they weren't as good as I expected..although my boyfriend  loved the Mexican torta!
