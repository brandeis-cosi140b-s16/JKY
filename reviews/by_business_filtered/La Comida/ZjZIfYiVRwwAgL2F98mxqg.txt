I love that Fremont East is getting more hip local spots to hang out. For those complaining about the gentrification of the area, I guess they'd be happier with another empty lot or weekly rent apartment complex?
Aside from that, I thought the food, service, and atmosphere at La Comida were all top-notch. The owner (same owner/chef/developer as the restaurants in the Palms) obviously put a lot of thought and time into the design of the space, with some exposed brick/wallpaper walls, rustic-y furniture, a marquee over the bar, and a small patio. It's a livelier atmosphere, even at lunch, with fairly loud music playing throughout. 
Our waiter was friendly, prompt, and helpful, explaining to us that the menu item 'huarache' is actually a tostada of some sort in the shape of a huarache. Weird, but cute.
We ate the pork tacos and the red snapper tacos. Both were very good. 
Chips and salsa were good, but nothing special.
The margarita/tequila list looked great, but we weren't imbibing on this day, so we'll have to return to check out the nightlife.
Minus one star for high prices ($12-13 for 3 street tacos...extra $3 for special salsa!)
