This place is definitely still my favorite Mexican food downtown! I have, at this point, tried almost everything on the menu.. but tonight I went for the Enchiladas de Mariscos, which were tender and flavorful shrimps with queso fresco and sour cream rolled in two soft flour tortillas and drenched in a delicious tomatillo sauce. The sauce tasted like what my Grandmother's marinara would if she were from Mexico instead of Italy- I could eat that shit on white rice. It was like heaven, if heaven were a sauce. Long story short, it made the dish. The shrimps were super moist and tender, like they had been poached instead of grilled like most places do. Fiancee had the Chilean sea bass tacos again, and as per previous review, they were exceptional. 
The service is always great, and multiple servers checked in on us and were playful. 
If you haven't been yet, you must soon!
