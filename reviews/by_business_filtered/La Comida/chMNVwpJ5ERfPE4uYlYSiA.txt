Exquisite food! Service is incredible and their margaritas are amazing! My favorite margaritas were guava and Verano de Jalisco. 
Pollo al horno, enchiladas de pollo and street corn were also delicious, not to mention their pozole and tacos de carne.
My second time at La Comida and it was again a wonderful experience.
