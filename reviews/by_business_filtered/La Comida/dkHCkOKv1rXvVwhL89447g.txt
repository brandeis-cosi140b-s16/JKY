Wow! We've been meaning to try La Comida for quite awhile and now we are kicking ourselves for waiting so long!  

We went for mid-afternoon lunch.  It was pretty empty.  Our server was attentive and really friendly.  We really knew the menu.  The vibe in the place is super cool too!  Love the old church windows in the bar.

Starting with chips and fantastic salsa, everything was delicious! Perfect amount of heat in the salsa.  We shared the nachos which tasted like home made with chucks of meat and generous amounts if toppings.  

We also shared the chicken burrito which was amazing.  My hubby would have licked the plate to get all the tomatillo sauce.  Yummm.

We finished with the Tres Leche cake. Oh yaaaaa! Perfect sweet treat!

Really amazing food!
