I love La Comida! It is a cute, little Mexican restaurant just off of Fremont street. You can spot it by the pink neon skeleton outside. It is usually hit or miss on the crowd. I have been there multiple times, but I have never had to wait more than 15 min.

Food - The menu is short and sweet. They have lots of Mexican favorites. My favorite are the street tacos. The chicken and steak are perfectly seasoned and grilled to perfection. The tortillas are fluffy, and the guacamole is fresh. They also bring out a large plate of rice and beans to share family style for the table. 

Drinks - They have the most fun and exotic margarita flavors. I have a strong liking for the paseo fruit and guava flavors. They are the perfect blend of fruit and tequila, and the tequila is hidden. They will hit you after 2-3.
