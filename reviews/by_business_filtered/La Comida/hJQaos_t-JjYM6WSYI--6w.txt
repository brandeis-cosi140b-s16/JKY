I came here with a large group (and appetite) on a Saturday night.  First I'll piggyback off of many Yelpers by saying the atmosphere is very awesome!  It definitely felt like this place was old and well-established in the area.

For dinner I went with a chicken burrito.  It was a pretty good size and tasty, with a little taste of sweetness (onion perhaps?).  It wasn't amazing but it kept me satisfied through my evening at Commonwealth.  

I was excited to hear that they serve rice and beans as a side for the table as well.  The rice was standard, but the beans didn't taste that good.  Since it is one of the only stand alone restaraunts downtown, I will be back and will order something different, my friend said to try the simple steak tacos.
