I love the design put into this old building and the salvaging of the former structure. Weird Santa Muerte altar over the kitchen and stained glass above the bar add to the character. Complimentary chips and salsa is outstandingly yummy. I had chicken tacos. I prefer Pepe's tacos and prices. But the chips and atmosphere really set La Comida apart. Good place for a date, and with the prices to go with it.
