Upsides: Delicious food!! Everything from the chips and salsa to all 4 of our meals were spot on. Two of us got a shrimp dish on top of a bed of chorizo, corn, and tomatoes (which I could remember the name). The shrimp were nearly the size of lobster tails and cooked to perfection. The other two got the red snapper and a chicken burrito. Both were good and the fresh tortilla was delicious.

Drinks: I didn't have a margarita, so I can't speak for them myself, but the bartenders definitely seemed to know what they're doing and they come in an adorable mason jar.

Downsides: Make a reservation! We didn't and it was packed. We had to belly-up at the bar. Also, I don't know if they have AC or not. Fans were going, but it was still really warm. Otherwise, great atmosphere.
