Downtown is home to a lot of up and coming restaurants in Vegas, and La Comida is up there on that list.

I heard a lot about this restaurant so I decided to check it out for myself.

Eats, the chips and salsa were great! I'm not a chips and salsa snob but these were yummy. I had the enchiladas de pollo for my entr√©e and they did not disappoint. Would definitely reorder.

To drink, I had the Paloma, one of my favorite drinks! The mix of tequila, squirt, lime and salt were perfectly balanced. The mason jar presentation was also a cute touch.
