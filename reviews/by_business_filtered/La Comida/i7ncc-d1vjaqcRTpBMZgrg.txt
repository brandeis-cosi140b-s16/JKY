La Comida, oh how I've enjoyed your fare. Tasty little tacos, yummy fajitas, and freshly made chips. Things could hardly be tastier!

Service is good. Although I'm a bit disappointed at a new policy that you can't have separate checks at a table. That's just annoying. But, I'll be back for sure...in with another group, even. The atmosphere is great & the food is fine.
