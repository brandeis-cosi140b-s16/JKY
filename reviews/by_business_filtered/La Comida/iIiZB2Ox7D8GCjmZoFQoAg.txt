Came in on a Tuesday night with my friend. It wasn't busy and we were sat right away. Our sever was super friendly. We started with a Guava margarita and a passion fruit margarita. Really yummy. The complimentary salsa was okay, nothing special. The ambiance of the room was really nice, very day of the dead and eclectic. I ordered the Pollo Al Horno. The server said that was great dish served in banana leafs. So I was pretty excited but he came back and told me it wasn't prepped and it would take 45 mins. He asked me if I like pork, I said no I don't eat any pork products. So he suggested a shrimp dish. Great. I love seafood. Food comes out. They also give us a family style plate of beans and rice to share. My seafood dish he picked for me has chorizo, pork product. My friend debates whether to eat his Camaron al maya tacos. After a bit of encouragement he eats and likes it.  Finally the sever comes back, apologizes. I ask just for carne asada tacos. The carne asada tacos are okay, it needed a bit of salt and some more heat. Nothing I would come back for. I would probably come back for just for drinks and atmosphere but never for food.
