Back after way too long of a hiatus!
The guac was most tasty and the salsa was pretty good too! 
We focused on trying a few margaritas, and the variety of fruit flavors they have is excellent!
I liked the guava the best and also tried the blood orange, which was also good but not impressive like guava! 
The atmosphere is festive and it's sort of upscale too. We never had to go without a bevvie and also got our chips & salsa refilled as needed. Their prices are upscale for sure unless you partake in happy hour!
It can be difficult to park nearby, as is to be expected Downtown, and so close to Fremont Street!
