From the looks of the other reviews, you either love or hate this place.  I had a great time here and thought the food was really good.  This was the best meal we had on our 4-day Vegas vacation and the service there was absolutely outstanding.

We sat at the bar because the tables were all full.  Our bartender was awesome - super friendly and on top of everything.  She offered us chips and salsa right off the bat - the chips were thick, crunchy and delicious.  The salsa was pretty good.  I had the carnitas tacos which were yummy.  The meat was tender and juicy which I'm actually not used to getting (usually it's fried so it's drier).  My hubs got a smoked beef  dish that he really liked.  I also ordered a Paloma which was light and refreshing.  And for my hubby's b-day they gave us a free shot which was really tasty.

I really have no complaints.  I knew this wasn't a low-rent, low-quality restaurant before we walked in the door and it exceeded my expectations.  I wish them much success.
