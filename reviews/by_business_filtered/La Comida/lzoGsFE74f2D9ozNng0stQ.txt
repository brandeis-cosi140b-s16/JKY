I really want to like this place, really I do. From the funky decor to the fun drinks and the great location, I really want to say I adore the food but I can't :(

I've gone here a few times and everytime I go I'm always disappointed in the food. The chips and salsa are so yummy and addicting but the food isn't really traditional. The last time I went I ordered a mojito which was really watered down and the nachos which sounded amazing but were sorely lacking when they showed up. For the price you pay you'd expect crisp chips and large juicy chunks of white tender chicken breast. Topped with melted cheese and fresh jalapeños. The chips were soggy, and the meat was dark meat and fatty. The jalapeños were soggy and canned. So disappointing. I'll be back for drinks but not for food.
