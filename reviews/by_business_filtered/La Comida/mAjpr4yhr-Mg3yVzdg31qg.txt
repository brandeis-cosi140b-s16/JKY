I will NOT eat here again.
The all male staff greeted and seated us and was goofy,  unprofessional and inattentive.  The salsa was one one of the WORST I have ever had in any Las Vegas restaurant  I ordered the tomatillo/guacamole salsa and it seemed to be missing any avocado.  I said nothing until my wife noticed it too.  All food seemed overpriced and portions were very small.  All the food seemed unseasoned.  When I told the waiter were were all wanting tacos he recommended the sea bass tacos.  They seemed very overpriced for only three tacos but he did recommend them so my wife ordered them.  I got the carne asada tacos. When the fish tacos arrived, we were overcome by a strong fishy smell.  We began to doubt if it was sea bass at all.  Also, the menu claimed that they were tempura battered.  They were beer battered.  Any taco cart in town serves carne asada tacos with more flavor.   The torta that my daughter ordered had the worst meat patty I have ever seen in any dining establishment.  Not only that, but the ham smelled terrible.  I took it out of the half my daughter gave me to tsate.  It smelled off and was clearly from a can (it had the telltale rounded corners of canned ham).
Do not eat here.
