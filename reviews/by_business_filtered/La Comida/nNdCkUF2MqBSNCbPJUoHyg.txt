I'm a local & had a training down around this area.  So my 5 other co-workers & I decided to go here. The salsa SUCKED, I've had better salsa from the jar at WalMart than this stuff.  Our waiter (tall, skinny, somewhat baldy) was not friendly AT ALL (a door stop has more personality than this guy did) & the food is WAY OVER PRICED! $9 for "nachos." I was thinking, ya know nachos! When the waiter brought my plate out it was LITERALLY 4 chips with cheese, beans, chicken & a tiny bit of pico on it. ARE YOU SERIOUS?! That's not "nachos!" That's 4 sad chips on a plate that should be considered an appetizer.  I will NEVER come back here.
