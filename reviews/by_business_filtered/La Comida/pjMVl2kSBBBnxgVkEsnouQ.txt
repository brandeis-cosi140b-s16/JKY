EXCELLENT service by Chris who couldn't do enough for us....he is an asset to any organization...great job Chris.  As for the margaritas..had the blood orange at Chris's recommendation and it just doesn't get any better.  Was with my brother and his gf eho asren't big on Mexican food but all 3 of us LOVED everything. The chips and salsa and guacamole were as good as they can be...She and I had fish tacos which were TERRIFIC and my brother had the carne asada tacos.   enought can't be said about the drink food and service....is on my list for EVERY time I am in Las Vegas..not to be missed.
