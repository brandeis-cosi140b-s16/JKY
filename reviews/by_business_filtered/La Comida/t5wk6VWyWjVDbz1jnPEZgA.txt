I've been to La Comida three times now but sadly haven't tried any of the entrees. I have had their margaritas and appetizers though! I've enjoyed everything I have had there so far. The one time I went there for dinner we ran out of time to eat because service was slow but I still enjoy going here. I love the atmosphere!
