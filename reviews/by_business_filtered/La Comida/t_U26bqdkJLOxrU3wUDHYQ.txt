Come for the decor and the drinks and maybe some food. I say that because the place is beautifully decorated and their guava margarita is a must! But when we order food it's just OK. Nothing to crave and make me drive all the way downtown for. So if you're in the area and want some drinks stop in, but the food leaves you wanting something more. The wait staff is excellent as well!
