I heard good things about this restaurant and had wanted to try it since it always seemed busy. I went on a slow night and thought it would be a perfect time.  Unfortunately, there was nothing noteworthy. Service was very slow and food was extremely bland - and adding salt didn't help. There were no rich flavors or unique items. The margaritas were too sweet ( as was the salsa ) and you couldn't taste the tequila. The only thing that had some flair was the decor.  Overall, it was very disappointing.
