We came here with the in-laws for a birthday dinner, had seen good reviews for prickly pear margaritas and we all loved them in Sedona.  Two of us didn't even finish the margaritas as they were just to sweet.  They were very busy but very quick and friendly.  Menu had little selection in comparison to other places.  I had fajita's as that's a norm for me at a lot of Mexican restaurants and they were ok, I forgot to ask for my meat well done but they had no issue taking it back when it was way to red for me to eat.  Don't know that we'll be back, but the bar area or a place to come hang out with some friends might lure us back in.  The decor was day of the dead and had us all looking all around the room enjoying the fun things we were seeing.
