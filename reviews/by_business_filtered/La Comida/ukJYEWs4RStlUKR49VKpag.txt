Intrigued by the exterior (and my love for all Hispanic food) we decided to grab lunch here. What a fun, artsy atmosphere inside: I felt like I was back in Mexico! The food didn't disappoint starting with the thick house made salsa (I hate runny salsa) that had mild spice and great roasted tomato/chipotle flavor to it. I got the Pozole soup which had great flavors and crisp veggies, just a mild spice to clear out the nostrils. My boyfriend had the chicken tacos; fresh flavors and the tortillas were AMAZING, great consistency.
