Came here last week on a saturday night. I ordered the carne asada tacos. tacos were nothing special and rice and beans had no flavor. La Comida is to big of a name for this restaurant. It  should be called NO COMIDA AND CRAPPY SERVICE. my friend ordered the enchiladas and it looked like slob on a tortilla, According to our server, she said someone was passing by every second to check on us( only passed twice) so when our bill came she said she couldnt do anything about her SLOB ON A PLATE. Also, It seemed like some sort of big shot from the restaurant came to greet the people sitting in front of us and ignored what was going on at our table. I say BIG SHOT because the chefs and kitchen staff kept coming to him about things but he was oblivious. Im pretty sure he was a manager or owner,  to my surprise he was LATIN and didnt care much to what was going on around him. ONLY GOOD THING ABOUT THIS PLACE ARE THE MARGARITAS AND CHIPS AND SALSA. EAT SOMEWHERE ELSE, WHERE THE MEXICAN FOOD IS AUTHENTIC! THIS PLACE IS GARBAGE (EXCLUDING THE MARGARITAS).
