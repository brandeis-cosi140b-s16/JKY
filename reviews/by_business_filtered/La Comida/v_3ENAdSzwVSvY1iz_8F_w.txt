The food here is outrageously good.  Small portions but big flavor. We got the shrimp enchiladas and they did not disappoint.

I thought my Guava margarita was good while I was drinking it but then I broke out in hives from the cheap booze/sugar overload. Not going to lie, this place left a sour taste in my mouth.
