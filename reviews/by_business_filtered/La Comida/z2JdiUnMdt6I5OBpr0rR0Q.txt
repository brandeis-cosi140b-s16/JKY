Dined here Sat night. Did not valet since there was a parking space 1/2 block away. As we (group of ladies) were heading into restaurant, the valet guy kept pestering us to move our car and valet with him. Feel this establishment should have valet that doesn't hassle their customers. Service was good and the food was pretty good:)
