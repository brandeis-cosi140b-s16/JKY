Like many people, we ended up at La Fonda thanks to an hour+ wait at Oreganos. It's nothing fancy and I wouldn't recommend this place for a date night or a night to impress anyone by ambiance, but I have to admit that the food was fantastic. And if there's one thing my family knows about - it's Mexican Food. 

I had a simple Bean & Cheese Burrito enchilada style and it was delicious. It was moist and filled with tons of beans and cheese and the enchilada sauce was great. My mother-in-law go the salad with fresh grilled pineapple, mango and chicken and it was delicious as well. The chips and salsa were pretty good (I still prefer Aunt Chiladas) but the service was quick, the vibe was mellow and the food was tasty. 

I don't live in the area and won't be driving out of my way to come back, but I'd recommend it if you're in the area and looking for some good Mexican.

Note: the combination entrees seemed a little pricey to me. We each got al-a-cart items which came with sour cream, lettuce & tomato and were plenty big.
