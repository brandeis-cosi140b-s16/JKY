Ate here with a friend that told me they had great salsa. She was right, however I don't get the salsa in a jar thing. My margarita was good too. My taco and enchilada combo was OK, but nothing great. I had asked for a side of sour cream, which I later found out on my bill cost me $2.00 for a tablespoon of sour cream! The server should have told me that, and I would have declined because that's insane - I deducted it from her tip, not to mention she seemed to want nothing to do with us. 
The place is old and run down. The ceiling fan light that was over us was flickering and clearly needed to be changed. I think I almost had a seizure from all the flickering. 

I haven't been back since, not saying that I wouldn't try it again, but was not impressed enough to want to come back.
