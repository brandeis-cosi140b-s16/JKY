I hate to have to do this but the last several of our visits have been lackluster. The food quality seems to have declined and the service has too. Last time we were in they had one woman seating, taking orders, bringing the food, refilling drinks, cleaning the tables and checking people out - needless to say it was a slow go. A few years ago we loved this place and now we are on the fence.....
