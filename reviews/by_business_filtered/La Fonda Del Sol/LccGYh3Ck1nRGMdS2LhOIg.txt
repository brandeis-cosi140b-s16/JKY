This place is not far from our home yet we had never been. We were hungry for Mexican food and the yelp reviews weren't bad so we gave it a try.

They were busy on Friday night but we were seated quickly. Our server (failed to get her name) was terrific. She helped us navigate the menu in terms of what were big sellers and her personal favorites. She put warm chips and fresh salsa on the table. The salsas were fresh and good.

Portions were large and they were very accommodating for a special order from my son (hold the tomatoes, hold the onions). I ordered a guacamole tostada and a bean burrito served enchilada style. It was way too much food. Apparently they have a buffet at lunch time and I'd like to try it as I have three sons who scarf most meals these days.

We'll go back - sorry I hadn't tried it earlier.
