This place is awesome! It looks like its been around for years, and the food is pretty good. Its hard to find good mexican food in Scottsdale. I am from Texas and let me tell you, thats where some good mexican food is at. However, La Fonda is pretty good too (not comparable) but good. 

Our group ordered a bunch of stuff, among which was the machaca burro, bean and cheese (boring but good!), green corn tamale, and enchiladas. Everything was great, a little much on the cheese but all in all I would keep coming back! 

Oh! best part! 2.75 for a pint of Shock Top? Whaaat? Its not even happy hour. We got a pitcher. The glasses were frozen as was the pitcher which was cool. They didn't have oranges for some of our party though, but the server was really nice and got some from the kitchen.

Prices range from about 10-15 per ontray and drinks are reasonably priced! Check this place out!! I've lived in Scottsdale for years and can't believe I just went now. 

PS Regular salsa is not that good :/ Chips are!
