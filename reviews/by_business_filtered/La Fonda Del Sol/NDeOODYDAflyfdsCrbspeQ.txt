I have heard about this place for years. This past weekend we decided to try it. It was obvious that if you are a regular, you are treated quite well. The servers knew the names of the customers and treated them like they were part of the family. Our server acted like we were from outer space. In fairness I did not see him interact with any other customers, so perhaps he was the issue. The food was good, but there are definitely better Mexican food places in town. Perhaps if this was our normal spot, or we had one of the other servers I would be inclined to try it again. But, it's not and they weren't so we'll probably stick with our usual places.
