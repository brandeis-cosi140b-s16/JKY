"Yummy, & big-plate Mexican food in Scottsdale!" 4/5

La Fonda has been one of our favorite restaurants for the last 2 years. We love going there to get some house margaritas with one or two plates of soul, comfort Mexican food. My favorite is its Shrimp Fajitas hot plate. J always like their Combo dish. Remember to pour some spicy salsa sauce on your food if you like hot stuff! :) We love the place and would recommend all our friends to try it out!
