I never write bad reviews because I feel I have better things to do with my time but this place was worth writing about.  Walked in and stood up front for 5 minutes before anyone even acknowledged us.  And when they did some lady said they didn't have room right now to  wait.  When we waited another 10 minutes I went up to her and asked if we could be seated and she simply said no and walked away!!   I told her and another waitress standing next to her that they were very rude and we wanted to go somewhere else they said okay bye.  Don't waste your time or money!
