Have been here several times and they are consistent with a couple of things.  First off the chips and salsa rock!  The hot salsa is very tasty and the chips are usually hot and fresh.  The taco plate is always a winner.  And the service usual is usually iffy.  It's good 50% of the time.  
For the food that you get the price is very reasonable.  I will def go back, even if it's just for the chips and salsa, since after all that's what good Mexican food is all about!!
(stay away from the older woman/manager...she is RUDE!!  and don't even TRY to use a restaurant.com gift certificate..she will cut you!  lol)
