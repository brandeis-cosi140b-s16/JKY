Their chips and salsa are the best I've had! The chips come with a bottle of regular salsa and hot salsa, and they are generous to refill anything you need! The regular salsa is chock full of tomatoes, onions, cilantro...yum....mix in some of the hotter salsa on your plate and it's perfect! 

I had their 2 chicken enchilada plate, no beans extra rice. It was really good, although it was cubes of chicken, rather than shredded chicken which I'm used to. Tasty, nonetheless, lol I'm just being overly picky :P Their rice was cooked well, and it came with a nice little side of lettuce and tomatoes.  All in all, a great plate of food! It was a tiny bit pricey...around $13.

But I really enjoyed my food! Service was great. My sister-in-law and I went on a Sunday afternoon around 3pm, and there were only a few other tables. They don't have horchata though :(
