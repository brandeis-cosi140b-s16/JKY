I complained before that Yelpers were consistently steering me in the wrong direction by giving out stars like candy on halloween. Should have known it was a bunch of random hard candies with no wrapper and not kit kats.

However, here is an example where they under-reviewed. 

OK, I realize this may be a situation where it is a matter of ones tastes, but I do believe I have been to almost every mexican food restaurant in the valley and can say without a doubt, that La Fonda is as solid as any place. 

Is it gourmet mexican that knocks your socks off - No!

But, I have been here at least 40 times in the past 4 years and I can tell you I haven't had one bad meal - EVER!

And, the food is pretty darn good!

I think that deserves 4 stars. I don't give 5 stars unless a place blows me away and I crave the food. This place isn't perfect. But it is consistently very good and it isn't overpriced. It is also a family run business, so that alone deserves your attention in the over-franchised world of bland food your are charged $18 a plate for [I am talking to you Sam Fox].

Skip Macayos, Los Dos, Tee Pee, Valle Luna, Carolinas, Serrano's, or any of the other places and head here. You will like it.
