La Fonda Del Sol has been in Scottsdale for forever. Yes, the place is definitely run down, however, they have good food. They have a big menu, there's something for everyone. They have fresh warm chips and salsa which I always get filled on because they are so good! Their Chimichanga's are huge and delicious! The portions here are massive so you'll definitely have food to take home. And the staff here is always super nice. Definitely try this place out if you haven't already.
