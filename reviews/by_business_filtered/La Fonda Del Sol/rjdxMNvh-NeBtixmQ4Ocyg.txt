This place is as good as it gets. Wonderful food, great friendly staff and just a nice atmosphere for a mexican restaurant. I return here every time I am in Scottsdale and I am always greeted with a friendly hello from the owner herself. I am not sure there is another mexican restaurant in the Phoenix / Scottsdale area that I would go to if in the mood for a good margarita and some mexican food.
