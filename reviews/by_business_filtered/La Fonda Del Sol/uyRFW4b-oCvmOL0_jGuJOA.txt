If you look at the front, it doesn't look like a very appetizing place to eat, but my grandma dragged me in because she wanted Mexican food, and I guess I shouldn't judge books by their covers...to a certain point.  The inside was okay, just rows of booths. I have a thing about dirty places, so I think it should have been cleaner. I didn't dare go into the bathrooms.  We were two of about five people in there. Service was pretty good. I got the guacamole tostada lunch special with rice and beans. It was sooo good. My grandma got a chicken burrito which was good too. Their chips and salsa were BOMB.
