After reading reviews on Yelp we decided to try this place. The iced tea was terrible, light brown and had a weird after taste. The salsa & chips were disappointing, all I could taste on the mild salsa was thei onion but my husband said the hot salsa was better. We had a quesadilla which was okay. My son had a bean burrito with rice, he loved the burrito but generally isn't a fan of Spanish rice. My husband has the chile rellano and was disappointed. I had the Machaca Chimi & beans. Both my husband & my plate were beyond hot! The refried beans were actually bubbling! I am not exaggerating when I tell you we had to wait about 20 minutes to eat our food because it was so hot! In all fairness the chimi & beans were actually good but overall not a pleasant experience.The service was okay but not great. Sad to say we were sorely disappointed!
