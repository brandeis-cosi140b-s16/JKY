Some of the best Mexican food of my life!! We started by doing happy hour, which was very tasty (tacos), but decided we would opt for the dining room full service dinner. The service was superb. Our server (I've forgotten his name! Darn!) was so attentive and just incredible! My husband ordered the blue crab enchiladas. Not something I would ever think to order but they were melt-in-your-mouth delicious. I had ordered the steak fajitas but was accidentally served chicken. I told the server I would stick with chicken (as opposed to waiting for a fresh steak to be cooked) and he went overboard to try to rectify the mistake. He brought a free margarita (also delicious - very talented mixologists!), and a complimentary dessert - the homemade churros with assorted dipping sauces! I DIE! If I could live in those dipping sauces and swim around my life would be complete! Everything was incredible! My only regret is that we were staying on site in a room with no mini-fridge, so no way to take leftovers. We were stuffed and couldn't finish everything and it pains me that the deliciousness was wasted by being thrown away because I would eat those leftovers EVERY DAY if I could. So, so good!
My main advice would be to go ahead and sit in the dining room. I know they're known for their happy hour (which is also good), but the full dinner is leaps and bounds above what I'd ever expected. And being from Texas and Arizona, I'm a bit of a Mexican food connoisseur so I know what I'm talking about! ; )
Also - get the churros. For the love of all things holy. Get 2 orders, just to be safe.
