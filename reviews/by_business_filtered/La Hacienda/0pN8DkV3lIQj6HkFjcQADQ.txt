The food was good, but the service was strange. We called to get a reservation and at 6:30, they said the soonest they had open was 8:15. We tried to clarify if they had ANYTHING sooner, answer was no. Fine, ok, we thought we'd just have drinks at the bar until then. We got there and sat at the bar, and realized the restaurant had only an 1/8th of the tables filled. I assumed the tables were all reserved and that was why we couldn't sit. The hostess could have let us know we were welcome to eat at the bar tables. We were sat at 8:15 by the bartender, as it was obvious there was plenty of room, which was still empty by then. It was just a really strange experience to have such an empty restaurant have people sitting at the bar wanting to eat, but not sitting anyone (the people beside us were also waiting for a table). The restaurant still had over half, maybe 3/4 of the tables empty when we left. Maybe this was an isolated thing, but it was so uncomfortable I have unpleasant memories.
