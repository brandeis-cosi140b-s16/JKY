Excellent. Great tequila choices. Unbelievable margaritas and plenty of staff for speedy good service. Fun drink specialties but perhaps the highlight is the freshly made at your table guacamole of goodness. A wood fire crackled near by as we enjoyed very good shrimp ceviche and the short rib for our entr√©e.
