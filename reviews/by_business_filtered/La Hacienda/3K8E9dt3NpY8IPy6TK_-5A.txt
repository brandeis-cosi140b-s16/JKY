Overpriced food. Great flavors on certain. We ordered guacamole sampler, it's the same guacamole with different toppings. Not very creative in my book, not worth $20. My chicken salad was delicious, chicken was marinated well and had great citrus infused flavor, the spices were well balanced. Chicken was overcooked. It was dry, if I pay $22 for a chicken salad I expect the chicken to be perfect.
