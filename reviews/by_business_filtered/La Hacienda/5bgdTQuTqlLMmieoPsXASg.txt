I loved this place.  We sat out by the fire tables which was great.  The guacamole sampler was an excellent way to start the meal. Really great flavor on all three choices.  I also really liked their housemade chips.  For dinner my wife had their shrimp dish with chipotle, and I had the slow braised pork shoulder.  Both were excellent.  In my opinion, this is one of the best Mexican restaurants in the North Scottsdale area.  The food looks and tastes really good.  Sure the meal may cost you $10 - $20 more than your regular Mexican place, but this isn't regular chipotle or Macayo style mexican.  There are a lot of lively and authentic flavors and everything has a real freshness and vibrance to it.  Well worth it IMO.
