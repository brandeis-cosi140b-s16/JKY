My wife and I went to dinner tonight to celebrate 27 years of marriage had the filet a la Parilla at La Hacienda at the Fairmont Princess Resort and now I know what they mean on the cooking shows when they say something has been cooked to perfection! The dish was excellent! In addition our server and the other staff were all wonderful. Our thanks go out for a dining experience that could not be improved upon.
