Danielle the tequila goddess doesn't have "Tequila Goddess" as her official title for no reason. She is the restaurant's tequila buyer and knows her tequilas. She arranged a tasting for our group. The restaurant was not busy at all on Saturday night, but was packed on Sunday -- probably the night that business groups check into the Fairmont for their week's meetings. La Hacienda was understaffed for the size of the crowd, but nevertheless the service staff did a good job under the circumstances. Food arrived warm, not hot, but was tasty. The guacamole made at the table is spectacular and you can specify spicy, medium, or mild.  Margaritas are the real deal.  For a different margarita experience, try the margarita with the serrano chile-infused tequila and pineapple.  I liked it!
