My husband and I were looking for a nice sit down place. Somewhere that we haven't eaten before. I took a chance and made reservations at this place. We started out with the queso fundido for an appetizer and it was so good! The food was out quickly and was freaking AH-Mazing!! I had the enchiladas verdes and the chicken practically melted in my mouth! The serving sizes are great and are very well worth the price. We also both ordered drinks from the bar which were also on point.We had our dinner outside and the weather was great and very relaxing. This restaurant is very much a place that you should check out. Can't believe that my husband and I haven't found this restaurant sooner!
