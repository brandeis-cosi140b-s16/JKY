High end Mexican Restaurant?  Is there such a thing?  Sure there is!  La Hacienda is a perfect example of that.  Located inside the Fairmont Princess Resort, this gem offers a high end Mexican dining experience.  We've been here for happy hour and they have great Margaritas and we've come for dinner.  The dinner is spectacular.  Here's what we ordered:

Guacamole, $14 (prepared tableside)

For appetizers, the tableside Guacamole is phenomenal....smooth and creamy.  They don't add too many Onions & Tomatoes, which is a mortal sin for Guac and most restaurants do that.  The Queso Fundido is excellent and comes with fresh, homemade Tortillas....definitely not store bought.

For the entree, I had the Tampiquena, which is a Steak cut thin and served with an Enchilada, Corn Mash, and Guacamole.....another excellent dish!  The Enchilada is covered in Mole Sauce, which offers a smooth, chocolatey taste to compliment the Steak.  Amazing.

Kiddo and The Wife had the Chicken Mole Poblano and the Barbacoa Taquitos.  They loved their dishes and finished their plate.

Dessert was the Capirotada and the Trio de Helados Fritos.  All I can say is yum!  I could only muster a bite of each because I was stuffed.  The family finished the rest.

Service was spectacular throughout dinner.  I highly recommend this place to anyone visiting Scottsdale.
