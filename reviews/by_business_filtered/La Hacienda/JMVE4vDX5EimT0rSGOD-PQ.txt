Revisit 7/27/2013: Unfortunately they have somewhat altered the menu and some of the more innovative (and better) dishes are gone.  The preparation also seems to have suffered.  Perhaps it is just a summer thing.  I hope so.  But I had to take a star away.

Original Review: La Hacienda is not your typical Mexican restaurant -- the menu is very upscale, the prices are high, and the ambiance is that of fine dining.  If you want chicken enchiladas, cheap magueritas, and chips and salsa, there are many other places you can eat.  

If you go to La Hacienda, you should be expecting a fine dining experience with Mexican-influenced food.  An example is the Chili Nagano appetizer, which is a spectacular rendition of a southern Mexican staple, blending the flavors of a slightly hot chili pepper with cheese, fruit, tomato, and chicken without any one being overwhelming.

Not all of the food is as good.  The short ribs are great, the slow roasted pork is sometimes a bit dry.  The house marguerita is very good, but the pork belly tacos suffer from an overly-strong salsa.  You get the idea.  How come the five stars, then?  Because even the misses are pretty good and would rate four stars on their own, but the rest of the food, the ambiance, the beautiful setting, and the top notch service make this a five star experience.

It also comes at a five star price.  Locals: you can save about $25 if you have the Preferred Dining card.
