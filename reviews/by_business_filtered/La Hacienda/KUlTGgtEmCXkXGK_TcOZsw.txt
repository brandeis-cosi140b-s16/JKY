I would have given this restaurant five stars. However, their beans have lard in them & they don't offer a vegetarian option. With this day & age, a huge percentage of people prefer either a healthy or vegetarian option &, thus, it's in a restaurant's best interest to offer this-especially an upscale one. Hence, it was disgusting to taste the flavor of fat/lard in the beans in their lobster tacos, which would have been fantastic had there been no lard. Additionally, they have a lovely, warm, soft, doughy churro dessert with warm dipping sauces in edible chocolate dishes. Great idea & delicious aside from the caramel dipping sauce, which in my opinion is terrible & ruined with a tangy goat milk as an ingredient. They should stick with more subtle tasting cow's milk & then that dessert would be fabulous. Pomegranate mojitos & fresh guacamole are great. The scallop dish is wonderful, though far too small & limited for price-especially if one does not eat red meat (comes with pork). Very dark setting. I suggest bringing a flashlight or cell with flashlight app in order to be able to read the menu. They should set silverware on napkins for cleanliness, rather than directly on table. Otherwise, good food, good service, & nice setting.
