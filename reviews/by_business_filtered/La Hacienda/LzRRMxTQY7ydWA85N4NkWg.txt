We were staying at the Fairmont and ate here twice and enjoyed both meals. The setting is beautiful and reminded me of the cover of the album "Hotel California" The Margaritas were some of the best that I have had as was the Guacamole Fest and the steak was delicious. Great service and a good wine list.
