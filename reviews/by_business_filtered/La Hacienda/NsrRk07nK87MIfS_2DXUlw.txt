Food was ehhh... definitely not worth the price.

The server was rude. We live in the area and went during the holiday season and the server kinda ruined our visit. We didnt order alcoholic beverages and the treatment from the server went downhill from there. When we ordered our food, he acted as if we owed him one. Then when our check came, for $71, not the $75 required for parking, he was extremely unprofessional with how he made a big deal out of it. We offered to get another drink but he insisted it was more work for him.. we will never go back
