Excellent!! This place is great! I think we had a taste of about everything on our recent trip to this fantastic restaurant. It's located in the Fairmont Scottsdale Princess Resort. We were not staying there but made a special trip just to try it out after hearing and reading great reviews. Very nice relaxing Mexican themed atmosphere. Amy was our server and she was great. Items we ordered: Guacamole made table side. This was the best guac I've ever had. They ask how you want your avocados, (mashed fine or chunky) I thought all guacamole was about the same but I was proven wrong. It's a  perfect mixture of ingredients and spices. Our entrees were the "Filet a la Parilla" and "Seafood Enchiladas." The filet came on top of the best cheese enchiladas I've had in my life. They are made with many cheeses including Oaxaca.  The filet is grilled in a coriander spice and served with some type of sauce with red and green peppers underneath the Filet but on top of the enchiladas. (this is the best way to describe it). We also had several of the margaritas including the "Original", the "La Hacienda" and the "Cadillac." My husband also had a "Horizontal Flight" which consists of three different families of tequilas. Dessert was Cinnamon Churros and a specialty coffee. They flame the coffee table side to add to your dining experience. A great experience. Give this place a try even if you are not staying at the resort.
