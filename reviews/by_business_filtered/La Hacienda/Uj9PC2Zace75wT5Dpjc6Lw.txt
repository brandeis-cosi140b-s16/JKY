A bit pricey for me but, heck, I'm on 'girls weekend'! Started with the guacamole tableside - AWESOME!  Our server?  From start to finish was the reason for the 4 stars - attentive, but also knew to let us girls chatter.... made suggestions, explained dishes - took complete care of us! Thank you Angel ... you are truly an angel! If I had to say there was any disappointment it was that the servings were minimal - and the tequila flight looked a little lighter than a 1.5 oz single shot - more like a 1.0 oz small shot -- a little light for a 'flight' at their costs - the cost of the El Presidente warrants a bit heavier pour! The caf√© de fuego - entertaining and a perfect addition to the churros & dipping sauce - the dipping sauce was the highlight of that dessert! Don't forget the chocolate cups are delightfully edible. We will definitely return to try happy hour, just probably not for dinner.... Angel can you take care of us at Happy Hour?
