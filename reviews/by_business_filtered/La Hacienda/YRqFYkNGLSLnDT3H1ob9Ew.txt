My husband and I have always loved and recommended this place, however today it was a bit disappointing... Happy hour menu has changed a bit, it used to be 2 tacos for 5 bucks now it's 1 taco for 4 bucks, specialty margaritas ( prickly pear and el diablo which are prepared with pineapple and serrano infused tequila) are no longer in the happy hour menu, neither was the tequila flight with the BEST SANGRITA I ever had, these drinks used to be 5 buck, now they only have beers and classic margarita and they're 6 bucks... time to start going elsewhere! :(
