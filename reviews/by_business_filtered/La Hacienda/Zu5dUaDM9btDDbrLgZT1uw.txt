The Princess is beautiful at Christmas time.  We go to La Hacienda two or three times a year, mostly during the holidays because the atmosphere out on the patio is amazing.  The menu is quite expensive and because of this, I expect the food and service to be top notch.  My last few visits, however could have been better. I've had the chicken enchiladas with gristle laden chicken and even had a small bone in one bite. Another time I had the chicken fajita plate and couldn't even eat most of the chicken. The texture was just gross. So this last time, I went with steak. It was very good.
But my other issue is the service. I think it's always been the same waiter over the last year or two. He's very short with you when you ask a question.  We asked for another cup of salsa and he seemed annoyed by this, but it's not like I'm going to stick my arm into the fire pit in our table to get some salsa. Of course he never came back. I had to get up and find someone to ask.  Not cool when we spend between $200. and $500. on our visits there.  Then a different waiter brought our food which is fine, but no one ever came back to see how everything was and we didn't see our original waiter until we finished our dinner. 
The food is good though and I'll keep going back. I just expect better service.
