Came here before Richard Sandoval took over and it was great food. Came here again last weekend while staying at the Princess resort and while I enjoyed it, it wasn't up to its previous standards.

The good: , the salad with goat cheese and almonds, ceviche, guacamole, grilled tuna, and shrimp entree. Also, GREAT margaritas.

The bad: tamal had great flavors but was dry like sand which is unaccpetable at these prices, taco trio was nothing special, quesadillas were different but again, nothing special.

I think Richard, who now has over 30 restaurants, probably needs to pay closer attention to the food at his restaurants to keep the quality up. That said, those dishes that were good were very tasty and this was a nice, convenient spot to go for dinner while at the Princess. I'd give it 3.5 if I could.
