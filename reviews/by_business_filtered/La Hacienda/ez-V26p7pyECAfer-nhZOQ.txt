We were staying at the Princess and wanted to try their well known Mexican restaurant. We were able to get a reservation the same day, which was nice. They greeted us warmly when we came in and seated us right away. Our waiter was pleasant, although not overly attentive. 
We wanted appetizers and margaritas, not a heavy meal, but many of the entrees sounded delicious. We started with drinks, I had a margarita on the rocks with a Grand Marnier float, delicious. My friend wanted a pineapple margarita, but the one they had on the menu was a spicy version with pineapple and jalapeno. No problem, the waiter said, we can leave the jalapeno out. When it came to the table she took a sip and her eyes got wide... they did not leave out the jalapeno! She is a spice wimp, but I tasted it and loved it, the sweet and spicy are pretty addictive. They brought her a new one right away with no jalapeno! 
We shared the guacamole sampler and it was really good. There were three different kinds, bacon, crab and pomegranate. The house made chips and salsa that were served with it were also good. The salsa is medium spicy with a roasted flavor. 
We also split the beet salad, it was just okay. More watermelon than anything else.
I had the quesadilla with carne asada. The flavor was great, the meat was very good and very tender. They looked more like empanadas than a quesadilla, but I liked it. 
My friend was disappointed with the style of the tortilla soup. It was a thicker, creamed soup, with not a lot of the usual toppings, not the broth style with chunks of chicken, avocado  and veggies she was expecting. 
Overall it was a nice experience and the food was very flavorful. They don't hold back on the spice, which is nice too. It is expensive, our 2 drinks and appetizers were $90.00 before tip.
