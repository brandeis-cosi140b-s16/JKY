I gave it a 3 for ambiance.  The reviews were very misleading.  This place is very expensive!!  I'm talking $90 for mini appetizers & a couple of drinks.  There is no way Mexican food should cost this much!  The beef was full of big pieces of fat.  However, the guacamole was good and fresh.  Overall, pretty restaurant but the food is not worth the price.
