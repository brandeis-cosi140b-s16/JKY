Ok the food I finally received the Steak with enchiladas it was ok, but it took a bit. I told my waiter that I am gluten free. I told him a few times. He said I got it. Well he did not. When I received what he called the best thing on the menu it had something on to that had Wheat in it. I could not have been any clearer. The Steak was ok. It was not great. Also I had a mojito and it was not good. Sorry but you guys need to learn how to make one. Very bad. The one outstanding thing I did eat was the Guacamole, It was so GOOD. Overall I was disappointed in this place. I think it was just a bad night. I may try it again.
