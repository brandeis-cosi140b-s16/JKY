The food was excellent. The service was insanely terrible.  So bad it almost deserved lower scores. We had a reservation at 645pm for 4. We ordered 2 appetizers 4 cocktails and 3 meals because obviously with 2 appetizers we had a ton of food. Not only did our meal come before appetizers they tried to rush our meal so much we had everything out at once and they were trying to clear our table within 25 minutes.  We never worked with the same server. To boot after far above the average per head ticket they added a $6 charge for "splitting" a meal.   With what we spent that was obnoxious.  Very disappointed.
