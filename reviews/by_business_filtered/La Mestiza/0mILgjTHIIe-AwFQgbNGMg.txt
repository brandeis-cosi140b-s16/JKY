I'm all for quaint family owned and operated places because there is a lot of potential and undiscovered delicious dishes. This is not one of those places. They need to apply to be on Restaurant Impossible because they need an overhaul. Their decor makes no sense whatsoever and the food was horrible. Their chips and salsa was great but it's pretty hard to mess that up. What's up La Mestiza?
