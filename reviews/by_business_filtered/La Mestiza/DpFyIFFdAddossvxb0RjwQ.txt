Absolutely amazing food.  Crap service.  Normally I can overlook sub par service, especially if the food is worth it.  This is an exception for me.  Actually walked out before our drinks even arrived (first for me!)  Server was beyond rude and even my kids said it seemed like our existence in the restaurant was a real problem for him.
