I thought the food was terrible. The enchilada sauce tastes like bbq sauce. They said they didn't have queso dip. The margarita was subpar. I took 1 bite of my food and couldn't eat the rest. Taco bell tastes more authenic than this place. I lived in Houston, TX for 2 years maybe that's why I'm so lucky about good Mexican food, but this place definitely doesn't have it. Never again will I waste my money there
