I've driven by this place many a time without a clue. It's in the Market Square area by Pegasus Games, just so you know!

What a great little place. Definitely authentic. My waitress was super sweet and patient. It took me forever to decide what I wanted, because everything sounded good. Besides, I was distracted by the chips...ohhhh, the chips! Probably my fave in Madison.  I decided to get a combo dish, to try a few things. Everything was delicious, and a refreshing change from what some think of as "Mexican"(you know who you are!). 

Fresh flavors and simple dishes done great!
