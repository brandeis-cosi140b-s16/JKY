Food was great, drinks were just okay.

I had the pork carnitas special. It is kind of funny seeing a staple of mexican cooking as a "special" only, but I'll make the positive assumption that they freshly roast enough piggy for a night, and are hence limited. It was quite tasty, and so was their salsa and guacamole (although the guac appetizer was kind so pricey). My biggest disappointment was in the happy hour margarita, it was vey much watered down. If I was there sooner than 3 minutes before happy hour ended, and could of put away a lot more I might have not minded.

The decor is totally "hole in the wall", a la "cheap Chinese takeout" restaurant too.

The food is what matters, and I'd go again.
