Second time at this location. First time I was blown away. Amazing service, fresh food, good food. 
Second time food was just as good, service was just as good, but at the end of the night my fianc√©e and I noticed a 18% gratuity had been already added to our bill. There were only two of us, we weren't demanding, there were no signs posted informing us of this possibility, and to top it all off they still gave us the receipt to add a tip that did not mention tip was already included on that receipt. 

Removing all customers' discretion to decide what to tip and how much is completely insulting, and the lack of signs, and the receipt to add a tip has made me very distrustful of this location. I love the food and service but this has us seriously wondering if we will be back.
