For what it is, it is very good. 

I got the lamb shoulder, my wife got the carne asada. We started with chips and salsa and guacamole.

The chips were out of the world-- very good. The green salsa was very good, not spicy but very flavorful. The red salsa just wasn't doing it for me. I tried it two or three times and just couldn't get into the flavor at all. The guacamole was quite good-- smoothe, creamy, delicious. 

The margaritas are phenomenal, definitely worth ordering. They are served on the rocks, in case you like them frozen. 

The lamb shoulder was incredible. It was served with rice and beans, which were fairly generic on their own. The lamb made up for it though. It was covered in a delicious, slightly spicy sauce with a touch of sweetness. 

The carne asada was pretty good. It wasn't the best steak I've ever had, but it was pretty good. Could have easily been better, I think. It was served with two tortillas, which really didn't seem like enough for an entire steak, plus roasted onions (yum) and more guac (still yum). 

We got the tres leches and coffee for dessert, which we split four ways because we aren't quite that gluttonous. It was quite good, one of the highlights. 

Next time I go, I plan on trying something with mole or the tres tacos appetizer (not sure why a meal is listed as an appetizer...)

I definitely recommend this place. Not the best Mexican food I've ever had, but definitely better than most Mexican places.
