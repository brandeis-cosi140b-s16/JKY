First time going here and the waiter was rude. We came in about 40 mins before they were closing.  Ordered a few appetizers.  And as we got our bill. He put it together without asking if it was together or separate.  I asked him to redue it so we can pay seperate. And while we walked out getting into our car he stopped me and asked why he got such a shabby tip. I was in such shock. So I asked him was what we tip not enough. He then stated that since I separated my bill I had to tip him as well. Even though we gave him a decent 10 percent tip on my friends card and I paid mine in cash with an extra 60 cents left on my bill so I told my friend to put the tip on her card. And when we asked who was the store manager he said he was. Again in shock I told him I run a business and never would I have lowered myself to stop a client getting into her car about a tip he think he should have gotten.  That was rude and not something a worker should do to a customer especially now knowing he claimed he was a manager. I will never go here again.
