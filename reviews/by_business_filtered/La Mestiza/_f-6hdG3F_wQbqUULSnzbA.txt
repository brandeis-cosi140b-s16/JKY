In the upper midwest, when soemone says "mexican food" the immediate thought is usually of some varaitey of tex-mex, or god help us something vaguely resembling outsized taco bell entrees.  And that stuff has its place - it's great comfort food and who can't say they've had a post-bar-time craving for a big plate of unnaturally orange nachos?

This is not one of those places.

Mexican food is diverse and varied, and La Mestiza chooses to focus on the home-style foods of Oaxaca.  While they have a selection of tacos, tortas, and tamales, they also feature a lot of slow-cooked braised meats, and really that's where the action is.  Stewed lamb, slow-cooked pork, carnitas, in sauces of pasilla chiles or a dark mole poblano - this is the real deal.  They even do a respectable ceviche, something one usually doesn't expect to find in a strip mall.

Unfortunately the rice and beans as a ubiquitous side dish are pedestrian.  I've had worse, but I've also had better.  

The opening salvo of fresh tortilla chips with salsas is quite nice.  It's something every mexican restaurant does, but the chips here are usually hot and just slightly greasy from their recent frying, and the salsas are different from the tomato-and-cilantro affairs that grace most tables.  A somewhat hot, smoky, slightly bitter red chile sauce on one side, and a soft, vegetal green sauce on the other.  You can order guacamole, but it's best to skip it - it's nothing particularly memorable and, while traditional, lacks much flavor beyond avocado.  

They're licensed to sell drinks, and make a mean margarita.  

They are, on the face of it, more expensive than your standard taqueria or tex-mex establishment, although it's slightly deceptive.  Portions are large for dinner, and lunch hours are graced with very reasonably-priced lunch specials that are generally slightly smaller versions of their flagship dishes.
