While La Mestiza is perhaps the only Mexican place in town with an atmosphere worthy of date night or merely eating in, this life is such that it's just another takeout stop. Throw in a couple kids who don't like Mexican food and interrupt any attempt at date night anyway, and the result is that I never eat my tacos hot. 

Maybe that sounds dirty, but that's just you and the truth is this: La Mestiza's tacos are incredible, even after 15 minutes of transit time in the car. We always order the trio de tacos from the appetizer menu: one chicken, one asada, one al pastor.  

The chicken is the stewed, pulled kind, marinated in a bath of delightful spices and cooked melt-in-your-mouth tender. The al pastor is grilled, quality cuts of pork, with a hint of tropical fruity flavor. The asada....just ok. Kinda tough and doesn't pick up the grilled flavor. The tortillas are good; hard to judge after the commuting time but they hold up well. The salsas also win -- fresh green tomatillo, spicy and sweet; red pepper, tangy and hot.

Someday we'll sit down here and enjoy the service of the friendly staff while conversing over sangria and actual entrees, but for now La Mestiza will remain a regular on our terrific taco takeout tour.
