The food is fresh, somewhat unique and, for a strip mall, the place feels kind of cool.  Portions are big, chips and guac are awesome (best guac I've had in a long time) and service is good.  

What stops me from giving more stars is the price.  I know, I know, its good food.  But it is in a strip-mall and it is Mexican food.  I guess I would rate 3 1/2 stars if I could.  But to drop over a $100 for 3 entrees, some apps and some drinks is steep for strip-mall Mexican.  

I do like the place and I do go back, but it pains me a little to pay for it.
