I had lunch at this little hidden gem and all I can say is WOW! Our server was delightful, helpful and did I mention delightful? And THEN there's the food! Everything that was ordered by our party of 4 was delicious, fresh, authentic, and left us wanting to come back again and again. The chips and salsa are the best I've ever had and I for one, cannot wait to go back there!
