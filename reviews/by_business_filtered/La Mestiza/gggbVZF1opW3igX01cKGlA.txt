If you are tired of the usual Mexican place with burritos, tacos and enchiladas with the same old variations and drinks that are half sour mix, this is the place for you.  Really good food.  We have been here 4-5 times and always had something different and always loved it.  I have to say the service has been a little iffy at times, but the food made up for it.
Some people seem to think it is pricey.  You are not getting ground beef on a tortilla... it will be a little a little more expensive.
