Good chips. 

Decent happy hour adult beverages. 

Somewhat confusing happy hour entrees. Every time I go to happy hour someone disputes their bill as they failed to read the fine print on the poster leading into the restaurant. 

It would help customer relations to give everyone a happy hour menu that explains the taco trio is happy hour eligible when steak is not selected as a meat. 

Customer service is good, entrees are a bit more expensive than you may assume, but the quality of the entrees reflects the price.
