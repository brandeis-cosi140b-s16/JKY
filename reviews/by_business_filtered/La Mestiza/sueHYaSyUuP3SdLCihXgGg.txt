I'll admit I was a little shocked by the price of La Mestiza. At least where I'm from, it's incredibly unlikely to wander into a Mexican Restaurant in a strip mall and end up paying 14$ a plate.

That said, the food was good. Very good, even. My only complaint is that there are only two things on the vegetarian menu, one of which were fajitas, which I'm not crazy about... which doesn't give me any options.

The drinks were dynamite, super tasty and well balanced, and our server was friendly and professional.

I'll definitely be back.
