I really love their food here, I've been visiting regularly since I moved into the area over a year ago. But I was really disappointed on my last visit to find out they now charge you $1 for any basket of chips after your initial first. I came here with a group of 4 people, and we received only one basket that was about half full when we arrived. If you're going to charge $1 for each basket after that, PLUS another .50 for the salsa, then be gracious enough to give us a full basket in the first place or at least one for every two people. :( Awfully sad, we'll be going elsewhere that doesn't charge us out the nose for things that are usually complimentary at other mexican restaurants.
