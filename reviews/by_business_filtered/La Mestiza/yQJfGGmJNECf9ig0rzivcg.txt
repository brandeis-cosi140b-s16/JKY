I have now visited La Mestiza twice, and I can't say enough good things about this place. We've struggled to find good Mexican food in Madison. La Mestiza will not satisfy your need for a giant burrito or tacos - it's not the traditional Mexican restaurant you find in America with combination plates. La Mestiza serves a relatively small menu composed of dishes highlighting the traditional regional cuisines of Mexico. 

The dishes are a little bit pricey, but you get everything you expect in a pricey meal. The presentation is gorgeous, and the food is fresh and delicious. I personally recommend the enchiladas pollo con mole - their traditonal Oaxacan mole sauce is phenomenal, with all the subtle nuttiness and rich chocolate flavors I pray for when I order mole. We've ordered specials as well as the carne asada, and they all elicited "ooo"s and "aahhh"s. They have an excellent house margarita and a couple of Mexican draft beers.

The restaurant is very small, but cozy and pleasant. This is a casual restaurant that attracts a wide variety of people. The decor is inviting and comfortable, with interesting artwork hanging on the walls and paper cut-outs strung from the ceiling in a playful, un-tacky sort of way. Do come here to eat at a table - the bar only has a couple of chairs and seems to be intended only for people who are waiting for their take-out orders.

Finally, the service is excellent. I've had two different servers (who were both there both times I've visited), and they offer the knowledgeable, understated, and appropriately attentive service I would expect from a fine dining restaurant.
