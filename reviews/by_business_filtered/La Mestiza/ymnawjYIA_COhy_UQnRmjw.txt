Flavors are unique and wonderful. The Cochinita Pibil is a must!  Their dishes take classic Latin dishest, but give a whole new twist (like pickled onions). 

Prices and choices are not very kid friendly. But if you are looking for a new twist on "mexican" I highly recommend you give this place a try.
