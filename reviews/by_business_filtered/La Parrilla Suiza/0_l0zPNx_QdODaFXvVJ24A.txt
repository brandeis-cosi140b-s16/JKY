Disappointed. 6 of us, started out ok, service went from ok to horrible. Halfway thru the meal we couldn't find wait staff, or management. Then a glass shattered and reception gave us a mop then hunted for help to clean up. Took 5 minutes. They never cleaned the table of shattered glass, nor did management check on us. Mind you the restaurant was maybe 20% full on a Saturday night, so crowds weren't a problem. They added 15% to the bill, and for the first time ever, we wanted it taken off. then again, management was missing. Can't even relate to the food, the experience was so bad.
