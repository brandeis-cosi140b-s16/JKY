First time here. I had the chicken enchiladas with green sauce and wow the chicken was amazing! I was caught off guard with the color but the manager was walking by and he explained it's how cooked. The meal is large in portion. Highly recommend. I did get up to go out side because it was extremely cold and the manager quickly came over and said I didn't like it he would get me something. That's great customer service and very happy to see they take action in pleasing their customers. Will be back:)
