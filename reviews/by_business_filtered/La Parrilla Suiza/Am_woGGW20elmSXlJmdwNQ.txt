First time here but confused about the bad reviews. Some people are just too hard to please I guess. Service was excellent and everything on my plate was robust with flavor. I had the Mar Y Tierra which was pretty damn good. The charro beans had some awesome spices I couldn't quite peg. The salsa trifecta was VERY good. I'll be coming back next time in town. I enjoyed the friendly staff.
