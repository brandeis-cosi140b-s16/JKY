Fantastic food and attentive service.  Every time we visit the valley we make a point to eat here a time or two.  My favorite dish is the #42. Wonderfully done steak, tangy chorizo, and melting cheese all on your own wood-fired serving tray.  This with great tortillas and their El Charro beans makes the perfect meal that I dream of when I'm away!  Mexico City style Mexican food gets no better than this!
