So, I Order The "Side Fish Taco"  For 3 bucks, When it came I was like ok cool they give you a good amount for 3 buck so I asked "this is the side taco right" she said "yes that's why is doesn't come with rice or beans" They Where not good at all to be honest I didn't even them or take the rest to go and I very rarely leave food. So the bill came it was 12 bucks. So I said "I order the side for 3 dollars why is it 12 bucks" (Keep in mind I pointed at the menu and said my order twice to make sure She understood me.)  She said "O I thought you order something else" and what ever she thought I said wasn't even on the menu. So I will never go back to this place waist of money and time
