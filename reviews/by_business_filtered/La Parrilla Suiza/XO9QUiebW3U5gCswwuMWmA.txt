My husband, my sister and I ate there at lunch today.  They had chimichangas and both enjoyed them.  I, who LOVE enchiladas and almost always order them at a Mexican restaurant, ordered a combination of enchiladas and tacos.  The tacos were OK but the enchiladas were lousy!  The sauce was very boring - too much tomato, not enough pepper and the enchiladas were not cooked thoroughly.  They were edible but wouldn't order them again.  Service was friendly and atmosphere was nice.  However, with all the other choices for Mexican food in the area, I don't plan to return.
