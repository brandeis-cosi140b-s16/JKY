Pleasantly surprised at how tasty the food was! The decor is typical. The staff was friendly. The chips come with two different salsas to start the meal. I had the number 31 which is like a quesadilla with a thin pork cutlet hidden within. The tortilla was crisped just right- the cheese was the good white melty mexican stuff that's not too greasy, and the pork was the right thickness and not overcooked. It was so simple but so good. I'd eat it again and again and I just may.
