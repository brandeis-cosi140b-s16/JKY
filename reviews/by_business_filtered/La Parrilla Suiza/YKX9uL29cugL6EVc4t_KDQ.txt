This was an interesting adventure, so let us begin.........We were seated promptly. For a full restaurant, this was pretty good. Now, it did take awhile before someone came and took our drink order; however, the waitress recognized that and took our food order as well (without writing it down). Now just as our waitress was bringout out our food, a waiter carrying iced tea decided that drinks would be on me....and I am NOT talking about "paying for everyones drinks". While I had a soaked shirt, the good news was that it was iced tea and not some HOT food/drink. The waitress promptly attended to us, moving us to another table and added complimentary desserts for me and my family (about $18 worth). The waiter made it a point to ask if I was OK. Now, remember, the waitress took our order WITHOUT writing it down AND the order came out just as ordered. I had one of the specialty Parrilla plates with chorizo, fajita, queso fundido, quesadillas, charro beans and grilled onions. ALL perfectly seasoned. The complimentary dessert was homemade flan and fried ice cream. The flan had a nice creamy texture and just melted in your mouth. It came with fresh blueberries, a large fresh strawberry and whipped cream. Again, all very good. I assume the fried ice cream was good, because my daughter finished it. All in all, I would definitely make a return trip......the recovery for "drinks on me" was satisfactory, except I would have liked a manager come personally apologize for that mishap. This is why this visit gets only 3 stars.
