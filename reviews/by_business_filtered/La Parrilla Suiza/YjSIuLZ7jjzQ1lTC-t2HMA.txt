My wife grew up on the Brownsville/Matamoros border and I lived there for 6 years prior to our move here 2 years ago...This is the first place in the Phoenix area that has reminded us of home...(even the single refill on your drink...classic South Texas mom and pop restaurant drink move, I laughed when I read that on the menu).  And yes, tacos are supposed to feature corn tortillas fried in oil and then stuffed with deliciousness...it tastes better that way....Rice....this is the way it is supposed to taste...Pollo Loco on 41st and Thomas (Yes, I'm calling you out!) stop by for a rice making lesson...The beans, refried or a la charra were both well seasoned and flavorful.  The Alambre was excellent (probably because I love bacon). The mole was excellent...I've had mole sweetened with peanut butter or sugar...this one tasted like tamarind, I like it alot and my wife, who loves enmoladas (mole chicken enchiladas), said this was the best she has ever had...that is high praise, because her sister makes a dang good mole.  I can't help but give this place 5 stars, I'll go back...many many many times.  Thank you Texas Roadhouse for being too crowded on a Friday night, otherwise we may have never tried this place.
