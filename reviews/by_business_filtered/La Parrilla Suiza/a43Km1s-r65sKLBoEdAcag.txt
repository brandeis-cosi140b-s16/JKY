My family loves it here.  We started out at the Tatum location, and then moved to Mesa.  We were so excited to find this location close to us.  Anytime we fell like having Mexican food this is our go to place.  Every on the menu is good.  Staff have always been super nice.  The manager usually comes around to make sure everything is going well.
