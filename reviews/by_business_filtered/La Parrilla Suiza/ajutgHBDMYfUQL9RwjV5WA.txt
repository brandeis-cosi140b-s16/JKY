Had the steak fajita quesadilla, which was good, no doubt about it. However the service was awful. We got chips and salsa but the girl who served us brought a bowl of broken chips..I mean - seriously broken up, can't dip into salsa - broken chips. When we asked for new ones, she brought a new bowl and just put some unbroken ones on top and left the bottom portion full of broken chips. She also didn't want to bring us any more salsa without charging for a pint of it. Barely got extra water..she was quite surly by the end. Ladies bathrooms were quite unclean. I won't be going back.. I have had the same rude experience at another location at the PV Mall area. Frankly, the decent food doesn't make up for the lousy and surly service.
