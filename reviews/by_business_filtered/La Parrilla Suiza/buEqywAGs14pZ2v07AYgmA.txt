La Parilla Suiza and I have long, long history. A tradition, really. I've been going to the various ones for probably 20 years since I lived in Tucson. Literally went there so much my family had our regular waiter every time. If you order #15 or #32, I humbly suggest you tell them to make it the "old way". It's better. Oh, and green salsa/salsa verde ftmfw.
