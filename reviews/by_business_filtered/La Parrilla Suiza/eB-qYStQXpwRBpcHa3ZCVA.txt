Okay, this is my absolute favorite Mexican Food restaurant in the valley! I realize that we have a lot to choose from here but La Parilla Suiza is still at the top of my list! They have a great selection of Margaritas, amazing Chicken Tortilla Soup, and of course a great selection of grilled entr√©es. The flan and sopillas are also worth a taste! The servings are very generous, especially with the grilled plates. On Friday & Saturday nights they have a great mariachi band playing. The service is fast, the food is authentic and the atmosphere is fun!
