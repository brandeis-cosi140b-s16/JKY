My family went here yesterday for lunch. All though the salsa was ok, that's where it ends!!!  I got a chicken chimichanga. The chicken tasted straight out of a can. Also, I could not eat the tortilla and the sauce they put over the top. I took 1 bite and it tasted terrible. Something was WAY off. My husband got the fish tacos. They literally looked like frozen fish sticks on top of a corn tortilla. Long story short, today has been a miserable day with what seems to be food poisoning!!! Never Ever going back!
