I thought it high time that I do a review for this restaurant. The staff is very attentive, the manager comes by to make sure all is well. The atmosphere and music is very lovely. And the food...  I have brought extended family here several times and the food is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!  It is one of me and my daughter's favorite places to come and feast.  The only complaint I have is that the water and tea taste bad. Tap water is no good. So we always buy a soda or margarita!
I do recommend this place... and definitely try the Chicken Enchilada Suiza with Green sauce!!!
