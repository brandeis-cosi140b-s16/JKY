We came here for a friend's 30th birthday and I actually really enjoyed the experience.  We had a private area to eat, the food (while Americanized) was very good. Plus, the beer choices for a Mexican restaurant were decent (they have Bohemia).  I am on a CRAZY diet and have to have my food come out in weird ways (annoying I know but it's temporary) and the waitress was VERY accommodating with it.

She got everything right and was super attentive, which we very much appreciated.  I wouldn't mind returning at all.
