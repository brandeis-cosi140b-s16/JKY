This food is just....fantastic.  I don't know what else to say.  I grew up eating at La Parrilla Suiza in Tucson.  The tortilla soup and "Queso Suiza" (read mouth-watering melted white cheese that you slather all over tortillas) is TO DIE FOR.   I don't even like soup.  And the tortilla soup you get at most places is just plain nasty.  Not true here.  We drive about 16 miles just to eat at this place.  And, I'll tell you what - it's worth it.

The free chips and salsa alone are fantastic.  Couple that with the soup and some tacos or enchiladas or a chimichanga and you're in heaven.  And the margaritas are pretty damn good too.

We have taken friends and family to this restaurant, and have never once heard a complaint.  It's simply the best Mexican food I have tasted in all of Phoenix.  Yes - I see posts about the waiters and waitresses not speaking good English.  It's true....so what.  You don't go here to have a friendly conversation.  You go for the food.  So get over it....   And eat.
