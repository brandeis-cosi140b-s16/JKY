Why am I always starting my reviews with a statement about how long ago I started eating at these places?  I guess I'm gettin old.

Years and years ago I used to eat at the location in Glendale.  We were excited when they opened this location.  It is really good food, friendly service, and they run coupons.  

This is a regional Mexican restaurant so expect something different than you ____berto's.  Great with a family and their 3 salsa service is outstanding!
