I called La pi√±ata to help cater a party. I was appalled at the service and unwillingness to accommodate my needs. They advertise only needing two hours to put together a party platter, so when I called on Wednesday I never assumed that there would be any issues with getting one by the following Saturday. 

I had a huge number of vegetarians coming to the party and just needed to make slight modifications to some, not all, of the platter items; replacing meat with beans. Seems simple right? I guess not. I was told that I would have to call back on Thursday to speak to the owner about my modifications. 

Long story short, I'm not even sure that they make the food fresh there at this point. There was no way to make any modifications, and the owner even refused to swap the non-vegetarian options with other items from the menu that already were set up without meat. I was told by him, THE OWNER, that I needed to go somewhere else. Then he hung up on me when I replied that I would be sure to share my experience with others. 

Sad.
