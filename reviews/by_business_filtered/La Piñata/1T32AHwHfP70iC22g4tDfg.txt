My family's been going to La Pinata for years - like many of the reviewers.  The restaurant inspires loyalty. 

I've eaten a lot of Mexican food at a lot of places in both Phoenix and LA and I have to admit, La Pinata is good, really good.  

We went the other night and I got the green corn tamale, rice, and beans and a Sprite.  The tamale was moist, fluffy, and just a tad sweet - perfect.  I think the trick with good Mexican food must be the quality of ingredients.  Their rice is moist but rich and their beans are creamy with lots of tasty cheese melted on top.  Of course, there's the requisite shredded lettuce and tomato on the side but it always seems fresh and the right amount.  I've also really enjoyed the chili relleno - again quality ingredients - the cheese is well melted in the relleno, it's a good size, and the egg coating is just the right texture.  I usually get that or the green corn tamale.  My mom usually gets either the green or red burrito.  She likes to shake it up like that!

As people have mentioned, the chips and salsa are addictive.  You've got to like your salsa hot because that's what it is there.  

It's a family-owned restaurant and they've been there for years and years so you know they must be doing something right. It's not fancy but it's definitely not a hole in the wall.  There's the requisite pinatas hanging from the ceiling when you walk in and Latin art work on the walls, red booths and dark carpet but the uniforms are just polo shirts and there's no mariachi bands.  

I think if you're looking to get some hearty, tasty Mexican food, you should definitely brave Indian School and give them a try. I think you'll like them.
