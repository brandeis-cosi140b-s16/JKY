I am very picky about my Mexican food. I grew up in a Spanish home and had the best cooking. This place is as close as it gets to home. Honestly you can not go wrong with anything you order from the fresh chips and salsa to the black bean burros.  My favorite the chili rellenos is great. If you want authentic food and really good service, this would be the place. The decor is a throw back to the 70's, but it is clean and comfortable. Staff is always friendly and welcoming. Their flan is delicious and two people can share one order of their fried ice cream.
