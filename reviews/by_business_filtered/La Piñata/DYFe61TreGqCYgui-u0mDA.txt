My family has been dining at La Pinata Mexican Food for 25+ years.  The absolute best Mexican food Restaurant in the Greater Phoenix area.  The food is excellent.  The People are wonderful and the experience brings us back every Friday evening!  Marleen is the person to ask for!  She is the best of the best!  She will always make sure your visit was Spectacular!  She is genuinely kind, warm, funny, happy and always a hug to go.  We Love Marleen and look forward to seeing her every Friday night.  The atmosphere is always as wonderful as the food!  The best Chips and Salsa we have EVER had!  You walk in hungry and walk out happy!  I could go on and on but I think you should go find out for yourself!
