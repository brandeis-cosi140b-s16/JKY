I have been eating in this restaurant, since it opened. My grandmother, who is now 95, lives just up the street. Every time I'm in Phoenix, I eat at La Pinata. My husband always has a mixed bean and green chili burro enchilada style. I eat black beans, rice, guacamole, salsa, and fresh corn tortillas--they are wonderful at catering to my food allergies. Grandma eats spinach enchiladas. Mom is the only eclectic in the bunch and loves everything she tries. We love the extra spicy salsa, available upon request, as well as the house variety. The chips are the crispy extra thin variety that are sooo hard to resist. The service is impeccable and prices more than reasonable. The owners are friendly and of course recognize our family.
