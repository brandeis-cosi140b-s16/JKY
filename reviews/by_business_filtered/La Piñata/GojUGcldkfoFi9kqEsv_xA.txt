I really wanted to like this place, based upon a friend's recommendation and good Yelp reviews.  The chips and salsa were tasty and fresh, but that's where the goodness ended.  As an appetizer, we ordered the spinach queso dip.  The dip was runny and had the consistency of milk....not creamy at all.   For dinner, we each ordered the shrimp fajitas and they were pretty terrible.  The shrimp was cooked and served in a very sweet Asian style orange sauce (complete with real orange slices), looking and tasting more like an order of sweet and sour shrimp.  The shrimp itself was extremely rubbery and overcooked.  The beans and rice were okay, a little bland, but I shoved them in my tortilla to mask the taste and texture of the shrimp.  Drinks seemed watered down.  I felt sick the remainder of the night.  Will not be back.
