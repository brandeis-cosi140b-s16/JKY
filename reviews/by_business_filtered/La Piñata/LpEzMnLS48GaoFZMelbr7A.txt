We stopped by on Saturday after going to the Burton Barr library.  My mom actually used to visit this place regularly when she was pregnant with me, she reports it's just as good now!  I was pleasently surprised to see the garden fajitas on the menu, they're so delicious.  They're made up of potatos, carrots, bell peppers, mushrooms, and onions also served with the usual, beans (not sure they're vegetarian, didn't eat them and didn't ask), rice, guacamole, and sour cream.  They were very yummy, they also have spinach enchiladas and a black bean and rice burro for the veggies.
My mom had the seafood enchiladas, she raved about them, and my husband enjoyed the chicken fajitas which even at a lunch portion were huge.  

Service was pretty good, atmosphere is nice, for being around 41 years they've kept it up well.  We'll be back when we're in the area.
