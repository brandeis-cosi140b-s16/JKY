So I went here due to a co-worker stating that they were really good. Personally, I thought they were just ok. I've had worse.

 I ordered the combo #1 a cheese enchilada and machaca taco with rice and beans. The enchilada tasted off, like there was an odd cheese mix or something - i think it was velvetta. It had that same government  cheese type of taste. I didn't like it. The taco was ok and the rice and beans were eh.

My friend had the chicken chimi, he said it was ok but he did find a bone in the chimi. I just  think there are much better places to spend your money in Phoenix.  

I was really disappointed that I didn't like this place as it's only a little over a mile from my house.
