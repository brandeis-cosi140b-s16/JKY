I've been going to this restaurant since I was a student at nearby West High School.
It remains my favorite Mexican food in Phoenix to this day.
The recipes are great, food is always consistent and the ownership has remained in the family since inception.
I just wish I could talk the owners into opening in North Scottsdale...it takes me an hour to drive there, but worth the drive.
