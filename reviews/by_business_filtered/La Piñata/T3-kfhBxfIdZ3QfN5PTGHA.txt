We were a bit cranky and very hungry after our flight into Phoenix was delayed by more than 8 hours.  We needed a late supper en route to Sedona.  We didn't expect to find this gem - and are so glad we did!
Just a few minutes off of I-17, this is authentic family Mexican.  Great fresh salsa, just the right ratio of chunky to puréed tomatoes; outstanding Pork Carnitas which we split (with way too much left over).

Bring your appetite, and seek out La Piñata!
