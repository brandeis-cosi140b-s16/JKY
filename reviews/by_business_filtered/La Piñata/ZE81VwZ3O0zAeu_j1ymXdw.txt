I loved this place.. comfortable, friendly, well priced and above all tasty! Met mother here for lunch after hearing so many wonderful things about it. My friend was right, old school, comforting Mexican food.. we started with a Mary Lou which is a quesadilla filled with red or green chile.. had the green chile and it was outstanding. Crispy cheesy goodness dripping with well seasoned green chile, winner! 

For lunch I had the taco and enchilada plate.. the taco shell was a little bit chewy but tasted good. Cheese enchilada was the star.. you couldn't tell where the sauce ended and the cheese began because both were so creamy and smooth. I could have eaten 3-4 of these things.

When in the 'hood this will certainly get added to regular rotation.
