We really like La Pinata. It's in a lousy neighborhood near my office. We found this place a couple of months ago and have probably been back 6 times. We've never had anything that wasn't great or a day with poor service. My favorite is the spinach enchilada but we've tasted about everything on the lunch specials menu and loved it all.
