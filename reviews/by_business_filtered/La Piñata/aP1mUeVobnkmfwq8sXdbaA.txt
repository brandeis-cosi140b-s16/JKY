This restaurant has been around since 1970! We were welcomed immediately and seated fast. One of the original owners, who is in his 70's, still works there and is the sweetest man. He talked and joked with us and made us feel very welcome. The salsa and chips are DELICIOUS and are made in house. Our server was adorable and so sweet. Too bad it's so far or I would love to go more often.
