This really is my favorite Mexican food around. Even though I'm mostly veggie, there's plenty of great choices. I love the green corn tamale, the black bean and rice burrito and at lunch they have a yummy black bean tostado with some kind of dressing that is like crack. And the salad with shrimp on it is excellent for the low carbers out there! Also the salsa is consistantly good. You must try their happy hour! Great Margs and Strong!!! Try the 3330 if you like um strong! If you sit in the bar, say Hi to Daniel! He's the best!
