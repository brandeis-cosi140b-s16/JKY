Love the new location! We have been eating here 20 years and it's still our number one Mexican restaurant. We drive 20 miles to have lunch/dinner here regularly. If you read a review that doesn't like the food, they're from the east coast and don't know good Mexican. The food here is consistently fantastic. Yes sometimes you wait and sometimes you have to ask for something twice BUT WHO CARES when the food is so delicious. The prices are fair, $9 for lunch. When did that become expensive? I paid $10 for a freaking salad and sandwich at paradise bakery the other day. 
Go enjoy this place, you'll be hard pressed to find anything better.
