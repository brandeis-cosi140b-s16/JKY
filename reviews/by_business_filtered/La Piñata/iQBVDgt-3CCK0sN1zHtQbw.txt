Love this place!!!  My husband and I always sit in the bar area...great, friendly service! They have, by far, the best margaritas I have ever tasted...and I think the food is one of the better Mexican's in this area.  The fajitas are delicious and way more than enough for 2. I would also like to add, that I love the decor! And its always busy...it has a following of locals, and that is a great sign!
