Some places are just so a part of your childhood that they always remain a favorite.  La Pinata is one of those, I have been going here since before I was born... no seriously, my family has been regulars for decades.

Kids grow up and it had been quite sometime since I had been to La and went there for a birthday dinner recently.  Man oh man it was a blast from the past.. not much has changed.  There was a new pinata- Chicken Little.. made me smile & the Steak Piccado was off the menu.. but other than that is same ol' same ol' (including the non-pos terminals for servers.. which made me chuckle a bit).  And you know what it works.  That is what has kept people coming here forever.

Portions are huge, flavor is even bigger.  Support your local restaurants!!


(Btw.. for those of you who have been coming here for years, there is a new AZ history mini-book series available at Barnes & Noble and some Walgreens.. Well the one about Mexicans in Early Phoenix mentions a couple times throughout the book about Pete and his early days with the band.)
