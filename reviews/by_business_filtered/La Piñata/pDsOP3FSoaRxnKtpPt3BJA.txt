Saturday I decided instead of waiting for bulk pickup I'd make a journey out of disposing my old dishwasher. A trip to a metal recycling center on 19th ave put $5.10 in my pocket to go towards lunch. I short trip north put me right where I wanted to be. Mexican grocery store and strange Catholic/holistic medicine shop on one side of the street, and an eclectic overly decorated Mexican Restaurant next to a auto shop on the other side of the street. 
La Pinata's food was well seasoned, without being overly salty, good chunky homemade salsa, and great prices with very generous portions. The "there's a taco in my burro" with Machaca dry beef was very good, a mildly spicy smokey flavor, and enough for 2 meals. 
Places like this are what make living in the Phoenix area fun!
