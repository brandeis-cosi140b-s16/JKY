Passing through from L.A. to Austin, I wasn't expecting much. Boy was I impressed. First, the portions are huge. I felt my belt expanding with every spoonful consumed. The price was about $14 a plate, but given the huge volume of food, it's worth it.  It's basically two meals - one for now and one for sobering up later after too much tequila. Go here. Get the Pollo Azteca. It will make you happy. Love, Chicano Lawyer.
