Hadn't heard that La Pinata was relocating.  Thought they were just opening a #2 at the old Mary Coyle's.  Anyone have confirmation on this?  

We have been going to La Pinata for at least 30 years, so maybe we're biased, but this is the standard on Mexican food for us.  I just wonder about the few people who are reporting non-cooperative service or "arguing"(?) by the manager?  Huh?  What exactly did YOU do to bring on an argument?  You're usually treated about the same as you dish out.  We love the restaurant and will patronize it loyally wherever they go.  Delish!
