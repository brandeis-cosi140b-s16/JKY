Not bad :) stopped here for lunch during the work week and had really good service. I had the rellano plate, someone else ordered the burrito bowl and the third had tacos. Everyone liked the food and the chips and salsa were good. My only complaint is that my rellano oozed grease when I cut it open. Needed to drain or something before it was placed on the plate.
