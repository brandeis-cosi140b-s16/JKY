Now THIS is the way to have Mexican food!  We tried La Ristra by using a Groupon....we will DEFINITELY be back!!!  Awesome server, Steve, and served immediately with chips and a trio of salsa (two that were hot...and SO good! and a mild salsa....also super delicious!)...then we had the southwestern egg rolls (?)....SO yummy!!!...and finally, our entree!....a full chicken breast (my hubby and I shared this entree), with rice and beans.....this was an amazing chicken breast topped with green chiles, peppers, cheese and a spicy sauce....wow! Super delicious!!!  But wait!...there's more!  My hubby had a cadillac margarita....but I had the "Sangrita"...oh, please do yourself a favor, and enjoy the Sangrita!  A delicious frozen margarita with a sangria poured over top...my FAV new drink!  We were greeted by the owner, and without a doubt, we will definitely be back!!!  This is a hidden treasure, but get ready for a long wait on weekends (we heard), Thursday night worked out great for us though!  Enjoy!!!!
