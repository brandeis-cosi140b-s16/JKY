My wife and I went to try out the digs before it was all finished and found it to be a pretty sweet find!  The chips and salsa were tasty with bland to spicy choices (but the initial serving size on the salsa was pretty lame... Ok, they did willingly return several times to give us more!!  Yeah!!)  You could tell the learning curve was just kicking in, but in spite of that, the servers were pleasant, engaged and willing to go that extra mile to please!  MARGARITAS are AWESOME!!  BEST in GILBERT BY FAR!! We'll be back to see how things trend for sure!! The Traditional Burrito Plate was tasty with the adovada pork and Christmas style enchilada sauces.  The Southwest Chopped Salad was tasty once my wife realized to use the spicy salsa as the dressing!!  Fair serving sizes meant nothing to pack up to take home but also no room for dessert! :)  Big Hatch Chili shin dig this weekend so we're heading out to check it out and savor some sweet smells and cool tastes!!
