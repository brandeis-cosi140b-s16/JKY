While in Gilbert my friends and I had dinner at La Ristra.  The food was delicious and the service was wonderful, Ken,  our sever for the evening was a delight.  I would recommend this restaurant to everyone or anyone that is looking to have a Mexican style dinner and be happy with the choice.  I certainly will  go back. for seconds and thirds.
