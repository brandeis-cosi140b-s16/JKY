Had my first taste at the Small Business Alliance meeting and was impressed with the sampling so I decided to do a lunch there today.  I had the pork abodada green chili wrap, now I love New Mexican food but this thing was amazing. They packed so much flavor into that wrap I could not believe I was still in Arizona
