My hubby and the in-laws and I decided to track down some yummy Mexican food.  We were moderately successful. The good: the food. I'm can't take that away from them, the food was delicious all the way around.  The cons: the service!
We had a waiter who was not very experienced.  He messed up two of our orders and was continually reaching over our food to reach plates, glasses, etc instead of walking around.  This would have been totally forgiveable.  Except... instead of telling us the dining room closed at a certain time (the restaurant is listed as being open until midnight) the staff simply cleaned up around us as we were eating.  I got to finish my meal with the pungent smell of cleaner instead of fresh salsa.  It was also super annoying that they decided to mop the floor to the only exit (making the walk to the door quite treacherous) and start cleaning the bathrooms so that they couldn't be used.  I would have been happy to eat elsewhere if we had been informed that they were getting ready to close the dining room.  We finished our meal and left  at 9:45pm on a Saturday.  It's a shame because the food was good but with such disappointing service, we will not be back.
