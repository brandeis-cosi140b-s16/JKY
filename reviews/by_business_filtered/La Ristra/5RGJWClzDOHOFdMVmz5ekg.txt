We tried this place for lunch on Saturday and sat in the bar. We were greeted and seated immediately. The staff was friendly and explained their menu. 
We had the taco appetizer and watermelon margaritas. Both were served fast and had alot of flavor. 
I had the blue corn enchelada stack that was delicious and spicy. I will say that their sauces and meats were spicy but not over the top. Perfect for my taste.
My only complaint or knock on the place was $10 each for the drinks.
We plan on coming back to try other menu items.
