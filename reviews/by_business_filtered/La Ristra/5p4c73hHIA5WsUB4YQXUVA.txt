I had the Pork Green Chile plate.  It was basically soup with a few (and I mean few) chunks of pork.  Flavor was fair at best compared to other New Mexican restaurants I have been.  I have to agree with another reviewer.  They cannot do rice and beans.  Now the goods.  I did like the flavor of their green chile salsa.  My wife and mother did say the margarita flight was very good.  My suggestion would be to come for the drinks and only order food once you are tipsy enough to not care how your food tastes.
