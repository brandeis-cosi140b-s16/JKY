I can't stay away from their blue corn enchiladas. They're so good. I can see where some people could complain about their food being a little bland, but since I'm pregnant, I gotta stay away from spicy stuff  anyway so it's not a problem. ;) I do wish they had better salsa, but overall, I enjoy the food, and the service is always great.
