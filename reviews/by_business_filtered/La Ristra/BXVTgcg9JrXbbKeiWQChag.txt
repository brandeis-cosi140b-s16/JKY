Very creative menu. The venue is comfortable with a large dining room with 30 ft ceiling so the noise level is not bad. It has a bar section which seemed comfy and inviting. Ken, our server, was knowledgeable and polite. He had excellent knowledge of the menu and made great suggestions. I had chicken with avocado, rice and black beans.....Yum! I'd go back in a heartbeat.
