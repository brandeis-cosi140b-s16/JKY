Loved this place!  The food was very good, especially the "Stuffed sopapilla" with shredded beef and "Christmas" sauce!  YUMMY!  The owner was very personable and accommodating.  The waitress was very knowledgeable about the Tequila.  They may have had a few struggles here and there, but the food and tequila is worth it!
