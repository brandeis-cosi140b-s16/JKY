I  wanted to check out the recently opened  La ristra, as it is in my area.   
Decor was nice,  but they need to learn how to keep it  clean.   Dirty table and cloudy glasses are a real turn off.

Margarita my wife ordered was fairly tasty, but very weak on the tequila, and it was way overpriced.    Service just ok.   Waited much too  long  for our food, and when it finally arrived,  the order was wrong.    Waitress told me I was in the wrong,  so I just ate what she gave me ( shredded beef burro plate).   The burro plate was pretty good to be fair.   The black bean tostada that  my wife ordered, was cold, and just ok.    Waitress later returned to apoligized, admitting she did get it wrong.    Burro plate ended  up  on the house, but  I dont think it was enough to put this place on the regular rotation.   Time heals all and  I could see myself giving the place another shot, if it is still open in a couple of months.
