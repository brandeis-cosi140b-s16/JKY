I found the restaurant from a friends FB post.  Checked it out on 6/29 and was back 6/30.  The ambiance is fantastic!  It has a very cozy and welcoming feel to it.  Only had margaritas on my first visit but they are fantastic as are the complimentary chips and three salsas!  Not too warm for me but if you sweat with mild salsa, then you better watch out :)
I went back the next day for lunch.  The red and green chilli plate I had was delicious and spicy!  There is a whole lot more to try there and I plan on it!
The bar is a thing of beauty!  They have quite a selection of tequilas and it looks like a work of art.  
The staff was fantastic and very friendly!  I can't wait to go there again!
