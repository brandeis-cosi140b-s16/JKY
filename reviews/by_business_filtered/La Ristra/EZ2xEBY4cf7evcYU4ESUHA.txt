this place was staffed like they had never been open on a Friday night before.  pro tip: it's not a great customer perception when I can clearly see 2-3 servers just standing around and chatting at all times.  at least sneak out back and smoke like any self respecting wage slave.  the food was really bland which was weird because they bill themselves as a New Mexico style restaurant complete with south of the border spicy food.  my wife wants me to quote her here: I hate everything about this place.  sums up the experience pretty well.
