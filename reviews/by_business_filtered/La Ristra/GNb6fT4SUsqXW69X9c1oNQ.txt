I live around the corner from this place & have been meaning to try it, so today when I had a hankering for green chili, I picked up some takeout.

The place had a great bar/cocktail area & a nice separate dining room, from what I saw. 

I got the green chile pork stew & it came with well seasoned rice, chips and three different salsas, of which the verde was especially good! The stew was really good... super tender pork & I love the addition of potatoes & pinto beans. 

I'll be back here for sure :)
