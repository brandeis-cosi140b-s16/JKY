Went back again. I just don't understand the reviews about "too hot" or "not New Mexican" New Mexican cuisine is supposed to be spicy as opposed to "Mexico City" cuisine such as La Parilla Suiza. This is great flavorful, and spicy food. There are non-spicy options, but the spice is what I love. Great food, great service...and an incredible selection of Tequilas. Just a great place and I love it.
