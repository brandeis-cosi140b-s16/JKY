I enjoy this place.  has a really lively atmosphere and on weekend evenings they have live music (which can get really loud if you're sitting in the bar).

the flights of margaritas are really fun to taste test - have a bunch of flavors to choose from.

we had a chicken chimichanga and split it.  it was really large so splitting it was perfect.  we did "chistmas style' so they put 1/2 green and 1/2 red sauce on the burrito which is fun.  chips come with a few different salsas

staff was quick to serve and were all very friendly.  prices are pretty reasonable too - especially for the portion size.
