I think New Mexican food is amazing in so many ways. I got hooked when I used to go visit the BFF in NM. 

This place is definitely on point w/ that! This place is really close to my house and I always pass it so my friend and I decided to try it out. For drinks we ordered the Sangrita that our waitress recommended. I love Sangria, I love Margaritas, so I'm already sold! & It was delicious! For the entree I ordered the Blue Corn Enchiladas. Oh my gosh... get this when you come! I got it with shredded chicken and it is topped with a fried egg. & of course I have to get the Christmas sauce. Sooooo good!! 

I really loved this place. Our waitress was so helpful with her recommendations and extremely friendly. Not to mention the food was amazing. I'll definitely be coming back for those enchiladas. But I also want to try their happy hour as well as their margaritas since they are known for their tequila as well. & you can get flights of their margaritas! =)
