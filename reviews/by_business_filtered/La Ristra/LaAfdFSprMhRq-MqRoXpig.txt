Ordered one of the house specialties- carne Adovada ribs with a Dos Equis lager on tap. Our server was Ken - very friendly and attentive. He recommended the ribs and I was very pleased - glad I tried them - delicious. Clean, comfortable seating, nice decor. Nice place to sit back and enjoy an authentic New Mexican meal. Great place to bring friends. They also have over 100 tequilas and live music in the bar.
