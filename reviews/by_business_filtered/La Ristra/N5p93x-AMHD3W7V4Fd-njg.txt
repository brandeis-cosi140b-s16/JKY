This is a nice looking restaurant with pretty decent service. My mediocre review is due to the food preparation. One year ago, I came here and ordered fajitas. My experience then would have warranted four stars. But last night, I ordered a chicken burrito and it changed my opinion a bit. The chicken itself tasted fine, but it was not seasoned much at all. For some reason, they put corn in their burritos. (?) I like corn, but find it to be an odd burrito filling. My biggest gripe is that they covered the burrito with cheese, but most of the cheese was not melted at all. If I am ordering a hot entree, I expect the cheese to be melted and gooey. My son had a cheese crisp, and his cheese was just barely melted. Perhaps if they work on serving their food at a hotter temperature I would have enjoyed it more.I should note that I asked for my sauce on the side because I don't really care for red sauce. Perhaps if it had been on the burrito, it would have made the entree hotter. As it stands, I would probably choose other Mexican restaurants over La Ristra. It was just a very "meh" experience.
