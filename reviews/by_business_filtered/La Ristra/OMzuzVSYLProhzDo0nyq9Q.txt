Came from New York to visit family in Chandler.  I do know a good restaurant when I eat there. They brought me to La Rista and I can't say enough about the place. The food and service was phenomenal!  The fishbowl raspberry margaritas were awesome - haven't had anything like it before.  I had the pork adovada (tried everyones) I can't stop talking about how delicious it was.  Came back and had to adovada bennedict for breakfast.  Can't wait to go back in November.
