Was very good overall.  I had the House Burrito Chimichanga style and my wife had the enchiladas, both dishes were excellent, good amount of spice but not crazy hot.  Salsas were good as well.  We had a couple sangritas which was a margarita, house made sangria combo which were also good.  My only complaint was that the meat could have used a touch more salt.  We will be going back again soon!
