If you have lived in New Mexico for an extended period of time.  You know that you have an addiction to Green Chile.  The Bad Green Monkey on your back.  Well I got a great dose of the old Carne Adovada that took me right back to those nights at Sadie's in Downtown Albuquerque (well its on 4th or 2nd street, killer Margaritas too who the hell can remember LOL) I digress....  
La Ristra has some great New Mexican plates, A little fancy, a little pricey and lets just say you won't take a doggie bag home.  But!! By GOD you will enjoy it and I guarantee you will go back only if you are a true Green Chile Aficionado.

Its in an odd place and the decor is reminiscent of a typical New Mexican cafe 

So Man up get ya some green, I dont know if they have wimp food.  My mind kinda goes blank after the first bite and I usually dont remember looking around at anything during the eating frenzy.  Good stuff
