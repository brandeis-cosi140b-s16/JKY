Food is great, especially the ribs. Service isn't very good. For whatever reason they do not like to refill your chips, even after we ordered the trio dip. Got the dip, but no more chips! This happened on at least 3 separate occasions. I mean seriously? After we got our food, the waiter disappeared. We had to go ask someone else for our check. They either need to hire more staff or hire people who are better at managing their time. We love the food but might not go back because of the terrible service. Such a shame.
