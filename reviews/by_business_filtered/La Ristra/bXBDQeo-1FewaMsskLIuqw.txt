As we live 1/4 mile away, we have tried to like this place. 1st visit for quick lunch left us 20 minutes speaking to nobody. Finally bartender came to take order. Food was good not great but 60 minutes for a quick lunch when the place was empty was odd. Second visit came at the exact time they were to open. Tried to open the door to but it was locked 2 min after opening time. We waited outside for 10 minutes until a staff member opened the the door only to continue holiday decorations. They could see outside the door and never once said welcome or anything. We were in the way. We left. Food is good and I see it is busy at nights but this will soon fade with this service.
