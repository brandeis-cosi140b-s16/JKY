We first visited La Ristra a couple weeks ago when they were kind enough to donate a portion of that night's sales to the family of my 9-yr-old son's classmate who recently passed away.  A restaurant that supports their community already had my vote before we walked in. Besides, we'd never even seen the place from the street previously, as it's the cornerstone of a medical office-y type complex. 
The interior of the restaurant was beautiful- reds, deep woods..very classy and romantic. Although I'm not exactly sure what "New Mexican" means, everything was amazing. 
My son had a chicken quesadilla, filled to the brim and so good.  My husband ordered tacos, which he said were perfectly tasteful and unique. I had a shredded beef burrito and the thing that will bring us back is the fresh flavor of the beef. The sangria was also very flavorful- not too fruity, not too bland.
 I have recommended La Ristra to 8 people on 8 separate events since this visit.  Three friends have taken my advice and they loved it as well.  I really REALLY hope that this place is able to stay in business, since a lot of my new favorite places haven't done well in the past couple years.  Last thing I want to mention is that they have a full bar area separate from the restaurant, and outside seating. This would be an awesome Happy Hour joint.
PLEASE support this community-minded restaurant!
