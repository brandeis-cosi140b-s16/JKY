I loved this place!  Not only was the food great, the service was great as well.  I tried a variety of things here: appetizers, soup, main course, drinks, and dessert.  Everything was amazing.  The atmosphere is awesome, it definitely has that unique bistro feel to it, nothing like a chain restaurant.  I am surprised by any negative feedback.  The owner personally greeted me and told me the story behind the restaurant.  He is the type of business owner who would bend over backwards to make his customers happy.  Go in and ask to meet him!  I highly recommend this place, especially during lunch or if you're looking for a nice night out on the weekend!
