Two strikes!  We went several months ago to a Sunday morning champagne brunch and felt they were deliberately slow in coming around to avoid pouring more champagne. We went this time with long-time fans of Los Dos Molinos (same New Mexico family) who were sure they wouldn't like La Ristra as well.  They were favorably impressed!  They didn't like the chips and salsa, but loved their food.  My chimi had very good flavor, but was overly salty.  What ruined the meal this time was the extremely loud (pre-recorded) music.  We had a group of eight with a double table and communicating with the other end of the table was impossible.  If you know flamenco singing, you know that a piercing voice is part of the style and that, combined with the volume, made it painful for me.  Several in our group, ranging in age from 31 on up, commented on it.  I asked our server to turn it down (we were the only patrons in the room) and he agreed it was too loud, but it never changed.  It ruined a otherwise nice Sunday afternoon family dinner.  We'll try one more time, but that may have to be it for La Ristra.
