Had multiple times authentic new Mexican food spicy salsa! Had fajitas chicken was great steak was a little fatty. The burritos are great, sometimes are very hot once were cold. The shrimp come with 4 shrimp and they were hard and overcooked but they refunded me every penny for that order. Overall the food is amazing but hey everyone has a bad day. Will order again!
