We have been going to LaRistra once a week since they opened their doors. Service is outstanding, food is beyond compare, and over 100 brands of Tequila. What else can you ask for. House margarita is the best on the valley.  The owners are very personable and the staff very friendly.  If going on a Friday night, make reservations. They are usually packed between 5 and about 8:30 ish. Also, try Brunch on Sunday with Bloody Mary and mimosa specials.
