Yum!!! Wow this is a must try! Ordered the Green Chile Mac with Chicken it was SO good! The atmosphere was great service was even better our waitress was clearly happy to be here! Over heard a gal behind us say this was her favorite Mexican restaurant, when we finished our wonderful dinner we absolutely agree!! We will be back!
