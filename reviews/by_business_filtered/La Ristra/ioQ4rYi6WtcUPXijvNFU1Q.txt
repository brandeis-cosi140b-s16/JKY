First visit tonight, with our son who had been here once before. He couldn't stop talking about it. Being Friday night, we had to wait about 25 minutes to be seated. I ordered the traditional burrito w/ green chile pork and asked for it Christmas style. My wife ordered Socorro's chicken, our son had the green chile plate and his wife had a traditional burrito "chimi" style. We all enjoyed the food and will be going back. The service was good, but not exceptional. The decor is pretty nice, too.
