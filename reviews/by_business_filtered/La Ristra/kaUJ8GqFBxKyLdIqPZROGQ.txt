A clean, relatively modern looking Mexican restaurant located in a strip-mall area.  The service was very good, particularly our waiter, Ken. All the food appeared fresh and well made. I had a 3 beef taco plate. The vegetables tasted fresh and the meat filling was quite tasty. Not very spicy, if you like hot foods. My wife had a chicken chiiichanga. The chicken as very tasty. The sauce was spicier then my dinner. The tortilla in the chimmigahnga was hot, but not crispy as it is often served.   My only complaint about the food is that the tortilla chips that were served at the beginning of the meal were all broken into very small pieces. Only the top layer was full-sized chips. The sauces provided ranged from a mild fresh, tomato salsa to a hot green sauce. We ordered a Margarita on the rocks. It was good sized, but I would say it was average in taste. Not bad, but noting special. The total cost of our meals, with drinks was less the $40 before the tip. Overall, I would recommend La Ristra for a good Mexican meal at a reasonable price if you are in the Mesa/Gilbert/Chandler area.
