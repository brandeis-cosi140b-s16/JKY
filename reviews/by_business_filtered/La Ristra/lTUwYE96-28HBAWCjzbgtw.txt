House tequila is Montezuma Gold. Haven't drank that crap since I lived in a cardboard box. The server literally messed up every part of our orders; red sauce for green, shredded beef for ground beef, black beans for pinto. And he forgot every extra item we asked for. 

The food was very bland. The salsas were good, so we just doused everything with it. 

The restaurant decor was nice. Not sure what salsa music has to do with New Mexico, but that was the music playing. 

Like other reviewers said : stick with New Mexican Grill.  That place is great.
