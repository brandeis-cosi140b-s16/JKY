- The red posole is pretty good.  Needs to be thicker and more stew-like, but great flavor.  The red chiles are the perfect touch.

- The carnitas were juicy, but could be a little saltier.

- The chicken tacos were pretty bland.

- The shredded beef tacos were excellent.  Lots of flavor and very tender.

- The red and green salsas both had some pop and were great with both chips and our mains.
