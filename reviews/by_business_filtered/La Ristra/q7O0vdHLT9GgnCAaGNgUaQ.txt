Highly recommend this place.  I almost purchased this restaurant but I didn't because its kinda hard to get to.  But boy I tell you what I made it in there today and it was worth the U-turn on Lindsay.  Located between Lindsay and Gilbert its tucked away in a mostly Business park,  Use to be the old Chuys,  about a 1/4 of a mile east of Lifetime fitness.  The food was fantastic and the pricing was on target for the portions you got.  My burrito was chimi style with this great Christmas sauce on top my mouth is watering now as I am writing this.  I plan on taking my friends there tomorrow evening.  I hope you are successful because your food is uniquely tasty and the service is impeccable.  No I am going to yelp about you all.  I want you to be successful so I can continue to eat there.  Best wishes for a successful future.
