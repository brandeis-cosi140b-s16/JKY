Stopped in today for the first time for lunch w/ a friend who's a fanatic of this place (he was there opening day and bought several pounds of the fresh roasted hatch chiles). It wasn't too busy, but it was mid week lunch which I imagine most other restaurants are less busy at this time also. I've driven by after work and seen the place pretty busy, especially on sports nights. My friend said there are often 45+ minute waits for dinner on weekends.

I had a lunch plate of 1 item plus rice and beans for $6.99 which is a really good price. I spend more than that at Rubios which isn't as good. The chips and salsa are great- they serve 3 kinds of salsa. A green which is pretty hot, red, and a garden style with corn and chunky tomatoes. My chicken enchilada was very moist and had good flavor. I had it covered "christmas style" with red and green sauce.  Our server/bartender JJ kept up on refills and additional chips and salsa. 

They have several decent sized tv's up on the walls with ESPN etc. Plenty to keep you entertained.  The bar looks pretty well stocked, I heard they have a good selection of tequilas. We learned about some new items and dishes that are coming to the menu, which is a little small but it allows them to do the dishes better. Focus on what you're good at and own it... anything with the green chiles are awesome (said my tablemates).
