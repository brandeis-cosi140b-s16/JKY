I so wanted to like this place but after eating there I will just say it is OK.  This dining experience was forgettable.   Arrived and they had employees smoking on the back dock with a bunch of random equipment strewn out the door.  You have to drive around the back to get to the entrance so it is the 1st thing you see as you park.  The restaurant has typical New Mexican decor and they played country music.  Food was just Ok.   The place had no energy and felt like it had no soul.
