Arizona does not know how to do New Mexican food! 
FYI 3/4 of this restaurant is a bar. Service was terrible. Waitress brought out the completely wrong order and when I asked her to correct it, she brought it out wrong for the second time! Finally I asked for a to go box so I could simply take it home and eat and that took way longer than it should have. They do have "red" and "green" Chile but it is not authentic New Mexican. I can say like some other reviewers that  the chips and salsa were good but I would not go back. I REALLY wanted to like this place but too many negatives! When I finally ate the food I would say it was ok, not terrible, not spectacular but definitely not New Mexican.
