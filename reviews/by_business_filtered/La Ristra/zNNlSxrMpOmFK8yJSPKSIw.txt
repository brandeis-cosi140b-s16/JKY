Since we are from Albuquerque we really wanted to like the food at La Ristra, but alas as most Az restaurants that advertise "New Mexican food" it just wasn't up to the standards of what we are use to in NM. I ordered tacos with ground beef, I got shredded beef, 2 of my grandchildren ask for them to hold the garnishment on their plates, (lettuce & tomatoes) they still received it. However my wife didn't get any on her plate! We pointed this out to the waiter and he comped the soft drinks. Salsa was good and hot, but the food just wasn't that good, so we will still make our quarterly trip to Albuq to get our fix of good Mexican food.
