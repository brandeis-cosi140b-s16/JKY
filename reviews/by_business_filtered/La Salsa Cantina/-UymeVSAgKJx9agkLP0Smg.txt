This - like most things I found on the Vegas strip - was watered down, fake, and overpriced. 

There was a supposed happy hour. What's that you say? You'd like a margarita? You'd like a happy hour margarita? Oh you can only have that if it's frozen. 

Wait, what? I can only get a 'happy hour' priced margarita if it's frozen, if I get the exact same drink on the rocks it's $6 extra? Wtf. Just so you can cheat me out of alcohol? Lame. 

The drinks were horrible, watered down, and not worth any money really. The food was bland. We had to pay of course for salsa and chips. 

Our server was nice but not necessarily attentive.

All in all though - what can you really expect from a chain mexican restaurant in ceasars palace? I should have known what we were getting into.
