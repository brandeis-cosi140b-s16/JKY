We went here for happy hour while staying at Planet Hollywood. They have an AWESOME happy hour, I was shocked they weren't more crowded. Their margaritas are 3.50 and they have discounted appetizers! It also was exciting because they are listed on AA American Advantage dining program so I got triple the points on my dining experience. This place was great and I will be back!
