I ate there alone and had the steak tacos. It was served with beans and rice. The food was good and the presentation was nice. But the atmosphere is nothing spectacular. It's pretty typical for a Mexican restaurant. 

The waitress was not very personable. She seemed to have too many tables. She didn't offer a refill on my drink. 

Overall this place was just average. I would go there again and I would recommend it.
