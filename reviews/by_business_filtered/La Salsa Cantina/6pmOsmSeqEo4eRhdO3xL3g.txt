There are a few positives about La Salsa.  One is that they have a DJ and a real dance floor; and by real dance floor, I mean that people are expected to actually dance to the music they play, not just grind or stand around holding a drink.  The other positive is that on a Saturday night, they were not charging a cover for guys.

Other than that...we got free chips and salsa for being locals.  Margaritas go from $10 - $17.  We didn't order any food besides the chips, but entrees were priced $15 - $20.  If you're on the strip and want to dance to Latin music, then cool, go to La Salsa.  If you're on the strip and want to get margaritas and get Mexican food...then go somewhere off the strip.
