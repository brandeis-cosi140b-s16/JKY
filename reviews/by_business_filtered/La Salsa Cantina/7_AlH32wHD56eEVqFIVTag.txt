When it comes to the strip everything costs money but this place was reasonable price and the food were good.  I love most the mango margarita for $9 and if you buy the big one that you take home it costs only $19.  They had a very good enchilada de Camarons it's kind a spicy and well done good.  Will definitely come back here.
