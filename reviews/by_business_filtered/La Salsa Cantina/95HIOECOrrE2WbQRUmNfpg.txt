This is a nice casual restaurant that my ladies and I enjoyed before a class we were taking at the V Theater.  They fill you up on fresh salsa and warm, crunchy chips, service is quick and the prices are very cheap for Vegas.  Great place to get away from the hustle and bustle of the strip and have a good cheap meal.
