I have eaten here on past Vegas trips and remembered them being a little better than what we got today. 

We got there about 10 minutes before their "Happy Hour" started. They told us about it and assumed since it was just a mere 10 min away, they'd honor it. My husband ordered a happy hour drink and before the server left I was like- that's the special price right? She goes no- that starts at 3. We said, then we'll wait the 10 minutes and then put in our drink order. We ended up getting a margarita for $3 and a beer for $2. Margarita was tasty. 

We started off with some chips and salsa.
Not a fan of having to pay for these. I'm used to free chips and salsa at Mexican joints. My meal wasn't too bad- I got the fajita quesadilla. It was good. My husband ordered a burrito but had to be specific about no cheese or sour cream, no guac, no salsa. Basically it was supposed to be rice, beans and chicken. Unfortunately, he got about 1/2 way through it and started gagging on chunks of tomato. He almost threw up on his plate. He was so nauseated he couldn't finish the meal but didn't want me to send it back or complain about it. (Sigh). 

Over priced just average Mexican. I doubt we'd return.
