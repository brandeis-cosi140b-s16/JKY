In addition to eating at the other location, we also visited this location twice in early September.  We only had drinks and snacks here in the evening.  I had margaritas, made w/ patron for $7.99.  They were very good drinks.  We had chips and salsa w/ them.  They were good and not too pricy.  They were bottomless so they just hit the spot w/ our drinks.  We had the same server twice.  He was a very nice guy.  I checked out the menu and want to have dinner here sometime.  I had breakfast at the other location and it was great.
