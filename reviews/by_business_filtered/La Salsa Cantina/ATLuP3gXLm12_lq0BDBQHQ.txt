Excellent place to go for Latin dancing on the strip. I have been here numerous times and it's a blast every time.  The dance floor is always lively and you can see that everyone enjoys themselves when they are there. 

 This is the La Salsa in the Showcase mall right next to the MGM and the M&M factory.  If you want to go out and have a casual time on the strip and not go broke,  make sure to come here.  Staff is always friendly and attentive especially Marco the GM who always knows what's going on and checks up on things.  

The food is always great too.  I recently had the fajita burrito and it was so big that I shared it with my wife and we couldn't finish it.
