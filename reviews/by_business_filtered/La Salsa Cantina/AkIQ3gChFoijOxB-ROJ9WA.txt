We have been visiting this place for years on every Vegas trip. CHEAP fabulous breakfast and the very good tequila sunrise! Home of the .99 Bloody Mary and 3.99 breakfast. You won't go wrong for this meal deal. There are several locations, the one inside planet Hollywood has a slightly different taste and staff service from our visit. The one we normally goto is next to the coca cola museum and MGM on the strip. Consistent and tasty, always a visit in our book.
