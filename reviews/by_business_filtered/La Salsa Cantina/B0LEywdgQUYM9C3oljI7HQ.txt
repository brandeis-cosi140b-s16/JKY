Damn, this place is overpriced. I got two burritos and a couple of drinks and the bill was $65!!!! Are you kidding me?? Then, I ordered a yard drink to go, and I swear, there was NO alcohol in it. I am a lightweight so I should have been drunk drinking the entire thing, but I drank it and didn't get drunk. Really?? The upside of this place is that the servers are really nice and the food is decent, but everything else about this place pissed me off.
