Not good food. For my order wrong. I don't mind that because it means I might try something I thoroughly enjoy and would have never known if that mistake hasn't been made. However this was not the case. I had ordered fajitas.. Ended up with enchiladas. Lol I wouldn't have mind but then my food was so gross and bland I couldn't enjoy it at all. Waiter was extremely nice but lacked understanding .

Oh well.. It's on the strip. What are your going to do?
