nice lil spot if you come with someone who like to dance to salsa..... not my favorite spot in the world .... I was not to fond of the way they speak to guest I know they deal with a lot of drunk ass people but you should still have a sense of good character... 
Tips: go to the bar and order yourself , waitresses are rude and take forever to get you served.
