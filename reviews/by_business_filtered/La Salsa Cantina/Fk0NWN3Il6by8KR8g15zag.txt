I could not believe that this place charges for chip and salsa since it is a "Mexican" restaurant. It wasn't expensive at $2.95, but really?! I ordered the grilled baja fish taco which was extremely dry, the black beans were alright, and the rice hard. My BF ordered chicken tacos which were also dry, but totally not edible! This was a complete waste of money that ended up being pricey after you add the drinks!!
