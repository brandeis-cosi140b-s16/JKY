Another so-so meal in Vegas.  First off, we had to ask for and pay for chips and salsa...really?  Then, we split a late night sampler platter and after drinks, you would think it would taste oh so good.  Not the case.  Makes me wonder how bad it would have been had I been completely sober.  Overall, the service was good and the food was edible.
