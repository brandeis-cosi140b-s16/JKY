I will say, the Bloody Mary here I had for breakfast was hard to drink... it just wasn't any good.  But the breakfast that I had was really quite good.  I enjoyed it much more thoroughly than the ridiculous excuse for a cheese platter and wanna-be baguette that I bought in "Paris" for breakfast the following day that made my stomach very, very, very upset.  Our waitress was decent and evenly handled a woman who did not speak English who was very adamant about wanting what we consider "over-easy" eggs.  We were also entertained by a charming English fellow performing card tricks at the tables.  Unobtrusive enough and he left immediately when our food arrived.  Reading the other reviews, I am glad to have skipped the ridiculous foot-long beverage... although to think that it would actually be a good deal in the land of rip-offs, makes one wonder what these folks were thinking to begin with.
