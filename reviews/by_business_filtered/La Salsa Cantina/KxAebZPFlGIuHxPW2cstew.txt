So we come here all the time not for the food but drink specials are great considering its the strip. Food is ok chicken enchiladas and fish tacos are good if your hungry... but drinks are great and the Bartenders very nice Brandon is the man. We always have a fun time here! Stop by and meet some loco locals and get a reasonably priced happy hour drink 3pm to 7pm.  Love it!!
