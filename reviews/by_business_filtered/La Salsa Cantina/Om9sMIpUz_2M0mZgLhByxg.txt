We were starving so we just headed into La Salsa. It was pretty good. I got the Mexican Pizza appetizer with shrimp. The pizza was pretty big for an appetizer too. The shrimp wasn't that good. The service was friendly and fast. We ordered 4 shots of patron, they brought us something else that tasted like Jose Cuevo. Probably wouldn't come back to a La Salsa in Vegas.
