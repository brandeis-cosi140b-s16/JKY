As a local finding good happy hours on the strip is always a mission. I'm never opposed to trying something new on the strip, and while on a "staycation" trying La Salsa's Happy Hour at Planet Hollywood seemed like a great idea, a 16oz Margarita on the rocks for $3.50 on the strip, hells yes! Well once my boyfriend and I were 3 drinks in, and I ran to the restroom while he ordered the 4th round with another 10 minutes until Happy Hour ended, we waited 42 minutes to not only to never receive the round but to be rung up. Customer service fail, I am most definitely not the person that you want to stop bringing rounds to, especially when I would not have cared to even pay full price well past Happy Hour. Not acknowledging a paying customer let alone a local, Epic fail, especially when I manage a business on Las Vegas Blvd. Where does the service mentality go these days?!
