We were extremely happy with our meals and the cost... considering that it was on the strip, the price was fantastic! Great happy hour special! (Discovered a 20% off with a fourstar check into the mall) Guacamole was great, fajitas had great flavor.. just enough heat for me, but my man was able to enjoy dinner without calling them wimpy. (Shrimp was a little overcooked) Hector the manager was fantastic as well as Aracely our server!
