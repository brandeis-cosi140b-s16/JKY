Came here with no expectations, only to get a quick meal and some dranks! super casual atmosphere and yes it is a lil touristy. 

Their drinks were pretty good and strong. Had (of course) the pina colada. Most of the people at the table got the corona/margarita.

For food had a mix of beef and chicken tacos. It was pretty decent. Big portions. Staff was super friendly. 

Overall, I left happy and with a lil buzz.....and suffered no GI distress. What more can you ask for?
