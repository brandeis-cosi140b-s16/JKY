we stopped by here on the way out of the miracle mile shops on our last day.  the food was really tasty, i had a carne asada burrito and it was a really good buritto.  prices didnt' seem too steep in my opinion, typical sit down mexican restaurant prices ($13ish for the burrito).  they do have the 50 ounce margaritas in the tall vegas type cup, but it is kinda pointless to pay that much for it when it only has 3 shots of alcohol in it (we asked the bartender).  better off spending the money at fat tuesday and getting extra shots of everclear for a dollar.  but the food was good, portions were large so we were happy
