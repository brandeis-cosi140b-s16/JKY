SAY WHAT??!! Food for Four Bucks on the strip?! Yes my friends, it does exist :)

$3.95 Breakfast Special like what is listed and blasted all over their reviews... I actually opted for the Egg White and Grilled Chicken BFast...it was only $6.25 pretty goshdarn good, my friend got the $3.95 special and said it was tasty. The tortillas were hard but their eggs were cooked great, the chips and salsa (must purchase for $2.95)  were excellent and the service was great. We sat at the bar, bartender was a super sweet chick and the $0.99 cent Bloody Mary's can be doubled for a whop-pin' total of two bucks and they were really good. 

Go for cheap but not Phenomenal, just good food, super cheap Bloody's and I'm pretty dang sure if you sit at the bar, you not only get better service but you get better drinks :)
