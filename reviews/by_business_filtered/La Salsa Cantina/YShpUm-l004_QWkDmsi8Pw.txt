If you don't mind bad service and cheap mediocre food this is your place to eat.  The breakfast deal that they have is what caught our eye.  My friends and I just wanted to get something in our stomachs.  We thought it will be quick fast food but we were wrong.  The service here is just HORRIBLE.  After we were seated, we did not get any service for about 15 min.  We were ready to leave.  They didn't ask us for water  or grab our order.  When a server arrived, we placed our order in and hoped we get our food quick.  Like I said in the beginning the food was mediocre but since the pricing was cheap we expected it.  Do yourself a favor and find another place.
