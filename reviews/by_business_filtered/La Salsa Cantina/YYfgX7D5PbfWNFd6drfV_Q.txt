I was stranded at PH around dinner time so we went to La Salsa. I ordered a margarita on the rocks and the server informed me that there was a $3 special on frozen. Normally I'm not a fan because I feel like frozen drinks are a good way to get stiffed on alcohol but a $3 drink is a $3 drink so I got it. I appreciated him saying that there was a special going on since they don't have signs announcing their happy hours. 

I ordered enchiladas suizas, and like other Yelpers have said, it isn't that authentic or that great. It was edible but it wasn't a place I would recommend. Again like others have said, somewhat pricey for smallish portions. Once but not a repeat place.
