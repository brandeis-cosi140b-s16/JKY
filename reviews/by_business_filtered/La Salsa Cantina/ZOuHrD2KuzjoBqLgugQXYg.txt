Last night, I went to this place based on a comp given to me.  There was a specific menu given to me with a few options.  I chose the chicken fajitas which were actually pretty good.  It was lots of meat.  I did have to add some salt and pepper but I was okay with that.  The service was good as well. There was no pressure to buy additional items.  They did come around and take pics for a personal postcard.  The pic for my husband and I were really good so I bout it, but again there was no pressure and I still got the initially promised free postcard.  Overall the experience was good.
