Come here for the bar, not the food.

The food was okay nothing special, the service was okay, the food did come out quick, but just wasn't impressed. Can't recommend the margaritas either, maybe it was just me but mine tasted like straight up over sweetened smoothie.

Did stop here on a club crawls and did have a lot of fun a the bar though.

This is one of those places you end up at, not quite a destination.
