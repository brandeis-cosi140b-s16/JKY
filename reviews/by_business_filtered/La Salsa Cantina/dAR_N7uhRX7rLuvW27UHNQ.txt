Came here after shopping because me and my friends we're starving! The food was alright and it was kinda weird how they charged extra for chips and salsa because usually restuarants give that stuff for free. The waiters were pretty nice me and my friends were pretty loud and some were buzzed! Cute place but the food is just average.
