The only reason to even stop when trekking down the sidewalk is for the yard-long margaritas. The bartender that served us was fast, upbeat, and excited (geuinely or not) to have us there. She made a mean margarita on the rocks and it had more tequila than I was expecting from such a touristy hole. In fact, it had quite a lot of cheap tequila. Which, in yard-long quantities, spawns the beginning of an awesome Vegas night. 

Minus one-star for telling us it was $16, then asking us if we wanted on the rocks while failing to tell us that would be an extra $3. Still - get it on the rocks. Trust me.
