I had a very expensive margarita here. I just wanted the experience of walking down the street with a drink, LOL. So I chose a $21 margarita. It was good, but not the best I've had. I finished about 3/4 of it, then tossed it after it melted. Oh well. My husband had a draft Dos Equis--this was the only draft the bar had!  We were a little surprised, but he was fine with it. It looked like a nice little place to get something to eat and drink.
