We came for breakfast. Understaffed, which left much to be desired in terms if service- but we were warned upon entry that they were behind. Great food but one plate came out warm not hot. Great chilaquiles and Mexican scramble despite temp. Amazing breakfast drinks: boozy coffee and Hot Tamale Maria. Would come back for breakfast if we had plenty of time to spare. One last addition, they had a great photographer coming around offering a "free" photo. Ours turned out great, so we got a free thumb-size and purchased a 4x6 for $20.
