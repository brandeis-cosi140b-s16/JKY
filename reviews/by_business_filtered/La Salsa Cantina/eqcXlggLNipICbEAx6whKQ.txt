I went to this restaurant after a long day's travel with my girlfriend and a bit of shopping at the Miracle Mile.  I had been there in the past.  Once again, I was not disappointed.  

I had the Taco Salad, it was fresh, cold and crisp.  My girlfriend had Taquito Sunrises which were also very good.  

The ambiance was nice as we had a table near the mall's water fountain.  The music a little loud at times, but if you like to be in a little action out of the heat, this a good place to be.  Service was just right, the server was polite and courteous.

We each had a drink and main dish for less than $40 for both of us.  If you are looking for good Mexican food with no frills and good service, this is a place to go.
