Ehhh the one good thing about this place is their location if you dine outside, people watching through the Miracle Mile.

We came here right after doing dune buggies and we were starved. We were kind of disappointed when we heard they were only serving breakfast, but we dealt. Both ordered the Mexican Scrambled [My friend who is Mexican makes it soooo much better!] but it was satisfying enough.


Now, the drinks. We had come here for drinks a few days before and they were good. But that morning, I ordered a Mimosa and he ordered a Bloody Mary. We shouldnt have expected much coming from a Tex Mex restaurant, but really.. how can you mess up a mimosa?! its only champagne and orange juice... mind you, their orange juice had PULP. Ugh. Ive had plenty of mimosa's and never had pulp in it. Maybe Im wrong, I dont know. And his Bloody Mary was veryyy very ketchupy [Working in the restaurant business, I have made plenty of Bloody Marys and they never tasted like that] But all in all, if you want somewhere to eat thats convenient with decent food, I guess you could go here. But I heard Cabo Wabo is better [wishh we would have went there]
