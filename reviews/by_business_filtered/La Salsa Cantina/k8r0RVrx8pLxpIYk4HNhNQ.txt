The $3.95 breakfast special is what called out to us as we walked down the strip... we we're all for it but what ruined this place for me was their DISGUSTING coffee.  The server told me prior that it was colombian coffee but I can't believe it because it was the most horrid, watered down coffee I've had in such a long time.  I tried it both hot and iced mind you.  The breakfast on the other hand was pretty good but theres no way in hell I'd return.  Breakfast and coffee go together like a hand and glove - they need to improve this situation pronto if their charging close to $3 a cup!   PS- There is a Starbucks right next store to save you if need be.  Good luck folks...
