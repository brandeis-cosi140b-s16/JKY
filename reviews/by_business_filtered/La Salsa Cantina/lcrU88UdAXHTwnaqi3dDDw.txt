We choose to come here after seeing a breakfast sign. Yum! The had the best price on breakfast the entire trip. I can't eat a buffet and feel it was worth it so, this place is my new top choice. 

WAY TO GO ON THE FRENCH TOAST!
 Great job on the hubby's steak burrito!!
Grandma loved the 99 cents bloody Mary's.

Will be back.
