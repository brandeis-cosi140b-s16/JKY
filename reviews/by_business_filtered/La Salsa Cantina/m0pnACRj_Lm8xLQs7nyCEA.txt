As a local I was disapointed with this restaurant.  Since I am not yet 21, the hostess told us we could not sit at the tables that were by their bar, which is a reasonable rule for most restaurants; however these tables were no where near the bar. They were closer to the public walking around than they were to the bar.  So they put us at a table in a dark corner (that was next to another bar I might add). So I can't be next to their bar, but it's okay if I'm sitting right next to another one.  
The service and the food was subpar. The waitress had a difficult time understanding us so we had to repeat ourselves a lot. And since the La Salsa Cantina is on the strip it wasn't unexpected that the food was extremely overpriced.  If I was a Vegas tourist and was prepared to overpay a meal,  I would have wanted the food to be of a better quality.
