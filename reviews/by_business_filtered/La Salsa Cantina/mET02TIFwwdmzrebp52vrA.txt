Love the fact that there is no cover, and the music is the kind of music I dig: reggaeton, bachata, cumbia, salsa, and punta.

The dance floor is very small though! A lot of people were dancing and I couldn't even get my groove on because of the constant bumping into people.  :-/

-2 stars for the small dance floor!
