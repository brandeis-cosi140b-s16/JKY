With the restaurant more than half empty during dinner service, I would expect service to be exceptionally faster. After we were seated, we waited for the wait staff to offer us a drink (which is instantaneous in most restaurants) or ask what we'd like to eat. We got neither after waiting more than 5 minutes. We then left.
