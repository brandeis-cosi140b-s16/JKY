Skip the food and go straight to the half yard margarita to-go. When in Vegas you HAVE to take advantage of the opportunity to enjoy your alcoholic beverage on the street. They're $17.50-19.50 depending on what you choose, but trust me you are MORE than getting your money's worth.

I prefer mine on the rocks with salt. That way I can see (and be amazed) at how much alcohol they're putting in. And, somewhat less importantly, I find the frozen ones too sweet.
