First lets start with late night entry... We had a party of 9 and one of us was wearing shorts.  They absolutely refused to let us in because of that. There was like 2-3 people in there that walked out with shorts right when they were telling us that shorts weren't allowed. Uhhh really? When we brought it to their attention, all the "supervisor" said was "They were here before I got here." One of them even had sandals on! We decided to just split up and a few of us stayed in there, only reason was really because my girlfriend likes the enchiladas from there and because we just didn't want to walk anymore. That was just the entrance, didn't get much better after that. 

We were given our table fairly quick and our order was taken shortly after. I believe I had a burrito but it was not that great. If you go in large parties be aware that there is a gratuity charge AND a "service charge?" Yeah go figure, looked more like a phone bill to me. 

I would've given them 1 star but my girlfriend really likes going for the enchiladas, I like the music they play, we were sat promptly, and there was some short guy dressed like Michael Jackson that made me laugh lol. All in all, decent place but there's definitely room for improvement and dress code consistency.
