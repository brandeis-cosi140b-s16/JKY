We ate here every day in Vegas for breakfast. I wish I could take the mexican coffee to work every day lol! The 4.25 breakfast is heaven sent! It's over at noon but the staff wi give it to you if you sit down at 11:57! The meal comes with bacon potatoes, 2 eggs  and tortillas or toast. The toast melts in your mouth! The bacon is flavorful and crispy! You can ask for additional bacon. Three specials is 13.00! Can't beat that with a stick!
