Out celebrating our friends 1 year wedding anniversary, I wanted a margarita. After checking out a few places we settled on this place. We stood forever at the hostess stand waiting to be seated. Finally a girl came over and took us to a table and gave us menus. Priced at $12.50 (regularly priced $17.50 when not on special) I ordered a strawberry "Margarita-by-the-Yard" and I couldn't taste any alcohol at all. Our friends couldn't taste any in theirs either, so we asked our server when she finally came back around if we could buy some shots to add to it. She said they are $1 per shot so I ordered 2 shots to add to mine. The margarita seemed like it was mostly ice and I just didn't care for it.

I figured with salsa being in the name of this place that we would get the standard complimentary chips and salsa, but nope! Chips and salsa cost here!
