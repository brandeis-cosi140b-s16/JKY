First of all, the Margaritas are some of the best on the strip and more potent than they taste.  They will add as much booze as you want (for an additional charge, of course) and will make those yard long margaritas on the rocks if you ask really nice.  Pro Tip: Don't race your friends to see who can drink their yard long first or you'll be siting out side next to gold painted street performer for a solid 15 minutes trying to get your bearings.  Now, the food (I ordered the Mexican Pizza) was AMAZING....granted I was wasted by the time it came due to said 'rita race, so very little wouldn't have been delicious at that point.  

Some might take issue with spending $20-35 on a yard long anything, especially in Vegas where the booze is "supposed" to flow freely, but if you think you're drinking for free when you plunk $60+ into a machine while you wait 30 minutes for the waitress to brink you your watered down well drink,  this becomes the steal of the century.
