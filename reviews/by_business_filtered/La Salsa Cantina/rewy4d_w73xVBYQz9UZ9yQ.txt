Love this place! I can't believe the bad reviews! Spend my weekend in Vegas and was here both nights for the dancing. I first went to LAX and it was so crowded, nowhere to dance! What's the point? So, we came here and had a BLAST!!! Next night we went to HAZE at Aria, and it was SUCH a disappointment, so we came here, again. It was so much fun! Staff is friendly, people are friendly. We didn't have the food so I can't comment on that, we just came to dance and it was SO MUCH FUN! I was probably the only non-Latin in there but nobody cared! It was a BLAST!!!

P.S. - they had water bottles for a dollar... A DOLLAR!!! This is unheard of at the strip. I was a happy camper since I don't drink!
