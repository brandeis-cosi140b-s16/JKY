The only reason I am giving it 1 star is because of the service. Food is definitely overpriced at about $20 plate. Drinks are fairly overpriced averaging about $15 a pop (I am factoring in this is La Salsa and not some high end club). Food tasted like flavorless wannabe Mexican food. Don't go there unless you have to. It's not like your traditional La Salsa, it's the red headed step child that no one wants.
