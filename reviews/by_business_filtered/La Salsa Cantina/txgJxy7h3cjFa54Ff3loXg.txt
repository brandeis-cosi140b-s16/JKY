My wife and I ate there Dec 12th 2011.  I travel almost everyweek and might have some high expectations, but this place let me down on several things.  First was they were not busy, but tried to put us almost in the kitchen.  Then when they moved us they put us into a run down bench that actually had cracked plastic and a tilted table..but were wer hungry.  Our server was slow, she was close to rude and spent more time visting with other workers than her customers.  Ok...not a great story but it didnt get better. The food was down right bad. I had a normal Faita and it was just bad.  The worst was the Ticket Stub place recommended it so I bought a discount coupon.  Stay clear of this place.
