We came here solely for their 3.95 breakfast special - needed a quick, convenient meal before hitting the road haha.  In terms of their breakfast special, it definitely does the job. You get 2 eggs, any way, some potatoes, a choice of meat, and 2 tortillas.  Nothing fancy, but it was a pretty straightforward, filling breakfast, not much to complain about. For a little extra kick, you can also get .99 bloody marys - yeah, small in size, but only 0.99, so what do you expect?  I'd say a pretty solid breakfast special that I'd come back for if I'm simply looking for something cheap, filling, and convenient.  Also, their breakfast special lasts until noon!  Which is pretty late for usual breakfast specials (but admittedly pretty early to be awake on the strip ;)
