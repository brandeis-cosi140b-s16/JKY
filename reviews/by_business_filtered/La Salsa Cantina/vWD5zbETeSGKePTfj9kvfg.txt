I came here because I was craving mexican food and I was already in Planet Hollywood. This was the closest thing. 

Regular chain mexican food. Not very authentic. Burritos are large portioned and served with a side of rice and beans. I enjoyed it only because my hunger got the best of me. Otherwise, I most likely won't be back.
