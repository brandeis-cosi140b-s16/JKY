They are so easy-going here that it's easy to say yes when they casually ask if you want your margarita made with Patron. But hey, it's Vegas!

We got the chips and guac, and the guac was most excellent. I got a burrito, which was standard mexican fare. It was good, but not great. The restaurant was also almost a side-note and relatively hard to find in the Forums. They were pretty tiny and the decor left some to be desired.

Service was quick and happy and it's hard to complain about that. I think every single person who worked there came by to check on us while we were sitting there.
