We were looking for a place to have breakfast and we ran into this place .. It was absolutely amazing, food was delicious and our server was lulu , she was very attentive with us , I will go back to this restaurant next time in Vegas I didn't get a chance to try their margaritas . If you go here you going to be happy with the food , the service and your pocket :)
