Awful experience every time I come here. I asked for chips & salsa & was ignored. Then upon other customers & myself trying to communicate with the bartender she completely gave me an attitude. Then I asked for no salt on my margarita & she put salt on it. She tried to take her mistakes & blame it on others. When I asked for chips & salsa AGAIN. She said, "you know you have to pay for it!" I will make sure to let everyone know not to go there.  If you want good mexican food go across the street to Aria!
