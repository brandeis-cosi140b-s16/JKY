We went there just to get a "Margarita by the Yard."  It costs almost $20.  Nothing too much to complain about, they served it in a souvenir container.  The nice thing was we could held it around on the street during that July hot weather.  If I happened to be there again I think I might get that from Imperial Palace for $15.  Same thing but cheaper.
