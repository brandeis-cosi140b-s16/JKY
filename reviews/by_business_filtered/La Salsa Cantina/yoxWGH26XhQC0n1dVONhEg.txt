For the family, we went to the La Salsa Cantina location located in Planet Hollywood on the main shopping level, Miracle Mile for a quick bite. The restaurant is located in the back of the mall, so it is a little bit of a walk to get back there.  The 3 of us ordered different selections and each were good.  Unlike their other location at near the M&M factory, they charge for chips and salsa.  Overall, the food was affordable and clean.  The service was okay.
