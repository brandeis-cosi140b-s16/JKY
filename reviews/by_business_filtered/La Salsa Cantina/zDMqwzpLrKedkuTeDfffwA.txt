Stopped in here on a tuesday in january for a yard drink. The bartender was awesome, just a really nice and cool genuine chick. She poured us two strong margos in the yard cups. My girlfriend had a blended mango margo and I went for the top shelf on the rocks. We also had an order of nachos. The bill came out to around $55 with a tip. I was not expecting much from this place and it turned out to be a great value. Those yard drinks are prolly like 5-6 regular drinks so for 16-20 bucks its a great deal. One negative would be the hostess who what quite the little prissy b***ch I felt like throwing my yard margo on her. Theres bad apples everywhere.
