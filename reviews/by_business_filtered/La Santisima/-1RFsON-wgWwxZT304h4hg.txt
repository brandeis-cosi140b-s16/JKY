Excellent !!! looked up the place before our trip to Colorado, decided to stop in Phoenix for dinner.  We had a 30 min wait, but it was so well worth it, the food was amazing!!.. the owner was very kind and started us on drinks while we waited for a table.  The staff is very courteous, the food is phenomenal.. the price is a little up there, but then again it's not your local Taco shop, this is definitely gourmet tacos at it's best.  I loved their Shrimp tacos!! and of course their cochinita pibil quezadillas were lickity good.. everything on the menu looks very very good.
