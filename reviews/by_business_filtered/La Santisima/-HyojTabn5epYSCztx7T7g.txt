So good! So good. A must try taco shop if you are in Phoenix. I ordered 3 different tacos and was able to turn them into 6 since they put a lot of fillings and 2 corn tortillas. The mole is so delish and you gotta order this taco. I ordered the steak and it was good too, but my fave...the carnitas taco. The pork is so tender and flavorful! I also love all the salsas! I just wish they didn't run out of some of them...there were so many to choose from it was hard to decide what to try so I relied an a regular to steer me in the right direction. The margarita was ok, but I would definitely go back for the mole and the carnitas!
