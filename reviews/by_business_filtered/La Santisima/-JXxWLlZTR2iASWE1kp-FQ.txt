Everything here is exceptional. Full bar with a decent beer selection of domestics and Mexican. Huge salsa bar. My favorite was the strawberry salsa. The salsa Mexicana was good, a little on the spicy side for me but I couldn't stop eat it!

I had the white pacific fish tacos with rice and beans.  The tacos were delicious with lightly fried fish, cabbage, cilantro salsa, and a delicious creamy sauce.  Everything was so good, I wish I leaved in the area or could take this restaurant home with me so I could try everything on the menu!

We arrived around 1130am on a Friday and around noon the place was packed, and it's a small place with limited seating.  Definitely worth it.
