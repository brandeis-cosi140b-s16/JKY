Lunch at the bar on Sunday.

Best Salsa: Chipotle and Tomatillo - the traditional ones are the best. I also liked the cabbage and jicama varieties. Peanut, pecan and others were more like dressing than salsa. Pico was tasty too.

Tacos: Chicken Mole was great, sauce was not spicy, but this taco sticks to your ribs.
              Carne Asada - had fatty pieces and chunks. Picked through this one.

Beans/Rice - Did enjoy the beans, free chips and rice wasn't really Mexican, but more white with veggies. 

Horchata - Glorious beverage here. First horchata I had to use a spoon for to get all the fruit and nuts out from the murky cinnamon depths.

Price: Two tacos platter for almost $10. wanted crispy shells, but only corn here. Horchata is 4 bucks so price can be $20 for one person almost.
