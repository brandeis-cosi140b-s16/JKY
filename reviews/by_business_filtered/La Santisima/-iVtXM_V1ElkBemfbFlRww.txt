This place deserves the hype. I asked the waitress to surprise me with with a couple tacos. I was impressed by the three she ordered for me, but the special shark taco was unreal. It was the best taco I have ever had the pleasure to consume. This is a wonderfully unique eatery. I would highly suggest dining here.
