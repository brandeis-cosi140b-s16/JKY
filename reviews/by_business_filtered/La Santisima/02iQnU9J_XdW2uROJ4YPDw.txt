A huge selection of gourmet and street tacos.  The variety of fish options appeared to be a huge hit with other options, but we particularly enjoyed the cochinita and carne asada tacos. Decent prices, and fun to try the different salsas from their large salsa stand. Beware it gets quite busy during Saturday lunch, and the seating is a small area. Prepare for a short wait during peak hours or go during off hours. We will probably be back again.
