They claimed to have mighty good horchata!!
The Horchata was indeed great!! :)
 I liked It! 
But not the best in my opinion, no place like Mexico could ever offer amazing Horchata to me thus far, nothing like the one's you'll find at street taco stands late at night in places like Cuernavaca, Chihuahua, Mexico city and or Acapulco! 
_ Anyways, coming back to La Condesa this place is super tiny, and should consider expanding to make it a bit more comfy, just my opinion! 
The taco platter I had included the Carne Asada , Pacific Fish and Cochinita Pibil taco. All three were okay, and just okay. The rice and bean were also A-ok, nothing too extravagant nor elaborate. I really think this taco shop could do better, they have the potential to, like their amazing salsa bar is a huge kudos to consider, and the staff too so you got that down Condesa, Keep up the good work and plenty of room for improvement if you care to know!
