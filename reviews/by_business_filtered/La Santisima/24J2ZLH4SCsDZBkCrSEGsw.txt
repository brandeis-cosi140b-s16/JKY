I LOVE La Condesa.  What more do I need to say? The salsa bar is amazing! I really like their carne asada.  They do but beans in the burrito, which, at first I wasn't sure how I'd feel about it, but after a couple, I really like it.  I've had the pork and shrimp tacos also.  The quality is always top notch.  I did the artwork too!  Two negatives...The music can sometimes be loud, and sometimes they are REALLY packed and parking is a bit tough to find.  Other than that, I HIGHLY recommend!
