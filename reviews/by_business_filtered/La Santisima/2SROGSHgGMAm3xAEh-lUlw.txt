My mom and I were referred to go to this place for some tacos and so when she was visiting me in Phoenix, we finally went to check it out! We pulled up and were very skeptical by the look of the outside, but we were greeted right away to pick a table. We both got the Cabo Shrimp Taco and a steak taco and it had this amazing fried cheese in it. And the salsa bar was amazing. I think the Cilantro salsa was my favorite. The beans and rice were also to die for. The shrimp in my taco were so delicious. I couldn't get over how amazing this place was. We happened to go for happy hour and got $5 Grapefruit margaritas as well. BEST MEXICAN FOOD EVER. I wish there was one in California. 

P.S- Everyone around us ordered a quesadilla because they are stuffed inside their homemade tortillas and deep fried. Can't wait to go back and try these. 

The service was awesome, too!
