Finding someone who can make better mole than I can deserves 4 stars.  My absolute favorite is the chicken mole burrito.  The chickens mole burrito is just that- loaded with lots of shredded chicken, minimal rice in a flour tortilla.  The burros are gigantic and the drinks are gigantic.  I cannot comment on any other items as I am extremely satisfied with the mole and don't venture far from it.  I think you can order chicken mole tacos but I am unsure.  The salsa bar is tasty, too.  

Apparently there is a Happy Hour on weekdays.  I noticed Tequila behind the bar but didn't see any beer and am unaware of what the Happy Hour entails.
