This little Phoenix gem delivers everything you want from fine Mexican dining without all the touristy bullshit. The exterior has classic Dia De Las Muertas tile work and the interior is rustic, intimate and clean. The menus and prices are simple and excellent and the food is phenomenal.

The salsa bar is one of the best I have ever experienced. At least 12 different salsas. All different and all excellent, and I believe, made on the premises. We had, Pecan, Peanut Butter, 7 Chili, Mexicano, Pico de Gallo, and Cilantro salsa. If variety is the spice of life, what is a variety of spices?

The absolute, takes the cake reason for 5 stars is the Horchata! I am a fan of Horchata. I have never had Horchata like this! 32 ounces with what must have been muddled strawberries and apples and fresh ground cinnamon. So good, so good.
