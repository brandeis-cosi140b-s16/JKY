I saw the good reviews on here and decided to try it today. I was not a fan of the food at all. I left hungry because I decided not to eat my street tacos, they were still bleeding from the meat. My 3 year old loved his quesadilla though. It can be that I'm use to more authentic mexican food. I would have rather stuck with my instinct and went to salsita or El Taquito. This food is for people who has never tasted good mexican food. I wouldn't recommend this place to a hungery latino. Also its not kid friendly. Very very small inside. Everyone that left didn't look happy for some reason.
