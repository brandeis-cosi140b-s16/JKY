Small joint, delicious food. You must try the Mole Quesadilla, I've never had anything like it, and it was the best thing I have ever eaten, maybe in my life! We thought about ordering a couple to take home, but we didn't (but we should have!!). We also tried 4 of their tacos, you can't go wrong with any choice. On the way out, we ordered the horchata and it was great. Lots of cinnamon, just sweet enough, good for a dessert. There are some fruit bits in there, and I am usually not a fan of stuff flying up the straw like that, but it was fine. There is also a large salsa bar, many varieties to choose from. I'm looking forward to going back to this place.
