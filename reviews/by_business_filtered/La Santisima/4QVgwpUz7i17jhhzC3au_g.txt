This place is delicious we got tacos and a burrito both came with plenty of meat and choice of rice and beans. The salsa bar is amazing so much to choose from and the staff is super friendly. This place is also family friendly which is a plus since it's very difficult to go out with a baby. Will definitely be returning.
