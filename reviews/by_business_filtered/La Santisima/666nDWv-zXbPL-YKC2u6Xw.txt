La Condessa is muy Bueno in many ways. The tacos are always fresh, from shark to carne asada you really can't go wrong. (Although I heard it is bad karma to eat shark).

They carry Mexican beers that I have never heard of before, last time I had an Estrella and it was delicious. They have a full bar with tons of exotic tequilas and they are generous on the pours.

The servers are attentive and sweet and the set up is old style cool. 

What really keeps me coming back is the salsa bar (oh the salsa bar)! Pecan salsa, 7 pepper, chipotle, sesame... They carry over a dozen and you will have to come many times to experience the perfect salsa/taco combination. It is worth every delectable trip!
