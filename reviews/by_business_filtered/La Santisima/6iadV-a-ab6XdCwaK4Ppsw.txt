It is a little confusing when you walk in, but you do seat yourself and a server comes over with menus and chips. Help yourself to the wide variety (about 20) of salsas @ the salsa bar and your server will come take your order. I got the cochinita pibil tacos and my husbannd got the carne asada tacos...we got the combo plates with rice and beans, 2 tacos for $6.99. I don't know where that person has been eating who said this was expensive...the plates (baskets) come looking a little plain, but you have all those salsas to add to your tacos which makes it fun and filling! Rice and beans quantity was a little small for my husband, but just right for me.
The carne asada tacos were good, but the cochinta pibil were amazing! I love the artwork and the tables and chairs...it's a great place! Plastic cutlery is a turn off, but who cares when the food is so good. I like La Condesa more than America's! *ducking behind the sofa*
