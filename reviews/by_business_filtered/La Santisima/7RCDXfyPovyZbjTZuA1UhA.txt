Stopped in for lunch, the incredibly LARGE parking spaces in a small amount of space leads me to believe this place was either small inside or has horrible drivers for customers, once i entered i assume now it is the latter, a spacious dining room, bar, and outdoor seating available.

First off i ordered a horchata, which was the second best i have ever had, they put a good variety of fruits in there that perfectly complemented the flavor.. 

I then ordered some street tacos, and before they came out i walked up to the Salsa Bar.. oh man, i need more than just a spoon for this place, they have every flavor you would expect, and an delicious peanut salsa.. it was soo tasty i don't even know if the tacos themselves were any good, guess i gotta go back!
