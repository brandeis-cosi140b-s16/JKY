Is this real? Are they serious with this? The ambiance was small, cozy, and art was hung on the wall that was really very good. Unbelievable service and food. All the salsas at the bar were stellar and my shark tacos were dynamite. I'm kind of a sucker for rice and beans and I think it's hard to mess up but I've still had some awful rice and beans at some other spots. Luckily, this place had some of the best I've had in a while. The prices were great, helped by a wonderful happy hour. I will be coming back for more because everyone loves tacos and La Santisima does tacos well.
