I couldn't put off my ravenous feelings anymore after leaving work the other night and pulled over at La Condesa. I had been meaning to try it for quite some time. So what if I was a party of one. Satiation is more important than social appearances. The place is in a mildly sketchy area next to a little market that sells pinatas and a few groceries. To me, this actually lended the place some street cred. Anyway, I like how the restaurant's interior has none of the feeling of a Baja Fresh or Chipotle yet the prices are pretty reasonable. The dining room doesn't look like it can fit too many people so I'm wondering what it's like on weekends. The bathrooms were reasonably clean and I got a kick out of the whole lucha libre motif in the bano for the chicas. 

I had a pork mole burro with the mole made with chocolate and nuts. Muy sabrosos but the meat was a tad salty or too kicky, not sure if it was the tanginess or salt that had me asking for more water. But I think that is more a matter of personal taste buds, not the reflection on the cooking. I found the meat quite tender. And I felt like a wimp only being able to eat half the burro. Next time, I will probably do the two-taco deal. There was only one gal doing all the bills and service. She was quite nice. 

But what will make me come back again is their awesome salsa buffet. It makes the salsa trays at chain restaurants look like plainer, less adventurous salsitas. I had the strawberry salsa (sweet yet salty), jicama, cilantro (my favorite but found if you have too much too soon, you'll feel lit) and peanut. It got to the point where I had to tell myself "no more chips" so I simply sucked the salsa off a chip like it was a spoon. Yup, it reduced me to that. Anyway, I do need to go back and get some more ideas of the food. But for now, I'm a fan.
