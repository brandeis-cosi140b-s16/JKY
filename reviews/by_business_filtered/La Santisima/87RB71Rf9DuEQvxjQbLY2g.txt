It's been almost 11 hours and darn it if I'm not still thinking about that mahimahi burrito. So fresh. So tasty with the various salsas. So awesome that it's just down the street and I can come here whenever I want and spend WAY too much time choosing the salsas I think would best compliment my meal. It just don't get much better than La Condesa, and that's coming from me, and me has a pretty serious taco/burrito issue, as in I always want them and I always want them.
