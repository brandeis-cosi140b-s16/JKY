Almost missed this place, because Yelp still shows no alcohol, and a mexican meal without a beer or margarita is not complete.  Glad I went!  We split the shrimp, veggie and pork tacos.  This is the only place where I would consider ordering a veggie taco over the meat ones.  The grilled vegetables were packed with flavor, and the cheese was perfect.  Add an awesome salsa bar and mexican beer, and you have the perfect meal for before or after the ball game.  I would have given 5 stars, but the pork tacos didn't wow me.  Don't get me wrong, they were good - but just above average.
