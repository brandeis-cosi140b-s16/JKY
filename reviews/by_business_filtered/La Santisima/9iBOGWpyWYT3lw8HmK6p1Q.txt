I tried both the machaca and shredded chicken tacos - barely edible!  The shredded cabbage looked to be a week old on the overcooked beef, which did not really qualify as machaca.  The shredded chicken was swimming in a tasteless red sauce. 

The combo platter promises rice & beans - more like thimble-fuls of white rice and bean soup.

I will say that their chips and salsa bar was great, but the rest was awful!
