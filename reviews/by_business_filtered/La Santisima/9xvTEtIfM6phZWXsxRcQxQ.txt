i reallllly need to come here more often. this is definitely a little gem of a mexican restaurant that fires on all cylinders. 

the restaurant itself is adorable-i love all the awesome dia de los muertos paintings on the walls and the unique decor. while it isn't in the greatest neighborhood, you'd have no idea once you walked inside.  

the salsa bar! oh my god, i don't even know where to start with how amazing this thing is.  i am a huge salsa fan (wouldn't mind eating it with every meal, or as a meal, whatever) and i've never known of a restaurant to have so many options! i could literally come here and only eat chips and salsa for hours and never get bored because of all the choices! 

horchata! they put an interesting spin on the horchata by adding pecans and fresh fruit to it.  i thought this might be weird since i've never had it that way, but it was totally delicious and refreshing.  

food! the menu is packed with delicious items that have some unbelievable flavors.  i recommend the carne asada burrito or the bullet (bean and cheese).  

i'll be coming back soon!
