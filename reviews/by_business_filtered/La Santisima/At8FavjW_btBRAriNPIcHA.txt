I like this place... there are a lot of interesting salsas to taste and the people were very friendly. However, the meat taco I had (it was recommended) was dry and not very flavorful. The vegetarian one was pretty great though- both could have used more spice. All in all- the location is cool and small- I like that it is unique for Phoenix, and I would definitely come back if I was in the area- I just wish their food was a little more spicy.
