Wow this place deserves the great reviews, I'm from out of town and was visiting this week. La Condesa is close to the airport so allow yourself an extra hour and go try it. 

I had the shark taco and the cochonita pork taco. Excellent! The pork had a strong tangy flavor to it, the pickled onions on top kind of had a strange taste. The shark was beer battered and very tender crispy on the outside. Great tastes on both. 

The salsa bar is impressive with done really unique styles of salsa, some even have pecan flavor in them! What?

I also had a Horchata which is a sweet rice milk, you can get it plain or with pecans and fruit, impressive! But if you get the one with the pecans in it don't try to drink it with a straw!

I wish we had a place as great as this where I live, I'd eat there weekly. Lots of creative items.
