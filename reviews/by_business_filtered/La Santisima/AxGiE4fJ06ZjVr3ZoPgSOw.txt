Order at the counter and decided to try lots. Street tacos were good but not the best I've had. Quesadilla with shrimp and chilies was amazing. Chips and all the salsas were great and the guacamole with cranberries was also very good and a nice change. Margarita was very good. Downside was the paper lined baskets and plastic utensils for eating. I'd go back but didn't leave raving like so many others.
