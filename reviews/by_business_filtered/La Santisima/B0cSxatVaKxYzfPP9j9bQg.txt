Huge and delicious Horchata!
Strawberry salsa!
Shrimp taco!

Those are what I had at my first visit. First it a little bit hard to find the place because we did not know exactly where this place is located at. Once we stepped inside, the artwork on the wall blew us away. 

We started off with the chips and 10 different kinds of Salsa. This is the incredible ideas since none of us love the same kinds of Salsa. I loved Strawberry one. My husband loved 7 chilies. Others also love different kinds, such as green chili and jicama.

Then our meals arrived shortly after. A basket full of tacos, rice and bean. They are all delicious and I have never had the shrimp tacos this good before.

I am glad that La Condesa is not to far from where we live. It is our new spot to go get some delicious food.
