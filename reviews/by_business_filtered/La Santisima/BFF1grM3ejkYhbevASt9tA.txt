The food is wonderful! We love the salsa bar. I especially like the strawberry salsa. The mole is the best I've had out side of Mexico City. The carne asada is delicious. The burritos and quesadillas are HUGE. The three tacos plates are plenty. 
 The service is slow at lunch. If you know that going in, it's okay. You'll probably have to wave down the one hostess and reminder her of your drink orders. Dinner is better. That's the only reason for 4 stars. We recommend this place.
