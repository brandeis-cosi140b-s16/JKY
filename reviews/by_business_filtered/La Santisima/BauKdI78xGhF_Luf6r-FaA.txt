This restaurant is schizophrenic.  The front of the house is a nightmare: incredibly slow, somewhat aloof service, small plastic cups of water that don't get refilled, restroom issues (the men's was closed and the women's was dirty which is unacceptable at all public establishments but especially in a restaurant).  When we sat down there were chips on the table but no napkins; those didn't arrive until dinner so I went into the restroom and grabbed some paper towels.  Speaking of salsa, the restaurant has a salsa bar with at least a dozen different types to choose from -- great idea in theory, but unfortunately about half of the containers were empty and they were not refilled the entire time we were there.  

However...I gave this place 3 stars because the food is indeed delicious.  My husband and I ended up ordering the same thing -- a "street taco" plate with 3 different tacos, rice, and beans.  The al pastor, chicken mole, and pork pibil tacos are fabulous, with complex flavors that explode in your mouth. The food is high quality, fresh, and incredibly tasty. I would have liked to tell you about the guacamole, but at 8:00 p.m. they were out of it.

We noticed that they offer take out service and I would recommend that as the sole way to get food from La Santisima.  In addition to the lousy, indifferent service the restaurant is tiny, crowded, and doesn't have much atmosphere.  They really should expand to a larger space where they can better meet the demand that's been generated from all the favorable press and their admittedly delicious Mexican fare.
