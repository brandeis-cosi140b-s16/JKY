WOW!!!!  Arizona already has the best Mexican food around, but this place is truly a gem.  All the sauces are homemade and present a wide spectrum of flavors.  My favorite unique items from the salsa bar were the peanut salsa (spicy, most likely has habaneros in it), pecan salsa (similar but very mild with interesting flavor), strawberry salsa, and jicama salsa.  Everything was incredibly fresh.  After sampling everything from our group, I would recommend getting one of their mole dishes (the mole is stellar) or the mahi mahi fish tacos.  Also, their house made guacamole was amazing; very unique and chunky with lots of different veggies in it.  I will be back again and again.
