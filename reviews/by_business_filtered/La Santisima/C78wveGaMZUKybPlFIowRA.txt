Just really good salsa's and Tacos!!  Just had a late lunch with the wife...had the fish tacos plate and the pork tacos plate accompanied by housemade horchata...both tacos were really good...especially liked the salsa to accompany the pork tacos.  The beans and rice were good. The horchata had fresh strawberries and nuts in it, tasted like they had  just made it!   Salsa bar has a really good selection..especially like the avacado and the tomato chipotle.  Will be back for more and try their queso's or a burrito.
