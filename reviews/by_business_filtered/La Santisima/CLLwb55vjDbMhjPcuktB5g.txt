La Condesa is an amazing little spot that has more than food, but charm as well. I really enjoyed the way that the restaurant was decorated; it definitely creates its own vibe, and it's not painted with a lot of loud colors (there are a ton of pictures of the decor if you look at the pictures). It's very classy to say the least.

The salsa bar is the first thing that I have to mention. It was overflowing with variety and flavor. Every time that I thought I'd found one that I liked, I tried another and pushed the previous aside. My girlfriend and I managed to polish of two baskets of chips without a problem or remorse because we had to try every salsa. The tamatillo and cilantro were two of my favorites in the mix. 

We also ordered the Mayan Conchinita Pibil tacos and the Aztec Tinga tacos. I'm usually hesitant about chicken on tacos because I usually always have bad experiences, but not here! The tinga taco was great. The meat was tender and well marinated - I could taste the sauce in every bite. The conchinita though is what really won me over. The pork was so good! Imagine the tenderness and juiciness or your favorite BBQ pork sandwich, but replace the flavor with a bevy of delicious Mexican spices and we'll pretty much be on the same level.

I'm pretty baffled that I didn't see a lot of my Yelp friends raving about this place. As a result, I will send this review out to you all (go try it =) ). This is a great little place that isn't pricey yet brings great flavor. The next time I got there I will be getting a quesa, no question, and hopefully I will be going back very soon.
