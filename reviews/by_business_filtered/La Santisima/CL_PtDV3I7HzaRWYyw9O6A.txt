Very good. But packed during lunch. Messy tables are unsightly, and the wait is long.
The food is awesome, though my order wasn't entirely correct, I ordered shrimp mole taco's and received chicken. Though was charged for shrimp (I think).

Service is friendly, and being such a small place I think they try very hard to deal with the lunch rush, but seem slightly understaffed.

I will go back as they have a great and varied menu and an awesome salsa bar. I just would probably wait until a non-peak time.
