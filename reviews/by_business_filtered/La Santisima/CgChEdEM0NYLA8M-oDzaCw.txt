I love the artwork.  Its a tiny little restaurant crammed with a bunch of little tables and chairs.  You go up to order at the counter, there's a salsa bar in the corner with a LOT of different salsas (most are not that great).  They do bring you the food and you do get a basket of chips on the house.  The tacos are pretty heft - about 3 bucks each.  They are "Gourmet tacos" after all..  

All in all, its kind of uncomfortable service/restaurant wise (self serve) but the tacos are very good and you do get chips and a variety of salsas.  Not the most friendly staff and the cost is kind of high for a place like this but its pretty dang good.  Get it to go if you don't mind packing a bunch of salsa cups.
