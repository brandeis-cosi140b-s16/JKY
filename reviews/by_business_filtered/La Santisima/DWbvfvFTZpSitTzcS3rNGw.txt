Just had lunch there and as for being a major taco fan i have had better(Los Angeles Tacos still rule) , but overall its pretty good compare to other places near by. I had the Argentine Style which thats were my dad is from.. was not as great the meat needed seasoning and the chimichuri was bland , not to mention a little cheap on putting the sauce on , so i had to ask for more. But the one that got me was the shark tacos , now thats a taco ! Just wish the would recomend the sauces/ salsa to put on it that would help bring out more flavor. They have so many salsas I WANTED TO TRY ALL OF THEM !  Great place for a good lunch and awsome concept ! if you have'nt tried it , you must go once its a fine meal for $10. Happy hour prices seem to be reasonable also. I will be back again i must say and will ask more questions about the sauces.
