First off, the service was lacking. Our waitress didn't seem very attentive or happy towards us. She could have checked on us every once in a while...and maybe smile? 

HOWEVER, the food was delicious (which is why I had to give a least four stars). We ordered their carne asada tacos and they didn't disappoint. Their salsa bar has a lot of choices and yes, the horchata is good.
