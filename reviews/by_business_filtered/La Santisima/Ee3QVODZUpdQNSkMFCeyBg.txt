This place is ridiculous. No complaints here. THE most interesting salsa bar I have ever seen with tradition styles such as chipotle and tomatillo alongside crazy inventions like sesame and peanut. All delicious. So far I've had the shark fish tacos, shrimp tacos, and carne asada burro. My fav is the shrimp tacos but all were amazing. Also, get a side of the calavasas - yum.
