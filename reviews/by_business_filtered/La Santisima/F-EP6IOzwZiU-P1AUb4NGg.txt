4 star food with 0 star service so I compromised. We walked in and questioned if anyone even worked there. We waited about 5 minutes before I had to walk over to the bartender and ask if it was self seating. I was told that they have to clear the tables which were full and that's why we weren't sitting yet. Thanks... I guess? So we finally sit and its 15 minutes before were asked what we want to drink and are given menus. About 10 minutes later the bar tender walks up and says "I'm not your waiter but I'll help you" the girl that was supposed to be our waiter was in her own world staring at the POS system like she was having problems creating people checks, but I think she just didn't want to face all the mad diners looking impatient around me. People that walked in 15-20 minutes after me are already getting Togo boxes and pretty much the same issue was present with the table next to us. We came in five minutes after him yet finished eating before he received his food. There was no order or massive issues in the kitchen or both. Even a walk up Togo order was in and out quickly, but the man was complaining about receiving the wrong food. The waitress seemed to argue back with customers or give excuses. It was very unacceptable customer service wise. I will never go back or recommend this place even though the food was good. Near the end of the meal we were told the food was great (which it was) but the service was horrible (also true) by a staff member. Why can't you fix it if you know it's wrong? If you order take out I would suggest the street tacos as they are all very good. If the restaurant isn't busy I'm sure the service doesn't struggle (as I've experienced the first time I went in) but when I returned on a date to careless and horrible service I know it's not worth my time to return.
