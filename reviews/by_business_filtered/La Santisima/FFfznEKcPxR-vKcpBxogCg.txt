My husband and I came here for a late lunch/early dinner today (Sunday). It's pretty small and kind of feels like you're at a friends house which is a nice change of pace. 

Pros:
The food was GREAT. I had a veggie quesadilla but it was more like a Mexican calzone- I had to eat it with a fork. Seriously so much flavor and it was big enough to eat half and save for later but I'm a bad ass and ate almost all of it because that's how I roll.

My husband (the picky one) had a carne Asada burrito- just steak, beans and cheese plus he added sour cream. Two bites in we were already making plans to come back.

There were plenty of vegetarian and vegan options so I'm excited to go back and try something different next time!

They have a huge salsa bar but half of the salsas were missing descriptions so it was kind of a guessing game.

The horchata was huge and came with fresh fruit, nuts and cinnamon on top. It was good but not as thick as expected (I'm just a white girl from Kansas so I'm not an expert).

Cons:
Parking can be a pain- I tried to come on a Saturday night and eventually gave up because I was already in a bad mood.

The chips were nothing special and salt would not stay on! They were free though so not holding that against them. 

From the one $, I expected the prices to be cheaper. I wasn't even sure if there would be waiter service. For a burrito, quesadilla, horchata and two negra models (on special) it came to $32 and change plus tip.


Overall, we were very satisfied and will definitely be back.
