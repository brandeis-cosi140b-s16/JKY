Tacos are yum! Went a couple of times and ordered between shark, beer battered shrimp and white fish. Each bite... never disappointed. My daughter ordered the a pork burro that had pinnapple.... wow! Service is slow at times but the food and drinks more than make up for it. Definitely would visit again and wait longer if needed.
