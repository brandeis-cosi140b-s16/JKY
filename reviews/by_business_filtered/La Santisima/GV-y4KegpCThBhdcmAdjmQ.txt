We stopped in on July 4th for lunch. We were told we could sit wherever we wanted. 
The server walked over and asked for a drink order. He later brought chips and let us know they had a salsa bar.

We walked over and they have a big selection. We tried several and they were very tasty. We ordered the fried quesadilla with chicken and beans and rice and an order of guacamole.

The quesadilla was amazing. The chicken was cooked perfectly and it was spicy. The refried beans were the best I have ever had, I just wished the side was bigger than the small cup it was served in.

Everything was excellent, except the service was a little slow. We had to ask for water, silverware and an extra plate a couple of times before it was brought over. But, the food definitely made up for it. Cant wait to go back!
