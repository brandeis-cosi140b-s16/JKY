We live in  Glendale and was excited to go here. Akward small salsa bar. No one greeted us as we came in. Self seating I assume. Who works here? No uniforms.  Nasty standing water by salsa bar. This food better be good! Weird way to get to the salsa bar where you have to twist and turn. No utensils or napkins on tables. You have to ask and wait.  

Positive.  Music and atmosphere is good. The outside patio looks nice. The prices are decent and they look to have a good vision. They have really nice art work but walls need painting.  Seating is good and looks nice wooden tops and cast iron details.

A bit more attention to details and some training will have this a destination for Glendale folks who want authenticity yet do not want to go near the hustle and bustle of Westgate.
