I've been in to La Condesa twice now, both during their happy hour. If you're not aware of their happy hour, familiarize yourself with it. It's pretty damned good ($3 delicious margaritas and $2 chicken tinga or carne asada tacos). 
To start, there is the salsa bar. You get one basket of chips (any more than that you pay for, but my wife and I never eat more than 1 basket-full) and then there are about 16-20 different types of salsa and sauces to try. I've only been brave enough to try about 5 of them, and they've all been decent-really good. My favorite was their tomatillo, and their chipotle didn't really do it for me, but I don't usually enjoy the taste of chipotle peppers in general. Too smokey.
The first time I went I got 2 carne asada tacos and 1 chicken tinga taco. I was disappointed in the carne asada. The meat was dry and topped with dry shredded cabbage. It has a decent flavor, but I had to put salsa on it because it was too dry for me. The chicken tinga, on the other hand, was pretty fabulous. The chicken has a very flavorful sauce on it with good spice, and it's topped with pickled red onion. Fantastic. I also had a plate of rice and beans which were delicious as well. So, the second time I went in, I ordered only chicken tacos. No biggie.
I highly recommend checking this place out. 5 tacos, 2 margaritas, and some rice and beans for $20. Brilliant.
