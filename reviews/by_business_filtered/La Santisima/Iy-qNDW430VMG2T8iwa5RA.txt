I want to say don't go here... Why? Because my wife and I loved it so much on our first visit to La Condesa that we selfishly want to keep it a secret from others.

The food was really good and such a unique sampling of traditional Mexican food dishes, with a twist.  The mole was to die for and the shark tacos were amazing.  The rice is also so tasty and I am not usually a rice kind of guy.  I always forgo ordering the traditional side of rice & beans and initially I did the same on our visit.  But my wife ordered the rice with her meal and after seeing and tasting hers, I actually added that to my order even though we already had received our food.  Everyone has already mentioned the amazing salsa bar so I won't repeat the accolades other than to say what a journey of amazing and unique concoctions, coupled with a few of the standard salsas.  Have to recommend the cilantro salsa if you go and be prepared to order more chips if you want to take the salsa adventure and try them all!!!

Gets pretty packed during the standard rush hour periods but worth the wait and if you plan accordingly (noon or early dinner meal), you can avoid the surge.  Definitely one of my favorite taco places in Phoenix.
