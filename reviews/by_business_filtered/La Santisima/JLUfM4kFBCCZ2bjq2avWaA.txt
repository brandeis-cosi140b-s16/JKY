I am beyond picky when it comes to Mexican food, having grown up in Phoenix. I eat here weekly since I work down the street. The meats are seasoned perfectly, the salsa bar is amazing (try the creamy cilantro), everything including the guac is fresh and the price is right. Waitstaff is very pleasant. Eat here.
