Their salsa bar is the best I've seen in Phoenix... I love them ALL. The Al Pastor burrito is my favorite... The burritos are HUGE here. I've tried almost every type of taco they have here and they are all great. Be prepared for a LONG wait if you're not going at an off time because they only have a few tables but it is seriously worth the wait. The prices here are unbeatable, too. They only have 2 servers usually who double as bartenders so you have to kind of grab their attention sometimes but like I said, there are only a few tables and it's very small inside so they can always see you.
