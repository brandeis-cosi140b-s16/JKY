I had high expectations for La Condesa, but it quickly turned to La Confusión. The three of us went in during the week for a late lunch, salivating at the thought of some tasty tacos. We each ordered a different  taco combo plate, one Aztec Tinga, one Oaxaca Black Mole Chicken,  one Baja Sur Dogfish Shark, and a quesadilla. 
After waiting a significant amount of time, the waitress brought out our quesadilla and one combo plate with one Aztec Tinga taco and one Oaxaca Black Mole Chicken taco. Despite going over our order numerous times with our server and another gentlemen, somehow, what we wanted seemed beyond comprehension. They brought out the Baja Sur Dogfish Shark taco combo plate and, after waiting so long and confusion over our order, we gave up and ate what we had.
The Azteca Tinga was superb. The Oaxaca Black Mole was good. The Baja Sur Dogfish wasn't really any better than your average fish taco. The rice is a white rice that had decent flavor and the same can be said for the flavor of the refried beans.
La Condesa has a great salsa bar, a cozy interior decorated with some great Día de los Muertos art. The staff was nice and friendly, despite the fact our order remained so elusive.
But, after the ordeal with our order and the less than stellar meal, I have to say that La Condesa was an utter disappointment.
