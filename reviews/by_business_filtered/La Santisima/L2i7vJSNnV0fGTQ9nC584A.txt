Very good Al Pastor Burro. It's a little hard to find right away from the road and parking can be a hassle but this is such a great place! Their salsa bar has flavors I've never even thought of that go way beyond green, mild, medium and hot. The meat in my Al Pastor Burro was so juicy and flavorful and the pineapple was actually in there for once! Will absolutely go back with friends next time for sure!
