This place was good!  I ordered 4 tacos to-go: dogfish shark taco, carne asada taco, cochinita pibil taco, and the chicken mole taco.

The shark taco was outstanding, it was not too greasy and topped with cabbage and crema.  The carne asada was some of the best I have had.  It was juicy and seasoned perfectly.  The chicken mole had great flavor and was very rich.  I wasn't too crazy about the cochinita pibil but that is most likely just a matter of taste, nothing was wrong with it.

The salsa bar is very overwhelming with close to one million different selections.  

By the way, parking is a nightmare.
