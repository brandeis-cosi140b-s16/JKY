Terrific little place. The salsa bar is fabulous as others have noted. Everything looked fresh and distinctive. Had the Oaxacan Mole Chicken Queso. It was a large stuffed, perfectly fried stuffed tortilla. The chocolate mole was one of the best Mexican sauces I've had. A little spicy, a little bitter, and very savory. Haunting.
