After almost 2 months of visiting this place, I am still fantasizing about their food!

I trusted my fellow Yelpers when I was taking a road trip with family to Tucson from California and had to stop for dinner on the way.  The Yelpers' raving reviews did not let us down.  When we got there it actually looked closed from the outside especially since the OPEN sign wasn't lit, but we took a chance and opened the door anyway to find that it was indeed open.  

It's a tiny little place with a Dia de los Muertos theme, so it was rich with color and culture.  There was only one server so it was a little slower than we'd like, but in her defense, she was pregnant. 

We each had to order the horchata with pecans and melon because it sounded so good.  The cup it came in was HUMUNGOUS and thank goodness for that because it was awesomely delicious!  We also pigged out on the chips and variety of salsas at the salsa bar.  The salsas are seriously amazing and there were a lot to choose from and taste.  I especially loved the jicama salsa.  

I ordered 2 carne asada tacos with rice and beans.  I was already so full from eating all those chips and horchata and usually it's hard for me to enjoy the taste of something after I'm super full, but the tacos were so good I finished them.  I only tasted a little bit of the rice, which was okay... probably my least favorite thing I ate there, but the beans were very good!  

I was soooo full afterwards and I left with a smile on my face and a new favorite restaurant that I'll have to stop at whenever I'm in Phoenix, which isn't very often, sadly.
