This is soooo much closer to where I live than the original location. Awesome :) I'll be back. The only kink is service and signage. The people are new and are being trained so that should improve. I swear one of the servers also works/worked at the original. This location is just as hard to spot though. Small building, but plenty of parking in back.

I'm a huge fan of the original. Been there multiple times. I was much more impressed by the mole being served here, but not so much the dogfish. It was still good, but seemed to be more batter this time around. Cabo shrimp and marlin are good at both locals.
Two taco plates with rice and beans and two horchatas = $25-30

I finally have enough experience with these restaurants to complain just a little bit.
1. Go back to putting the rice and beans in cups or bowls please. I am begging you! I'm so tired of my tacos getting soggy from my beans spreading across my entire plate. Get plates with ridges and sections or something. Something! Anything!
2. The music IS REALLY LOUD at both locations. I'd like to not have to yell at my dining partners.
3. No pecans in the horchata anymore? Did I miss this menu change or was it just a hiccup at the newbie?
