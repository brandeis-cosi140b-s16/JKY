I love this place. Been here quite a few times now.

I love this place because it stands out among the hordes of Mexican food places serving smothered in cheese and sauce Mexican food. That's not my Mexican food at all. La Santisima is. 

The location is across 59th. Ave from Old Town Glendale so not exactly walkable from Old Town because who wants to cross Grand and risk death by car. There's a small parking lot in the back of the restaurant though. 

It's never very busy when I've been for a weekend lunch or dinner. La Perla next door can be packed with patrons and 20 tables will be empty at La Santisima some weekends. That simply means less hassle to get some of the best food you can find in Glendale.

I would recommend trying anything with arrachera in the description and the al pastor tacos. Their seafood choices are bangin' too. 

Their salsa bar will challenge your ideas of what a salsa can be made of. 

If you want to go for lunch or dinner at La Santisima and you can't find a date, I'll go with you anytime.
