I came to Phoenix for a business trip and didn't want to eat near the arena so I looked up any nearby triple d restaurants. I randomly chose one to yelp and from the reviews and pictures, we chose this one. The whole ride there I was salivating over the pictures of the deep fried quesas. I knew I wanted to try that and the fish tacos. It did not disappoint. Soo good!! And on top of that they have a salsa bar with like 10 different salsas you can try! Super friendly staff. One of the waiters gave me a bag of chips no charge to take to go with all the yummy salsas! I would definitely be coming back here when I visit Phoenix in the future!
