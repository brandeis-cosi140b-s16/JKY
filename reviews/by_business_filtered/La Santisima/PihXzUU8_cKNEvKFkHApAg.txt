This place is simply the best. This is my favorite Mexican food in Phoenix. I have sent MANY people here and every single person has been amazed. I moved to Seattle and boy do I miss this place. The service, atmosphere, and most importantly the food is GREAT. It is all fresh and I don't know who is back there making this heavenly food but they definitely know what they are doing! 

The salsa bar is huge and all of them are amazing. I can't wait to visit Phoenix so I can go again. They used to be call La Condessa.. not sure why the changed their name but who cares as long as they still have those amazing tacos, amazing burritos and that amazing salsa bar.  

Side note: I am a vegetarian and have had no problem with the selection of vegetarian food. Definitely worth it.
