Awful. After all the batting away of the flies, dodging the moldy chips, straining to hear my date over the blaring and awful mexican music and noticing that my Sierra Mist was brown, I never did get around to actually ordering a meal, I was too frightened to! The walls were supposed to be white but you could only see it through all the dirt where the chair had recently scratched the wall.....won't be going back! 

I suspect someone spends a lot of time writing their own reviews....
