SOOOO thrilled to find this place! The food is excellent - not the heavy cheese-laden Sonoran style that the Phoenix market is used to, but a lighter, more flavorful Mexican style. Lots of things to choose from on the menu. Loved my chicken mole burro. Margs were delicious and I cannot wait to do happy hour there - an afternoon of $3 margaritas and the amazing salsa bar with a great variety of salsas. I particularly liked the pecan, peanut, and chile arbol salsas, although they were all really, really good. If you love horchata, you'll love the one here.
