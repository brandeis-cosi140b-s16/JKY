Whhat? I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet. It is by far, one of my favorite taco shops in all of Phoenix. Authentic. Quality. Delicious. 

When you first come in you get chips and can start experiencing the amazing salsa bar. Each flavor isn't just thrown together, but put together with thought and care. I have favorites, but they are all pretty tasty.

Follow that up with some amazing food (I personally love the Mayan Cochinita Pibil Taco plate with double rice). Then you can wash it down with a, not-so-traditional, but in a good way Horchata. 

They will then drop the bill off and you will be pleasantly surprised that you had such an delicious, fresh meal for such a reasonable price.
