If you're a fan of big fancy, red carpet joints, this is not the place for you. The service is not good, it is understaffed, the restaurant itself is small and there are a boat load of people there. If you like eating some kick ass Mexican food though, this place tops the list. I had the pork and bean burrito with a side of their chipotle salsa. The meat was so tender and the flavor was so developed, I wept a little with each bite. This is on my radar for the next time I come out to Phoenix.  Just hope they find a bigger location or open a taco truck.
