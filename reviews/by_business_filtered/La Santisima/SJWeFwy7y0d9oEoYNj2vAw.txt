If this place only served chips and their salsa bar, I would still give it 5 stars!  As a salsa and hot sauce (they're different, people!) fanatic, I tend to judge Mexican food joints based on their quality of salsa - and La Condesa ranks high!  Last time I was there, I counted 10 different salsas and 2 or 3 different condiments (limes, onions, etc.).  They offer a wide range of salsas from their exotic strawberry salsa, to spicy chipotle, or creamy cilantro.  It looks a little silly with 8 little cups on salsa at your table, but you have to try them all! 

The horchata here is also 5-star material.  Don't be a cheapskate - shell out the $4 for it! Its giant, it will make you happy. And, when you're done with it you can eat the fruit and nuts - the drink keeps on giving! 

I have been here twice and have only eaten the veggie tacos, 2 of them are enough to fill me up and they are very delicious!  I must say I am not a huge fan of their rice and beans, which seem a bit bland to me.  But, the tacos, salsa and drinks all make up for some plain 'ol rice! 

I was very  happy to see a decent sized crowd here on my most recent visit and that La Condesa is applying for a liquor license.  This place needs to stick around for awhile!
