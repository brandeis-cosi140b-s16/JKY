REALLY great salsa bar selection here! I would go here strictly for that reason alone. The food here is great. The drinks are delicious as well. They hand make the cocktails with love and use real fruit. I had the blueberry martini and there were so many fresh blueberries in it I could barely finish it haha! My hubby got the horchada with rum...it tasted like a pina colada! Yum yum. In a rougher part of town, but this is definitely our new go to spot for Mexican food when driving to/from the airport back up to North Scottsdale :)
