This is an awesome, quaint artsy restaurant nestled just slightly off the Historic Glendale strip with a casual vibe and truly delicious food. 

We visited on a quiet night and had attentive service, since we were the only other guests other than a large family gathering in the center. The number of patrons, however, is no reflection on the food or experience. 

We split two, two-taco plates for maximum sampling--chicken black mole, la santisma with shrimp, chicken tinga, and pork pibil...all of which were delicious. The la santisma, loaded with veggies and cheese was the overall winner (and was the one recommended by our waiter). Also, being a mole fan, I was excited to eat a REALLY good mole! 

I only wish there was one closer, because I would eat here wayyyy to often. The salsa bar is out of this world if you are a salsa nut like myself. Sooo many options, all for the tasting. Ever had a delish jicama and cilantro salsa? How about the less common radish salsa, which was outstanding? Not to mention the other 10+ salsas on the bar, including a spicy guac. Many of these have quite the kick, so this may not be for the faint of heart. 

Lastly, the house margarita was tasty and we both loved the mixed citrus, including lemons, limes, orange and grapefruit. This is not a "knock-you-on-your-a$$" bev, but probably the tastiest mixed drink I've had in a long time. So fresh, crisp and well-made for enjoyment. 

I will be making the trip back again and again. Yum...
