Totally worth the crappy parking situation here! My girlfriend and I came in on random weeknight for early dinner and the place was already full. Wow! Could be due to the limited seating or maybe because the food is terrific. Both? Likely. Chips arrived promptly straight from the oil pan - nice and toasty. And we helped ourselves to the salsa bar - which is completely fresh, creative, and whets your palette at the get-go! We loved the cilantro salsa and salsa mexicana the best. Zesty! The servers were quick to take our order despite being busy and minutes later my tacos de arrachera arrived. Sooo good! I mean. Wow! Meat was tender and juicy ....and the combination of spices and flavors was heaven. My friend ordered the Condesa specialty taco. Another winning ticket! Condesa has nailed the right way to make beans too. And..don't get me started on the deliciousness of the horchata. I've had me some horchata many places ..but this really rocked my world. Rocked it! 

Condesa, I have just two requests: Please do something about the sitting area so we can actually fit in this place. Also, please don't be out of flan next time I come in! Thanks!
