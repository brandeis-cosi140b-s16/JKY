Solid offerings and an excellent salsa bar make this dive taco bar one of the places you must visit in Phoenix.  I haven't frequented other taco bars in the area so I can't comment on how it stacks up.  However, I think if you are charging higher prices for tacos they should include the rice and beans if you order two, or be packed to the brim with filling.  I must admit I was a bit jealous when my brother got his pibil taco, as this seemed to be one of the more filled-tacos on the menu.  The shark was outstanding and had great flavor.  Seating is at a premium so be careful with larger groups. You may just want to get them togo, sit on the curb outside and have yourself an authentic Mexican experience. I'll definitely visit again next time I'm in the area.  I could see myself pouring that Cilantro salsa on some fries to make for an excellent side dish.
