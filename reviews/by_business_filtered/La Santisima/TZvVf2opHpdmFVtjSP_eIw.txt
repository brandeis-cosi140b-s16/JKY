My dad & I were in town for the day. We were sooo hungry & in the mood for anything so yelp helped me find this place & of course we were kind of iffy about it & expected it to be like every other Mexican restaurant, BUT we were totally mistaken! My dad is from Mexico City, but has been living in the US for almost 22 years. This is the FIRST place ever to actually have tacos that tasted just like from his hometown! He even teared up because of the memories that filled him (no i'm not exaggerating!), & when my dad says the tacos are authentic then they are! This place will be the only reason why we will come back to Phoenix! Hopefully this place lives on for good! :)
