It doesn't look like much from the outside but the food is outstanding, and it's a great place for lunch. It offers free chips and a salsa bar, and the hardest part was limiting myself to just a few salsas. The 3 I had were great. Chicken mole torta (though they don't call it a torta) is rich and tasty, just right. I'm glad they offered a Groupon; I'll be back.
