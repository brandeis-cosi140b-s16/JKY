I was in town from Texas. We know Mexican food and I can say this place is amazing!!! 

The salsa and chips are great! Good service!!! 

I had the smoked Marlin quesadilla!! First it tastes amazing!! Not like any I have had before! Great flavor profiles and the guacamole on top was second to none! 


I highly recommend this place!
