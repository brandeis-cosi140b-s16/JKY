Dude.

I love this place. It's walking distance from my house, that is baaaad news for my thighs. I've driven past it multiple times and it never caught my eye. Finally, I did notice their large statue thingy outside of the establishment. It was all lit up as I drove by during the evening. When I realized it was a gourmet taco shop, I knew I had to go asap. 

I went with my boyfriend and we both went to TOWN on their chips and assorted salsas. My favorite was the pecan salsa. Sweet and spicy! For our meals, he ordered 3 tacos and I ordered 2. The pork tacos were slightly bland and made me worry at first that I was going to be let down, but then came the chicken mole taco - oh my! Delicious! Sweet and savory, it was perfect. I know that sauce is difficult to make too, so, well done. Most of the tacos actually don't come with cheese - you know why? Because the tacos are so bomb you don't even need the cheese really. Their flavors are very carefully picked to taste a certain way. Save the cheese and salsa for the chips! You'll enjoy the tacos just as they are.

YUM!
