Tiiiiiiny little place, but with very cool decor[ artists exhibiting their paintings], day of the dead theme.Not that it -matters-, because with the food that is served here, it could be all paper plates and plastic cups and I do not think anyone would -care-.
  We came here on a sunday evening, with a -very- hyperactive 5 year old in tow-as the restaurant itself is -very- small, even the smallest sounds he made felt like they would bring on an avalanche- or maybe I was just self conscious, as no one seemed to mind.
 The staff were very attentive and kind, the food arrived super quickly.
 And now onto the food-O M G
I had the Oaxaca Black Mole Chicken tacos- they were incredible.Rich, thick, delicious, amazingggggggly good. My son had Mayan Cochinita Pibil tacos[banana leaf roasted pork shoulder], and though usually I do not like pork, but from what I had of his, was delicious.
 Husband had Aztec Tinga[shredded chicken] bowl, with a fresh tortilla the size of a UFO saucer.
  There is a salsa bar with about 12-16 different, freshly made salsa;from pico de gallo to more exotic offerings such as strawberry salsa[the bomb], creamy cilantro salsa, creamy cashew .etc etc.All were super fresh and very tasty.

We will definitely be back-the mole sauce alone was worth the drive!
