Been driving by this place for some time, and finally I decided to try it. I was skeptical at first because the parking isn't very inviting. The restaurant is somewhat small but yet quaint. I was very excited to try all the salsa's but was utterly disappointed when the chips they brought us were hard, stale, and just not suitable for eating. I think they were some of the worst chips I have ever had, I had one.. I requested another basket and they kindly bought another basket of chips but they were the same, Stale, hard and dull. I ordered the Aztec Tinga Taco, and they were very good. The salsa's were all great. The service was great, and the waitress apologized for the chips, and stated that they had ran out and had to buy some etc, etc.. Overall tacos were great for the money, just disappointed with the chips.
