I was totally blown away with La Santisima. 

The salsa bar was top notch. Over a dozen to choose from, each delicious. The pico de gallo was some of the best I've had. A creamy guacamole and a cilantro sauce were highlights as well. 

The tacos were phenomenal. Each topped with salsa and garnish that complimented perfectly. Even the beans and rice were incredible. So much flavor in such traditionally simple sides. 

The interior is fun and quirky, decorated with luchadors, sugar skulls and other interesting Mexican art.
