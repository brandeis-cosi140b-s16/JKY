Ok, I finally got a chance to come back with some coworkers. They changed their format. The first time I was there, it was go to the counter order and they give you a number. They have waiter service this time. I got the Sonora Arrachera Quesa (Oaxaca cheese & char-broiled Arrachera steak). It was so good and too much for me to finish. I looks at my fellow lunchers and their tacos looked so GOOD. The salsa bar is filled with all sorts of varieties. I tried the strawberry salsa, too sweet for my taste... but more to favors to try!
