So, mi media naranja and I were flying out of Phoenix early in the morning: we were headed to Boston for a couple of weeks. I didn't want to get up at the butt-crack of dawn to drive up to PHX from Tucson, so we decided to stay the night close to the airport. Of course the normal "what do you want for dinner" conversation started, and we decided we wanted some good Mexican food before we left the desert Southwest. Yelp led us here; when was the last time you saw a 4 1/2 star review with 500-some odd reviews?

Those 4 1/2 stars weren't lying. The salsa bar is ridiculously fantastic! Strawberry salsa? Yes please! I had four helpings of the robano pibil salsa. Chips were sorta warm, nothing incredible; the real star was the salsa. I ordered a couple of al pastor tacos and a Mayan Cochinita pibil. The pastor was delicious, and the Mayan taco?? The pork was mouthwateringly tender and perfectly seasoned. I felt sad when my plate was empty. 

My better half had the cabo shrimp taco, which she didn't seem super excited about. The mole taco, however, got her talking; incredibly, she shared a bite with me. I agreed; it was phenomenal. 

Service was fast and courteous. I'd take off 1/2 star for using the restrooms as a storage area for extra dining-room chairs. Kinda gross. Overall, though, it was excellent and I am glad we went!
