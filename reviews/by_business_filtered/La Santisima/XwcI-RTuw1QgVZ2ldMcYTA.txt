This was my first time here. I was glad to see new blood come into the downtown Glendale area. I spend a lot of time in this area and I'm always looking for a new spot. 

The decor and styling of the restaurant is great. I loved the paintings and lighting throughout. There is ample seating although we came on a very busy night. 

Now for the bad news. We waited nearly an hour for a total of 8 tacos between 4 people. We were told by the manager that he was sorry and he was missing two servers and a cook. Sadly I did see people leave prior to getting food due to service. I can only hope this gets addressed. 

On the good side the tacos were excellent. I ordered two steak tacos, while my friend ordered one steak and one shredded pork. He also described the steak taco as good but he said the pork was delicious. 

Great menu with lots of choices. I will go back and hope the service issue is fixed.
