I first tried this place last Sunday and I went back yesterday for more. Given that I'm not much of a "regular" (I crave variety to an unhealthy degree), this says a lot. 

Both times I've gone, I ordered the La Condesa shrimp tacos, which were positively fantastic. The shrimp is great quality and perfectly grilled to bring out its natural sweet flavor. I also love the robust veggie filling, including sauteed spinach, onions and peppers - the spinach is especially flavorful and a unique addition for sure. My only gripe with the tacos (and this is just a personal thing) is that each comes with two corn tortillas, which appears to be necessary to hold the hearty fillings but is a little carb-heavy for my tastes. 

But who I am I kidding? By the time my tacos arrived, I'd already devoured an entire basket of delicious, not-too-greasy chips with a ton of great salsas from the salad bar. Why stop there? :)

Speaking of salsa, while I like the more traditional ones, I think that the unusual flavors are the most delicious. For example, the sesame one tastes great drizzled on top of the shrimp tacos, and the peanut one was really solid with the chips. Both Asian-seeming sauces. Both surprisingly great matches for the savory Mexican flavors. 

The final thing I wanted to mention is the Jamaica (pronounced Huh-my-kah) drink, which is essentially sweetened hibiscus tea. It's delicious but I think it's a tad too sweet for me. I'd love if it was watered down a bit. 

This is definitely my new Sunday spot, but of course, check back with me in a few weeks. If I've still been hitting this place up on a weekly basis, you KNOW it's good!
