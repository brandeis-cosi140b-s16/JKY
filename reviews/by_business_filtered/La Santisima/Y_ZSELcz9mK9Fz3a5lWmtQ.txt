Realizing that an inordinate portion of our travel west, from the Port Fonda experience at Greendirt Farm outside of Kansas City to The Shed and Salsa Brava, had focused on Mexican food I couldn't help but pass by La Condessa while my mother was in town for tacos and although I know some in Phoenix may claim the space is not "authentic" enough for them (from what I've gathered, according to some locals you need to have questionable evaluations from the Health Department to be legit) I can say without a doubt that although I've not been south of the border, these are the best tacos I've ever tasted.

Beginning first with another free chips-and-salsa-bar stocked with a baker's dozen of house-made salsas and sauces paired with slightly salted, almost greaseless, and pleasantly warm tortilla chips and moving on to the four tacos featuring local produce and fresh proteins on (unfortunately not house made) imported flour tortillas I particularly enjoyed the crunchy texture and delicate flavors of the shrimp taco while the bright acidity of the pork shoulder and smoky spice of the chicken taco both worked nicely as well.  

Perhaps not as regional as some taco stands (or trucks) and instead choosing to focus on the depth and breadth of Mexican cuisine from coast to coast I'm sure the is "better" or "more authentic" cuisine to be found both here and over the border, but thus far I've not experienced it (outside of the vastly more upscale, expensive, and certainly less authentic Distrito.)
