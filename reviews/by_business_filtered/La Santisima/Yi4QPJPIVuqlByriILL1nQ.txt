Based on my first visit, I would have happily given La Condesa a 4 star review. My veggie tacos were delicious, and I loved all the fun salsas. I couldn't get enough of them! Really, the only negative was the cramped quarters.

My second visit, however, was not nearly as good. On the positive side, I got guacamole this time which was studded with dried cranberries and tasted great with the strawberry salsa. I was impressed with the service too because my friend's order came out the same time as mine despite the fact that we ordered separately 10 minutes apart. 

The tacos this time were awful. I decided to get the vegan tacos since the description of "no pintos, no rice" lead me to believe that the beans and rice in the veggie tacos weren't really vegetarian friendly. I'm a pretty strict vegetarian so I try to avoid food that's been prepared with meat-based stock. The vegan tacos come with black beans which were absolutely flavorless. I'm not sure these beans encountered even a grain of salt during their preparation. The tacos also had iceburg lettuce in them which tasted dreadful of course. 

So now I know I can't have their veggie tacos, and the vegan ones suck. No reason to visit again.
