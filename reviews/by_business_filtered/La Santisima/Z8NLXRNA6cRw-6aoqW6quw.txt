I really want to give them five stars. I love: the art, the atmosphere, the super friendly servers. 

I think I would have loved many of the salsas, but they ran out of cups & had small plates to put the salsas on instead. Dude, it's really hard to dunk a tortilla chip into a plate of salsa. I tried the cilantro & the tomatillo & both were great, but couldn't muster the effort trying to scrape another flavor off the bottom of a plate.

The Mayan pork taco was damn near perfect, but I thought the chicken mole was a little too much on the sweet side.
