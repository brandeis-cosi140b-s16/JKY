Delicious margaritas, excellent salsa bar, local business.....the trifecta of restaurants.  I like that it is small inside and eclectic.  The guacamole is amazing as are the white fish tacos.  Really, you can't go wrong.  Close your eyes and point to a menu item....it will be awesome whatever comes out of the kitchen.
