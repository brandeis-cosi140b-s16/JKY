First off, amazing salsa bar. Flavored I've never even seen and not sure if authentic, but great nontheless. If it weren't for Yelp, I know I would have never walked in. Wasn't necessary in a great location, but I'm so glad I went in regardless.

This place is pretty small but people popping in and out in a Saturday afternoon. Definitely a good sign but again I kinda want to keep it as my own secret place.

Got a their Cabo Shark taco and it was absolutely amazing. Also tried a bite from one of their shrimp tacos. Again amazing. Definitely coming here again.
