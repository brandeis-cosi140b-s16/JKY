I had the gaucho taco (chimichurri beef something or other) and the cochinita pibil taco. 

Honestly amazing food. 

Really interesting assortment of sauces and salsas (jicama salsa, peanut sauce stuff was great.) Looks like they just recently added some awesome new tequilas so I'm looking forward to stopping by at dinner time. Really authentic stuff. Looks like they just had Diners Dives and Drive ins there as there was a cool metal art piece signed by Guy Fieri.
Food came out quickly despite lunch rush. I'll be back soon. 
Recommended to people looking for authentic places to make their more boring friends jealous of their foodie acumen.
