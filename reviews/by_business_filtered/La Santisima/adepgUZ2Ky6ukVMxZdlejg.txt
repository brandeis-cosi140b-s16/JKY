The cabo fried shrimp tacos are the best thing to me. Salsa bar is awesome as well. Little over hyped. Cramped seating. Service is mediocre. One guy does a good job but he's not always there. I've had to wait for a while before. One time I just estimated my tab, left money and left. For a spot that made it on diners and dives they need some work. I would think they would care more about service and presentation. Food is always good. But I'm not there to hang out for long. Reminds me of a little dive in mexico. I usually enjoy myself despite the flaws. Best is go when its slow.
