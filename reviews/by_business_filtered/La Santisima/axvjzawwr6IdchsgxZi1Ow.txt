I love this place! The service is quick and friendly and the food is great! There are more than enough vegetarian options and too much good salsa to try! My favorite was the cilantro and the pecan dressing. They are so fresh and the food didn't take long to come at all. I will definitely visit again next time I'm in Phoenix
