As many have mentioned, this place is freakin fantastic.  I vote for La Condesa Shrimp tacos as my fav.  Best horchata I've ever had and eating the fruits and nuts when your done is a tasty dessert.  The Rabano (radish) Pibil salsa was so amazing I almost killed their supply of little cups going back for more.  That's one I'll be trying to recreate at home forever but will never get quite right.  Slightly sour, slightly hot, it's like a Mexican kimchee . . literally, I just drooled on myself thinking about it.  Viva La Condesa!
