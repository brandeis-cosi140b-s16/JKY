we love fish tacos, but find it hard to find good, "authentic" ones near our house without paying scottsdale prices. i've heard of La Condesa, but since it's out of our "circle of convenient driving distance" we never think of it. 

thanks to the wife, we were all set to meet some friends here last night. we first noticed that is an actual sit-down restaurant. i assumed with all the hype, it would be a grungy, post-soviet area looking eatery (re: carolina's), but no....it was nice inside, replete with some beautiful dia de los muertos paintings. 

we had to wait about 30 minutes for a table to open up. once seated, we were brought a jug of water and some chips. then the fun began! trying out each one of the approx 15 salsa's at their salsa bar. i liked many of them, but wound up going back to the traditional salsa and pico. of note, the cilantro, pecan, and strawberry salsa's were good, but only for a few dips. 

i ordered one each of the shark, the shrimp, and the veggie tacos. they are small but packed with flavor. so juicy, they come stacked on 2 small corn tortillas. i actually savored the veggie and the shrimp instead of wolfing them down. both very tasty with that mexican sauce they put on them, and the fried shrimp were perfect...not caked in batter, but just a light dusting. i didn't get to the shark ones because i was so full, so it's in our fridge waiting to be eaten. i also ordered a margarita...it was rather delicious!

there are so many choices of tacos, burritos (with/without the tortilla) and fajitas...and several for veg heads. it's difficult to pick 2...which is why we must definitely go back!!!!!
