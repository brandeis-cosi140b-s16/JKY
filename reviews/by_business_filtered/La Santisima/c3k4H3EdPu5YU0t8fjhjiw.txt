Had a Groupon - went there today...  It was fantastic!  

I had the Oaxaca Black Mole Chicken Taco plate. Loved it!  I normally don't order rice and beans but since It was my first time visiting here, I did get them.  The beans had a nice flavor and they were moist enough to dip my chips in and eat that way.  The rice had bits of corn and cilantro and was very flavorful.  

The salsa bar was also delicious with several options to choose from, including a strawberry salsa that was very nice for the sweltering Phoenix summer day.  

I liked La Condesa so much, I bought another Groupon while eating my lunch!  :)
