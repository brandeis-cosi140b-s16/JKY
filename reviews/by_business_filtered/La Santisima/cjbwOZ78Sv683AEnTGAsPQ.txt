It is all about the salsa bar.

I've eaten their tacos many times, both at the restaurant and to go.  Food is fresh and tastier than many of the other mexican eateries close by.  It isn't cheap by any means, but the salsa bar has so many choices (delicious each one) that more than makes up for the slightly higher cost.  And the choices don't just range from pico de gallo to hot to hotter.  Some are tart, some are creamy, some are smoky and hit the back of your throat, some are hot on the front end, etc.  Just go and taste it for yourself

Because I live close by, I prefer to take my tacos home because the space is very small and (because the food is so good) it can get quite cramped in no time.  (And when the unfortunate circumstance of someone bringing in a baby happens, there really isn't any way to pretend you aren't in hell no matter how much Yoda you think you can channel.)  But get there early and down a few of their happy hour margaritas you might not care about the space.  

If anyone knows of another place with a salsa bar even half as good as La Condesa's, please let me know.
