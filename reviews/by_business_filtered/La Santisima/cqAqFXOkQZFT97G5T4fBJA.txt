I really do think that I could live off their chicken mole tacos and the salsa bar! The service was wonderful, the food was above and beyond, and I am addicted to their cilantro salsa. 

The chicken mole tacos were overflowing with meat and topped with just a bit of pickled onions, perfection. Their quesadillas .....as delicious as they are, are not figure friendly. They are homemade corn tortillas stuffed with various meats, cheeses and veggies and then deep fried. I had the Oaxaca cheese & char-broiled Arrachera steak, which was ooozing out on delivery. Waaay more than I bargained for, good thing I was sharing. These are very indulgent and intensely tasty.

Once I got a little into trying all their salsas, I decided to mix the cilantro salsa and the chipotle salsa...WOW!!  This was my husband's idea, have to give him credit. 

If you haven't been here already...go...if you have been here...go back, I know I will.
