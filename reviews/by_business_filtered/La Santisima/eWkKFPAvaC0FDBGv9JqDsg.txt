This is a place where the hype exceeds the capability of the restaurant. 

There's nothing wrong with this place. It's just not exceptional, great or even noteworthy. 

When you throw in their exorbitant prices of 3.99 for a single taco, you realize that you're getting hosed. 

The salsa bar itself is good. The serving cups are too small so as to adequately support the dipping of the chip. Speaking of which, the chips are too thin and cold. 

The food itself is good quality. The shark taco was crunchy and tasty, the pork shoulder taco interesting and flavorful. Sadly neither was worth the 4 buck price.
