Sometimes, Yelp is right on.  I was looking for a great Mexican restaurant in the neighborhood to take my wife to (it was date night).  This place had far more stars than most, so we gave it a go.

Upon entering (we visited on First Friday last month) it was so loud that it was like bombs going off.  The decor was unusual and had an interesting botanica vibe going on.  Service was a bit slow but they were so packed that I wasn't surprised.

Their salsa bar had more flavors than I've ever seen at a restaurant anywhere--and I've been to a lot of Mexican Restaurants.  As for the food itself, there was nothing "traditional" about it, but everything was so bursting with incredible flavor that I was savoring every bite.

Holy sh*t, that was good.  My burrito was loaded with CHUNKS of marinated steak--not ground, not shredded, but chunks.  I was blown away.  Next time, there's a SHARK burrito on the menu that I can't wait to taste.

If you're in the mood for something "traditional", I still point people to Mi Patio in Phoenix.  However, if you're looking for something other than the same old Mexican taste, may I recommend this landmark.  It's just a few blocks north of McDowell on your right hand side.  You won't regret it.  The place is small and can sometimes be packed with noisy gringos, but the taste is unforgettable.
