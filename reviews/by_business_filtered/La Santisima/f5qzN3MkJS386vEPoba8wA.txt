When you come here, the best thing you can do is order a plate of tacos, more tacos then you can comfortably eat (but you'll eat all of them, damn it) and build a fortress with the salsa cups.  There are so many different kinds of salsa here.  Just keep going back until you have a cup of each different kind and stack them so you create a barrier and no one can see you stuff your face with that delicious food.

Don't be afraid to wipe with your sleeve, because no one will see you.... the wall of cups of salsa will be blocking you.  Eh?  See, I think ahead.
