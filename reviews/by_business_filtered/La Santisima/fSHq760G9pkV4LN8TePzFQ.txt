The food was amazing, and so many choices. I had a al pastor street taco which is probably one of the best ones I've ever had. I also had the pacific white fish taco, two big pieces of fried fish, very crispy and tasty, and my friend and I shared the poblana quesa quesadilla, very untraditional but so good. You get chips when you sit down and theres a self serve salsa bar with a big variety of all kinds of salsas. Limited seating but we got a table right away. Can't wait to go back!
