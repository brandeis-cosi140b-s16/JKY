Love, love, love this Phoenix gem!  I stumbled upon it when I was out house hunting & my husband learned about it from a co-worker, so we tried it one night & have been hooked ever since!  The salsa bar is awesome & the food is fantastic!  We are so happy to live just a few short miles from here & we go often!
