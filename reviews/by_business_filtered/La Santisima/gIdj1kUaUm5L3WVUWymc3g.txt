Lunchtime out with a relative on a weekday, and La Condesa has a seat by the window. There is really nothing like its saloon-artsy walls for us to gaze.   The Dia De los Muertos motif and wooden furniture make it perfect for easy conversation.  
Most folks seated around us already know where to go for lunch that's not too pricey and homemade.  
The Horchata is nothing short of liquid dessert, filled with pecans, fruit and rice milk.  You can avoid dairy all together with this and a special bullet burro with guac and lettuce.
The salsa bar sets the standard for good restaurants.  It's wide variety of salsas leave little doubt what creative people run the place.  My hope is that only a few people read this and try it. Otherwise, to my chagrin, the next time we park on 16th Street, we may have to WAIT in a line outside.
