Love La Condesa!  They have a fantastic salsa bar with delicious, interesting salsas and a range of fantastic tacos (something for everyone).  The environment is cozy, albeit a little small.  The only thing that would make it better is if it were BYOB (they recently started serving alcohol).  Phoenix needs more restaurants like this one!
