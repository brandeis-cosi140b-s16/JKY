I've been here twice now for lunch with a co-worker and I'm obsessed.  First thing you notice is their huge salsa bar in the corner -- looks like they always have about 8-10 different kinds to try.  My favorites: strawberry, pecan and cilantro.  The whole place is decorated with Dia de los Muertos art everywhere -- very colorful and authentic.  Next...the meals.  So far I've had the shrimp burro and some of my co-workers chicken mole quesa.  Both were absolutely delicious -- melty fresh cheese, the mole sauce was unbelievable, and the shrimp burro was a great mix of cheese, an assortment of vegetables and a yummy sauce.  If this place was closer to my house I'd be there way more!
