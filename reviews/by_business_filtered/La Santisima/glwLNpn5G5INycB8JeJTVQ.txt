I have enjoyed La Condesa numerous times. I am stuck on the La Condesa Shrimp tacos. Awesomely fresh and I love the spinach instead of lettuce. Beer is cold, service is slow, but very good. Before my trip last week I would have ranked at least 4 stars, but the shrimp were NOT deveined. Not only mine, but my friend who went with me. I had 2 shrimp tacos & she had one with a carne asada. She loved the carne asada. I don't know that I can eat the shrimp again...what a bummer.
