Do yourself a favor and start eating here (if you're not already a fan).

#1. Hands down best salsa bar on the PLANET!!!

If I can help it, I eat here at least 2x/week. I literally order the same thing every single time and it never gets old: veggie tacos and horchata, both of which have ruined any other Mexican restaurant for me... nothing comes even close to their glorious flavors, and it's always fun picking and mixing the different salsas with the food.

The super chill and friendly staff and unique atmosphere are also worth mentioning.

Seriously, I hesitate to leave Phoenix because of this place.
