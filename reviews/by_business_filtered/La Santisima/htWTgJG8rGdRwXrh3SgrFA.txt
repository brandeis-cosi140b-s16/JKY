My rating is based on experiences from previous visits to the sister establishment on 16th St.  The service and quality do not hold up here.  I hate to be so blunt but that is the way it has to be.  I have watched people walk out due to lack of service.  Watched a father and son dine without silverware!  THEY DID IT.  Will they be back???  Watched my uncle clean a dirty table that had been sitting dirty long before we had decided to sit outside and just before we had decided to leave.  All in the same day.

The food has been really good here, but they definitely have some growing to do.  We have come to love La Santisima's and would have no problem going back to the 16th St. location.  Get it together.
