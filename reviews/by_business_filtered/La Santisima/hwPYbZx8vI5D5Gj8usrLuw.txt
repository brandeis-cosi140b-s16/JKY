Been here a total of 4 times and I want to make it my 5th as soon as I can. So this was easy for me to update my rating from 4 stars to 5 stars!  I still love my tacos but my wife recently had the argentine steak quesadilla and it was amazing!! It was very big..big enough for us to easily share. On our last visit we didn't share but ended up taking the other half home and have an amazing snack!

Overall service isn't the fastest, but I'll wait a little for food so good. Nice local restaurant in Glendale!
