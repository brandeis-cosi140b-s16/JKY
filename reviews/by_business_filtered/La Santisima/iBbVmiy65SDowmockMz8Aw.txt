The salsa bar was fun and interesting. Maybe not quite as tasty as I had hoped. But it was amusing to try so many different styles of salsa.

When people say get the horchatta, they mean it. Get that thing. Lots of flavor. Not too sweet. Overall very much worth the price.

The tacos were wonderful and this was the first time I had mole that I really liked it. So much deep flavor. Give this place a chance. It is not like the stereotypical heavy, greesy food that we've come to expect. But the flavors are amazing.
