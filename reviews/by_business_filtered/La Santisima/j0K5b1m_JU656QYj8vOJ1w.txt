Awesome flavors. We went on a Saturday around 1:00pm and the place was empty but filled up soon afterward. Service was prompt . The menu was bigger than expected and sounded pretty authentic. They have a full bar which was a plus as I was in mood for some tequila. I had the smoked marlin tacos and slow cooked pork tacos..both were incredibly flavorful and excellent. Not the best I have ever eaten but darn close and I have had a lot of great tacos in my travels. The only disappointment was I was hoping to also get a chile reano, sadly they don't offer them. I'll go back for sure when I am in Phoenix.
