We went hiking the day after Thanksgiving and after that we were starving. I have been wanting to try this place out for a while, we loved it!! Not only did we enjoy the atmosphere & music, the food was seriously good!! I have to watch my carb intake and my husband discovered they had tacos protien style SCORE!! they were beautiful, looked like enchiladas.  I had the chicken tinga and gaucho steak tacos, the taste was an explosion sooo good!! Even the kids loved them. We really liked this place, the pictures of skeletons were awesome, our teen girls really thought it was cool! We will be back for sure!
