Was very excited to come here after all the good reviews.   Overall, our experience was quite "meh".  The menu was inspired.  I loved the idea of having a taco to represent the cuisine of so many different latin american places.  I also loved the salsa bar with its dozen or so unlimited salsas.  However, the food its self was nothing to write home about.  We tried six different tacos, and none of it seemed particularly fresh or interesting.  Had to rely heavily on the salsas to revive the tired tacos.  Doubt I'll be coming back.
