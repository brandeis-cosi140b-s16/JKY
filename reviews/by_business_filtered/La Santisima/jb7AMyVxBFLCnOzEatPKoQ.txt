I had heard many good things about this place so I finally decided to eat there. The restaurant is small and cozy with lots of mexican art on the walls. On to the food... The salsa selection was very generous and I liked most of them. The beans were great and so was the rice. Now about the tacos, the mole was not that great, they went overboard on the chocolate imho, the carne asada was good. The chicken tinga taco changed my life, it was amazing! Overall it was a good experience. I will be going back soon.
