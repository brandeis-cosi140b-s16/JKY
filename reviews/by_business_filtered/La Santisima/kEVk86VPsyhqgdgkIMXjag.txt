These are not your buddy's street tacos.
La Condesa hits the nail on the head when it comes to flavor. Cochinita Pibil that tastes like Cochinita Pibil... though I would be fine with a little more achiote.
The tinga is great, with citrusy notes on top of slow cooked beef full of chorizo and onion flavor--don't worry, the onion sweetens it up.

My personal favorite is the baja shrimp taco. Big juicy pieces of breaded shrimp stuffed into two corn tortillas with cabbage and mayo on top.

My only point of contention; they should warn people that more than two tacos is actually quite a lot of food. It would help get over the sticker shock. Beans and rice are unnecessary.

A suggestion: Provide people with suggestions for salsa/taco pairings and make everyone drink the fruity horchata, it's awesome.
