In a nutshell: After 1 1/2 hr wait we left without other food in our stomachs but chips with salsa!
Place was packed, 2 servers for the whole hungry crowd, our order got misplaced, and with two hungry kids next to me I had to leave to a nearby Subway. I do believe the food a the two sister facilities is great. But the service at this location is close to the worse I've ever experienced. I was happy when I got to know this place had been opened in Glendale, since we just moved to the West Valley, but unfortunately I'm not planning to come back anytime soon.
