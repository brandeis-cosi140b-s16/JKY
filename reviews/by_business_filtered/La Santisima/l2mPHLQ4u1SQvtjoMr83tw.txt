We visited here on a Saturday afternoon and we immediately knew this was a place that we would be returning to regularly. The food was wonderful and the salsa bar was just plain fun. The wait staff was extremely helpful in understanding their menu and her recommendations were spot on.  We're looking forward to working our way through their entire menu, one visit at a time!
