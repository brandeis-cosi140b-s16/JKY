I ordered a burrito and 2 tacos w/ rice/beans. I was charged $20.85 for what I thought was a rip off. Looking at the chicken it appears like it's been sitting at room temperature all day. It's black, dry and old looking. They must think people are stupid and won't know the difference. It's harsh to say, but I could not finish a meal I purchased due to disgust.
