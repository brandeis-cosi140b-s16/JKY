Gourmet Tacos at it's best !  The nice lady behind the counter was the owner that served us. My friend John and I decided to check this out this evening and all I can say is it's the bomb! I ordered the deep-fried shrimp quesadilla with ooey-gooey cheese! ( I know it sounds unhealthy, but I had to have it) It was huge and succulent!   John and I both had the pecan horchata and it did not disappoint.  We went there around 8:00pm when it's slow, so our service was stellar. There are so many great sounding dishes on the menu, so I'm really looking forward to returning.
