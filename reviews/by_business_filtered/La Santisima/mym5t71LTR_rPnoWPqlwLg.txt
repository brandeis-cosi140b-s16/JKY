The food is amazing! Fresh ingredients & great taste! The quesadillas are my favorite, filled with cheese! My One Complaint: I was seated by the salsa bar next to the wall & somehow ended with white all over my jeans & jacket! Very inconvenient since now I have to go back home before going to work because it doesn't come off easily!
