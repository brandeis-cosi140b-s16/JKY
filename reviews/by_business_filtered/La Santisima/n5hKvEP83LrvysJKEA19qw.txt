I come to La Condesa quite often (at least once a month) because it's really close to my house. It's one of those hidden gems along 16th Street and I really wish I could give it five stars but I just can't. Here's my summary of the place:

Good:
-The tacos are delicious! My favorite is the Mayan Pibil taco. 
-The prices are pretty descent.
-The salsa bar is AMAZING! I can't get enough of the pecan salsa. 
-The chips are free and they go fast with such great salsa selections.
-The margaritas are tasty.

Bad:
-The service is really bad. I'm not they type of customer to really care too much about service at a restaurant but it's pretty ridiculous here. I took my bf here the other day and it took about 8 minutes before anyone came to the table to greet us. I would say this was a fluke but, unfortunately, it's happened a few times now. Also, I have had two occasions when they forgot to bring out silverware/napkins. I've had a couple times when they've forgotten to bring out my margarita (they're really good here btw) and one time when they brought it out looking like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for 10 minues (all of the ice was melted). It's really sad how bad the services is because I absolutely LOVE the food/atmosphere.

I guess the bottom line is that La Condesa makes some amazing gourmet tacos and salsa but they fall very short on the service. I'll be back but there are plenty of other places I can go and receive great food AND great service (i.e. Gallo Blanco at the Clarendon Hotel).
