The tacos here were amazing! I had a shrimp taco and the black mole taco. It was great!! The salsa bar has a huge selection of fresh made salsas. My only complaint would be that they were out of guacamole when I came in which broke my heart. But next time I'm definitely going to try it. The margaritas are definitely spot on too, definitely a must try if you are in the area!
