I have eaten here twice and it is consistently excellent. I have had a shark taco, mahi mahi taco and veggie taco. I had to bribe my meat-loving-high-cholesterol-fighting mother into "splitting" the mahi mahi and veggie taco's with me. She loved them, too! The horchata is like nothing I have ever experienced. Love the fresh fruit and nuts in it. The salsa bar is a tastebud orgy of sheer delight and a playground for foodies who love complexity of flavor. But best of all... for 2 tacos, a little side of rice and beans, chips, two BIG drinks, it was only $16! Plus, we listened to The Smiths and old Mexican folk music. This place rocks. Oh, and for those reviewers who were frightened by the neighborhood, get over it. I live 5 blocks in a historic neighborhood and it is as safe as a city can get. If you come for lunch, you just might take a walk a couple blocks up to get a poleta for desert. 16th st between McDowell and Thomas has successfully embraced its roots to create a truly positive cultural experience.
