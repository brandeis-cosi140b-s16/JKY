This place has excellent gourmet mexican food... When they actually have ingredients in stock. I drove 25 minutes all the way from Goodyear to come here. And it seems each time I am disappointed they don't have avocados for my guacamole, sometimes they are out of carne Asada, maza, and salsa... WTF?? What kind of mexican restaurant runs out of carne Asada??? It wasn't even noon yet. Although the food is excellent, the experience is often inconsistent since they never seem to have everything they need to make the food the customers want to order. I would love to give a 5 star review and recommend this place to everyone, once they get figure out a way to keep ingredients in store. As for now I will bask in my disappointment.
