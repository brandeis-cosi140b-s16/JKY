We must have arrived at an odd time for them to be busy because the service was lacking. The kid was super sweet, but we waited and waited... and then waited some more. The food made up for the wait, but we were HANGRY when we got there and it almost got ugly. 

We got street tacos and they were awesome. We wanted to go back when we were flying back out of PHX, but we totally would have missed our flight and no tacos are worth that. 

That being said, one of the reasons we came here is because Yelp said that vegetarians go nuts here... and that was just not true at all. Veggie options left MUCH to be desired, so beware.
