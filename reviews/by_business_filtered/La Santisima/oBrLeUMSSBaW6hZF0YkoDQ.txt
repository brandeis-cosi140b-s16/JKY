Damn this place is GOOD. A family friend discovered it right after it opened, and I am always down to go there.

Parking is a SOB, look for street parking because the lot in front of the place is always packed. 

Lunch time is out of control packed and the dining area is TINY so come at odd times for your best bet and shortest wait. Love the decor tho. Old school, giant wooden tables/chairs, giant local art. 

20 salsas to choose from, ranging from pica de gallo to pistachio, you'll always find new ones to try. Tacos are quite good. Maybe a little pricey, but it's worth it. I always try something different because it's guaranteed to be tasty.
