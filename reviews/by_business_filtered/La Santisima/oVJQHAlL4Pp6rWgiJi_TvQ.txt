This is actually hard to rate for me.  This place is different, the way the food tastes is different than most taco places, but it wasn't bad.  I liked the strong cinnamon flavor of the pork shoulder taco, but half the taco was enough.  The steak taco was good, juicy and not as sweet as the other food.  The chicken one (not mole) was ok, also too sweet.  I liked one or two bites of the chicken mole quesadilla, but couldn't have more than that, the sweet chocolate flavor became too strong.  I think that is what threw me, the food was almost dessert sweet. The mahi mahi burro was good, but I question the freshness of the mahi mahi, it was overly fishy, other than that it was very good.  So nothing was bad, the Hubby couldn't eat any of it after trying each, it was not his thing at all, but I would go back to try some other stuff.  My advice is to expect something different.  FIVE STARS + 100 more for the horchata though, ooohhhhhh my amazing!! The salsa bar was awesome also!!  Our service was good, and fast.
