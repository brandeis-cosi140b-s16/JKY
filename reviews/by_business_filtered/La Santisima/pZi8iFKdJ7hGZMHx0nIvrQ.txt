I had to finally give La Condesa (recently changed their name to Santisma Tacos) the five stars they deserve. THIS PLACE IS MY JAM. We eat here all the time and believe me when I say that their santa condesa veggie taco is the best you'll ever have in your life (if you're vegetarian) and definitely awesome even if you're not a veggie. My go-to lunch/dinner is the 2 taco plate with one santa condesa and one ghandi vegan taco (their guacamole on this is divine). If you haven't ever had a horchata with fruit and nuts in it, it's about time. Theirs is delicious. 

They also have brunch (!!!!) and it's so fabulous. Just make sure to add Oaxaca cheese if it's not already part of the option, trust me.
