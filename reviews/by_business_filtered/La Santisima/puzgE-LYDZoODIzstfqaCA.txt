This place is a local gem, and we were introduced to it by a local.  I hesitate to review it, for fear that the out-of-towners will find it.  You'd have to know where it is though, because the tourists are not going to accidentally stumble upon it.  It's in the middle of the hood in Phoenix.  The only thing setting it apart from the other old-school business fronts with barred windows is the giant mosaic Day of the Dead Catrina above the door.

Known as a "gourmet taco place" to locals, the menu also features burros and quesadillas.  Where else can you get a shark soft taco or a Mahi Mahi burro?  I have no idea, but you can get them here.  My husband loved his Mahi Mahi burro.

I had a more traditional Carne Asada soft taco.  All their flour tortillas are hand made, and fresh.  And did I mention the salsa bar?  About 20 different kinds of salsa for you to try, with the chips that keep coming to the table.  My favorite was the creamy cilantro one.  There are also peanut and pecan based salsas, so those with nut allergies, take note.  You may not expect nuts in your food, so pay attention.

Seating is limited, (maybe 10 tables) and the restaurant was full when we were there, for lunch, in the middle of the week.  If you have a group larger than 4, it would probably be wise to call ahead.  Parking is also limited, just the few spaces on the street in front.

The only slightly disconcerting element was the giant mural of Frida Khalo.  It's a little odd to be stared at by a giant portrait of a mustached woman while eating such wonderful food.

We liked it so much that my husband took my dad there.  My dad is a notoriously finicky eater (which means I probably came by it naturally), and he is still talking about it a week later.  Yum!
