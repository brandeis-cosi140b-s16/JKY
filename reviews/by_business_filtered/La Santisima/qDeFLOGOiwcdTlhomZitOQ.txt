Dear Condesa,
I wish you had a few more vegetarian items, and that you didn't get all persnickety and confusing about the whole torta/lonche thing, because that led me into an ordering error. However, bygones. While I didn't love my veggie lonche, it was obviously very fresh and prepared with care. Also, please refill the salsa bar more frequently so that I won't be tempted to get too much of the really spicy ones and burn the he** out of my mouth. And put more tequila in the (non-happy hour) margaritas. Thank you!
Amalia C.
P.S. Your chairs are too heavy.
P.P.S. In reflection, maybe this was more of a 2-star for me personally but my husband really liked his street al pastor and carne asada taco plato and again, it all seemed fresh. So I bumped you up. You're welcome!
