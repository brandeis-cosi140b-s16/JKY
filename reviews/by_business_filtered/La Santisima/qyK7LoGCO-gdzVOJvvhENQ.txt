I was looking for a quick street taco fix and what I found was La Santisima.  Calling it a gourmet taco shop is fitting and more importantly the price was right!

The list of Mexican restaurants and taco shops is endless in Phoenix and while I can't possibly try them all, I have at least found one I thoroughly enjoy.  From the quality of meat, to the portions, to the highly touted salsa bar, this place delivers on all levels!

I started with a half order of guacamole to compliment my assortment of chosen salsas.  Their guac tends toward the chunky side mixed with red onion, tomato, mango, and cilantro.  The chips were disappointing, but they served their purpose of sampling salsas and the guac.

I also heard great things about the horchata, which I can never pass up when available.  First of all, it comes in a massive 32 oz cup.  I would definitely share this with somebody else next time.  It's also loaded with strawberries and mangos, which I initially thought seemed unnecessary, but provided a unique twist.  The fruit proved difficult to fit through the straw, so maybe I'll order without in the future.

I ordered 3 of the gourmet tacos - El Gaucho Taco, Baja Sur Shark Taco, and Mayan Cochinita Pibil Taco. All were $3.99 and excellent and I would say the Cochonita Pibil was the best I tried!  It went really well with the salsa cilantro, a cream based cilantro salsa.
