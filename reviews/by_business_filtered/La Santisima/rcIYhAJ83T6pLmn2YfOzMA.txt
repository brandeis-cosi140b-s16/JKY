Good "upscale" mexican fast food, if that makes any sense.  Lots of great flavors to be had.  Mixing and matching with the unique salsas (peanut, pecan, cilantro and jicama salsas are standouts) allows for some pretty awesome flavor combinations.

Sort of an odd place, because it the menu feels like it should be a takeout or order-and-take your seat kind of place, but it has a beautiful wood bar that seems wasted on the environment.  If they do carry beer, it isn't in an obvious place (no taps, no display refridgerator).  And they appear to only carry one type of wine.

Just think of the drinks as afterthoughts and enjoy the variety of food you are able to enjoy...
