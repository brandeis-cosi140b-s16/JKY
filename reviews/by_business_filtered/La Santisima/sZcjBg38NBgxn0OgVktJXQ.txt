Food was really good. I had a Quesa and it was not the ordinary quesadilla. The horchata was also unique. I am definitely going back to try the shark tacos. 

I would have given it 5 stars but it was warm in there. In AZ you do not want to go from baking outside to eating in a warm restaurant. There was also only one server working.
