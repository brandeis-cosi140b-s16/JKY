Dear 16th Street,

Please continue to bring it!  Just yesterday a colleague at school told me he thought Barrio Cafe's food was diminishing in oomph.   I disagreed, but that evening, I just so happened to bike over to La Condesa to try out this new gourmet taco place on 16th.

The cursive red neon sign, that word "gourmet" and the dozens of Yelp endorsements ushered us in on a Tuesday night.  Warm walls. Original paintings. Furnishings from Bellas Artes de Mexico.  The most substantial wooden tables and chairs in central Phoenix.  When we had opportunity in our conversation to "knock on wood," we felt a bit shamed by the feebleness of our gesture and the robustness of the table.  Order at the counter from a cheerful and demure young lady, whose accent we could not place.

I linger on the ambiance because others have noted the stellar food.

Your food food for thought:  Come for the two taco meal (with beans & rice (with corn!)), and stay for the fresh and diverse salsa bar.  This isn't Baja Fresh.  This is Condesa cuisine.  Think jicama and orange salsa.  Think peanut salsa. And the creamiest, zingiest cilantro creme salsa!

I must disagree with Lali about the beans: America's Tacos' are more memorable, but you are still right, Lali, on a technicality -- the beans at America's are not pinto...It's a secret. Not really. Ask them.
