La Santisima has a great variety of Mexican foods from many different regions of mexico, with a depth and richness of flavor that is absolutely amazing. Their happy hour is extraordinarily reasonable, but one of my favorite things is the salsa bar. Around 20 salsas with a variety of flavors and ingredients, from a pecan salsa, to old standbys like pico de gallo. I would highly recommend this restaurant to ANYONE, and have brought folks visiting from out of town. Everyone agrees, this is the best of the best.

P.S. The place is definitely cozy. I would recommend coming in during happy hours if you are trying to avoid a crowd.
