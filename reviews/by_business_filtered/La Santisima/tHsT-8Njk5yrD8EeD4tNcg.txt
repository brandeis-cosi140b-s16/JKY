Let me start by saying that I absolutely love Mexican food (so I believe I have good taste)  and these tacos were literally the best I've ever had ! 

So many salsas at the salsa bar, which is like candy land for someone like me! I had the chicken taco and a shrimp taco (with beer batter) and my sister had the cactus tacos. We born enjoyed our meals quite a bit although my sister liked the cactus tacos from two hippies beach house better (she's vegetarian). 

They were so good you must try!!! I am very picky about Mexican food and only enjoy authentic flavors. The beans were underwhelming , but it's a taco shop, so this rating is based on tacos. Will def be going back the next time I visit Arizona!
