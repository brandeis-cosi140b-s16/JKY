I've been here twice and I was not disappointed either time. First of all their salsa bar as one of the best I have ever experienced as far as choices and taste. There are tacos and quesadillas are top notch. This place is one of my top five restaurants for Mexican food. I also like that when I get my plate the food is piping hot and you can tell the ingredients are fresh. I find their prices to be very reasonable and their staff was kind and attentive. If you've never been here you have to check this place out. I'm certain he will not be disappointed. :)
