Oh hells yes!  I had driven past this little gem several times and never really gave it much thought.  That is until a friend of mine invited me to join for a bite.

Some may say this place is small, but I say it's quaint.  The menu is pretty big, lots of veggie options:)  I ordered the veggie burrito (mushrooms, spinach, cheese, rice,  etc.) and my friend ordered a few different types of tacos.  I was excited to see how amazing the salsa bar was!  I opted for a creamy cilantro sauce.  It totally kicked up my burrito!!  I could order that burrito each time and use a different salsa and never get bored!  

The service was top notch and the prices were very reasonable.  Two very enthusiastic thumbs up!
