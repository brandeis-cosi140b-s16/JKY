I was excited to try this place out but after the bad customer service I walked out after 15 minutes of waiting there. I went with my husband and 6 year old son and as we walked in we saw it was busy. I didn't mind it being busy or waiting but after 5 minutes of waiting and none of the waiters greeting us and just passing by over and over again I started to get annoyed. So we stood there another 5 minutes as another group of people came in.  A couple minutes later the waiter went to them and sat them in an empty table he had just cleaned off. I was in disbelief and told my husband that it was time to leave. It was a waste of 15 minutes just standing there. I have never written a bad review before but how we were treated was awful and I hope they see this review.
