Just go here. You won't be disappointed.

The atmosphere is cozy and hip with rustic tables and chairs and dia de los muertos artwork lining the walls. The staff is FRIENDLY. I can't emphasize that enough. I have been for lunch and they handle the crowds well. At dinner, and during slower traffic times, they are very attentive and ensure that you have everything you need.

The food. Where do I begin. I will start with the amazing salsa bar. They have about a dozen salsas per day. Fresh. My favorite is the seven chile salsa which is simply roasted chiles and red onions. They are all amazing though.

As far as the tacos, I have only ever eaten the pibil and the mole, and that's because they are so good, that I can't branch out yet. Every time I go, those are the ones I am craving. The pibil is so good that it makes me fully appreciate Johnny Depp's character in "Once Upon a Time in Mexico" having such a love of good pibil. 

If you go at lunch, go before 11:30 to beat the crowd. This is one of my favorite places to eat. Hands down. Get some horchata to go as well. They top it with fruit and pecans. Yum!
