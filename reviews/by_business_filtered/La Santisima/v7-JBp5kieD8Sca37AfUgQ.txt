I've been to La Condesa three times this week for the mole chicken tacos. I think about them all the time. This place is cozy inside with a big salsa bar which I'm working my way through.  Be sure to try the cilantro cream! The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because service can be a bit slow, even when there are only two tables of people. And also, I nearly lock myself in the bathroom every time because that darn latch is so hard to open.
