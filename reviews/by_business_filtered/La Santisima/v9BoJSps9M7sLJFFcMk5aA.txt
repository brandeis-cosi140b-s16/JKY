Fantastic. I had gaucho borro, was delicious but I should have added rice and beans. Margaritas were tasty too. Guacamole was from perfectly ripe avocados, which I really appreciated.

If you go at night, don't be discouraged by the total lack of lighting outside. Inside the food was great and staff was welcoming.
