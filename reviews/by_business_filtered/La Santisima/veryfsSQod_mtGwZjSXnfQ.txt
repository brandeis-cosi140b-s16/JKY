Thanks to Yelp I discovered this Amazing  Taco gem on the way to a meeting down town. 
La Condesa has a great salsa bar. The margaritas are tasty too!
Love the selection of tacos on the menu. 
The tacos were so delicious that when I started eating, I texted my husband to go there on his way home from work. Luckily he made it there before I had to take off to my meeting, and agrees, the food is amazing. 
The carnitas is my favorite. 
I cannot wait  to go again.
