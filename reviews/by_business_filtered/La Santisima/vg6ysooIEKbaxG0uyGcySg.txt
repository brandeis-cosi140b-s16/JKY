I love this restaurant. It can sometimes be difficult to find solid mexican food, but this place nails it, bringing dishes from various regions in mexico, but mostly central and southern. 
The salsa bar is fun, it is great to find a dish you like and experiment with new salsas.
The negative of the place is also its charm, but it is small and usually very busy, so expect a 10-15 minute wait. 
My favorites are the burritos, with a grapefruit margarita.
