This place has classic tacos from Mexico D.F. and a really great salsa bar. The peanut salsa is unexpectedly spicy, and the cilantro salsa is a personal favorite of mine. 

I'm a fairly unadventurous eater. Once I find my favorite, I like to stick to it, but that's pretty much impossible here. I want to try everything, and think that over time, I'll eventually get there. Until then, my top recommendations are the street plate with at least 1 mole taco. You'll be upcharged, but if that's your only reason for not trying this piece of delicious, message me for a stronger sales pitch. The point of this place is that if you know what you like, or even if you don't, you'll find something here. Everything tastes like a really good version of what you'd expect at a price point that can't be beat.

Pro tip: toss some cilantro salsa in with your rice :)
