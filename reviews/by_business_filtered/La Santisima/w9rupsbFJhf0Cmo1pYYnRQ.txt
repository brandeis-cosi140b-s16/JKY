This place has some of the best food I've eaten. Even the tortilla was superb! Any downside with limited parking and a slightly cramped dining area are quickly forgotten when you take your first bite. There is a great selection of salsas at their salsa bar, ranging from mild and tasty to hot hot hot and tasty. Staff are pros and friendly and will help with the menu if your not sure what to order or if you have any questions. They also seem perfectly willing to make accommodations if you ask for substitutions or additions to your order. This is a definite must try place, cause you'll love it.
