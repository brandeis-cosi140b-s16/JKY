My parents taught me, "when you don't have something nice to say, then don't say anything at all."

Yelp has taught me, "when you don't have something nice to say, tell it like it is."

Sorry mom and dad, Yelp FTW!

I like my restaurants how I like my style, un-cramped; unfortunately, this place is packed full with wall to wall tables and chairs leaving about 3 inches in between you and the guy at the table next to you. Don't plan to come here during the lunch rush with a big group, you're lucky if you can fit one or two people through the door. The parking isn't that appealing either, you are practically parked in the middle of 16th street traffic. :-/

La Condesa makes a pretty good taco, and their salsa ain't bad either. To their benefit, they do have some fairly unique salsa's to choose from, such as strawberry, peanut, and pecan; but in my opinion, unique doesn't necessarily = awesome. Any of their tacos will do you right, but my favorite is their pork.  

In my opinion, and lets face it, if you're reading my review, that's exactly what you're looking for right? La Condesa over stated when they went with Gourmet in the name. Sure, everybody likes their taco's but who wants to pay $9 for two tacos and leave feeling like they were packed in like sardines in the middle of a seedy neighborhood? If it isn't obvious yet, I don't plan on coming back soon, I can take or leave their salsas and tacos and wouldn't be bothered either way.

Happy Yelping Phoenix, hope you find that hidden taco gem you've always been searching for.
