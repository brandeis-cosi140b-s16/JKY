Yum! I wish their space was bigger and had something further on the northside but that is honestly the only thing I can say negative about this place. I have never had anything that I didn't like. Everyone who's visited me has wanted to come back to Phoenix to eat these tacos. If you go during a normal meal time expect to wait probably at least an hour. But it's all worth it!
