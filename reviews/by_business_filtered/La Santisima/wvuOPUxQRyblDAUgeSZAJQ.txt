Stunning variety of fresh salsas that cover the spectrum from salsa fresco to a cabbage salsa (the night that we were there) and it is my understanding that the salsas are created daily and vary from day to day.

While the salsa selection is incredible, I was encouraged to order an Aztec Tinga Taco. While I enjoy slathering salsa on virtually any Mexican food offering, I found that the Aztec Tinga Taco was so perfectly seasoned that it require no additional seasoning. Perfect.

Can't wait to go back again.
