Food - OK. Had cochinita pibil tacos with beans and rice. I found bone and thhe flavor wasn't all that great. Husband had a quesadilla - way too greasy. Napkins couldn't soak up the grease fast enough. Salsas available, because some were empty were quite tasty.
Ambient- sound bounced of the walls and couldn't really have a talk with out contributing to the already loud room. Lighting not great. Beautiful mexican culture inspired art. Loved it.
Service- not good. Sat us down and then disappeared had to stop them and ask any of the employees to put in our order, refills, and our check. The worst part was... there wasn't that many people.
Other- loved there terra cota plates. Cups were paper cups, and they had nice silver wear. Couldn't figure out whether it was nice dinner restaurant or just a dive.
