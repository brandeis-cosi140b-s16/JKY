As much as I love their veggie quesa and amazing salsa bar, I am taking them down a star because I found out they use lard in their rice and beans.  As a vegetarian, this really limits the menu items I can eat.  

Veggie quesa is pretty much the only thing I can get.  It is fantastic so it is worth going just for that.  Actually, I'd probably even go just for the salsa bar.  But I wish I could explore other options too.
