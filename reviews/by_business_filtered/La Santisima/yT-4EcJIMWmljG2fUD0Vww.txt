You would miss this place if you drive by it in a random small strip mall on the side of 16th st, but the muerte that is so beautifully decorated outside will catch you! My first trip to La Condesa was great, the music is very authentic, almost like Latino pop. But the FOOD- lets talk about it... First you get chips and you wonder, where is the salsa lady?! But then you realize that amazing salsa bar at the back of the restaurant is where you get to pick out your salsa! My favorite was the strawberry salsa it was so unique, I've never had something like that before- and it was fresh fresh fresh! Then there's other usual salsas and more fun ones, probably about 12 or 14 to choose from and lots of lemons and limes.

I had the tinga chicken tacos and they were very spicy, but I like spicy! But if you don't like spicy do not order them, they have an after burn and don't require salsa. The amount of chicken on the two taco plate was amazing for $6.99! 

TIPS-

Try the strawberry salsa
