What can I say? Fucking delicious, which in my vocab is the equivalent to a five star review. WOW! Amazing salsa bar with bland salsas for those scared of the real hot ones, along with some AMAZING tasting salsas that are hot but even so, you cannot stop eating them! 
The chips brought to the table as an appetizer aren't the best but that was about the only complaint I had. I ordered a Pepsi and it didn't taste like it had sugar at all so I returned it and the girl gladly exchanged it and didn't give me any beef about it, she was so chatty friendly and witty and she recommended the Cochinita Pibil Quesadilla, and I said oh hell why not? Lets have it as an appetizer while I waited for my friend to get there, well was I in for a big surprise! It was ORGASMIC, with some of the best cochinita pibil I have ever had in my entire life, so warm and with the perfect level of spicyness, I even added one of the hot salsas on top to the quesadilla, it was even more delicious after that, and the queso fresco it had on top was just to die for. 
I was actually way too full to even finish the quesadilla, and way too full to even order one of their delicious tacos which according to my friend, were also orgasmic. I cannot wait to go back and will definitely become a repeat customer.
FYI, the girl told us that they are supposed to have a bar soon, but in the meantime, each guest is allowed to bring a beer into the establishment. WAY COOL. 

Super lugar, de lo mejor!
