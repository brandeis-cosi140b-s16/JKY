Decided to take my dad on a lunch date to La Santisima. We were both more than impressed with the taste and presentation of the food. I purchased a two taco plate and was stuffed like a turkey on Thanksgiving, well worth it! The salsa bar was amazing, so many options, you can't try them all in one sitting. This definitely means I'm going back for more!
