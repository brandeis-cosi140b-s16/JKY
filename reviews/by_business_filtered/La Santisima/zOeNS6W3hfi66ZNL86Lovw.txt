I went with a friend over here after work one night on a recommendation. I loved my food it was much bigger than I thought and more gourmet to. I was expecting a little cheese crisp filled with meat, but it was so much more than that. I had a margarita that was really good but I think it was grapefruit all it says on the menu is margarita's but no description of any of them.

The place was very tiny and cramped, but it was colorful in a good way and was not super busy. The service was a little slow and it was our first time so it took a while before they told us you get your sauce's from the little bar.

I will be back in the future, overall it was a good price and taste food.
