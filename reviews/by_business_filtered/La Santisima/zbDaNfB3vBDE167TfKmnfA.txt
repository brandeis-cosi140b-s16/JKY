I have been here twice and both visits were enjoyable.  The food is amazing and the portions are generous.  It is fun to order and share among friends since there is such a variety on the menu - definitely many flavors to suit every palate.  The salsa bar is eclectic and amusing and brings a great point of conversation to the table.

This is a great addition to downtown Glendale.

I was disappointed by the slow service provided at both visits.  The staff plays music from an mp3/iPod but we had to ask several times to turn it down because we could not even here each other talk over the volume of the music.  It was a feature that I could have done without.  These are easy fixes for the management and staff.
