Really great salsa bar, tacos, quesadillas and burros.  This is 'authentic' mexican; not Macayos.  
A few downsides though, it is really small & not really built for families or large groups; plus, I wouldn't park in the neighboring streets.  I got yelled at by one homeowner saying if they saw my vehicle again they're having it TOWED!.
