This place was an incredible find. We trusted Yelp on this one and it did not disappoint! The only knock (and it was no surprise if you read the reviews) was that it was pretty small so they run a pretty small crew.  With the 15 or so different salsas at the homemade salsa bar and the late amount of food we got, we were not in any hurry to leave!

We will definitely be back here soon!
