Good homestyle Mexican cooking. This place has absolutely no frills. It has a huge menu, as well as a small market and panaderia. You order at the front and grab a table until your number is called. I absolutely melt over their sopes (both the shredded beef and carnitas are delectable) and their burritos are massive. Definitely a place with large portions. The prices are OK for what you get, though certainly not a bargain. 
Last time I went they messed up my friend's order. They were very polite and apologetic, and fixed the problem quickly and with a smile. Overall I love coming here. Great Mexican food in the heart of Phoenix.
