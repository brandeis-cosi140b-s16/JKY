What can I say, Mexican food wonderland! I had the Torta Cubana (basically everthing in teh entire world plus an egg) that was the best I've ever had, and I'm a total torta whore. Wifey had the Chilaquiles, which were pretty spicy so beware. They had a great looking menu and the prices were just right. Wifey isn't crazy to come back, but I'd get that torta if I was in the area and wanted to eat until I puked...which is a compliment
