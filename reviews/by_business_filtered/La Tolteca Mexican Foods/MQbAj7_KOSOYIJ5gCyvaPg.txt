went there today @4 right after wk.. the manager took care of what happened yesterday.. I took the chance again and order 2 carne asada burros again,but told them to cook the steak in there grill(they use real charcoal!!!) the girls told me that it's going to take 20mins extra.. I said that was fine.. sure enough.. the carne asada tasted waaaay better!!! wow!!!!! still needs to  improvement..
