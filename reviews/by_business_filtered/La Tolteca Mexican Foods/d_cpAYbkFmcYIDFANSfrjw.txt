We are from out of town and was staying at a local hotel. Our family loves hole in the walls. On our way out of town we saw this place and decided to stop in. I love the smell of the authentic Mexican establishment. We were behind 6 fireman that were ordering their lunch. Watching their food be prepared was a treat. But not as much as our treat when we ate our food. We had the shrimp salad, shrimp burrito, and chicken taco. Everything was great, great, great!
