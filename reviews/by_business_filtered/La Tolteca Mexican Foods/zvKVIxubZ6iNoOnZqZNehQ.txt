Atmosphere inside is kinda like a Mexican version of Chompies -  good sized counter restaurant flanked by market and bakery, oozing ethnic energy.  More intimate (and less overwhelming) than Ranch Market; a plus for tentative gringos like me.  

It's a lengthy and fun menu to pore over and the place is airy enough that no one glares at you if you take extra time figuring out what you want, before stepping in line to order. My carne asada torta was really satisfying, smeared with guac, grilled onions and juicy beef on a nice, crunchy roll. My kid didnt get too excited about his chicken enchiladas - just average he said.  Next time we'll try something a litle more exotic, maybe grab something from the bakery. 

To be frank, I wasnt real comfortable in the neighborhood outside. Cant say if that's objectively reflected in crime statistics, and nothing bad happened to us, but there's a slew of chop shops and homeless/marginal looking types milling around and I spent part of our meal worrying about the semi-hidden laptop back in our car. We went Friday at 2PM, a fairly quiet hour, and maybe the vibe is busier - and safer - on weekends or at noon. 

Hate saying that, cuz La Tolteca's a cool place worth visiting, and the surroundings obviously arent their fault, but next time I might take the bus,  "travel light" as they say, and enjoy the entire experience a little more.
