Love this place for breakfast and dinner. The lunch specials I've tried so far are only ok. Do not order guacamole on its own for chips. It's a smashed up avocado on a plate with salt. Not yum, but if you get a meal that comes with guacamole, it's good. Good carnitas. Not crazy about the carne asada. 

Crazy about the salsa. This is another Mexican restaurant where I'd dive mouth first into a vat of it... Anyway, go here for breakfast or brunch if you haven't already!!!
