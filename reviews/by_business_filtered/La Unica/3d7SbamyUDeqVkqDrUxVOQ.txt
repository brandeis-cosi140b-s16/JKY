As a Mexican-American with an Abuelita that is a stickler for traditional Mexican food, the hunt for an authentic Mexican restaurant in Charlotte has taken many years. I finally found one that makes chilaquiles, and even better,  just like hers! Chopped fried tortillas covered in a creamy tomato sauce con pollo y queso, this warm and cozy dish took me right back to Abuelita's kitchen in East LA. 

My boyfriend and I loved the food so much, I asked him to bring me here for our one year anniversary. I didn't need a $7 frou-frou margarita to celebrate, I needed food my Abuelita would approve and a cold glass of horchata (a sweet rice drink, don't be scared to try , it's great for cooling off the spicy salsa!).

La Unica sits in a surprising location, but the packed tables should tell you this place is worth the drive from Charlotte. If you're looking for traditional, no-frills Mexican, come here!
