Of the many Mexican restaurants around to choose from, this is definitely the best. I've never had a meal from La Unica that I didn't enjoy. Lately I've been on a taco kick - I love their shredded beef tacos & their carne asada tacos - authentic with cilantro & onion on soft corn tortillas. They also have some of the best horchata.
