My family and I tend to be very picky about their tastes, but this place hits the spot for everyone. Do you have bland tastes? Pollo Fundido Dinner is perfect. It's not overly spicy, and just has chicken, sour cream, and cheese! Like seafood, they have that too! This place is super delicious and the staff are super awesome. If you're hungry, here is a perfect place to go.
