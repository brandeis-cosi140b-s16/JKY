Great food at a great price.

Friday night-  5:00pm, dinner

Food:  You start off with complimentary tortillas and two sauces one mild, one spicy. The excellently made Chicken Fundido is highly recommended! Good portions. Great food specials, combos. Made to order. Fresh. 

Service: Was great. The place was very busy, however our server was able to give our table a fair amount of attention. Food came out at a reasonable time and was correct.  Did not have to ask for refills on drinks. Did not have to ask for anything. Well done! 

Price: Best value and great food for the price in the area for Mexican. Most entrees under $10. Also combo deals, lunch specials.  

Other: The place is very busy during dining hours. Because it is very busy, parking has become an issue. The restaurant is placed along a strip of other stores. Some of these stores have blocked off parking areas for their customers only (not that they have many customers as it is). By doing so, the limited parking during peak hours, have become even more limited!  

Tip: Try getting there early on weekends in order to beat the rush and also to find a parking spot.
