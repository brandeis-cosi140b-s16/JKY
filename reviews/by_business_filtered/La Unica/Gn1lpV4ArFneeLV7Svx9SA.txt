Food - 2/2
*Simply the best traditional Mexican food in all of Charlotte.  My favorite item to order is the Fajita Steak Nachos.  The steak is so savory and delicious.  The chips and salsa that they bring out are excellent.  They'll bring you both mild and hot and watch out because the hot is HOT!  I end up mixing the two together.  I've never had anything here I didn't like.

Service - 1/1
*Fast and very friendly.  Some of the staff are some of the most personable and friendly staff I've ever had.  You're food will come out fast!

Price - 1/1
*Appropriately price in the $7-13 range.

Atmosphere - 1/1
*You don't expect much.  This is a hole-in-the-wall and I wouldn't change anything about it.  They recently expanded and it's made a huge difference for traffic flow.  This place is always busy.  We've learned you need to arrive before 6pm or you better be prepared to wait.  Side note- traffic coming down Old Monroe from Matthews is horrible around 6pm.  It could take you 30 minutes to get to La Unica from the 485 exit.

Overall- my favorite traditional, authentic Mexican food.  I find myself craving this food.  It's the best.
