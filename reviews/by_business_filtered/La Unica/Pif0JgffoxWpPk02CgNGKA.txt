I love everything about this place. I've been coming here for around 4-5 years now, which means they're doing well. In fact, they're expanding into the building next door. Every meal comes with free chips and salsa. This is pretty standard for a Mexican place. The salsas come in two flavors: mild (which is thinner and very tomato-y and garlicky) and spicy (which is a lot chunkier and has onions and cilantro mixed in). If you ask your waiter or waitress, you can get a green salsa and a brown salsa in addition to the two you are given. The brown one is really spicy. The green one looks like guacamole and it tastes like green chiles. As far as the food goes, I'm vegetarian and I usually get one of the vegetarian dinners. Vegetarian Dinner #1 is my top pick (bean burrito, cheese enchilada, and rice). The rice and beans are also very good, but the rice isn't exactly exploding with flavor. Another thing I like about this place is the consistency. If you like something, it will always be that good every time you come back. But, above all else, is the great service. If you go there enough, they pick up on it and know you by name (or at least by face) and they will come over and say hi. Best Mexican Place I've ever been to!
