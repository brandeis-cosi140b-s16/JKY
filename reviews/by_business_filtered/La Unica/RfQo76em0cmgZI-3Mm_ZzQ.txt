Hands down, the BEST Mexican food in Charlotte. If you go to this place and order a normal Tex-Mex entree you a SERIOUSLY missing out. Order the traditional tacos, carne asada, carnitas, arroz con pollo, sopa de pollo, etc. You will NOT be disappointed. 

The staff is awesome. They always greet me upon entering and the manager always makes time to come visit my table and say hi to my son (he's 2 and this is his favorite restaurant).

It is ALWAYS packed. But absolutely worth the wait.
