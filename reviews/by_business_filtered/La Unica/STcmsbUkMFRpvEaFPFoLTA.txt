My favorite Mexican food in Charlotte! I go out of my way to go here whenever the craving hits and it never disappoints me. I love the vegetarian options and the queso! My only qualm is that you can't be seated until your whole party is present -- which is kind of a drag if you're meeting up with a bunch of people. Worth it though!
