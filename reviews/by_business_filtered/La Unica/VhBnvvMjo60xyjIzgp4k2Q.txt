If you really like Mexican food, there's no better place in Charlotte than La Unica.  Driven by it for years, never paid any attention until a coworker took me to lunch.  OMG is it good.  The food is hot and fresh, staff is friendly.  Free chips with two types of salsa just for showings up...gotta love that!

It's busy because it's GOOOOOOD.  Seriously skip the chains and step up to the real deal.
