Seems to be a very good rendition of very traditional Mexican fare (if you are looking for some sort of modern mexi-texa-cali fusion place, this is not it). As we were seated we were started with two salsas, mild & hot along with very fresh chips.  Our waitress was very attentive despite working numerous tables.  Our Fajitas were served "fresh" and the Tortillas were clearly just made.  Sharing one dish came out to a perfect proportion with a small lunch size leftover to take home along with Salsa.  Awesome find, we will definitely be back.

On a sad note, they do not serve alcohol.
