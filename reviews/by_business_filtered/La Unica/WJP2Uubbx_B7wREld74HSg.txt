Let me first say that the food at this place is 5 stars!! It is so good and tastes very authentic. I give it 4 stars b/c I fully believe that every good Mexican restaurant should have a bar. Mexican without margaritas is unheard of. This place has no bar and not the greatest atmosphere. Just a bunch of tables in a room. Greater ambience and a bar would make this place 5 stars!
