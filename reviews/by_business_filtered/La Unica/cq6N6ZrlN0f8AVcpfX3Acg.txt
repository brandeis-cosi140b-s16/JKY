If you're still searching the Charlotte Metro East for honest-to-goodness Mexican food for cheap, this your "ultima parada" (last stop).  Most people quickly dismiss a strip mall restaurant where the anchor is a Food Lion, but the proof is in the flavor.

The chips are hot and fresh and they offer several kinds of salsa-mild and spicy.  You can even order tomatillo salsa.  The queso dip is little pricey but SOO good.  I normally order the tacos.  Their tacos are two small flour tortillas with minced meat (pork-'al pastor', carne asada, chicken, or BEEF TONGUE) with a little cilantro and onion.  The meats are overflowing on these little treasures.  I think they run about $1.50 a pop.  The rice is not dried out like other Mexican chains and the taco salad puts those Cali-Mex chains, like Chipotle's, to shame!  

La Unica has fast service, friendly staff, and are usually busy on weekends.  Regardless of when you go, you can expect prompt service.  Keep in mind that this particular La Unica doesn't serve alcohol.  But you can fill up on quality Mexican cheaper than a Toxic Bell combo...word to your madre!!!
