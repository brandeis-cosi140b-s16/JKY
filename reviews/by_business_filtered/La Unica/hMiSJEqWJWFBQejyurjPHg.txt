Thank you to all of the Yelp reviewers whose enthusiasm convinced me to try La Unica. Had lunch there today with my hubby. It was exactly what we have been looking for, for nearly 10 years, since moving to Charlotte from Texas. Authentic, fresh Mexican food (without the fuss). 

The menu is extensive and includes a varied lunch menu for quick lunch service, as well as a full menu that has me already planning my next trip. I can't wait to try their 7 fish stew (I passed someone having a bowl of it on my way in). Today, I ordered the Tacos de Asada, because I figured the best way to know if they're legit is to try the Carne Asada... And I was NOT disappointed. The tacos were served on a double-stack of the BEST corn tortillas I've had since Texas, and were filled with the perfect amount of seasoned, chopped carne asada meat. They were served with fresh onions and cilantro over the top, as well as (get this) a whole fire-roasted jalape√±o and onion. HEAVENLY. The refried beans were very good, not the typical sludge you get in other places. The Spanish rice was flavorful and moist, and made a delicious complement to the dish. I added a touch of their house-made hot salsa (chunky-style with heat!) to the top, squeezed a touch of fresh lime, rolled it up, and savored every last bite. 

I was especially impressed with their seafood selections, too many to name, except to mention that every Latino I passed in the restaurant had a seafood dish and looked happy as can be. Next time, I'm gonna pull the, "I'll have what he's having" routine. 

As someone who can't have dairy, I greatly appreciated that there were many options on the menu that weren't queso-laden, sour cream-covered globs of meat and cheese. I do wish I had seen a few more vegetarian options on the menu, which is the only improvement I can note at this time.

My next trip to La Unica will be at a time that I can enjoy a margarita, and I will be sure to report back!
