Very good Mexican food in a very unexpected location.  The restaurant is a bit cramped and always busy.  I've never had a bad dinner here and my GF and I eat here once a month for over a  year now.  The food is always quick and very tasty.  Skip the hot salsa for the chips....too overpowering.  This place is like Azteca minus all the cheesy props and Mariachi band.  The staff is always friendly and will go out of their way to make you happy if the dish you ordered isn't exactly what you thought it would be.  This place is our "old reliable" when we can't decide where to eat out....we default here.  Yum.
