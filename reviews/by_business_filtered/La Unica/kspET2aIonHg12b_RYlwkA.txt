I love this place. The food is fast, and the salsa and chips are good. My orders are never complex but I've never had a problem with service. 
My only complaint is that they are a Pepsi restaurant (usually that's a deal breaker for me) but they get the food right, fast, and reasonably priced so I overlook it and get a water.
