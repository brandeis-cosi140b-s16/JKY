Not very impressed and surprised at all the good reviews. The servers and hostesses were very nice but the food we had just wasn't very good. We had quesadillas, chips and enchiladas and it was rather bland. I probably have high standards because I've eaten a lot of Mexican in other parts of the country, it's generally not very good in NC. It also took 10 minutes after we sat to get service.
