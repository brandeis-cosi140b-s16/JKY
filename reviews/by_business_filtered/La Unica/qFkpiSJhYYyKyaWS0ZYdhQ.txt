I can't understand why this restaurant has such good reviews.  First of all if a Mexican restaurant doesn't have good salsa, run . . . which is what I wish I had done. The salsa tasted like chili out of a can - the hot was dark and the mild was red, which proves it is canned salsa because the hot would have been red too if it had been homemade.  I ordered a shrimp chimichanga and it was small.  The shrimp were cut in small pieces and actually looked like chicken and they charged me $1,50 more than the chicken & beef chimichangas on the menu.    I think I will stick with Mi Pueblo in Matthews where their salsa is homemade and the shrimp chimichanga has full size shrimp inside and the chimichanga is big.
