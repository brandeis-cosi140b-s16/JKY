We've eaten here before, the former times during the dinner rush. Those dining experiences were 100x better than the awful service tonight. We arrived around 8pm tonight, we waited at our table for 15 min before our server opted to take our order. My biggest pet peeve (which is why I hate being seated in a back table tucked away from server stations) is being unattended for more than 10 min ESPECIALLY when it's slow! 

So we finally get to place our order and boom server doesn't know the menu yet. Because apparently what I ordered was a new one for her. Above all, they came back confirming my order thrice, thereafter, one time another server confirming. To top it off, my order came out wrong anyways and our drinks never once refilled. At that point, I've succumbed to their poor service and decided I could skip a meal. At check out, we're asked, "how was everything?" Glad someone else was with me to kindly pass a, "it was great."
