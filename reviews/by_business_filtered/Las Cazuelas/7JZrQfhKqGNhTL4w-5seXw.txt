The boyfriend and I wanted to look for a "mom-and-pop" Mexican restaurant for the casual atmosphere, yet served yummy, simplistic dishes, and we found this place based off the other high reviews. 
Yes, the place isn't busy, which was nice. The gentleman who worked as your cashier, server and buser was extremely courteous - think it was the owner. 
The food was yummy too! I liked my carne asada tacos. It's funny because I always order this the first time I go to any Mexican restaurant to estimate how well their food would be in the future, and the ladies in the kitchen could not go wrong with their cooking style! I honestly wish I copied my boyfriend and got the enchiladas though! 
Although they don't serve alcohol, they do have Mexican sodas, which is a bonus. 
I guess you can also eat outside of the restaurant as well because the gentleman went outside to check on his customers too.
