Authentic Mexican by family owners. Loved the pork and avocado sandwiches swimming in red broth. Mole poblano which was very good , is an acquired taste that may not be enjoyed as much by those expecting Americanized Mexican cuisine.  Try the roasted corn epizote  ( less messy when ordered off the cob.) If you wanted a truly tasty Mexican meal made by "su abuela's" loving hands, this is the place!
