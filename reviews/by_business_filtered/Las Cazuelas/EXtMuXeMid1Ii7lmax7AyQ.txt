I  am, admittedly, spoiled when it comes to Mexican food. My mother's food cannot be beat!

I have lived in Las Vegas for over 10 years and haven't really found a favorite Mexican place...until now!

The worst thing about Las Cazuelas is that it's so small. It would make an incredible sit-down restaurant if it had space in which to sit. But the food is GREAT!
