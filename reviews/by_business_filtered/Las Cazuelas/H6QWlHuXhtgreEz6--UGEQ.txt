Quick Tip: It not an expensive place but it's clean and prices are really good. Also, you get complimentary chips and salsa if u r dinning in.

Restaurant is located right across from target. Its got many other restaurants in the vicinity including a hot dog joint and a boba tea place. It's a competitive area for a restaurant. However, what sets this place apart from others is the authenticity of the food. Mexican food in Henderson is easy to find; Robertos, Lindo Michocan, etc., but the taste of the food items in this place is exquisite. 

My favorite dish at this restaurant is Chicken Mole Enchiladas ($7). The mole sauce is rich and flavorful and enchiladas are in the league of their own. The meat is tender and has the right amount of spices. I could eat two plates of this because of the sauce. Chanclas; which is more like a french dip with avocado and shreaded chicken and its drenched in spicy sauce. Its wasn't my favorite, because the sauce didn't have much flavor to it. Complimentary, chips and salsa is good but salsa did have a lot of salt in it. 

Overall, this is an excellent place for cheap-authentic mexican food. I would highly recommend  you to checkout this location.  Mole chicken enchilada's are to die for.
