We reeeeeeally like this place! First off, the price is totally amazing for what you get. Pretty much everything on the menu is reasonably priced, especially for fresh, handmade, Mexican food. The chicken enchiladas with green sauce are awesome. Their sauces in general are awesome, actually. To top it all off, the service is also top notch.
