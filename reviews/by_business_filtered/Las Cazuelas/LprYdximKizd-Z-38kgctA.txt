I enjoyed everything about this place.  I loved the review from Shirley B and it was a place not to miss.  My wife wanted to try some Mexican Food and of course, I was looking for something very authentic... Glad to have found this place!

a.  Ambiance - 5 Star - Ok, perhaps this may make you think too much, but this place is very basic, very simple and has 4 tables with 4 chairs each.  So approximately 16 people max.  There is nothing very special about this place or decor, but you know what it was simple yet just right for my expectations. Basic is often very good.

b.  Menu - 4 star - The menu is also very basic and if these dishes are available at other Mexican Eateries, I have not seen most of them.  The menu has a limited choice of such foods as Enchiladas, Chanclas, two types of tacos, frijoles, Molletes, Huevos Rancheros and some other choices...

c.  The food - 4 star - As I wanted to go authentic, the most authentic dish that I personally like is Caldo de Res, which I have found only in a few restaurants. This is a beef bone soup with vegetables.  So, when I meant authentic, I meant not tacos, burritos, tamales, and fajitas....  So we ordered:

Enchiladas de Mole Poblano - Chicken in a corn tortilla with the mole sauce.
Enchiladas de Salsa Verde - Chicken in  a corn tortilla with the green sauce.
Chanclas - bread with chicken, avocado and onions with a chorizo sauce.
Molletes - bread with refried beans, cheese, pico de gallo

I enjoyed the verde, the chancels and the molletes very much.  Since I am not a huge fan of Mole Poblano, I have to say that it was good, just not something I would personally order.  The enchilada was great though.  The chicken very tender!

d.  The price - all very reasonable!

e.  The service - Excellent small family style.

GK says to check this place out for some really good stuff.  My next visit will be the frijoles, and the esquires!
