This small ( 4 table) yet quaint restaurant is situated in a small plaza on the corner of Silverado/Eastern.  It is embedded in between Yummy Sushi Grill and Windy City Beefs and Pizza.  It's a great addition to the center as it is not your typical Mexican Food Restaurant.  It is a family owned business and the husband and wife team are very modest and friendly.  You can tell their mission is to showcase their native food from their city of Puebla.  

Our menu consisted of the following:

**Molletes: A split hoagie topped with beans, mozzarella cheese and lots of pico de gallo (chopped tomato, onion and chilies) added after the sandwich is grilled in the oven so the cheese can melt.  Unfortunately, our son is quite picky so he had his with just the beans and cheese...let's just say he licked his plate clean!

Chicken Enchilada Mole:  This is definitely not your average enchilada as it is dressed in a chocolate-rich mole sauce.  Not my favorite but could be YOURS!

**Pelonas: 2 sliders filled with marinated shredded beef fried with a smear of refried beans dressed with sour cream and salsa.  The description sounds nothing extravagant but believe me it will leave you wanting to order more...which we did ofcourse.

Chanclas, slider-sized bolillo rolls filled with shredded chicken and avocado and drizzled with a chorizo-infused sauce...this is definitely worth the mess or a knife and fork will do too.

Like I said earlier on my tip: you may want to look at the menu completely before ordering the tapas like dishes.  On our first visit, we started with one dish, then had to try another, and couldn't leave until we tried one more item!  Finally my husband and I agreed to return on another day as to not explode with all the yummy goodness.

I have a feeling this place won't be here too long (in a good way) as they will need a bigger brick and mortar to accommodate their Foodie Fans!
