I like trying hole in the wall restaurants always looking for that gem.  This one may not have been the gem, but their friendly and fast.  

Don't go here expecting TexMex or Americanized Mexican because you won't get it. They have very reasonably priced dishes and a lot is more ala' carte so you order the parts you want and it is still reasonable. 

It was good and we may return to try some of the other dishes.
