5 for good food on the cheap and good service. It's family owned, and they were really nice! And it's also a bonus that it's really conveniently close to our new place.

What we ordered (in the order of fave to least):
-molletas
-enchiladas de salsa verde
-chanclas (w sauce on the side so bread doesn't get soggy)
-taco arabe
-frijoles charros 
-corn in mayo, cheese, and lime
