Let me preface this with some background- I'm a protege of the chef that put modern southwestern cooking on the map and have traveled extensively through Mexico, and I believe that hospitality and cuisine are a Mexican national treasure. I know Tex-Mex from New Mexican and Tijuanan-Border from Baja-Californian.

This is the best regional Mexican food I've experienced in 25 years living in LV. The mole poblano is benchmark, if not acme, and I haven't had anything on the menu that disappointed. The corn is can't-miss, and the enchiladas verdes are as benchmark as the mole. The passion for food in their kitchen and their ability to execute it far out-matches their humble location and lack of serious accompanying beverage (enjoy the frugality of BYOB here while it lasts). The serving dishes and plating reflect their passion and far exceed expectations.

This might be the Mexican equivalent of Lotus of Siam...
