Going to swim against the current here. I am a big supporter of family owned businesses. This place has gotten a lot of great reviews, in fact so many good reviews that, that is what brought us here.

  The place itself is small and not good for larger groups. The service was good. We ordered red sauce enchiladas, verde enchiladas, tortas, and a quesadilla. the food was tasty, nothing that stood out that was better than other places. We sampled the molle sauce and it was pretty darn good.

Here is my issue with the place; the portion sizes are lacking. Everything is about half the size of what you would get at other Mexican establishments for the same price. It's as if the dining-ware they purchased was from a misses cook set from Matel. Everyone left still somewhat hungry. Even the chips and salsa were small, I think they were single portions but we shared them among 5 of us.

If I'm going to leave a Mexican joint I wan to leave fat and happy.
