This small but mighty little gem in the Target shopping center on S Eastern and Silverado Ranch is wonderful. The absolutely best Mexican food I have ever enjoyed. The mole sauce was terrific as was the fresh corn. Between the four of us we tried nearly everything on the menu. And the bill total was only $65.00 for four people. Very reasonable!

Great food, great service, small but mighty good little restaurant!
