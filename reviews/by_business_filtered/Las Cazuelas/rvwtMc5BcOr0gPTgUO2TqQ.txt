This small restaurant serves authentic Mexican cuisine from the Puebla region.  We arrived shortly after the posted 9AM opening hour, but the doors were locked.  After waiting awhile we were just preparing to depart when the owner arrived and asked us to give him 15 minutes.   On entry we were provided menus, glasses of water, and salsa and chips.  I noticed on the menu that the tacos included parsley versus the standard cilantro.  The owner explained that this was the authentic preparation in Puebla.  We each ordered huevos rancheros which were very high quality and delicious.  I also mentioned that we would come back some time to try the mole and he offered a sample but I did not want to hang around waiting for it to be reheated.
