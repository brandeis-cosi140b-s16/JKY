I have heard nothing but great things about Las Cazuelas.  So, we decided to give it a try for lunch.  The employees were very friendly.  After ordering, we were brought chips and salsa very quickly.  The salsa was extremely watery, which I don't care for.  The flavor was okay, not great, but I've certainly had worse.

I had the chicken verde enchiladas, the wife had the quesadilla arabe, which is filled with cheese, pork and chipotle sauce.  We also tried the beans, mini molletes, and esquites.  My favorites were the enchiladas and molletes.  The molletes are sort of a Mexican bruschetta, refried beans, pico, and cheese spread over soft bread.  I loved the pico, I think next time I go to Las Cazuelas I'll ask for that instead of salsa.  The enchiladas were simple, just shredded chicken topped with cheese and lots of verde sauce.  I really liked the sauce, which made the dish.  

The beans were basic.  The esquites, or warm corn salad, was okay.  I didn't get any lime or spices, pretty much hot mayo, cheese and corn.  The quesadilla was cheesy, but it didn't have much meat.  I don't know if this is how they serve them or if we just got a sparsely filled quesadilla.

Everyone is loving this place and it's getting great write ups in local magazines.  So, it's likely that we ordered the wrong stuff (clearly should have tried a mole dish).  I'll return and give some other menu items a shot.
