My husband and I saw this place during one of our many trips to Target and decided to drop in for lunch. The menu is very limited but it seems like everything on it is delicious and done very well! They offer plates that are very difficult to find at a "fast food" Mexican restaurant - or really ANY typical Mexican restaurant. Very authentic. 

The place is small, but clean. It is clear that the owner really cares about presentation - not just of the restaurant but of the plates as well. 

The mole poblano is DELICIOUS and very authentic. Very very close to the mole my abuela and suegra make. The torta de pierna was also perfect!

When the plates came out my husband and I thought it wouldn't be enough food. As it turns out the serving size was perfect. We were satisfied but not overstuffed. 

I'm definitely looking forward to returning to this place many more times to try everything else on the menu.
