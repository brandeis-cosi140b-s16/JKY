Really enjoyed the food -- a different version than standard Americanized tex-mex. table service is very attentive; but the place is small so when it's busy I'd be claustrophobic in there. I really liked the portion sizes; I get so tired of places that heap on more food than anyone should eat at one sitting since I'm not a fan of dragging it home. Here you can order an inexpensive meal and eat the whole thing; if you want to order more I'm sure they'd oblige! Glad to find a place with Mexican slow-food (in the good sense of that word) near to our house.
