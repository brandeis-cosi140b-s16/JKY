Gloria's is where we go every Thursday for $1.50 tacos and 99 cent margaritas.   It is just down the street; in our neighborhood and where we always go.  We love the place.  The service is good and they are very professional and courteous - not to mention lovely.  To be honest I used to go there in the 70's when it was El Tango (and not as good!).  Now they are on the trail of the light rail and we hope the parking doesn't make things difficult for them but allows them to become one of those institutions along 19th Avenue.
