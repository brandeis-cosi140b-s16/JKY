some of the best dining experiences happen when you almost don't go inside the restaurant. this is the kind of eatery that makes you thankful for crappy strip malls.

sure, the exterior isn't great. and the neighborhood isn't perfect. but this place is small, friendly, clean. the food is excellent

my friend and i tried las glorias because we were in the area and we had a coupon. we were incredibly happy with ourselves after we found this place.

the chips were crisp and fresh. the bean and salsa dips were delectable. the rice was great. the portions were large. my friend said this place reminds her of her very favorite spot from home. she is something of a chile relleno connoisseur, and she said this one was among the best she had ever had. this batter and lots of cheese.

we will definitely be going back., coupon or not.
