Was good. I liked the tacos and they were a great price. I just liked my husband's meal -the chicken enchiladas much better than the tacos. The waitress was very nice and and let us use our coupon from the money mailer even though techinally we didn't order 2 entrees. It is close to home and was a good experience. The only real issue that I had was they only carry pepsi products and I prefer coke.
