It has been all too long since I wrote a review. So, here goes. I almost want to give this place 5 stars, but I would like to sample more food prior to doing so. I found this place because of Yelp. I am new to Phoenix and probably going to be gone from Phoenix all too soon so hopefully I can add a fifth star before I go. I walked in and it is a tiny lil dumpy place in a strip mall as most things are in Phoenix. I sit and the chips and salsa are good but the bean dip they serve with it is out of this world. The free part is awesome so what can I expect for the entree. I reviewed the menu but then was offered the lunch menu which is served until 3pm. I decide to order the fish tacos which are made with Red Snapper and a white sauce. Delicious!! not spicy, but mild and very tasty. It is served on one piece of corn tortilla and served with rice and charro beans. $6.99+tax. Can't beat that either. I was loaded and with tip I was out of there for $10 and a happy tummy. I plan to go back again. I must say this was my fiorst pleasant experience with food in Phoenix. I have been hard pressed to find good food here. Being from Austin and a lover of Houston, I have high expectations for my taste buds and this city has left me disappointed .. until Las Glorias. You must Go.
UPDATE 5/12/2011: FIVE STARS. I had the Shredded chicken tacos today. Cannot wait to return and try a full menu entree this weekend.
