This is my go-to place for a Margarita and good Mexi food within biking/walking distance. 

What we love: 

Fresh chips and salsa, and the bean dip served with is dee-lish 

BIG, CHEAP Margs. Try the Mango, Peach, Mango/Peach. :) 

Fish Tacos. I had never had them before and they were very good. On Wednesdays they are only $0.99! 

Great enchiladas, cheese crisps, and pork tacos as well 

Friendly service. The servers are always impressed (or act that way) when Nico uses his Spanish on them. 

It's nothing fancy or will win any interior decor awards, but we love coming here for a fun experience and always get out of there without spending a ton of dough. Muy bien!
