This place is not good.  At all.  I got the Green Chile Burrito and my friend got the Carnitas.  Both were fairly flavorless and the meat was a bit dry/tough.  I really have no idea how this place has a 4 star rating.  That being said, the staff is very friendly and the service is great.  The food just isn't very good.
