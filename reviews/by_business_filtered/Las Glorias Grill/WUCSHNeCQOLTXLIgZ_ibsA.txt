I was craving chips and salsa and Gloria's gave me a fix. One of my favorite things about this place was the service, I never once ha to ask for more salsa and the house marguerites were just $.99. Next time I am craving salsa I'm coming back here. My wife and I split the 13 combo, we got a cheese enchilada, beef tamale, and a chili rellano. All were excellent and the cheese on top made them great. Five stars because I would gladly come back here.
