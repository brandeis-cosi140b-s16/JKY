Before, I had a handful of places I rotated between.  Now, I can't go anywhere else.  I have loved everything eaten there, particularly the shrimp enchilada.  The chips and salsa and bean dip are addictive and I always eat too much, leading to food coma because I can't not eat all of whatever I order, it's too good!  We've learned to ask for the check, or else it's always a long wait for them to come back, but with stellar food always served quickly, we really can't complain much about that!
