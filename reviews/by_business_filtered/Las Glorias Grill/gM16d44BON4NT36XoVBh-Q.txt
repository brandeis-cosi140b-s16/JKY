I love Las Glorias and eat here regularly. My favorite is the cheese enchiladas combo. The enchilada sauce is perfect, the enchiladas themselves are stuffed full and satisfying, and their refried beans are the perfect amount of spicy. Their green chile is super yummy too.

Chips are always hot, the salsa is good, and service is always friendly. If they're busy they might take a little extra time to get your bill to you, but they always keep the glasses full and the food always comes out promply. One of my biggest pet peeves is when my drinks don't get refilled, and that they always stay on top of that here. 

The decor isn't fancy, but it is clean. Don't let the strip mall outside scare you -- it is cozy and yummy inside!
