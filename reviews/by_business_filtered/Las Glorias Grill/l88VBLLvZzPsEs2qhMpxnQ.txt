My family and I were on vacation and wanted a good Mexican place with fish tacos for my Dad. And seeing the Best fish tacos in Phoenix plaque was a promising sight. I had the carnitas which were well balanced with a refreshing glass of root beer. My Dad of course needed a second helping and has absolutely no regrets. And my mom claims to have had the best carne asada she has ever had. And afterwards  (being an 11 year old boy) I had a large helping of fried ice cream. I certainly enjoyed all of it. It is truly a hidden gem.
