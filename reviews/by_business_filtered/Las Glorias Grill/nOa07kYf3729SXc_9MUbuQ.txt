This is my go to spot, been coming here for years.  The key word is "consistent," there is no shortage of decent mexican food in PHX but I find that the quality/service often varies from visit to visit.  Las Glorias is always tasty and the service is fantastic.  Like all places there are some dishes that really stand out and in this case its the Green Chile burrito - best green chile around.  If you are a vegetarian, i highly recommend the spinach and mushroom enchilada.
