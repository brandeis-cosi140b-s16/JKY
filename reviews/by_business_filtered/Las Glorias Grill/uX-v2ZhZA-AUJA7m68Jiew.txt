Can't believe I haven't tried this before, it's so close to the hood.
It came up on a yelp search for breakfast, decent reviews, why not.
Fantastic, authentic Mexican food... I had Sanoran style enchiladas with over easy eggs...num num
Chips and salsa are great an it comes with bean dip! Love that. I will be back!
