They have a great happy hour at this place, and my friend and I had the good fortune to come on the 99-cent fish taco night. We had a few Coronas, and all the fish tacos we wanted at 99 cents each. And the fish tacos were really good: with grilled whitefish, crumbled white cheese, a bit of lettuce and pico de gallo, and lemon slices for squeezing (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/FoKx_RP4kUM-aiGo3wlUUw?select=Nz2ljtMm2hNpttl8WfdS3g). We left the restaurant very happy, and very full; no need for dinner after that.
