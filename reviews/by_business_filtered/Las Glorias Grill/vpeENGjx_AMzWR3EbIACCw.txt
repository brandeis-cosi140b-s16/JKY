First, it is a little difficult to get to, due to the light-rail construction, but once you do, it is worth it!!

We first used to go there, quite awhile ago, when the owner would come out, and wait on us. 

We've come back, even after moving out of the neighborhood, a few years ago.  They offer up 99 cent margaritas, all day, every day.

Their chips and salsa are so good.  The chips are thin, and probably baked, which means that I eat twice as many!  *wink*  They bring out a bean dip (warm), and a salsa, both of them are very good.

My husband orders Chicken Enchilada dinner (it comes out *sizzling* hot), and I order Shrimp Ranchero Burro.  The shrimps are yummy, nice and plump, and the dnners are presented very attractively.

We used to download a coupon BOGO (buy one-get one free), and order up a few of those 99 cent margaritas.  They still offer up the coupon, but there is no more 99 cent margaritas included.  So today I had a bottled beer, my husband had an iced tea.  The total was under $19.00 -- not bad!

We try to get to Las Glorias about once a month.
