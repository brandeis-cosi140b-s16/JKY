Like the reviews say, you would probably never find it on your own and it won't stand out when you do, but the food was ok. The service was great. The girls were very helpful and friendly. I think only one behind the register spoke English well though. It was very basic. Nothing unusual or different but for what it is, pretty good. Seating restaurant style inside. My friend says it the best Mexican food anywhere. I can't tell the difference between here and Filiberto's, but hey. I'm just a dumb half Mexican white girl so what do I know.
