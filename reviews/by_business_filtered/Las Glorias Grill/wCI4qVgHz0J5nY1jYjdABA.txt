It's just ok.
I was enticed by a coupon for buy one get one free, so if you're interested in checking this place out...check your money mailers!
I've only been for lunch, so I won't speak for the dinner menu....
It's not the place for a power lunch and I don't think the food will overly impress anyone.  Most items on lunch menu are $7 and are a good value.  It's your standard tacos and burritos, but they also have stand-outs like shrimp enchiladas.  
The service hasn't been fantastic, but I'm sure I'll be back.
