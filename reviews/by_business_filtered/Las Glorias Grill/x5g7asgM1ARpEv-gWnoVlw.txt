I have passed this location many times growing up in this city and never thought anything of the place behind Circle K, put once again I can thank Yelp for inspiration after reading a few reviews.  I love that these guys are open at 10 am since that is lunch time for me because I start my morning at 5am.  The salsa was fantastic (always a good sign) and the bean dip was alright but not my favorite.  I love that they have a huge menu of $6 lunch specials.  My waitress told me that the number 7 (2 chicken enchiladas) was the most popular.  I had it with the sour cream and it was absolutely delicious.  The beans and rice were great also, I seen the Wednesday and Thursday specials that everyone was talking about and will have to check those out sometime soon.  The service was good for me but I was the first one there at 10am, I read a few of the negative reviews mentioning that but I enjoyed the experience.  I also thought the atmosphere was really clean and nice, actually was kind of surprised since reviews I read mentioned otherwise.  I don't know what people expect but I was overly impressed with the whole experience.  There was even a flat screen TV and the posters on the wall weren't to much.  I will be back soon.
