Pretty good Mexican food.  Great cheap Margs (just like Chi Chi's used to make!) and really great bean dip to go with the chips.  Yum.  Love the Sour Cream Chicken enchilada/Taco Combo.  The fajitas look very good as well.  

Service is usually okay but it depends on the night.  The strip mall location is not perfect....but go on in and enjoy!
