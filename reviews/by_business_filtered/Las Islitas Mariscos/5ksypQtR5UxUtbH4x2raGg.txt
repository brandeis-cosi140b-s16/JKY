I recommend  this place to everyone that's going to Vegas, after a long nigh out you need authentic Mexican seafood !! You will be born again.. TAXI is bit pricey about $30 from strip but its worth it! ask the front desk for a ride back to strip and one of there employee will take you back for small fee!! A MUST IN VEGAS!!
