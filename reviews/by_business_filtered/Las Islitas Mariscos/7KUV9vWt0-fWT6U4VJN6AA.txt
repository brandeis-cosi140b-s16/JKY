This was the best seafood I have ever had!! Came here on a Saturday morning(right before it got busy). We were quickly seated, placed our order for drinks and got some chips and salsa. We had a party of 5 and instead of each getting our own plates we each ordered an appetizer size platter of different items on the menu. Everything was delicious my favorite was an avocado ceviche, I couldn't stop eating! They had different types of music playing our whole meal. The staff was very attentive and kept the beers coming! We were having such a good time that I believed we stayed somewhere between 3-4 hours. We also though we would have a crazy high bill by the end of our meal and to our surprise it was about half of what we thought it would be. All in all, the staff is great, food is smacking and the environment is fun! Next time in Vegas, this will definitely be a stop.
