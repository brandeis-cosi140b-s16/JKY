My family ordered oysters and prepared oysters as appetizers. Both were fresh & delicious. For our meal we had camarones inperiales, campechana, camarones a la diabla, empanadas de camaron and quesadillas..all of the food was made to perfection and it was super delicious. The michiladas were great and a great cure for our hangovers. My only complain is all the people that go into the restaurant to sell you souvenirs. During our meal a man came around our table and took a couple of pictures...a few minutes later he came back with our pictures developed in a frame and demanded $15! We were never told we had to buy the pictures if he took them. Another lady also came up to us and put a bouquet of flowers in our husbands hands and said you need to give these to your wife and pay me $20. She stayed in our table for a good 20 minutes trying to convince all our men to buy a bouquet. Overall I would say the food is awesome but you should get rid of all the sales persons that go in trying to hustle you for $$
