I went to this incredible mexican restaurant w/ my dad's niece and her family just tonight. When i took the first bite. the reaction was 'holy cow, i have never tasted such incredibility in my whole life!'
What my party ordered was the fish platter that serves six, carne asada because my sister abhors seafood for unknown reasons, and the cuccaracha shrimp. I thought i would not like it, but i was wrong. and the best thing was there was a mariachi band that played continuous music.
for reasons i cannot fathom. The green habanero sauce got me crazy with tastebud scorching. The sauce was so spicy, my nose started bleeding, it was that spicy. The bill was kind of pricey, but after the service, quality, and satisfaction form the meal; i felt that the experience was worth every last cent. Plus, their tortilla chips were not like i would normally see, instead it was like a tostada disc. they were pretty good as well.
As a matter of fact, everything; down to the last piece of shrimp was worth the drive and the expense my party incurred. 

In conclusion, if you are in the mood, for certified pure mexican seafood, big portions, and consistently friendly service...
You have come to the correct place.
