Food was really good. But the reason why I give this place a 2 star is because as a customer I felt that it was extremely shady to charge us $100 a person to watch the Cotto Canelo fight When another group ( with the same amount of people as us ) only paid half. I UNDERSTAND WE PAY TO WATCH FIGHT..YOU GOTTA MAKE MONEY TO SURVIVE BUT then again another group with more than two times the people as us only paid a tad more than what we paid to watch a fight. FOOD IS GREAT BUT AT LEAST HAVE A SET PRICE instead of being shady. I felt robbed and shafted because I was coming from outside of Vegas to visit and really wanted to watch a fight and over payed more than any one there !
