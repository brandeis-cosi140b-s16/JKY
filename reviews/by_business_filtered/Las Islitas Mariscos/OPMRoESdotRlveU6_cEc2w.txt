Some reviews are not purely based on food, this is one of those places for me.  We were in the mood for Micheladas and have been looking for a place to find them GOOD ones not beer and tomato juice.  A Michelada is prepared with beer, lime, salt, and particular hot sauces or chile slices. There are several other optional ingredients.  And ohh soo good!  I have had them at the outdoor swap meet before but it is just to darn hot out right now to go out there and get them.  

So our quest begins... We search the web including Yelp and found this place.  The ambiance is awesome fun and makes you want to have some fun!  We walk in and they have dueling mariachi bands!  AWESOME!  LOL I had a blast drinking my micheladas and hanging with friends and having a snack.

This review is based solely on my experience and my drinks, I did not enjoy my food it was mediocre at best but I would go back for the drinks and the fun time I had.
