Was at Broad acres swap meet one Sunday with my wonderful girlfriend and wanted to try something new for lunch. Our eye was drawn across the street to an interesting sign and full parking lot so we decided to give Las Islitas a try. We were very pleased to see the full restaurant and friendly staff when we came in the door. We were seated quickly and placed an order. While waiting for our meal we enjoyed the mariachi band and took in the decor, very nice. Amanda's oysters came out quickly along with my shrimp Ceviche tostada, both were very good. We've enjoyed their shrimp tacos, burritos, and shrimp diablo. There are flat screens on usually set to football games or news, and the juke box can be a bit loud at times but all in all it's well worth it!
