Iv been here 2 times now with my boyfriend and we're going to keep coming back! There's nothing like ceviche and a preparada for any day of the year. And this is the place to go! The environment of the restaurant feels so authentic!  You could only imagine how the food will be. And the service was as excellent as the food. A little over priced but a great place and I would definitely recommend.
