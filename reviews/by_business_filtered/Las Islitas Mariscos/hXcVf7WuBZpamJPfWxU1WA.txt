I was VERY dissapointed in this place. The service was horrible. The Waitress never asked to take our order, we had to tell HER  we were ready, same with the food and bill. It took maybe 40 to 45 minutes to get the food to us... I had a schrimp cocktail. I was still optimistic because the food at least looked great and was surprised  that it was good, HOWEVER half way through my meal I found a piece of octupus or "pulpo" as it is called which I specifically told her I did not want. I understood it was an error and I still tried to not be upset, UNTIL I chewed on shrimp shells. I can understand if a piece of pulpo accidentally making it on to my plate but crunching down on some shrimp shells is where I draw the line, at that point it is unedible.  I will never come back here and If I'm foprced to come back I will only order a michelada, those were at least decent.
