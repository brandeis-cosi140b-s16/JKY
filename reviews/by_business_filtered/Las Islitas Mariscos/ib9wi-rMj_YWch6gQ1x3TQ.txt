I used to love eating here, the food used to be great. Now the the last 2 times me and my family have come everything has gone down hill. The food has no flavor in anything we got. Like everything is watered down. From the vuelve la vida to the Jamaica to even the French fries. And the service has gone down also. Our waitress only came to the table to take the order and bring the food. "Quote the raven never more". Didn't even Bring us the bill I had to go get it my self from someone else. The people selling movies and flowers came by more then the people who worked there. And for the price so not worth it. They've upgraded many things but took away from the food and service. This is probably the last visit here from us.
