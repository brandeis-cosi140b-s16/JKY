Se tardaron 20 minutos para darnos una mesa y nomas apuntaron donde y cuando fuimos a la mesa no habia sufficiente espacion para sentarnos todos. I had to ask someone else for a chair. Then they brought out the wrong order I order ceviche de pescado and the brought de camaron. Then they forgot to bring out one of our tostadas literally we had to ask. The ceviche de pescado wasn't even good it was bitter like they used old lemons. The fish tacos have no sauce or dressing. The tostada mixta was just plain with no verdura. Y para cabarla de chingar they charged us wrong so they had to give us money in cash cause they charged to much on the card. Not worth the hype. Food isn't that great. Don't recommend it.
