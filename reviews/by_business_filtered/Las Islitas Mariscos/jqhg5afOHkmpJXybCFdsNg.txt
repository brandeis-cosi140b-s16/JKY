If you like hard core ethnic Mexican food, you'll love this place. We go every now and again and are always smiling when we leave. Most of the staff speak little or no English and we have to point to items pictured on the menu, but it's always tasty and they are very friendly. I have no idea of what I ordered, some kind of Asada, but was hella good. Worth the stop.
