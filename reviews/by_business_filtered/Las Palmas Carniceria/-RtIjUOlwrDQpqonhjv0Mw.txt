* Grab a fistful of dollars. $10 will be enough for sampler of tacos and a Coke (con sucre real!). 

* Go here (ideally at noon on a Saturday when everything is hot, fresh and there are plenty of people to chat with in line.). 

* Eat the best tacos in Pittsburgh. 

There's no seating, but you can waltz down to the fire station to find a bench against the fence. Plenty of people can fit here. I find it's good to grab a few packs of the Maria shortbread cookies from the benevolent Goya company while here. They're good for post-taco dessert. Do not reveal that you're a Yinzer raised on Mad Mex by asking for sour cream and guac on your taco. That's tacky. Be the locally-eating globe-trotter by experimenting with the salsa bar. You'll learn to love your tacos with the fresh vegetables rather than the gloopy spreads. 

Remember this isn't just a taco hut. You might also want to stock up on your chorizo and other meats here. You really can't go wrong. And the prices are all far better than Reyna's (bless their intents) in The Strip.
