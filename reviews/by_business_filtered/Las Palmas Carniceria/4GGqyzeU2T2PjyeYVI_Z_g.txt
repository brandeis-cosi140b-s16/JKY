This is the real thing here, people.  Real Mexican tacos on the street from a cart.  When you arrive, you must go into the market in order to pay before ordering your tacos.  They have three types of beef, one sausage and one chicken.  J and I both ordered 2 - one chicken, one beef each.  We also went into the store to get tortilla chips and salsa that you can buy homemade from the butcher counter.  Side note - the butcher counter looked amazing and I definitely need to go back to get some fajita fixings.  But I digress...  the tacos!

The tacos are on fresh soft shells.  Corn and deliciousness in your hand. At the end of the grill, there is a wondrous stand for salsas.  It is filled to the brim with the good stuff - pico de gallo, cilantro, limes, pureed avocado, tomatillo salsa, red salsa...  All spectacular.  I am never one that loves pico de gallo, but this was amazing.  

Definitely the best tacos in the city and for $2 a taco - they really can't be missed.  Come to Brookline and fall in love!
