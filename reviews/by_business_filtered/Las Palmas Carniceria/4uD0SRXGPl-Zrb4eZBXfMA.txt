Wow!  I'm a Californian snob when it comes to Mexican food.  It can't be some fancy place with sit down dining.  It's gotta be gritty and you need to feel like you're the only English speaker.  Then maybe the food will be good.

These guys nailed it.  This place is home away from home.  We had tacos on a snowy day and will not eat any others in the area after this.  How we didn't discover this sooner I'll never know.  But will be making up for it for sure!

Just a caution, if you like staying in your comfort zone and don't like flavor, stay a away from this amazing food experience.
