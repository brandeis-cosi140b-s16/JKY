I may have to go back and change every taco place I've ever reviewed... Las Palmas is now my favorite.

$2 a taco. That's IT. They are super generous with meat portions. And you can go CRAY on their serve yourself toppings. I had cilantro for DAYS. Salsa for MONTHS. Yumville population: me. 

Cash only. Worth it.
