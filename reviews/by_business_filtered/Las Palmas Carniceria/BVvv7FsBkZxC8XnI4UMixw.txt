I am sooo happy to see that this place exists in Pittsburgh.  No offense to my hometown but I am a Pittsburgher living in the San Francisco Bay Area for the past 20+ years.  In California we LOVE our Mexican food.  The more authentic the better!  Unfortunately I still speak to family members back in Pittsburgh who have never hears of a soft taco and who still believe that the big U-shaped Frito that comes stacked in an Old El Paso box is the real deal.  This Pittsburgh is the real deal.  Delicious, fresh and authentic!  I don't hold it against them that they haven't yet tried to expose Pittsburgh to the wonders of tripa and buche.  What they do serve is awesome!  I'll be back when I'm back to visit.
