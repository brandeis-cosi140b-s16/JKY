Thank You Las Palmas.

Thank you for answering the unsatisfied craving for quality authentic West Coast Mexican food I've had for years since leaving Orange County.

Thank you for being that cheap (read $6 for 3 tacos) staple quick food fix when I don't feel like taking the car or bike out to grab some grub.

And thank you for offering not only a great taco stand with a variety of fresh simple dressings, but also an always fully and freshly stocked ethnic grocery store where I can find hard to get items for a quarter of the price that competitors charge.

As I've watched you expand over the past 3 years...  just PLEASE do me a favor, don't lose sight of what makes you great!
