Love the veggie tacos at Las Palmas. What a simple concept they have going; you pick the type of taco you want (meat or veggie), they give you the taco with just the base (meat or veggie), then you add as little or as much toppings as you want. The toppings bar has about 12 different options to choose from. There's several different salsas, fresh limes & cilantro, avocado and onions. With so many topping choices you can dress up each taco different. The veggie taco I ordered came with potatoes and grilled poblano peppers. They even put the tortilla wrap on the grill for a few seconds to warm it up and give it a little bit of a grilled taste. And the prices are great! Only $2.50 a taco!! And just 2 tacos will fill you up. If you're looking for true authentic tacos Las Palmas is definitely the way to go.
