Sooo delicious. After visiting Carnegie Mellon and exploring Pittsburgh, we were starving for tacos so Yelp came to the rescue with this place. We had an assortment of almost all the different meats and all were fantastic. What makes it even better is being able to fix your tacos however you want from their salsa bar. I think I'd like my daughter to go to CMU so we can go visit her and get tacos :)
