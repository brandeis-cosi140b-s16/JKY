This is a great and friendly store!!  There aren't very many Mexicans in Pittsburgh and I was glad I found this taco stand/grocery store.  I tried the al pastor and carne asada tacos...the were both decent.  Doesn't compare to Chicago tacos though, but for $2, they are pretty big.  

The store inside, the clerks were friendly and helpful!
