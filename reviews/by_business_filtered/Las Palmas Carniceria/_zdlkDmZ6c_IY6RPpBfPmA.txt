Great prices even better food! These tacos are phenomenal they have choice of beef chicken or pork and you get to dress the tacos yourself I got a chicken taco one day and the gentleman working stand told me "that's a hot one amigo be careful" I've never eating anything so hot in my life and as hot as it was it was so good! I've turned my cousins on to these tacos and there isn't a person I wouldn't recommend these to! Rain shine sleet snow that taco stand is up so next time you want tacos or you want just a nice quick cheap meal look no further then Las Palmas! And the taco stand isn't the only thing las palmas has go inside they have fresh fajita mix produce a meat counter and like a million types of hot sauce! Go in and try Las Palmas
