Having just recently found a love for the humble taco, figured I would give this place a try on a tip from my new roommate. His review was quite accurate. The food put out by Las Palmas is tacos the way they are done south of the border. If beef tongue is on the menu when you stop by, definitely go with that! It may sound weird to you, but trust me, try it once and you will gain an entirely new appreciation for beef.
