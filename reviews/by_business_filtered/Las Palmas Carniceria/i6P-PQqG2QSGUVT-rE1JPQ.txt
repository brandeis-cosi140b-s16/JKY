AMAZING!!! I love the tacos here! They are the best that I've had in Pittsburgh! They have a grill outside with different types of meat selection and flavors such as chicken, beef and pork. My favorite is the beef (res). Each taco is $2.50. You can make a meal out of it with two or three tacos. I like going to Chipotle but this place has way better tacos and for a cheaper price. There is just no comparison. After getting your tacos, there is a salsa bar which you can pick what you want to put in your tacos. 

There is also a little Hispanic grocery store. They have a variety of meat and veggies. I like buying the pre-mixed meats which you can just throw it in a frying pan and cook it very easily.

I highly recommend getting the tacos from this place! Only down side is that there is no place to sit and enjoy.
