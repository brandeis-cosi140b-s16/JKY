Authentic cheap eats.

At $2 a taco, you really get a bargain because these authentic tacos will delight the Pittsburgher sick of the watered-down Americanized versions of tacos commonly found in the Pittsburgh area.  High quality meats, authentic double layered tortilla and a fresh salsa bar will fill you tummy with delight.

Service is casual and friendly; however, since these tacos are best when ate immediately after preparation, you may end up eating outside or in your car.  Even though the atmosphere is lacking and there is no seating available, these tacos are worthy of the drive from anywhere in town and the wait in line, so if you find yourself on the south side of the tubes, Las Palmas is a must-try.
