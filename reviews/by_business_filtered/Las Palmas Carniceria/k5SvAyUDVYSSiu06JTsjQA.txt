These tacos were so good.  I went two days in a row...  Being from Atlanta I am used to authentic mexican food and this hit the nail on the head. 

- Huge portions of great tasting taco meat for 2.00- 
- Wonderful salsa bar to dress your tacos however you like
- Everyone there is extremely friendly  

Would be great if they had a few tables, but half the fun is the street cart atmosphere. 

They are seriously wonderful and my favorite out of the dozens of places I have had tacos in Pittsburgh.
