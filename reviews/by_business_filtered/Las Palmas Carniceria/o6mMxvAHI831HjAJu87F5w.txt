This is the kind of street food you'd find in any market or taqueria in Mexico...cheaper, chewier cuts of meats marinated and then seared on the flattop with onions. Simple and delicious. They were only offering the carne asada and ground beef ones today, so I'll have to go back for the tacos al pastor, which are my favorite. The salsa bar elevates this little taco stand above the rest, with a great choice of salsas, pico de gallo and thin guacamole. I don't know if they have them in order from hottest to mildest, but noticed the ones on the right were made from the more fiery chiles, so a note of caution for those of you who don't like too much heat. 

The carniceria itself has a great selection of dried beans, canned goods, produce and dried chiles. The meat market is in the back, and, while I didn't buy anything today, I'll be returning to do some shopping. This Mexican market beats any others in Pittsburgh. 

No seating here, but just on the other side of the fire station next door, there's a bench at the bus stop where we sat and devoured our tacos. Just like in Mexico City...

!Buen provecho!
