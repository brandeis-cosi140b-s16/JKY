I've been here two times in the past month. The first time I had chicken tacos--seriously, amazing. It's just a stand outside where they cook everything and then there is an area with toppings off to the side--so many delicious salsas, some very spicy, some not so much, their pico de gallo is phenomenal as well as their avocado sauce. Most recently when I went I got 2 steak tacos. It's grilled steak, unsure of whether it was marinated or not, with onions in it and it was seriously great. They had a few other meat options besides just chicken and steak.. They have a ground beef, another steak option I believe, some type of spicy sausage (maybe?) can't be 100% sure because I haven't had anything else yet, but I can not wait to try more! There is also a store, the taco stand is just out front. Inside the store they have some pretty neat items as well, although I didn't get to look around as much as I wanted to. Either way, it's definitely a place to check out!
