$6.  Three huge tacos.  

One was pulled chicken which was noting to write home about.  I topped it with one of the really spicy sauces which had my nose running.  The sauce was awesome.  

One was pulled pork.  Wow.  To die for.  So good.  I topped that with a milder sauce (I can't remember which one).  The pork was tender and cooked to perfection.  Plus the corn tortillas.  So fresh.  Squeezed some lime on top.  Fantastic.

One was chorizo.  It was a little heavier than I would have preferred (i.e., greasy) but I guess I kind-of asked for it.  I topped that with the avocado sauce.  It helped cool the spicy chorizo (and my still burning mouth).  Added more lime.  I would like to buy a chorizo and make it with eggs the next morning.

Friendly staff.  Quick service--they fry the tortillas right in front of you.  The corn tortillas are awesome too. You dress your tacos yourself.
