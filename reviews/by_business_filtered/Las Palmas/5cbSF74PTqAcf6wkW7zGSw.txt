Outstanding tacos. Right on the street, very casual street food. Nothing fancy, pay inside and pick up outside. Delicious choices and you can fill up for 7 bucks. Try the avocado sauce, and selection of freshly diced tomatoes, onions, cilantro, and top it off with some fresh homemade salsa pico. Definitely stands as the some of the best carnitas I've ever had, and I'm from Southern California! I know my Mexican.
