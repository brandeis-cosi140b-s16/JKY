Some of the best tacos I've had thus far! The meat is fresh from the butcher next door, and, for $2.50 per taco, it's easy on your pocketbook. There's no place to sit, so it's fun loitering about the outdoor grill and people-watching on Atwood St while eating standing up. Also, it's attached to a lovely little Mexican grocery. Try out some of the candies in the back of the store: I'd recommend the chilli-covered mangos, prunes, or tamarinds. ^_^
