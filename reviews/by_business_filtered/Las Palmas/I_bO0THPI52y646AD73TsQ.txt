After eating here I felt like I had hit the jackpot.  I had wanted so badly to try Las Palmas tacos but with the public bus service being what it is today Las Palmas in Brookline was out of my reach. The hour bus ride there and back I could not commit to. Then I found out there is  a location in Oakland and after class today I walked from Fifth Ave to Atwood to finally have my tacos!!! 

Las Palmas tacos are filled with 3 times as much meat then what I've been served at Taco Bell, Qdobe and Chipotle.  I am sending a warning to those cooperate chains you've got some competition in Las Palmas. I knew going into this the tacos would be big so I played it safe and got two. One chorizo and one steak and onions. The Chorizo may have been a tad dry but all is forgiven for the price of $2.00 dollars.
