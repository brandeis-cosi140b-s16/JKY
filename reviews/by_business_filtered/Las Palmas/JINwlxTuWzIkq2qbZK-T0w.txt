I don't know the name of the tacos that I got, but they were really good and cheap. I want to try the others. I just pointed at two, which I think were pork and the other chicken. I really like the help-yourself toppings bar and their salsa. It was prime taco time so much of the choices were getting low/still being cooked, so I'd want to come back when there's a smaller line and less traffic.
