The BEST authentic Mexican food that I have found so far in Pittsburgh. They bumped the price of the tacos up from $2 to $2.50,  but it's well worth the extra .50. The staff has never been anything but friendly both inside and outside the store and they are willing to help with any questions you might have. For $5 you can get two filling tacos with a variety of meat choices including steak, shredded pork, chorizo, chicken, and ground beef. Be sure to ask for the freshly grilled corn tortillas to avoid any of the older tougher ones (which has only happened to me once). There is a toppings bar off to the side where you can pick from several standard toppings, which include: 3 types of salsa (I advise avoiding the deep red unless you chew on habanero peppers on a daily basis), guacamole, tomatoes, cilantro, lime, etc. There can be a short wait which can be avoided by not going between 12-2PM on the weekdays. Inside they sell great Mexican sodas and snacks. I would recommend eating the tacos immediately so that the yummy sauces don't make the tortilla soggy, but if you can't I've had them put the meat on the side of the tortillas so that I can eat it when I get home without worrying. No matter what time I go it's always worth the wait!
