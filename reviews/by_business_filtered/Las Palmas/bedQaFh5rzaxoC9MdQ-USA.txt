I love tacos. I love cheap food. I love small family businesses. Las Palmas consists of all three of these loves...therefore I love Las Palmas. 

It's $2.50 for one taco, so $5 for two tacos filled with your choice of meat and unlimited toppings. And trust me, they are super generous with the meat and you can go crazy with the toppings, so just two tacos can make a pretty satisfying lunch. 

My favorite is the steak and onions taco. The meat is fully seasoned and the double tortilla is nice and warm. Be careful with the different salsa though because some can be extremely spicy. Double check the spice level before you slather on the salsa. 
 
Overall, I highly recommend Las Palmas as a Mexican option for a mid afternoon snack or a quick lunch.
