This place is my go to spot for lunch! Amazing chorizo, chicken, pork & steak tacos. Can't get much better from a price ($2.50 for a taco) or taste stand-point. The stand is outside a small Mexican convenience store so customers can get drinks etc. from inside. People have to pay inside the store first and then come outside and order the tacos. They have an great variety of condiments including fresh cilantro, guacamole and varied level of hot sauces! Can't go wrong with this place.
