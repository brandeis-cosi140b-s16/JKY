The pork and pineapple taco with avocado sauce and Pico de Gallo is quite possibly the most amazing, orgasmic food to ever have graced the sad, littered streets of South Oakland. There is a certain charm to the sketchy looking exterior of Las Palmas, and the inside also doesn't disappoint. The unbelievable selection of Mexican sodas and the authentic vegetables and pastries brings new meaning to the phrase "dive." 

Go. Yep, I said it, walk on into that shady Mexican grocery store and say "2 tacos please." Then walk your butt right out and live the the taco-induced fantasy that is Las Palmas.
