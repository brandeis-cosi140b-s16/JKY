There have not been super good tacos on Atwood Street since La Fiesta closed.  (Sorry, Mad Mex.)  Thankfully, Las Palmas is here to save the day and provide the East End with excellent and inexpensive tacos.  This taco stand is just as amazing as the one in Brookline.  I recently went by a 50-degree late Sunday afternoon and there was quite the line.  The only downside is that there aren't any nearby benches, but if you can manage to wait for a few minutes, it's a quick walk to Schenley Park.

The store has a great selection of Mexican condiments, beverages, pastries, and fresh produce.  It's smaller than the store in Brookline, but would be a great place for students to shop--it's on par with what Groceria Merante is for Italian food.


PRO TIP: You pay for your tacos inside the store and then they give you a receipt to take outside.
