I've been attending Pitt for 4 years now and nothing makes me feel more love for South Oakland than Las Palmas.

The guys that work the taco stand are really nice guys. I get acknowledged any time I walk by. For $2 a taco, you can't beat it. I'll never look at taco Tuesday at Quedoba the same. Rib eye is def the best quality option for your money, but if u order chicken of chorizo your gonna get a taco very full of meat. I never have to order more than 3 and I'm always full.

The avocado sauce(not sure of its real name) and pico goes on each of my tacos. Sometimes I use a small amount of the yellowish ghost pepper salsa but not always.

Plus glass bottle Mexican Coke, pretty sure it's real sugar Coke and not high fructose corn syrup.
