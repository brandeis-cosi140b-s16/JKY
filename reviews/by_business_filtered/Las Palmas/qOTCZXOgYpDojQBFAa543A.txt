If you're looking for delicious, authentic Mexican food in Oakland, look no further than Las Palmas.  Despite their inexpensiveness, the ingredients are fresh and plentiful.  For a mere $5, you get two tacos made of corn tortilla filled with the meat of your choice (or potatoes, if you're vegetarian), and access to a toppings bar brimming with pico de gallo, cilantro, and salsas of all spice levels that you can slather on your creation.

I came here a couple months ago on a Friday with a friend when it was raining cats and dogs.  In spite of the rain, it became clear within half a block of here that the guys who work here were grilling up goodness.  I ordered the chicken and the pork (carnitas?), and put pico, green salsa, and guac on mine.  The guys who work the grill kindly gave me a bag to help us carry our tacos and shield them from the rain.  The chicken was delicious--tender and moist--and the guac was thick and creamy, and the tortilla shell added a nice crisp crunch.  The pork was a little salty, but was still good.  I washed it down with a bottle of pineapple Jarritos, whose sweetness served as a foil for the savory goodness of the tacos.  They were so good, there were no words exchanged between my friend and I as we greedily gobbled them up.  You know you're onto something delicious when conversation takes a backseat to savoring.

If you're hungry for authentic Mexican goodness, it awaits you past Chipotle and Qdoba a couple of blocks down Atwood.  Go ahead, walk those extra couple of blocks--it'll help you burn off some calories, and your stomach will thank you.
