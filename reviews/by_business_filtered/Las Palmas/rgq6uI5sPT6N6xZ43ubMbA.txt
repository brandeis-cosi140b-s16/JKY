Fairly similar to the other location in Brookline. Basically, what you have is a small Mexican grocery store with reasonably priced produce and other goods. Outside on the sidewalk, during select hours, they run a small taco cart with pork and beef options. Each taco consists of two corn tortillas with a generous helping of meat, and then you get to add your own toppings and salsas. No vegetarian options here, and nowhere to sit outside. Most people seem to just stand around on the sidewalk and eat.

The tacos are cheap and authentic. It's definitely a hole in the wall experience, but quite tasty.
