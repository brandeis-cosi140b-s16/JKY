Best tacos EVER (in Pittsburgh). $2 gives you a decent sized tacos made with two corn tortillas, your choice of meat (chorizo, pork, steak, beef tongue, etc.), and unlimited toppings. They have all different kinds of salsa ranging from super hot  habanero to not so hot tomato salsa. They also have guacamole, tomatoes, cilantro, onions, and more. Did I mention they are unlimited?

The stand is right outside the Mexican convenience store. So if the habanero sauce is too hot for you, you can go in to get some Mexican coke. They also have these guava and other flavored drinks that are quite nice.
