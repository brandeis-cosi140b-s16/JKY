Las Palmas is a religious taco experience. These are no gringo tacos. They are made fresh in front of you and you have plenty of salsa options (from mild to super-spicy), cilantro, and lime to heap on to craft the perfect little slice of taco heaven. I could probably eat these every day, particularly the ribeye taco. I probably shouldn't have written this review hungry as I can feel my mouth begin to water for them now.
