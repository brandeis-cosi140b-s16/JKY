Bland guacamole. Cold bland burrito which came with a small salad of limp iceberg lettuce and pink mealy tomatoes. Disorganized, slow service. This place is the worst. I would have sent my cold burrito back, but the server seriously disappeared for half an hour. Not much else to say about it except that it's probably the worst "Mexican" restaurant in Pittsburgh.
