Service was friendly, but it didn't make up for the less-than-sub-par Mexican food. Basically, every dish that we ordered was the exact same thing except it was either wrapped inside a burrito or laying on top of some nachos. I get that most of Mexican food can be like that, but really? It was obvious that they didn't invest any effort into recreating the dishes. It must have taken them 2 minutes each to make a dish since the ingredients were EXACTLY the same for each dish. 

Blah, even with the Groupon I didn't feel that justified the price of the meal! I could have had a better meal at Chipotle across the street...

Also, the inside felt very plain Jane. It didn't feel like a restaurant... there's no ambiance or decor.
