I have a mixture of feelings about this place.  The decor and ambiance is pretty cool.  They have lots of seats next to a huge window overlooking Market Square, and there's not a lot of cheesy faux-Latino decorations strewn about.  The food is  also good.  It's a little fancy for Mexican, and it's a little pricy for the quantity, but it's interesting and tasty.  The service is where things go downhill.  Patently inattentive and slow.  The drinks were also bad, including the draught beer.  If it was in my neighborhood, I'd probably give it another try; but since it's across town, I'll probably never go again.
