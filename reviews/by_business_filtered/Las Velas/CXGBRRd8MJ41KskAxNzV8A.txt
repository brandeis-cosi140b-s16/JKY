Bobby and I stopped in yesterday. I read online that they had good happy hour specials and we havent stopped in for awhile (New Years 2013 was our last visit I believe..)

So for happy hour, the appetizers are half off (besides chips, salsa and queso) The maragaritas are $2 off- both small and tall. A small is normally $6 and a tall is normally S10. I believe the same price goes for the sangria which is also $2 off for happy hour. They also had happy hour specials on some beer but i cannot remember the beer or the price.

Bobby ordered the margarita and I ordered sangria. I loved my drink and Bobby had no complaints about his. The drinks were strong and we felt a little buzz off of one so I bet after two we would've been *turned up* :p .... We had somewhere to be and could not be on that level though, lol.

We also ordered chips and queso. I'm really picky about queso (Moe's=ewwww) I really liked Las Velas' queso however. We finished it with some chips to spare so we ordered salsa. It was good.. not chunky though :(  I love me some chunky salsa haha.
