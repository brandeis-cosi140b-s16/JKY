I loved my dinner here! My boyfriend and I splurged on this meal. For appetizers, we got fried jalapenos and chips with queso. The queso was alright. The jalapenos were delicious and the accompanying sauce was just so good. My boyfriend got chicken fajitas and loved them. I'm a vegetarian and went with tomatillo enchiladas. Mmmm. Delicious. We finished off the night with churros which were okay. My biggest complaints are that it is chilly in the restaurant, even when we visited in the summer, and that service is a little slow... The waiters/waitresses are not often around. But good food! :)
