Went here before the ballet on Saturday...server was good, food was pretty tasty, not the best Mexican but decent enchiladas for the price--I disagree with another review that said chips are great--pretty bland, but guac was good.  They charged us $13 each for a margarita when the menu lists them as 7.50--one size--we asked the waitress who sent over the manager (bartender also) who said they were in the process of re-printing their menus and there are 2 sizes/prices... that is bait and switch...no one mentioned there were two sizes when we ordered! And 13 bucks for a house marg???-- this isn't NYC.  He didnt want to comp anything, then he said he would comp one drink each---which was fair--then when the new bill came he took 6.00 off each bill.  wtf.  I mean if you want repeat business just comp a damn overpriced drink  already, make the patron happy, and we would probably go back and give it another try.  instead, he pissed off four people who eat out all the time...we won't go back.  Oh, and they took my number and assured me the owner would be calling to discuss our dissatisfaction....rigggghhhttttt.  still waiting on that call
