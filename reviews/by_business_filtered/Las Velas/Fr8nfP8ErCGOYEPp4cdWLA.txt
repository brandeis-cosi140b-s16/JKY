After planning on going to the gallery crawl we just ended of getting dinner and drinks... whoops. 

We decided on Mexican because "its cheaper" but that really wasn't the case here.   The interior is decent.  The bar is set up so its looking towards the windows which opens up the place.  We sat at a table next to the windows and the chips were quick to follow (YES!)  The menu is standard mexican food, nothing really high end.  I wanted the shrimp fajitas but I was turned off by the $18 price point,  i don't mean to be a cheap ass but that seemed steep. I opted for the chicken instead. 

I also ordered a vodka club and a big mojito.  Everything was good!

Pros: Chips and salsa, full bar, solid mexican food, fast service. 

Cons: Pricey for what it is, food isn't as interesting as it could be, no outdoor seating. 

Overall:  One of the best things about market square is sitting outside and people watching so i wish this place had outdoor seating.  I wish there could be seating on top of the patio.  A girl can dream.
