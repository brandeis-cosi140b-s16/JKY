The Mexican food here isn't going to rock your world but it is decent.   The chips and salsa are addicting.   The guacamole is good but not amazing.  I made a lot of so-so choices on the extensive menu until one day I tried the mahi mahi tacos, which have become my go-to on the menu.  The tacos have avocado, pico de gallo and some kind of creamy chipotle sauce. Topped with fresh lime, it's very flavorful.   They also come with a healthy side of beans and rice.

The turnaround at lunch is very quick and you can stop here before a show in the evening with no wait.  I also love the margaritas, particularly the mango one.
