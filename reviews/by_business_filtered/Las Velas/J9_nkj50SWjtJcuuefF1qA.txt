Soo where do I begin ... Okay well I have to say the chips and salsa were delicious but it seems after this point that things went down hill, I ordered one of those Carona margarita drinks , and I drank about half of it, it was delicious , all of a sudden I take another gulp and I begin to chomp on what I'm assuming is ice- to discover that the "Ice" I'm chomping on is quite gritty and um painful, did I just loosen a filling ? Upon spitting it into my hand I realize its GLASS , my guy friend waves down a waiter who feverishly escorts the drink away and comes back with a new one . After this I was just looking forward to my meal, which happened to be gross . The chicken was cold and slimy and they gave me flour tortillas when I specifically asked for corn. The servers were not very attentive and seemed liked they could care less about being there. Will not be returning.
