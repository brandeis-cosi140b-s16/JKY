The chips and guacamole/salsa are not free, the waiter charge $2.50 for the chips and salsa and then $3.50 for the guacamole. It was disappointing since both the salsa and guacamole tasted mediocre.

I ordered a frozen margarita that was more poorly mixed than one I ordered a month ago. My meal was extremely "wet" for lack of a better word. I had a spicy Mahi Mahi dish, which was ok, but not great.
