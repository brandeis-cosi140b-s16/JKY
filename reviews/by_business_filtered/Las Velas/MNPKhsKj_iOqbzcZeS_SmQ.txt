my coworkers and I go here for lunch all the time.  the guac. is great and always a must for us.  The food always tastes fresh and delicious.  We love it and can never wait to go back!  the service is okay, but I usually don't expect much during the busy downtown lunch rush time.  All-in-all, I say it's definitely a must place to try if you are ever downtown.
