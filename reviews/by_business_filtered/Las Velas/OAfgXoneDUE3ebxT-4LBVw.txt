I am so glad this place reopened!

I had went here for a happy hour months before the horrible Market Square construction had from my understanding shut Las Velas down. Now that it's back in business, I had to try it again.

I'm very pleased to find nothing has changed. 

Great frozen margaritas, check.
Amazing salsa, check.
The best homeade chips, check.

One of my favorite things about the restaurant is the view overlooking Market Square, well now that it's completed and the homeless problem has been elimated. I find the prices reasonable and the staff is always friendly.

And I always make sure to ask for a refill of my chips even if I may be dining alone.
