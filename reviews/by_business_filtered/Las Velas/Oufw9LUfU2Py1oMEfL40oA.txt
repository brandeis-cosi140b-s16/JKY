I've been here a few times, but the new lunch menu today pushed it over the top. 

We ordered chips and salsa cause you have to order chips and salsa.  The chips are definitely homemade and awesome.  The salsa is full of fresh tomato flavor and cilantro.  They do charge for chips and salsa ($2.50), so don't be surprised when your bill comes. 

It was a lovely day to be in the second story in market square overlooking the grand prix cars and the many people out in the miserable heat.  Pittsburghers do love their old cars.

Back to the food, M got Huaraches which she loved.  She got chicken as the meat option.  They also had lettuce, sour cream, refried beans and cheese.  It was served with Spanish rice that I never enjoy, but love here. 

I got the vinegar soaked pork tacos.  Sadly, I don't remember their real name, but I will need to when I come back.  It was nothing but pork and habenero vingar soaked onions, but damn, did it pack some punch.  So much flavor on a homemade corn tortilla.  It was served with rice and black beans.  

Great lunch option in market square - one of the best views in the square!
