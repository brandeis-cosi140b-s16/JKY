Awesome space upstairs overlooking Market Square! I enjoyed sitting in the window drinking Tres Generaciones tequila on the rocks with lime! They do charge for their chips and salsa... The salsa amazing, but the chips were a little heavy... I prefer corn tortilla chips.. They were so heavy they might have been flour.  My food was delicious.. I ordered an entree of mahi mahi that was prepared with a chipotle tomato sauce that had jalape√±os and green olives in it. Sooo good. It was served with rice and avocado slices over lettuce. I will definitely go back again!
