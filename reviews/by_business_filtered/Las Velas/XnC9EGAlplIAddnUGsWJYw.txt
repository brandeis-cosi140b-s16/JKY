It was ok.

The chicken for the quesadilla didn't really look freshly made. It looked like the pre-made chicken strips that can be bought in a grocery store. It was good, but could have been better. 

The margaritas were good with a nice combination of alcohol incorporated into the drink. I tried the raspberry, mixed berry, and plain lime. 

The refried beans were also tasty, and the chips and salsa were very good.

I'll definitely give this place another go!
