I was staying in Pittsburgh for business and this place wasn't too far away. I tried to go there for dinner the night before, but I couldn't find it. The light wasn't on. I ended up walking into a different restaurant. So, it's located above the Diamond Market and the door is right next to the Diamond Market on the right. You walk up a long flight of stairs and you're there. The service here was pretty bad. I was sat by my server Aracely. She asked me if I wanted a drink when I sat. She brought it out and took my order of chicken fajitas. Someone else brought me my fajitas. I never saw my server or anyone else again the rest of lunch. Mind you there were only about 10 people eating in the entire restaurant. I finished my Pepsi about half way through my meal, so it sat empty the rest of the time as I had to eat the ice to wash down the fajita. I ordered the corn tortillas, I only got 4 of them. They were small and I had lots of food left on my plate with no tortillas to put them in. Plus I hadn't seen my server in about 15 minutes. I finished my meal. The server shows up, takes my plate and asks if I want a refill. Of course I don't, I'm finished. Didn't bother with dessert or anything else. Not going to go back. Food was average and service was horrible. Too bad too since it's really close to my hotel and I have 2 more days here and I love Mexican food.
