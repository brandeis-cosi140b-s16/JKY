Two Margarita's in and I'm golden.  Golden as a peach and raspberry marg you get!

Order some fresh made chips and salsa and I'm in heaven!  I knowingly had a homemade taco salad for lunch, knowing I would indulge in Mexi fare later that night.  I didn't care, I like to double dip!

Immediately I ordered the chips and salsa...I mean...dah...who wouldn't?  You could tell it was of the homemade chip persuasion.  This wasn't a bag o' tostito's poured out!  We also ordered the gauc.  Thank gawd it didn't come in a puny bowl.  It was a heaping helping of the green stuff!  I was all over that ish!

I ordered the Burrito Isla, which came with cheese, rice, green peppers, grilled onions, salsa and sour cream.  The option included meat but I opted to go veggie tonight.  It was a huge portion.  Factor that in with the huge chip/salsa ratio and you've got a full belly!  

The ONLY issue I had was that it seemed to take a long time between drinks.  Maybe I'm a little overzealous between bevvies...but it's happy hour...I gotta get my drink on!
