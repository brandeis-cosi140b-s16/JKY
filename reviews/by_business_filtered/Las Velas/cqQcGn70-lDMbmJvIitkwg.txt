Doesn't even deserve one star. U get one just for the view if market square during light up festivities. 
First, waitress doesn't know the diff between the various salsas in the menu. Go ask the kitchen. 2nd, I order a small sangria she brings a large one puts it down and goes oh ya... U did want a small , takes mine away from me pours it in a small glass ???? Just give me the drink! customer service 101. 3rd, our food comes,  waitress's put it down and a few of us start eating when we realize it's the wrong food in front of the wrong person. Wrong meats etc. arghhh !  No one ever came back to ask how food was can I get u anything else,  nothing !  And as I was watching the waitress walking around with the big trays of food I also noticed her ponytail in the plates of food before it was served. Delicious. Also why must I pay for bad chips an salsa?  Why are they not standard?  Really?
Chick fil a has better service.
