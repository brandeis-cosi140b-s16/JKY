Service was terrible! We ordered way too much food and the waitress did not care to tell us. The "family style" fajita dinner is basically fajitas for one times 3! Didn't understand their menu at all. They charge for chips and salsa and even extra tortillas when we had three fajita dinners. The best thing was the chips and the guacamole, but we won't be back.
