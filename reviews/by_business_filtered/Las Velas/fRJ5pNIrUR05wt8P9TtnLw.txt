Absolutely in love with this place!! Has the best Mexican cuisine in Pittsburgh hands down. It's a gem on the square.  I love their handmade chips and fresh salsa. I'm forever convincing friends to try this place out. I always order their breaded shrimp tacos. Their happy hour has reasonably priced margaritas!! I've been here many times and only once have I had a mediocre experience. Most of the time the staff is friendly and attentive. The atmosphere makes me feel like I'm somewhere else.
