The greatest margarita menu I've ever seen. The strawberry cucumber was my favorite. I also tried the mango cayenne and basil agave. All are amazing! I will never go anywhere else for one. The food was great. Left full and happy. Definitely a place to try and enjoy! The service was attentive and food came out quick.
