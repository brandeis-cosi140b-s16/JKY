Eh. The boy and I saw that Las Velas was open again and we felt like giving it a try. It was okay. Not really Mexican per say. More Tex-Mex. There wasn't much spice to our dishes even though we did order the more spicy dishes off the menu. Eh. The decor is WONDERFUL, but the food was just okay. Though the chips and salsa are worth the money, it was probably the best part of our meal.
