This is the hole-in-the-wall of the Market Square restaurants downtown; I'd never have found if someone hadn't known where the door to the place is. I want to note now that I've only been here once for a spontaneous dinner date - and that only happened because Olive or Twist was completely and totally booked. But now I'm absolutely dying to go here again. The meal I had here hit the spot perfectly.

I'm not even a major fan of Mexican food, so it's very rare for me to heap this sort of praise on Mexican restaurants. I ordered the pork quesadillas, and have to say, they were spot on - also a surprising statement coming from me, because I'm not a major fan of pork, probably because a lot of the time people overcooked pork dishes when I was younger and I grew up thinking all pork is just dry and pretty tasteless. Places like Las Velas remind me that nope, this is not the case - and bless them for it! My meal came with plenty of both the main course and the necessary toppings to spread on each individual quesadilla as I saw fit. There were more than enough toppings to go around, and combined with the juicy pork and toasted quesadilla wrap they made for a wonderful mix of tastes and textures. 

By the way, even if the food wasn't amazing here, I think I would still consider myself a major fan of this place just because of their supremely delicious Peach Margaritas (dying to go back and try the raspberry one). Fortunately the food is as good as the drinks, so everyone wins!

I'll note that even on a not-so-busy night, I, like other reviewers, experienced a little teensy bit of drag in service. Still, I had company and we wanted to talk, so I think as long as I avoid coming here alone or when I'm starving, I'd be able to tolerate this as easily as I did during my first meal here. Still, I can see this being a drawback for folks, so just know it's a possibility here and be prepared. Bring company or a book.
