I was really sad when the cigar bar and brew house closed down years ago but was really happy for a Mexican restaurant to pop up in it's place. Unfortunately, this place has proved disappointing on many occasions.

The first time I ate at Las Velas, I had a really great experience. I ate really light but it was really good. All I ordered was the tortilla soup and I stole some bites of my cousin's refried beans. Both were excellent.

A few months ago, I met a few friends for dinner at Las Velas and did not have the same feelings about the place I had initially had on that first visit. The food took forever to come out and when it did, I had wished it away. The Seviche was disgusting. I love seviche but this was a soupy mess. Nothing tasted fresh about it. The very look was off-putting. All of our tacos and tostadas had dry meat lacking any true flavor. It was a disaster of a meal.

I did try and go back. I understand where a restaurant may have an off day and was willing to give this place another shot. Unfortunately, when I stopped in the other day I was sat at a dirty table and handed a dirty menu that I stared at for 15 minutes (in solitude because a waiter never came) before walking out. I can only give a restaurant so many chances before I just don't want to risk spending the money on a potentially disappointing meal. Save yourself some frustration and walk over to Bea's Taco Town on Smithfield. You'll be much happier and satiated.
