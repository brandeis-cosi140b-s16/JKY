We went to Lenero's for lunch.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  Our waitress and the manager were glad to answer any questions (except the  secret spice in the salsa) we had.  The warm salsa was very good.  A new slant on chips and salsa.  Being the first time we had visited there, we played is safe and had chicken enchiladas and steak burrito.  They were both very fresh and flavorful.  Excellent.  There is nothing fried there.  Everything is grilled over apple or peach wood.  The cocktails were very good as well.  We highly recommend this if you are looking for good Mexican food that is a bit different.  We will be going back regularly!
