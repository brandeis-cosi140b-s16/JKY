How did I leave Lenero Mexican Grill? Fat, happy and aggravated as hell. I know, it makes no sense. Stay with me and I'll try my best to explain. 

The place smells like the wonder that is smoked meat products. Said smoked meat was beyond delicious. Husband and I shared the full rack of ribs for $22. It was huge. Like it's Tuesday and we had this on Sunday and are still eating it huge. A half rack is fine for a couple. They dry rub it, grill it and smoke it. 

The salsa is fresh made every day and kept warm. Nice. Beware though. If you don't like it spicy, you're SOL. That stuff will make you sweat. May have been the batch but holy hell. I still loved it! The corn tortilla chips were not the best. Generic and I'm struggling to find more words here. Not like me!

Margarita was nice and strong. I'd like to go back and have 8 more and make my husband drive me home. 

Why the frustration? The service is just so lacking. This is clearly a mom and pop operation and I love it for that. But, mom and pop need a new family member to serve tables. She was sweet. I'll give her that. But, she had no idea the difference in margaritas to tell me why one cost more. She came back and asked if I wanted salt. Like Milton at the end of Office Space I asked for my margarita with no salt. "No salt." That was one salty margarita. Our food sat on the counter for five minutes, our guacamole came once we were about finished, and paying our bill took almost as long as it did to eat our meal. We even had a coupon we bought online and she said she thought we had to print it out, even though you could clearly scan it from the phone. We asked her to check and never heard a peep back. I had given up. 

We'll be back. Well, we have to because I have $30 to spend there. But, I'll do myself a favor and sit at the bar. And drink 8 margaritas. With no salt.
