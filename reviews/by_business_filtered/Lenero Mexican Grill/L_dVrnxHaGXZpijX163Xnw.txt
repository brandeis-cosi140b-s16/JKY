Service was ok, there was only one person. Dishes looked very presentable and ambiance was relaxing. Chicken was very succulent and very well made. Salsa was served warm which was the first time I've heard of. Server was really friendly and although the ambiance was relaxing it would have been nice to listen to a variety of music instead of only John Mayer.
