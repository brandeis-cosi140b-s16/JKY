I would love to have been able to review the food here, but unfortunately, after sitting for close to 20 minutes without our server coming back to take our drink order, we finally got up and walked out. There were 8 other people in the restaurant sitting at 3 different tables, and 4 people sitting at the bar. There were 2 females and a male working front of the house. There is absolutely no reason why 3 people can't handle 14 people including my gf and I. 

I really wanted to try the food as the menu looked good, but all we got to try was the warm salsa and chips. 

When we walked out, we walked right past the female server and the male, who made eye contact and didn't say a word. It was almost like they wanted us to leave and didn't want to serve people.
