My boyfriend and I had went in for dinner and was not pleased at all. Instead of going to our usual spots for Mexican food like Blanco, LA Fonda Del Sol and Z'tejas, we decided to try somewhere new. I hoped that this little joint would be awesome but within 10 minutes of arriving, I lost hope. We sat, got our menus, ordered our drinks and received our drinks. 10...15 minutes later, no one had come to our table to take our order. I got up to ask who our server was. We got an apology and our new server was really nice but it did not make up for how bad the food was. I ordered the Chile relleno and it was pretty much a soggy bell pepper with cheese that was drenched with the same salsa they served with the chips. It just looked like a sad dinner. Not worth the money... Boyfriend ordered the enchiladas - no bueno. But the drinks were good! They took care of the first round of drinks to make up for forgetting us but nothing makes me want to go back. But we tried!
