Amazing Happy Hour deals!!!
     Great appetizers and drinks, this place is tucked away between a Whataburger and furniture store.
Place is small, but very well decorated! They even had a guitar player on the second floor who played nice and calming songs during happy hour! 
Nice!! :)
 Not very much to say since we only came here to try out their happy hour, and all of the appetizers we ordered were great!! Especially the Queso Fundido, that was delicious!!! Yum and the nice long list of drinks!! The bartender that night mixed up some delicious cocktails too!! 
I definitely will come here again to try out the full menu soon!
