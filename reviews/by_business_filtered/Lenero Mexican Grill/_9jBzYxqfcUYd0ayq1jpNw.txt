This is a delicious place to eat. Found it at a business lunch and drove 25 miles to take my wife to try it. They do use chips from a bag, but the salsa is home made and amazing. Their fish is one of the best I have ever tried and the meat is to die for. Service friendly if not overly professional. I would recommend anyone try this place
