What a hidden gem this is. Another couple joined us for dinner and we all extremely pleased. The tacos, enchiladas and fish were superb. We loved their chips and Salsa. Everything has a bit of a bite but yet not hot. 

Deci, our waitress was a delight. The place is squeaky clean and attractive. 

We all agreed it was a fine evening.
