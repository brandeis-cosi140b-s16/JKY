Had a terrible meal. Restaurant was understaffed and server was more interested in interacting with wife/girlfriend and child than waiting on customers. In fact, not sure they even wanted to be open for business. We tried ordering their signature margarita with spices, only to be told the spices hadn't been prepped. ITS their signature drink! It was probably 20 minutes before we got any drinks. I use yelp a lot for picking restaurants, and tend to focus on food quality since anyone can occasionally get bad service. Food was pretty good, except for several problems. First, one entree for a person in our party was cold by the time it was served. The flour tortillas are only 4 inches in diameter making it difficult to eat fajitas. My fajitas weren't served with any accompaniment like cheese our sour cream or anything. To top things off the server never checked on us to see if we wanted more drinks or if our dishes were ok. Apparently too busy checking his watch to see when he was getting off. Now you might think, oh he might have been overworked because I said they were understaffed. We were the only party in the restaurant at 7 pm and he was the only bar tender/ server there. Given that I am in the Southwest, I know there must be many better Mexican places to choose from, particularly ones that care about their customers all the time.
