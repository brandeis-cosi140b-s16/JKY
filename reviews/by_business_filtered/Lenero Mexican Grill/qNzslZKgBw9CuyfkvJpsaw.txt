I love this building, hate the parking. 

I came in for a late lunch, in fact there was one other table and they left halfway through my meal. I hate a taco plate with carne and chicken. Both were good but I was hoping for more of a smoke flavor and less ...veggie flavor. They chop small and include veggies all diced into it. The tortillas were awesome. 

The "hot" as in temperature hot salsa was odd, but good. I actually liked it better once it cooled but I have a feeling it is a "used to response." I suggested they make a cold one as well at least for the summer. 

The Server was great, engaging, smiled, polite and I appreciated it.
