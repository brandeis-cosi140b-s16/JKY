We had dinner here and the food is excellent, the atmosphere is cozy and homey and the service is fantastic.  Our waitress, Stephanie was friendly and helpful, the salsa, guacamole and steak fajitas were amazing.  The food  is affordable with dinners ranging from about $8-$16.  There are inexpensive weekday lunch specials and brunch on the weekends.  I can't wait to try the brunch!
