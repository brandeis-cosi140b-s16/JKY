The decor is nice, but that's about all I liked about it. Maybe we just had the bad luck of getting a new waitress who didn't know how to take care of her customers, but service was slow and annoyingly absent most of the night. The food took forever to come out and was overpriced for the portion size and disgusting. 

I ordered the chicken enchiladas. They barely had any chicken in them and the salsa on top was so sour and tasted like Hernz sauce from a jar. My companion ordered the barbacoa and it just tasted like bland shredded beef with about a gallon of pepper dumped into it. It came with beans that were absolutely disgusting. We couldn't eat them at all and sent them back. 

The manager came over to ask us what was wrong with the food since we sent it back almost untouched. When I explained that the beans were so badly prepared, they were unpalatable she said I must not know authentic home style Mexican food. I informed her I'm Hispanic and definitely know what good beans and barbacoa taste like, she got a bad attitude with us and said, "well you can't please everyone". Just that attitude alone would have been enough to turn me off from ever going back, if the food hadn't already.
