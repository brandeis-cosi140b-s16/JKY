I was really excited to live so close to a Mexican restaurant when we moved to the area, and our first dinner here was great; service and food. However every time since has been disappointing. I have tried a variety of menu items hoping to find something worth coming back to but its just "okay". The staff is all over the place running around, one night a waiter ran around the corner booth and kicked an empty chair in his rush and it flew right into my fathers leg, it was hard enough that my father said "ouch". He made eye contact with our table grabbed the chair from the floor and walked away without even acknowledging the fact he hit a customer. I know he was aware of it because he went and told the manager about the incident right in front of the kitchen window, we were seated two booths over so we were able to see & hear the conversation happen. Not the waiter or manager came over to make sure he was okay or apologize for the incident. We let the incident go and even returned tonight giving it a last chance. My husbands dinner was not as he ordered it and his said his margarita was terrible, unfortunately we will not be returning.
