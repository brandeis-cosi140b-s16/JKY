I am from So. Cal...  just minutes from the border and I grew up on Mexican food.  Leticia's is awesome!  Incredible food... great atmosphere.... awesome service.... and the friendliest staff!  I love this place and we eat there weekly!  The green sauce is the best I have ever had!  We even had Letcia's cater our Christmas meal!
