First time here, great impression. Service was wonderful even though our server informed us she was in training. I got the chicken tamales and my husband got the Colorado burrito. Very good! 
Wasn't impressed by the margarita I got. Bartender definitely over-poured, I could taste only tequila. 
I would come back here for sure!
