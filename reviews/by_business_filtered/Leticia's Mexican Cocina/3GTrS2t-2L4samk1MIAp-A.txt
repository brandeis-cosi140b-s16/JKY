Today was my first visit to Leticia's. I have had friends rave about their food so we decided we should try it out. I have eaten a lot of Mexican food. I mean, A LOT. You know when you go somewhere and the food doesn't live up to the hype? This was NOT that kind of place. The food was SO good. I have been let down by many Mexican restaurants, but the flavors here were the bomb. I got the Molcajete which is served in a giant, sizzling bowl with your choice of meat(s), ranchera sauce, grilled cactus, and a side of tortillas, rice, beans, etc. Basically, it's like fajitas. The ranchera was a little spicier than I was expecting, but still delicious. Our server was Mario. He was personable and kept our drinks filled. My only disappointment was that they were out of Mole sauce, which is my favorite and what I originally wanted, but that forced me to branch out and try something new. I will definitely be back!
