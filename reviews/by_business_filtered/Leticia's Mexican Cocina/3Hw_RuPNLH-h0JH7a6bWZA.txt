Came to eat here for lunch with my husband about a week ago. We decided to sit at the tables near the bar. when we were ready to order our lunch the man told our waitress. Expecting her to come and take our order.. No big deal!! Well that didn't happen. The waitress/ bartender continues to do whatever she was doing for at least 10 minutes on her computer, then walked out of the bar and started chatting with some other people. You have to be kidding me!!! By this time it's been like 20 minutes, so we said screw it .. Paid for our drinks and left. We have come here quite a bit with our family the past few years. I have never experienced this here. The worst service ever!!! I understand when waitresses get busy but to wait that long is crazy!!  
Never again!
