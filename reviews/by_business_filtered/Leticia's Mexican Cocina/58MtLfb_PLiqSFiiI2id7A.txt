The restaurant sits on the corner of a cute plaza with parking at the front and back.  The outside is very inviting and at night the lights come on and make it very romantic. The inside is filled with great South American decor and the colors are warm and comforting. Try the enchiladas and their tacos. The servers and host were very friendly and courteous too.
