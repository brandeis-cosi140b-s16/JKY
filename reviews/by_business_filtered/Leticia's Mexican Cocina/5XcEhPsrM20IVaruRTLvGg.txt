OMG! Can you say, the best pork enchiladas EVER!  Come early because you'll be waiting if you wait to long. Have been coming here for years. Service is great. The owner is often on the premises. And if having Carlos Santana as a frequent customer isn't a selling point, I don't know what is. Dining inside or out, this is a place that has become a favorite.
