We went to the Las Vegas Taco and Tequila festival and found this gem. 2 months later, I move and lo and behold I see as I am driving and had whiplash I was so excited! BEST.MEXICAN.FOOD.EVER. GET the quesa tacos with shrimp and creamy garlic sauce! Go to the patio and have Happy Hour! We even had our wedding dinner there, that's how good it is. Seriously, Go! Now!!!
