I've been to true Mexican restaurants. Myself being Mexican and used to my grandmas cooking I know what true Mexican food should taste like and it's definitely not like this! 1st of all there's no home made tortillas served with your food. Their micheledas are the worst their just lacking something. The one I had just served in a warm glass and tasted like tomatoe juice and beer. True ceviche is supposed to be cooked and marinated in lime juice, my shrimp ceviche was cooked in boiling water, and then sprinkle with lime juice, you could definitely taste the difference. There's was about 7 shrimp on my plate, definitely more diced tomatoes than ceviche. If you want more authentic Mexican food try Lindo michocian in centennial hills
