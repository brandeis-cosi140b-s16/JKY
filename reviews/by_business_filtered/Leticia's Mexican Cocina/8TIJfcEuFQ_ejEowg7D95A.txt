Horrible food and service! It took over an hour to get our food and it was not even busy. On top of that, our waitress seemed bothered by having to serve us. 

I ordered the Asada and chicken enchiladas, which were far too salty. My dad ordered the birria, which he also thought was too salty and greasy. I would not recommend this place.
