I'm a vegas native and I have had mexican food all over this city my entire life, and I must say that Leticia's food is by far some of the best I have ever had!  We ordered their signature tacos, some tostadas and the fajitas!  All flavorful and amazing!  The carnitas taco was amazing, seasoning just perfect!  Their ground beef tostada was to die for!  Their ground beef has to be the best in Las Vegas!  I can't wait to come back to try a beef burrito!  The fajitas were piping hot and everything was succulent and juicy!  All white meat chicken!  We are waiting on sopapilla's and im more than positive I'll be mind blown by these as well!  The service was amazing, our waiter gave us the most amazing recommendations and I am so excited that I finally got to try this place!
