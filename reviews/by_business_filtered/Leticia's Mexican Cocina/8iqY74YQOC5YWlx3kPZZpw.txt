I was hopeful that this would be our spot for Mexican food but........the restaurant was clean and cute but very loud, even at 4:30 on a Sunday as they are busy.  The food was bland, sorry to say.  Nothing jumped out as being flavorful and quite honestly, for the price, we've had better food elsewhere.  The portions are a good size, so that is a plus and service was good.  The red sauce on the enchiladas was really potent as I would not recommend it at all.  I would say give this a try, but as this was a hike for us to get to, I would rather go the opposite direction to Mi Casa where the beef enchiladas with red sauce are delicious!  Sorry, I wanted to really like this place but not worth the drive for us.
