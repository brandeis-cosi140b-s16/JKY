I'm from Texas and have struggled to find decent Tex-Mex food out here in the wild wild west.  I think this might be the best Mexican food I've had.  Well, there is a place in Wichita Falls, TX, called Casa Ma√±ana, which has delicious food (even if it didn't always agree with me the next day), but Leticia's is even better than that place, and never disagrees with me!  

Everything at Leticia's is freshly prepared (no canned ingredients, apparently).  It is apparent that the chef/owner cares a great deal about what ends up on our plates.  My husband isn't a huge fan of Mexican food, but he loves Leticia's!  The food is great and in huge portions so I often have the next day's lunch as well.  The drinks are great.  The service is great.  I love this place and can't recommend it enough! 

Leticia's es la Bomba!!
