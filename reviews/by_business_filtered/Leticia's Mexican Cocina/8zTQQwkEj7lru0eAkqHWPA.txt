The low score is for the service.  The food was awesome and the house margaritas delicious but the service was awful.  I could see my margarita sitting and the bar for about 5 minutes before it was brought to me. The waiter took awhile to take my order and at one point,  two servers were arguing with each other. And the manager had to step in and settle it.
