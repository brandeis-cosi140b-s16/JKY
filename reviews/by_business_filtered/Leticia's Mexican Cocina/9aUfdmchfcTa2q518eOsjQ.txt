There is no excuse for poor service in a slow restaurant.


I came here with my girlfriend and two kids for lunch on a Saturday.  As we walked in, we noticed two other parties in the dining room; the place was not busy.  

We sat down, ordered our food, and waited.....waited....waited....  The entire time the manager (I think) was gabbing with the waitstaff about nothing important, right next to our table.  We were pretty much ignored throughout the meal.  The waitress brought out two scalding hot cups of soup, literally seconds before our entrees arrived.  On top of that, she placed the soups directly in front of our 4 and 5 year old eaters.  Common sense isn't always so common.  

I mentioned the poor service to the manager, who just said, "Sorry," and carried on chatting with his waitresses.  

The food was bland at best.  I know I"m only giving a little attention to the food here, but probably just as much attention as the cooks gave it in the first place.
