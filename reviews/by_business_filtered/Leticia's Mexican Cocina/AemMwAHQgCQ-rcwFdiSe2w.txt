Wow, this restaurant has the worst customer service! Came in for lunch around 11:30 and the restaurant was pretty empty. We were a party of two and The "host" told us it would be a minute or so, then another party of two comes in and he goes to seat them right away... It wasn't until I spoke up that he then sat us first. Then to make a really long bad experience short, we waited over an hour for appetizers and then was overcharged! When I pointed it out to the "waitress/bartender" she first tried saying its because I got a filling in my taquitos! Really? Because the menu states choice of filling for $6.89, she then said its a glitch in the register system! Whatever, I'll stick with Viva Mercados!
