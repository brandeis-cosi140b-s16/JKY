Two business associates took me here for lunch.  I can only say it was THE BEST Mexican food I have ever had.  Simply exquisite.  The tastes, the textures, and the hospitality of the owner were exceptional.

I had her award winning shrimp tacos. "Oh, my" they were over the top.  I had them with heat (and they ask you how hot).  They were fantastic.

I also had her award winning margarita made from tamarind (tamarindo).  It was great, too.  

As per the owner, we even sat in Santana's booth, as he visits monthly to get some great food.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
