My mouth waters thinking about the dark, smoky salsa a server brings with warm, salty tortilla chips, beans, and a green salsa as soon as I'm seated at a table. I have a theory that you know how the rest of the meal at a Mexican restaurant will be based off their salsa and chips. No American-style Mexican food here, we're talking about Mexican food with depth of flavor and spice. I've taken family from out-of-town here and then had them ask to return the next time they've visited because the food was so memorably delicious. Items my family, friends, and I have tried and enjoyed (in order off the menu) - quesadilla, volcanes tostaditas, queso fundido, Mexican grilled corn, carne asada, chile rellenos, camarones al mojo de ajo, spinach and mushroom enchiladas, chile colorado, Ensenada style tacos, el molcajete, and mole chicken. Long but not exhaustive list. Also worth noting, I've always had great service here and am sorry for those that haven't. I think those experiences are exceptions and not the norm. Anyway, I highly recommend this place.
