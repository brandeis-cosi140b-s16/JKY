I hadn't been here in about 4 years. I loved it 4 years ago. Don't know what's happened. After ordering it took over an hour for food to come out. We didn't order anything complicated. It was not busy. When we asked for a Box to pack up our food it took another 26 minutes! Asked multiple times for water with lemon and NEVER got it. One napkin at the table. We will not be returning. What a shame.
