This was my husband's & my 3rd visit here.  It will be our last time giving it a shot.  The style of salsa is not the kind we like.  the beans they served with chips lacked any flavor.  The Fideo soup we both ordered was thick and glupy. The salad I ordered was loaded down with about a cup of too much cheese.  The shrimp poppers were overly breaded.  Hubby did like the Consume soup.  The staff was friendly, but service was slow and they never checked on us to refill drinks.  I do like the decor, but the fluorescent lighting is bad.  The place is always packed so we thought why not give it a try again & it's so close to home.  However we won't be returning.  Sorry Leticias, Michoacan is just much much better.
