The quality of the food is great. I would however recommend to have reservations prior going to Leticia's as this place is packed on the weekends. The service takes a dip due to the number of customers that they are serving. The plates which the food was served had some breakage on the sides and also missed on serving us the water that we asked. The food is definitely good. Be careful on eating too much of the Nacho's since you wont be able to enjoy the entrees.
