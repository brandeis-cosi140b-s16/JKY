Great food, crappy service every time. Every time I go, the food is always amazing and they hit it out of the park on that end. However, they're service sucks.  Even when it's slow, the service is slow. I ordered a drink and didn't get it til mid way through the meal. Mind you that was when we first sat down I ordered a drink. Oh and there was only a handful of people in there. Not sure what the hold up is.
