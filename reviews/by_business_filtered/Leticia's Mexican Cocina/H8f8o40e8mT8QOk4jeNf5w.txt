The food was (again) delicious. I had the chile relleno carmelitas and a small bowl of pazole. Both were very flavorful and fresh tasting. 
Unfortunately this time the service was somewhat below average, which was hard to understand  considering that it was not busy at all for lunch.
Despite the weak service I will continue to go and work my way through the menu.
