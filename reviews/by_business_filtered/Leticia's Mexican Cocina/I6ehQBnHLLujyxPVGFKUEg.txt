Had a great meal at Leticia's!  The server was excellent and had no problem recommending his favorite dishes.   I'm a fajita fan and usually get them at every Mexican restaurant on my first visit.  Leticia's did not dissapoint.  My wife got a flauta platter that was ok, not the best she's had, but still very good.   Overall, a good experience, highly recommend.
