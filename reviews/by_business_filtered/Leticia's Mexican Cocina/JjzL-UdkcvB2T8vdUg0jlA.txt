I'm not one to give out five stars unless I feel a place earns it and honestly this is the best Mexican restaurant in town, considering this is the only Leticias in town. This isn't your typical chain restaurant.

The environment inside is very nice. Decor matches the obvious theme, the lighting is at a slight dim and the bar has a sort of cantina look to it. Every time I've been the staff has always been pleasant and personable, always willing to strike up conversation besides the typical "What can I get for you?" routine.

The first thing they bring out are tortilla chips made in house, along with bean dip, verde salsa and a black salsa. The chips and dips are so good that you can get full from eating so many, they are that delicious. They have a crisp airy taste and taste like they just finished making them. When I say the chips are baked in-house, you can genuinely taste that they are. Amazing way to start a meal.

My first visit there I ordered the Milanesa and man was I blown away. Everything seemed to be cooked perfectly. The portions are huge so unless you come with an appetite plan on leftovers. My second visit I ordered the quesa shrimp tacos and just when I thought their food couldn't get better these tacos proved me wrong. The only way I can describe their food is to let your taste buds do all the talking for me. I decided to try out their dessert and their tres leches is delicious. I was given complimentary coffee with it which was an amazing gesture in my book. Be sure to check in as sometimes you'll get a free treat to top your meal!

Overall, this place takes the cake when it comes to Mexican dining. Prices can get a tad steep but I'm okay for paying a little more when the food is well worth it. A++ in my book.
