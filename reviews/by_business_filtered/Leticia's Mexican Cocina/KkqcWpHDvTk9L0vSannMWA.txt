Very disappointing. No flavor. Terrible service. The waiter practically threw the chips at us on his way by. Had shrimp tacos but there were MAYBE 1 little shrimp in each. Had to dig to find and even then when I say little I mean... these were THE SMALLEST shrimps on the planet. My husband had the carne asada burrito. Blah! Zero flavor. Had to add the habenero salsa or it would have tasted like nothing. WAY over priced for the low quality and very low service. Great building, street shopping theme, but terrible parking. Will not return.
