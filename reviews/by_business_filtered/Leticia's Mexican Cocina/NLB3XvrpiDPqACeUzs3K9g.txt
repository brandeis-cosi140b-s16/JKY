I don't have enough positive words to say about Leticia's!  Simply the BEST Mexican food in Las Vegas and beyond.  We like to call it "Mexican gourmet," but there's a comfort level that goes beyond gourmet.  From the time you walk in, until the time you leave, you're treated like family.  You'll see regulars, tourists, and celebrities (Carlos Santana eats here!!!!), all treated the same by the lovely Leticia.  

Fair warning, the free salsa/beans and chips are HIGHLY addictive!  I can't even count the number of times that we've had to take home the majority of our entr√©e because we filled up on the margaritas and chips & salsa.  I would seriously hurt someone to get her tomatillo salsa recipe.  Seriously.  You can have my firstborn.  

Don't be afraid to ask your server for recommendations.  Or the person at the next table, if their food looks interesting.
