Best Mexican food in Las Vegas, hands down! My only complaint was the hostess, don't remember her name, but she was the worst hostess ever.  LOTS of empty tables available but she choose to not seat them and make customers wait up to 1/2 hour for a table.  Poor management skills.  Food was delicious!  Can't say enough good things about this place.  If you go on the weekend, just plan to wait awhile for a table.  Its worth the wait though!
