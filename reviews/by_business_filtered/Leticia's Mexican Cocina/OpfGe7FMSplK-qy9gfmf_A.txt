All I can say is fuck Justin. Worst service ever. The food was cold and bland. Homeboy decided to drop my to-go box on the floor, throw out one piece of food that fell, put the rest back in and informed me that the "other part is fine", after I watched it hit the floor...  He was abrasive and sketchy, and the whole experience was incredibly disappointing.
