Its been awhile since I've been to a Mexican restaurant and seen something on the menu I've never eaten before. 

Today the clouds parted and the Sun shown down on my new favorite Pork Chop dish in Vegas. The Chuletas!  I was a little nervous as I am a bit particular when it comes to my Pork Chops but as soon as the waitress placed it in front of me and the intoxicating aroma hit my nose I had to fight the urge to dive right in and wait until my entire table was served.

Ooh the Humanity! The wait was killing me but once I started I couldn't stop. If it wasn't a business lunch and if I wasn't there with my colleagues I may have just ordered a second Pork Chop!

The chips salsa and refried bean appetizer was delicious but might not be touched on my next trip. Will want to save room for that Pork Chop.

Their salsa is a mild salsa with great flavor. For those looking for something a little more spicy ask for a habanero salsa dish to be brought out with the nachos. It was hot and had great fresh flavor. I couldn't tell if was from a can or not as my coworkers and I made that dish disappeared in less than five minutes but I'd guess freshly made.

The Staff was amazing and had a lot of personality as they interacted with my group of seven. One even went so far as to call me a Gringo for ordering flour tortillas. Was not expecting that and I played along making it an ongoing joke throughout the meal.

All in all I loved this place and can't wait till I have the opportunity to return!
