My wife and I moved here 3 months ago from San Antonio and this is as good as you get in SA if not better.  The first time we went I told Walter our server that we had just moved from SA so would be hard to please.  His comment was "let me order for you" and it was fantastic.  Several trips later we decided that we could try their Tamales for Christmas.  Tamales are a Christmas tradition but we cheated and had some last night DELICIOUS!!  The Chipotle Tamales were fantastic.  Not sure where some of these reviewers ate cut could not have been here and thanks Walter for all of your help making selections.
