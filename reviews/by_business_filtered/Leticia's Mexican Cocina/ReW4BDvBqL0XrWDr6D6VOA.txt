My girlfriend and I have been wanting to come here for awhile, we finally came & we had the worst experience ever. We asked our server for a few minutes to look over the menu & he never came back. 15 minutes later, someone finally came and took our order. We waited awhile and when they brought our food, they got the whole order wrong. My girlfriend ordered soup and it never came out. Worst service ever. Would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.
