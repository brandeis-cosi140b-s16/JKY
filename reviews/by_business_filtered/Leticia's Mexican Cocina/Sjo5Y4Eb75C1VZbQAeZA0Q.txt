I have been coming to Leticia's on a consistent basis since they opened. I have always enjoyed the food and consider this to be one of the best Mexican restaurants in the valley. 

The food remains good, however I have been noticing a steady decline in the service. Good establishments get busy and Leticia's is no exception. Today we came in for lunch, took a while before anyone came and got our drink order. The waitress was confused on the fish tacos when we said we wanted grilled, she said "okay so soft" as if she was referencing the tortillas. On top of that I never received any drink refills, despite the wait staff telling me they would bring a refill. The service is really disappointing and I hope that it turns around because I really enjoy the food.
