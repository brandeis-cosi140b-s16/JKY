Hands down, my favorite Mexican restaurant.  And I'm from San Diego, the land of Mexican restaurants.  We've been to Leticia's more times than I can count in the year that I've lived here.  We've brought every one of our house guests to Leticia's - and that's a whole bunch because when you live in Vegas people come out of the woodwork to visit.  Everyone we've introduced to Leticia's has fallen in love, just like we did.

Some of our favorites include: Poblano White Rice Casserole (I order it on the side no matter what else I'm ordering), El Molcajete, Quesa Tacos, Sopa de Consomme (which I get to go every time I'm sick) and their bean dip.  The chips are dangerously addicting.  We've never had anything that was bad.  Also, the service is great.  The first time we went our waiter, Mario, was so fantastic that we request to sit in his section every time we visit Leticia's.  He know's the menu inside and out always gives the best suggestions!  

Also, I have to say, I am allergic to MSG and normally stay away from ordering anything with sauce and almost never order soup in restaurants.  If I eat anything with MSG in it I get a horrific migraine the next day.  I have never had a negative reaction to their food.  Before I ordered the soup I asked if they made it in house.  The chef got on the phone and said it was made in house and from scratch.  I wish there were more restaurants like this one!
