Recently moved here from east coast. First time eating here. We had great service and the food was extremely good. Loved the tortillas and salsa. Could barely finish our meals. Will definitely bring our east coasts guests here when they visit. 
We will be eating here more and sitting outside as the weather gets warmer.
