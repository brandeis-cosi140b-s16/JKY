Decided to come here for my wife's birthday dinner and we immediately remembered why we don't come here anymore. We waited for 1 hour before being seated, after being told the wait is 30 min and seeing a ton of people go in front of us who came in after. The service was terrible, one person in our party didn't get her food til 15 minutes after everyone else. And the food is way over priced, a burrito with 3 items in it is 15 and .75 for every additional item and 2 tacos are 13 for just meat and a side of beans and rice! The only bright spot for this place is the chips and salsa. Awesome chips and 2 salsas plus beans. All in all I will not be back just for the chips.
