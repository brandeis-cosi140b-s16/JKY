This place was decent when it first opened but something happened..... I just don't get all the people that eat here and like it.  they can't possibly know real Mexican food.

What a disappointment! DO NOT EAT HERE! The carnitas were bland, the tacos unbelievably salty, the taquitos were so over fried I could just about bite through them and the meat was dry and tasteless.... service was terrible - the waiter brought the wrong food... tell me, does "TAQUITOS" sound like "FAJITAS"???? Then by the time I actually got my taquitos the rest of my party was finished. What was offered to make up for this??? Oh, fried ice cream.. As if any of us wanted anything else fried. We ate outside. The table was filthy - chair were full of food crumbs - it looks like they have never washed the ground with a hose... people are banging into your chair as you eat to walk by... 

This is truly THE WORST Mexican food I have ever eaten.... and I have eaten Mexican food in NJ and Hawaii - and even there it wasn't this bad! I don't know where the other people posting have eaten, or what their definition of good Mexican is - but you would do better at Taco Bell. 

To add insult to injury, it is WAY over priced.... two street tacos were $13... three burnt, small taquitos also $13... save your time, your money, and your stomach and go elsewhere.

My husband, who has a cast iron stomach got sick and could wait to get home to run to the bathroom. Next day - he is still sick.

Food is certainly not fresh. Not tasty. Not cooked well. Service is sub-par. I honestly don't know how the place is still in business.
