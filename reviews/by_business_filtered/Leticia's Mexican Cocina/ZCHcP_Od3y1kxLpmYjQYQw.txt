My husband claims this place to be a 5-star and I believe it's a 4-star, so if they had 4.5, we would choose that.  The food is really authentic and the location is in a super cute area.  They host events around holidays and seem to always be busy.  We would always return for good Mexican food here.  Try anything, it's all good!
