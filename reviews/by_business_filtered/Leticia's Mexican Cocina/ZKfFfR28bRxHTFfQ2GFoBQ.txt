Nice restaurant, comfortable outdoor seating, very good service.  I liked this place, I would definitely come back for a drink and some chips and salsa.  My problem with it tough; is the prices.   Not that it's wildly expensive, but I ended up paying around $15 per entree, for the same Mexican food I'd get at a mom and pop shop for like $6.  Go for the atmosphere, not a quick fix to satisfy a Mexican food craving.
