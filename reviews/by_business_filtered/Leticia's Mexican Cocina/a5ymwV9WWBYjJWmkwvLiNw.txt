Really nice location. There's a nice atmosphere and friendly staff. It's pretty busy here right now. We ordered the nachos and choose the ground beef. It was really good. I think the carne asada or grilled chicken would be better. Ordered the carne asada tacos and the fish tacos. Both were really good. The fish tacos are some of the best I've had. I got them battered instead of grilled fish.
