Leticia's USE to be a great place for Mexican food, unfortunately no longer. The service is very slow and sporadic at best. The food lately has been just ok, and the quality has definitely gone down hill. We enjoy eating at local places, non chains and are very disappointed in the direction this restaurant is going.
