What happened to this place? It used to be amazing now the service is bad and the food is so dry I am so disappointed they didn't even give a salt and pepper on the table because our food needed it what happened to the old managers? We went there to sit outside and they said it was closed? We only gets so much good weather here in Vegas and you r telling me no seating outside. And our meal was expensive for what we got.
