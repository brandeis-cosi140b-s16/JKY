Love love love me some Leticia's! I've eaten here multiple times and have never been disappointed. So far they have the best restaurant style Mexican food in Vegas in my opinion. Service is always great. The only draw back to eating at Leticia's is that there is almost always a wait to get tables because everyone else on the North West side of town is trying to eat there too!
