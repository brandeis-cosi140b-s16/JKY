I've been going to this Restaurant every Saturday for months! It became almost like a family tradition! The main reason my group  went is because of the superb service we would get from JUSTIN! We were at a loss for words to hear that he was no longer there! Justin is such an asset and will truly be missed by many!! What a loss!!!
