This is our favorite place to eat Mexican in Las Vegas! All of the food is freshly prepared. The menu has an extensive collection of traditional and house specialties. Happy hour is amazing. The queso fundido is my favorite appetizer. The capirotada is a favorite am dessert but only made seasonally! The shrimp quesa tacos are the most amazing and a family favorite of ours. Don't forget the sangria and / or margaritas!
