I knew Leticia's Mexicana Cocina made my top (702) Happy Hour locations, but I learned something new today. The restaurant meets my standards for being a kid-friendly dining spot. 1) Friendly, attentive staff. 2) Homemade chocolate milk. Horchata is on the menu too. 3) Kid's menu and crayons. 4) Children like to watch the food set up on the kitchen line. 5) Booth seating. 
Great Blanco Pozole today!
