Wow.  Third visit and this place gets better each time.  Very friendly people.  The food was delicious.  Shrimp tacos, goat burrito (yes goat), al pastor street tacos. Everything was seasoned perfectly.  You could taste a hint of pineapple in the al pastor tacos.  The salsas are very good. The avocado salsa had a nice bit of heat/spice.  Great sangria.  Many Mexican beers on tap served ice cold.  A very nice atmosphere. Did I mention friendly and delicious food. Oh, and the best part. VERY REASONABLE PRICES.  We felt like many items were under-priced for the quality and portion. Fabulous!
