This place is pretty excellent. They have big portions and you can pretty much share with whoever you're with because it's that big. They have excellent customer service. Only reason why I put four stars is because it's kind of expensive. My boyfriend and I don't really order any appetizers or desserts or anything like that, but we still on average spend at least fifty bucks.

It's okay though, because we only go here once in a while and the good is good.
