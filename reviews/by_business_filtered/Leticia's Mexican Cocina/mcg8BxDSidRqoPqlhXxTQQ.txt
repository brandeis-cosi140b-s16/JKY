Recommended by a friend, so we yelped it. Good reviews. Food was very good, the chips and 3 different salsa they give is also delish. But we got full on those waiting on or meal to come out. Or waiter was great, very helpful with the menu and explaining what was what and recommended some good dishes. A little pricy but worth it. We'll be back.
