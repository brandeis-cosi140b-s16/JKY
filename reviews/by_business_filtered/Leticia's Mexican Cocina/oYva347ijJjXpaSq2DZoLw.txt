I'm normally not on this side of town but I came here with a friend who was swearing by how great the food was and I wasn't disappointed.  I never knew there was a little nook of restaurants in this area but it's a nice area and the restaurant is big and completely Mexican while being interesting.  The bar area also has TV's for watching a game and enjoying a meal if you're so inclined.  

When I first sat down I was welcomed with chips that were still warm and toasty along with red and green sauces, and refried beans.  The lunch menu is a nice sampling of the dinner options and served with great proportions to be filling without overwhelming.  I had the Carnitas "Ma Pita" which was pork prepared in a way that I hadn't had since I was back home.  The spanish rice was warm, moist, and spiced with a nice tangy flavor.  The food was authentic and the service was attentive without being annoying and it was great to see a team effort of everyone helping your table and not just those that were assigned.  

I will be returning whenever I'm in the area and possibly even drive out there for dinner, and that says something since I normally don't exceed my zip code.
