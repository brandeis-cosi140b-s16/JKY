Very good home made tasting mexican food.  Here is the deal I have been here three times, 2 times it was great and once it was lousy.  The sauces they make for enchiladas and such are incredible, I had the chicken mole enchiladas and they were amazing.  I have also tried all kinds of dishes of others and they were all good.  The bad experience I had was the time I went with some real picky eaters, we had all kinds of special requests and the waiter was rude and basically said that they couldn't figure it out.  Then the meal came completely wrong (surprise).  Also on another occasion a guest got carnitas and it was just big chunks of fat (and I eat carnitas all the time).  

They do have a deal on fridays I think when you can get 1.50 street style tacos and they are awesome.

If looking for mexican in vegas try this spot and also Via Mercados, both are worth trying.
