I wish there for 4.5 stars for instances like this... I truly felt Letcia's was better Mexican than Lindo Michoacan (which I gave 4 stars), but being located up in Centennial I can't see myself visiting unless I happen to be in the area.

My party of 8 waited for 45 min on a busy Friday night and were seated outdoors.  Chips and 3 kinds of dip/salsa were brought to the table in a timely manner after we ordered our drinks.

i ordered a taco combo plate of both ground beef and carne asada with the standard beans and rice sides.  The hearty helping came in a double wrapped soft tortilla which I thought was genius so everything doesn't rip through on the first bite.  I felt overall the tacos had a bit more flavoring than Lindo for about the same price point.

I just wish this place was closer!!!
