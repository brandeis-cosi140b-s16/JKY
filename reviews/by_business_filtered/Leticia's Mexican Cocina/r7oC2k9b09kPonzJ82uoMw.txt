I was there with a group and everyone said their food was excellent.  One in our party has been to Leticia's a lot, so she obviously has had a track record of good experiences - enough to bring a group of 8 there.

I will vouch for the deliciousness of the Pozole Blanco.  I loved all the fresh veggies that you can add in proportions to your own liking.  I also learned (from having leftovers - the portion sizes were generous...  I had leftover soup from ordering a small) that the avocado in the soup (this soup, at least) was still bright green the second day when I reheated it for lunch as it was the first day.  Cool!

I live down in the Anthem area and can't think of any Mexican restaurant that quite met up to what I saw or experienced this day.  Although I do love Las Cazuelas - gave them 5 stars, too - but their menu is pretty tiny compared with Leticia's although it has the mom and pop atmosphere.  That's really the only possible complaint about Leticia's - its success means they're no longer a mom and pop place - not bad, just not as personal as it undoubtedly was when it first started.  Anyway, I will be looking for a reason to be in Centennial so I can go back sometime.
