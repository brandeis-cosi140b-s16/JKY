I'd like to comment on the food, but for the second time in a row, they are closed before their posted time. This evening however, not only are they closed early, but their open sign was on and when we came to the door she told us they were closed. When I commented that the sign was on and the posted times said midnight, she proceeded to turn the sign off and slam the closed sign down. 5 paying customers....apparently, things are going so well, they don't need our business.  And we've eaten here before. The food was great and this time we brought newbies to try it out. Guess they'll never know.
