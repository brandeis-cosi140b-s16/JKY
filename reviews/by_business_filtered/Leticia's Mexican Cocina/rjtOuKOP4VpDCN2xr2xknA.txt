Amazing food and service.  Authentic Mexican In Vegas!!
Walter recommended the Enchilada Del Mar.  Without a doubt the best rice I have ever tasted.  The chips and salsa were great too. Two kinds of salsa and beans were served to us with homemade chips yum!  Everything is made from fresh ingredients.  We definitely will be back!  The best Mexican food in the valley and I am a native.
