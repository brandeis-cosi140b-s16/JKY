Went on a whim last night and it was fabulous! Mario was our server and he was phenomenal. Fajitas, mole, and carne asada were our choices and all delish. We started with the Mexican corn and their homemade chips and salsas. 

I have not one negative thing to say. It was so so good! Our whole experience was perfect.
