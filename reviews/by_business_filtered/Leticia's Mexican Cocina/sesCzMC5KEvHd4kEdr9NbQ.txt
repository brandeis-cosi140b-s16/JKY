Have given it a few chances - not impressed.  Family suggested dinner.  Willing to try it again.  Around about 7:55 on a Friday evening.  Lots of empty tables but were told it would be a 45-minute wait because they were waiting for servers to arrive.  Seems that we could have been seated and ordered drinks while waiting.  Probably will not be back.
