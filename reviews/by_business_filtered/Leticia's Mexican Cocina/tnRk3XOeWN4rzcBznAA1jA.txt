I know everyone loves this place but our group of 6 left deciding never again. Good came we had no silverware. Ask 3 employees and 4 minutes later someone brought it to us. Yea, we timed it. So we sat there looking at our food. No one refilled our water so finally my husband went to the busser station and brought back a pitcher of water and filled our drinks. Our food was way too salty. Our friend ordered an appetizer that never came too. Like I said never again. For the price we got bad food and no service. This place is over rated.
