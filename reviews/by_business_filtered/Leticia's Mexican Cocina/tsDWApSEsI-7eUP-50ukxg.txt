We went to Leticia's because our coworkers said we should try it out, and me being a great Mexican cook :) thought the experience would be disappointing. Not at all, best Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas! Authentic and delicious food, once seated the service was fast and friendly. My hubby and I went for lunch and it took the host a few minutes to acknowledge us, but the delicious food made up for it.  We had the salsa macha, queso fundido, sopes and the carne asada. Can't wait to try more food on their menu.
