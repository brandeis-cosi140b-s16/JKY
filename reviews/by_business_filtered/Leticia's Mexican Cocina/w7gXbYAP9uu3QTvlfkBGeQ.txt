I hate doing this, but I feel it needs to be said. 

Firstly, I love Leticia's. By love, I mean we eat here a lot. By a lot, I mean we frequent this place at least once a month. That's a lot for me. 

The reason for this update is the service. We sit at the bar because we like to play for free drinks. And it's usually just my boyfriend and I. Otherwise, we'll sit at a table. And I have almost always had a bad experience when we're seated. The waiters/waitresses seem so rushed, so annoyed and just generally pretty rude. I hate being biased and I have been for way too long. They are seriously lacking on how to treat clients. They rarely check on you, take forever to get you food or drinks. If I'm here with a smaller or larger party,  it's made no difference. Each time, we have been waiting too long or just had a server that doesn't seem too keen about helping us. 

The bartenders are awesome. They have a few new ones that have been excellent. The food each time has come out perfectly and delicious as always. The main reason we come to this place. 
Now, I hate referring people here. Each time, they say the same thing. They loved the food but hated the service. 

So, I give you 3 stars - for the servers, please...do not ruin such a great place. For the food, drinks and bartenders - I give you 5 stars.
