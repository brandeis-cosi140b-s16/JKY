My daughter recently told us about this jewel in the desert. We've lived here for 19 years and have searched for a GREAT Mexican restaurant since moving here. It is located in the far northwest of the valley, but luckily we live within 10 minutes away.

We dined here last night and it was everything I had hoped for.  We were seated right away, and we had our drink orders and chips served almost immediately. Our food server (waitress)  was wonderful, the margarita's were delicious and the chips/salsas/bean dip were freshly made (a bean dip, a smoky mild salsa, and a guacamole/cilantro smooth dip).
When the meal arrived, I knew before even taking the first bite, that it would be great. And it was.  We both ordered the shredded chicken enchilada's with Ranchera sauce (they offer other flavor sauces but we have been looking for Ranchera sauce with enchilada's for as long as we have searched for a restaurant.)  Our rice (Mexican rice) and refried beans were very tasty with a lot of good flavorings.

 The quaint little street the restaurant is located is designed beautifully, and the interior d√©cor was very nice, and colorful. We will definitely be coming back.
