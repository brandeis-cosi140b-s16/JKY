Heard about this place through a friend. Just moved from Texas where mom and pop Mexican restaurants are dime a dozen and all are amazing. 

Well this place did not disappoint. Went on a Tuesday where the margaritas are priced 2 for 1 at 7.50. Honestly the most equally balanced margaritas I have had. Then had the make your own burrito and you honestly don't want to stop eating.

We will be a regular here that is for sure. I would recommend this place to all my friends.
