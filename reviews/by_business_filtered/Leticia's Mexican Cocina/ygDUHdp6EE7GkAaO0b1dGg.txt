I met a girlfriend for a 'let's catch up lunch" and was lucky that we both agreed on this place.  Service was friendly. It took us a little bit to order because we were chatting and I was getting my son situated and the waitress kept coming over to check on us to see if we were ready to order. A little more time in between would have been better. A good waiter(ess) should be able to judge their table and know how often is too much.

We started with guacamole and it was alright. My girlfriend had raved on and on about it so when we got it, she wasn't that far off.

I went with a chicken finger meal for my son. The chicken fingers were made fresh with their own batter. They came out hot, fresh and crispy with plenty of french fries.

I went with a fish taco and rice. There was plenty of fish on my tacos and they were super delish and yummy. I was really surprised by how much I loved them. 

My girlfriend ordered a chimichanga which she shared and boy oh boy, was that sucker huge. It was filled with lots of meat and cheese. 

Overall, I had a good experience and definitely need to make my way back soon.

Perfect little spot. I wish I lived closer.
