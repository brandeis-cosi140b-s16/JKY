So sad. Came to Leticia's, our go-to Mexican restaurant. The food wasn't nearly as good as it was the past few times we've come and the service was lack-luster. Asked the waitress for extra sauce for my wet burrito, because it was pretty dry when it came to the table. Apparently, the waitress forgot because we never got the extra sauce. And to top it all off, our glasses went empty a couple of times and we had to request refills. Disappointing, to say the least:(
