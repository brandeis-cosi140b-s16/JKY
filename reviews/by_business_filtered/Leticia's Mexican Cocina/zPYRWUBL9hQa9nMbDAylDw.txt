I have been going to Leticia's since they opened and am always happy with the food and normally the service. The chips and salsa are great and the guacamole is some of the best in town. Their soups are very favorable and reasonably priced. Their seafood enchaladas are excellent. It is a good family owned restaurant that I would highly recommend if you are in the NW part of town.
