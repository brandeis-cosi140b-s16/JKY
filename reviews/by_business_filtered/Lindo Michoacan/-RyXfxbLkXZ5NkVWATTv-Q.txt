I love this place!
They have a live musician/singer, which is a really nice touch :)
The service is very fast and friendly.
My absolutely favorite dish here is the carnitas a la coca cola. The meat is really tender and super flavorful.
I also like their flautas.
And their complimentary fideo soup is so delicious!
Almost every time we come here, we're seated right away. Except for one time when we went on a Sat around 7:30 pm, it was super packed and we had to wait about 40 min to get a table. So you should make a reservation if you're going there on a Sat.
It gets pretty loud when they're busy (I hate loud restaurants).
The only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 is because sometimes they get super busy & because their complimentary corn chips & salsa could be better. The chips are a little on the thick side, not light and crispy. And their salsa seems more like hot sauce than salsa (not tomato-y enough).
But their flour chip that comes as a garnish in your entree is delicious.
The food portions are a good amount for the price.
And I like how they have lollipops instead of boring mints.
I keep coming back here again and again.
