We visited this location on a very busy Sunday-Mother's Day 2013. It coincidentally was my son's 13th birthday, and he chose the restaurant (good choice, son).

We walked in, expecting a crowd because it was prime lunch time on the most sacred of days for Mothers.

Our wait was about 25 minutes. We lucked out were able to sit in the waiting area (some had to stand, as they were busy).

We were greeted to be seated, and each female that the staff assumed was a Mother, was given a pretty carnation flower, a nice Mother's Day touch. They were hesitant on giving me one (hopefully because I looked too young to birth the 3 monsters in tow), but once they read my tank top that says 'Best Mom Ever', I was gifted a carnation.

We were brought to our table, which had gorgeous views of the Vegas strip. The decor is pretty authentic, and the live Mariachi band made me feel like I was back in Cancun on vacation. Unlimited chips, beans and salsa. I had the most delicious Pina Colada that by the time we had ordered our food, I was feeling VERY good. My 3 kids were also enjoying the live band, who were walking around from table to table.

Service was a bit slow, the wait to receive our food was a little longer than desired, but all was alright because the band, the non stop chips, and my amazing pina coladas made our experience actually FUN. The kiddos were rockin' out and didn't ask me once when their food was going to arrive (thats a first!).

We finished our meal, and were suddenly bombarded (in a good way) by the whole Mariachi band at our table, armed with churros loaded with whipped cream, and a huge sombrero, for my birthday boy to wear. The whole restaurant joined in to sing Happy Birthday. 

It was truly a perfect day, thanks to delicious food and drink, great service, great experience, and sharing my special day with my firstborn.
