Great view, waiter and chip and dip guy was very attentive. I had a taco salad. The shell was very oily. Chicken was the worst. Chicken tasted as if they defrosted several times and forgot it on the grill. It was so dry I think the chicken died of dehyration. No flavor to the whole salad. This is my first and last visit.
