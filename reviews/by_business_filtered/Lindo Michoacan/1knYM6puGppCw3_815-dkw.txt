Not great, certainly not bad.

I've heard their fresh guacamole is excellent but it's pricey. (I haven't tried it yet).

Their lunch specials are great. I love their green chille pork burrito, their salsa and chips are really good, Their burrito was just ok. Their soup is SO yummmy 

Service is VERY nice and REALLY fast 

They are a little pricey though on their regular menu.
