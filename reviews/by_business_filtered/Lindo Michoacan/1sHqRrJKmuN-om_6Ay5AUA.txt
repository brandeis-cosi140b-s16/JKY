This place is good. The service was great. Our food came out really really fast! If you can get a table by the window the view is cool, you can see the LV sky line! Best part was the Cadillac Margaritas they are strong. Not weak you can definitely taste the alcohol in it!! The food was good definitely worth checking out! Loud atmosphere good for kids and birthday dinners!!!
