If I  could give Zero stars I would! Myself,My husband and son, with two of our friends came in for dinner  a couple  of months  ago. We  made a reservation and Sat for damn near an hour! Seeing how it was a Friday night. We finally get to a table and waited and waited and waited some more, 45 minutes to be exact, Our waiter finally shows up, takes  our drink order and we wait another 15 minutes for that to come. IT  takes Another 45 to put in our food order. I asked  my waiter several times what was taking so long, he couldn't tell me a thing. I  happen to  look over to the bar area , it was a huge wedding party that all the wait staff was catering  to. 2 hours later our food came, half raw ,thrown on a plate and on top of that my son who is five fell asleep at the table and left hungry, we were charged full price for our meal when it should have been comped, they still charged us! Lindo you shit the bed in the worst way, your customers should come first, I and the other 250 people sitting there that night feel the same way, Put off ,highly Pissed and never coming back!
