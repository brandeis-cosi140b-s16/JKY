I had been craving mexican for days and was pretty excited to come here when i heard how good it was.  

i started with a peach strawberry margarita.  yum!  then had some chips, they werent that great but i was hungry so i still ate them.  the salsa wasnt anything special either.  it was all spice.  no flavor, or substance.  i ordered chicken fajitas.  when my plate came out it was about 80% peppers.  there were maybe 4 pieces of onion, and barely any chicken.  i made myself one fajita and then didnt want anymore.  the tortillas werent good either.  

maybe new york has me spoiled when it comes to mexican food, but this place was not even close to what i expected.
