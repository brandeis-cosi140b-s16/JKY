Amazing!  Simply amazing!  I just left Lindo on this rainy day.  To say they were busy, was an understatement!  The waiter, and busboy were 5 star all the way!!!  The food was perfect as always!  I recommend this place to my family, friends, and any tourist friends.  They are pricey, but worth every penny!  They never skimp on quality, or portion control.  I had one of the combinations.  My roomies had the shrimp ceviche.  The BEST!!!  The best food, service, and view.
