I can't say that this place offers "authentic" Mexican food as it reminds me of El Torito and/or Acapulco's.  But, for the general public, I guess, its as authentic as you're gonna get on the West Side.

The menu is pretty expansive, so take a minute to peruse...I chose the Chile Verde Burrito, and it was very good.  Spicy, but good.  Big enough to give me left overs for the following day, too.  My hubby ordered the Carne Asada Torta - as did my uncle - and my aunt got the fajitas.  Pretty expensive, but they picked up the check, so all good.

Probably will go back to taste other things on the menu - but it will have to wait for a pay week!
