One of my favorite Mexican restaurants! You can't beat the service here. Whenever your drink is empty, there is always someone coming along to fill your glass. The food here is delicious.The ensalata marinara is probably my favorite salad here. The avocados and shrimp in it are a very fresh combination. Gallo Al Mojo De Ajo is a great dish for all garlic lovers. Definitely try the fried ice cream, but get it to share with someone, the portion is very large. They have a large variety of flavored margaritas which are great!
