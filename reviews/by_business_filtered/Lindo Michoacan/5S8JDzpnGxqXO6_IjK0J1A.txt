First things first:  in spite of giving only three stars, I want to go back.  I want to give it another try because we really enjoyed the food and drinks and would like to try that again.  My meal was simple; I had two beef tacos and a cheese enchilada.  It came with a tomato-based noodle soup that we both enjoyed, plus rice and beans.  My husband had some kind of chile relleno with shrimp, which was delicious--both of our meals were very good, and we both enjoyed Cadillac Margaritas on the rocks.  Everything came in a timely manner.

The drawbacks:  we made a reservation at 7:00, and arrived a few minutes before.  First the hostess says she does not have our reservation.  No one called, no...oh wait, the spelling is what?  (I should add that our last name is very simple and common.)  Oh, okay, well...wait just a few minutes.  The place was packed, hot, and very very loud.  There was nowhere to sit to wait, and "a few minutes" stretched into 45--at which point we went to the hostess and told her we were leaving.  "I'm seating you right now!" she told us, and they did come within 3 minutes after that.  

After that, things were much better, as stated above.  Things we disliked:  the confusion about the reservation, the long wait, the NOISE--it's so very noisy!--and the restroom could have been better maintained.  This seems to be a family place, so look out for a LOT of kids.  One other thing I had a problem with:  the menu is huge and the restaurant lighting is fairly low, and the small, red print is very difficult to read in that light.

But we will go back, probably much earlier than 7 - 8pm, because that seems to be when the rush is.  I'd like to try the guacamole...and I'll be taking a flashlight so I can see the menu!
