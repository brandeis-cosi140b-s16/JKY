Not sure which was worse, the service or the food. This is three times we've been to this location and it's gotten progressively worse. 

On this trip, it took 20 minutes to order, but only after flagging down a server. The appetizer took 45 minutes to arrive and it was another 30 minutes before entrees hit the table. The entrees (tacos, an enchilada and a chimichanga) were lukewarm. Lindo's prices are roughly 20-percent higher than the other non-strip Mexican eateries around Vegas and this is the overall quality you get?

On a side note, I ordered a Michelada. That was also substandard and bland.
