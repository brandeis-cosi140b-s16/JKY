My husband and I each ordered a bowl of menudo and were disappointed. $25 for 2 bowls of menudo - they only offer one size. The size of the bowl did not match the quantity of actual menudo. There is no hominy in their menudo, which is fine, but the tripe-soup ratio was definitely off. Also, I was really craving an horchata and they said they were all out. Bummer.

The service was fine and the views were spectacular, which is why I gave two stars. I could have gotten a better Menudo at Fausto's down the street for about half the price. I've been here twice, but probably won't be coming back again.
