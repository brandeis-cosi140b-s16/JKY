Beautiful setting foe a Cinco de Mayo
Lunch over looking Las Vegas.   W were lucky enough to get a window table.  The service was definitely 5 star.  Very happy friendly and super efficient.  We had a house margarita and enjoyed the extremely spicy salsa with chips.  Just like we like it.  The food was very good although for we who love spicy the shredded beef was a bit flat which was easily remedied by the addition of the great salsa.  We would definitely return when in the area.
