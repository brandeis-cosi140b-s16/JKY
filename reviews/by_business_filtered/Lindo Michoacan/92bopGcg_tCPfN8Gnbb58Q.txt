The menu is vast! Allow yourself 20 minutes to read through the 6+ pages of options.  

The Summerlin location of this Las Vegas favorite is pricier than the rest.  All of the entrees are approx. $2-3 more than sister properties.  That said, the portions are more than fair.  Your dinner is likely to provide leftovers for an additional meal.  All the meals come with a tasty little cup of tomato fideo soup.  I would go just for this hot deelish little soup cup.  A house margarita is $10 - that's a bit steep for off strip.

On our most recent visit, we started with fresh guacamole.  It is fresh; and mixed up right at your table.  I dined on the coca cola carnitas.  The tender chunks of pork are coated in a rich, dark, flavorful sauce.  They will curb your craving for delicious pork!

My husband was quite pleased with his fish tacos, and my sister in law was ga-ga for her steak tampiquena and cheese enchilada.  Smiles all around.  

Dinner was $110 for 4 with 1 marg, 1 beer, 1 tea, 1 guac, and 4 entrees.  Like I mentioned, a bit high on price but high on portion and flavor as well!
