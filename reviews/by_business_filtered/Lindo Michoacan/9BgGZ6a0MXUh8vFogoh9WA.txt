We came here for the great night view of the city, it was amazing! The restaurant was clean and inviting. Salsa was very spicy but delicious! They have a huge menu with a ton of unique options so we all opted for things out of the ordinary. Buey cilantro was very good and my friends enjoyed the steak with coco cola sauce. If you're in the mood for mexican food definitely worth a try!
