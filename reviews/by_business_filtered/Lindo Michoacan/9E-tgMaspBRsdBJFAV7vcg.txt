This place is incredible! My personal favorite is their chicken soup and their flan. Best tasting flan I've ever had. Service is great, view is spectacular and the food is very tasty. 
I've never been a fan of Mexican food but this is truly a great restaurant and I would recommend it to everyone, as I already do. Lunch specials are also very inexpensive for what u get!! Best Mexican restaurant in Henderson, hands down! ;D
