Excellente'. Greeted at the door and promtly seated. Live music is a nice touch and not overly obtrusive on your conversation and is something Vegas seriously lacks. I must say we had excellent service through out our meal. It started off with the obvious chips and salsa but the addition of bean dip is always welcome cause I love me some bean dip. We ordered the Marinated Chicken Castillo,  Flautas and a Shredded Beef Burrito. Man it came out quick cause we barely got through one bowl of chips. I like the fact all the meals came with guacamole which saves you a ton of dinero, cause what's Mexican food without some guacamole. Drinks were always full to help put out the fire  cause I like it spicy. I really should eat here more cause the shits da bomb. Five jalape√±os for this spot and see why it has so many Best of Last Vegas Awards... Oh and tip the musician, he's really good.
