The place is overall good. The food is good. The service is satisfying. The location is phenomenal, since you have that amazing view of the Las Vegas strip. The only negative thing I could say about this place is that the d√©cor is a bit outdated. Then again, you get that feeling that you're in a true Mexican restaurant.
