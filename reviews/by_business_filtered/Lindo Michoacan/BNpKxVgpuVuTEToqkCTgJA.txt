The food here is average along with the service. That isn't a knock on the establishment it is just simply my experience. What isn't average is THE VIEW!!! WOW!!! Maybe that is why I expected more? Anyway, I had the Milanesa Plate. I must say it was just ok. It was served with French fries. The price was reasonable and I would come back, but mainly for the view.
