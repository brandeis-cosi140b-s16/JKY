Decided to try this restaurant this week to celebrate me getting a Job, so me and my hubby drive about 20 min to get there, and the restaurant looks nice people were very helpful.

  The bad thing was with the food....My hubby had the Arrachera meat which was hard, dry and stiff he had a hard time even pulling it apart, his corn tortillas were not good, and the beans seemed to be from a can or something...I know my beans...Yes, I'm Mexican and a great cook according to every single person that has ever tasted my food..

  As for me, well I had the Carnitas platter with the flour tortillas....The carnitas were stiff, over fried pieces of pork meat, and dry also...So was I dissapointed  "YES"...The good thing was the salsa had OK taste and the Flour Tortillas were GREAT I know they are hand made because I make some a few times a week at home myself.

So I gave 1 star for place being nice including the server, and the other for the salsa and tortillas....but ok...After paying 70 dlls for good flour tortillas and salsa ONLY...I figure I could have made my tortillas for about 2.00 at home and a good salsa for another 2.00.

HMMM...maybe I should think about opening a REAL AUTHENTIC Mexican restaurant myself. :-)
