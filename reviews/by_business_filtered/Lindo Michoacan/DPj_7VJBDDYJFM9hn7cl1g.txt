Lindo Michoacan came highly recommended so we stopped in for appetizers and drinks.  This place did not disappoint!  The views looking back into the city were fantastic but our waiter Manny was the star of the show.  Manny was extremely attentive and took care of all our dietary needs (gluten free).  We enjoyed the Organic Margaritas, quesadillas and table side guacamole.  Lindo Michoacan will be on the must visit list next time we're in Las Vegas.
