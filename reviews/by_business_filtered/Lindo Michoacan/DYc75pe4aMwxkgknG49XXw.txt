Seated up on a hill near Anthem, this location is breathtaking. If you can, avoid the main dining area and get a table near the windows. When I came here it was a beautiful, clear day, so you have an unobstructed view of the city. 

When you sit down you are welcomed with a bowl of warm chips, a side of salsa, and refried beans. The chips are addicting and you might be surprised by how fast they go, but do not worry, the staff will refill it for you.

Our server was a little hard to find, but the hostess and busser came to take our drink orders and then refilled them frequently. Two baskets of chips in, our waiter came around to take our order. This normally would not be a problem, but one person was on a lunch break from work. After another twenty to thirty minutes we got our order. If you have the time to wait, this place is good, but avoid if you have a time restraint.

We got cheese enchiladas, carnitas, carnitas burrito, and the steak skewers. The friend who got the enchiladas liked her dish. The carnitas were seasoned well, but some pieces were really dry. I slathered my in salsa and guacamole. My friend who loves carnitas could not finish his. To give you an idea about how much he loves carnitas, he ate them three meals a day for three days straight while on a business trip.  He also said that he wanted to spit a bite out because it was more like chewing gum than meat. The skewers were the best. Moist and tender with gorgeous pieces of peppers and onion. The portion size is enormous, for $15, it is a great deal for two. 

Overall, the view is what you are paying for.
