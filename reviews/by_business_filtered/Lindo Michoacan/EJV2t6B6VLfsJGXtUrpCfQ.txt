I've been here on a few occasions. The interior of the restaurant is really dim, especially in the day time. You might need the light from your cell phone to light up the menu if you don't happen to have bat vision. Service is great. The moment we walked in the door, the hostess greeted us warmly and seated us at a table of our choosing. A moment later we were seated our waiter and busboy both came by to take our drink order and bring us chips, respectively. Our drinks never went empty and our server was always ready to fulfill all our requests. 

It's definitely not my favorite Mexican food in town, the spice level is definitely toned down and I wish the flavors were just a little more dynamic. I have ordered quite a few things off the menu and have never really been blown away flavor wise, but it's definitely solid. On this occasion, I ordered a shredded chicken burrito, which was huge for the price. It definitely needed more flavor, but it was still a pretty good meal. 

I'd be back, if I'm in the area again... I'll just make sure to ask for extra chile or spicier salsa on the side.
