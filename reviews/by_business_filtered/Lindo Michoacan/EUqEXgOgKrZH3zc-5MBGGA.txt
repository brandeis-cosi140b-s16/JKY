I have been here several times in the past and everything has always been great, great food, service, staff, and decor. The delicious sticks of goodness (churos) are also very delicious! I've been here for lunches, dinners, and just for a quick snack before (delicious sticks of goodness & quacamole). Today was the first time that I came for take out, this experience is also what prompted me to write a review. It was quarter til 10am this morning when I decided to call and see how much menudo was. I was given a price. Then, I had asked if the serving was enough for 2 people and I was told the ounces it contained, but I can't recall now. I asked if they were open & he said no but he could get the order in and it'll be ready in about 20 minutes. I figured that works by the time it's done it'll be during their open hours. When I arrived the food was packed up and ready to be picked up. Then I realized there were no cars in the parking lot and the restaurant was empty. That's when I asked if they were open & they actually didn't open until 11. I was picking up the food before it was even 10:30. I couldn't believe they went ahead and placed and made the order prior to opening. The portion of menudo was also very generous as it definitely fed the two of us & had left overs. I have to say, ordering soup to go has always been a messy experience for me, at any restaurant. But here, they not only packaged the soup in the soup cups but they also put plastic wrap all around to assure no mess. The portions of oregano, peppers, cilantro, and onion was also great. I hate to run out, but that was not a problem. I asked for extra limes, and I definitely got extra lime! It also came with chips & salsa & about 6 or so tortillas as well. I was very pleased. The fact that I was able to pick up food before opening was great. The food was delicious and portions were generous. They didn't skimp on the toppings. Definitely 5 stars!
