Service and food were above and beyond what I expected. This is now my favorite Lindo Michoacan location. 

The guacamole here is great. They have a certain way of doing it but you can feel free to make a suggestion about certain ingredients to cater to your liking. i let them do their thing and it never disappoints.

The food was great, we had a Chile Relleno/ Tamale combo. The Chile Relleno was really good. The pepper was cooked just right, nice and tender but not mushy. The stuffing in the Chile was delicious. The Tamale was great a beef tamale and I could just sit there and eat that all night.

We also ordered a Gallo al Mojo de Ajo. It was a chicken breast cooked in a garlic wine sauce. I cut up that chicken, tossed it in a flour tortilla with the rice, beans, and guacamole and I was happy. Also ordered a Tamale with that, I think that is going to be a permanent a la carte order from now on.

Up next was the Banderillas de Torro. Grilled Beef skewers with onion and green, red, and yellow peppers. A little tough on the meat but tons of flavor. Good stuff.

Service is half of the experience for me. I can go somewhere with excellent food but if the service is lacking it's ruined or I can go somewhere where the food is OK but as long as the service is great, I will have a good experience. This place is a no brainer if you're in the mood for good Mexican food and excellent service.
