We had dinner here, party of eight. The couple had been here before, claiming everything is great! It wasn't, the service was terrible, had to wait for our orders to taken, had to wait along time for our orders to be delivered, had to hunt  for refills and then waited a long time for the check.

Food,$$, the avocado dip was very bad, very strong taste of onions, the avocados were very bland. I ordered the beef taco combo plate, it was very plane, not the taste you paid for.My wife had beef on skewer, the taste was fine, until she found a very small chrome ring, about 1/8in. in size mixed into the meat, they didn't charge for her meal.

The couple that had been here before, had to add bowls of chilli sauce to make it taste good.

Food at a fast food stand tasted a whole lot better, and at a fraction of the cost.
