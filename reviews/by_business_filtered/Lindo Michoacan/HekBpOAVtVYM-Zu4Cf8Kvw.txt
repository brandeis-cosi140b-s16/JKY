GREAT SERVICE, GREAT ATMOSPHERE!! Food well very good not amazing but very good. Lacked a bit of spice probably just basic like salt. But great presentation!!  I had appetizers for dinner. Fidello soup. Excellent!! Guacamole needed more lime juice and salt but hey personal preference. Queso Fundido very good but could of used a better quality chorizo. Finally, Sopapillas very VERY messy to eat. Lots and LOTS of lettuce. Again just missed a smidge of something to pep it up. Otherwise very good. Would have given 4.5 starts but service was that good!! LOVE YA JORGE!!  ALWAYS ask for him. He's the best. Also, great team here even the managers get involved. Great Job guys!!
