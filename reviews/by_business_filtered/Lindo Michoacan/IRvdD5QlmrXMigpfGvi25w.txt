I've been going to Lindo Michooacan La Loma for years, actually it's become a part of my family go-to spot for Mexican food. Aside from the beautiful view of the city you can see from the restaurant, lots of fond memories with friends and family have happened there.  

I must have eaten everything on the menu at least once, but if I had to pick a few items I like the most its the "Chile Verde De Marrano", "Pollo Rebeca" and "Tora ala Coca-Cola" all very delicious.
 
Service is great!! I've never experienced a problem even on busy days, they are attentive and are a courteous staff. In fact, one of the bartenders her name is Erica became a friend of mine. She's very cool, knowledgeable and a good person to have a chat.   

All in all I recommend this place!
