What do you people see in this place???  The food is horrible.

The chips are greasy and soggy.  The red "salsa" (And I use that word lightly) tastes like burnt peppers . . . .This is the WORST salsa I have ever had.

Then the soup that comes with the meals . . .what the hell is that?  It is terrible.  The people who had been there before in our party basically screamed a loud "NO" when the put that soup down in front of them . . . and told them to take it away.

The chicken burrito I had lacked flavor . . . it was not marinated or seasoned at all.  It was like they just threw chicken in a tortilla and called it a day.  Three of us in our party all had this and all agreed that it was the worst burrito EVER and that Del Taco makes batter food.  One person found chicken bones and grissle in her burrito . . . she currently has an upset stomach and will most likely throw up.

This place should be shut down it is that bad . . . yet there is a huge wait each night to get gross food . . . I just don't get it.

The only thing that is nice about the place is the view . . .but that is spoiled by how loud this place is . . . you can't hear the person next to you.

So come on people . . . ..take your business elsewhere . . .this place frankly offers some of the worst Mexican food I have ever experienced.
