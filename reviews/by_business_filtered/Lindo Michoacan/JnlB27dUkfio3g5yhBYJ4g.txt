Good family style Mexican restaurant. Nothing bad on the menu.

If you aren't full after eating here, it's your own fault.

Chips and salsa are served along with refried beans, so be sure to save room for your meal!

This is the sit-down Mexican restaurant I recommend to friends and family in town visiting. 

My favorites are the chimichangas and chicken tacos.
