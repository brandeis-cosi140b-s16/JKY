The first time my sister took me here I ordered the chevice I thought it was going to just be okay so I didn't get my hopes up. I ordered some drinks but I didn't even drink them until after I ate the chevice because it was amazing and I stuffed myself eating it. I shared maybe one bite and had to stay a hour to finish my drinks. I don't live in Nevada so my stomach is always thinking about this place and trying to substitute the flavor until I go back out there but nothing gets me there until I visit.
