I went here last halloween with my boyfriend for a low key night. It was fun to walk in to everyone dressed up. The wait staff was by far the friendliest and very observant to keep the water glasses filled, which I find it hard to come by these days. 

The food was very good, and the portion sizes were large for myself. Boyfriend had no trouble finishing his however, haha.  Prices were pretty standard I think. About 10-15 a plate,  depending on the meat and amount. Overall, it was a nice place with friendly people. I have been back once, and was treated the same, so although i haven't been a ton I would consider it to be a pretty consistent restaurant as far as staff and food goes; and that is what keeps me a continuous customer.
