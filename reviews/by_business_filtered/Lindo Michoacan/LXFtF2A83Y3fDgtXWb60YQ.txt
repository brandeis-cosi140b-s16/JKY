Let me start by saying I love this place.  I had pscado "playa azul" that's the best a white guy can do. The flavor was great but the quality and portion of fish could of been a little better for $20. The staff is great as well and the view is awesome. And thats what I think you're paying for. I live within walking distance so I'm here quite often but just started yelping.
