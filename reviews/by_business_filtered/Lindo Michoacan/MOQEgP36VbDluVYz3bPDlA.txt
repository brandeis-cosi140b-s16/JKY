My family eats here every couple months. Their food is very delicious, authentic Mexican and the service is usually above par.  It only got 3 stars from me because of the price. Mexican food is typically cheap to make and I have a pretty big family, so when we are feeling like good Mexican food, it's hard to cough up $50-$60 to feed all of us! I think they could be more reasonably priced.
