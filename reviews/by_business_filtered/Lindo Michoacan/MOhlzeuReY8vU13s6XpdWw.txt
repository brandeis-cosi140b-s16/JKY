I love this place.  Unfortunately, I seem to get the carnitas every time I go now.  They are very well prepared and come with large home made flour tortillas that are awesome.  There are always leftovers for the next day's lunch.

We always get the table-side guacamole, which i would recommend regulating the amount of ingredients the servers mix in.  Some of the servers just dump a whole bowl of onion, one of tomatoes, and another of jalapenos into the mix.  It should just be a touch of each of those.

I sat outside on our last visit and it was very pleasant.  Inside is a little more typical, but still nice. 

Food update:  I didn't like the Chile Verde as I found it too sour.  But I did have the Chile Relleno, and I recommend!  They use Pasilla Chiles (i'm purdy sure), and nice creamy cheese that mixes well with the enchilada sauce that its covered in.  The sauce is almost as good as mine! (almost.)  

I generally disagree with the other comments about service.  I have generally had very good luck and received extremely friendly service.
