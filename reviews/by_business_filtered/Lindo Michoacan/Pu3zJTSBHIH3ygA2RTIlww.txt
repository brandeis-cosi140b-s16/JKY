Disappointing.  I've enjoyed the Henderson location most.  The E. Desert Inn location is also off.  But the W. Flamingo is just "not great".  The taco salad at lunch today was the worst in memory - no flavor - simply thrown together.  Cabbage to fill the lettuce.  Not much tomato.  Not a spec of cilantro or onion.  The chicken was gawd awful.  Service staff was working hard, but without good effect.  From Henderson, I got the impression this group was run by a nice family and had their management chops down.  I'm afraid not.  Alternatives abound.
