My experience at Lindo Michoacan has always been five stars. Even today I am rating the overall experience at four stars due to some glitches which I'll mention shortly. I'll start with positive highlights from today as I believe it's fair to point out the good. Today I decided to try a new item, the "Milanesa con papas" which is a lightly breaded steak with French fries on the side, this dish delivers in value, taste, portion size and presentation. Two thumbs up! One of our dinner companions today had not such a good experience which truly saddens me as I love this place and love it when people share my experience. Her dish seemed to take a little bit longer than expected, the restaurant was busy so we understand. However her steak came undercooked when she asked for it to be well done. Steak was taken back to the kitchen and came back burnt to the table. My humble suggestion to the manager would be for waiters to follow simple directions and relay them back to the kitchen. With that being said I will be back to give them another chance.
