I found my new favorite dish here...the Camarones Sarandeados Estilo "Tia Esther" (18.25$). I had it last night and I can't stop thinking about it. The shrimp were sweet, perfectly cooked in a red sauce with a hint of heat. I also had one of their Javier's Organic Margaritas (10$) on the rocks, I'm usually not a big fan of margaritas but this was delicious. I like their fideo soup, but I add a bit of salsa to it and crush up a few chips, you won't be sorry if you follow my lead. Service was great. It was a bit loud, they had a keyboard playing in the dining room that made it hard to talk, that was my only complaint. 
It was our friends birthday so the staff surprised him with a song, some churro a, and a shot. Very cool!
