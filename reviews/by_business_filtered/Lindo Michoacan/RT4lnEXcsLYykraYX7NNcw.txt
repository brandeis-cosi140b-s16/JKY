My wife and I have eaten here several times, the food was usually good.  However, today we had lunch there and it was unimpressive.  I ordered the carne asada plate and my wife ordered the carne asada tacos.  The carne asad did not have any seasoning.  My guess is that the pre cook it and store it in water then grill it when they need to serve it.  When you bite into the meat it appears to be water logged and has absolutely no taste.  We were very disapointed.
