Coming from the Bay Area, where the SF Mission has some of the best Mexican food around and then living for 5 years in Socal, I thought the Vegas Mexican food experience would be very underwhelming. Lindo Michoacan has definitely changed my mind! The restaurant itself is more sprawling than other restaurants and there's a lot of different types of seating (booths, patio area, long tables, etc.). Our servers/runners were on top of it and we were never left wanting chips, salsa, bean dip, water, etc. The chicken in my enchiladas was soft and flavorful and my fiance really enjoyed the fajitas he ordered. I preferred this place over Bonita Michoacan (they might be the same owners),  where I had a Groupon, but that location was farther from us and the parking wasn't ideal. I guess the fairer comparison is against Frank and Fina's Cocina, which is right around the corner. I would say I didn't enjoy the atmosphere as much at F&F and the staff there definitely catered to the regulars a bit more, so we had to wait awhile to get worker's attention on a lot of things.

All in all, until I find a better restaurant, Lindo Michoacan will be the go-to Mexican spot.
