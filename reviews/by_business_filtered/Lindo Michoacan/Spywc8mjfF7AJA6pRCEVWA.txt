For authentic Mexican food in the desert, Lindo Michoacan is great.  The food taste amazing, the salsa is spicy, the margarita's are strong and the portions are large.  The service is also very wonderful.  I had the carnitas on the bone and it was fall off the bone moist and succulent.  The burrito is also super huge and can be enjoyed by 2 people!   We also had the Queso Fundedo con Choritzo for the app.  It was not the best I've ever had.  I would pass the next time.

When My wife was sick, I came her to get the Pollo soup and it was fabulous, hit the spot.  

The only downfall is that is quite expensive for Mexican food.  Our dinner bill was around $80 (1 drink).  I always feel like Asian food and Mexican food should not be that expensive.   My humble opinon.

Other than that, if you are looking for great Mexican food, I'd recommend.
