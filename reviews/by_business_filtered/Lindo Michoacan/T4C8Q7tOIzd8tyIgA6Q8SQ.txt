I was recommended this place for great Mexican 2 nights ago so we came then and again tonight! I have lived in 3 states and I can honestly say this may be the best Mexican food I have ever had! 

First night we had 2 frozen margaritas, one regular, one Cadillac both amazing! Then I had the fried tilapia (HUGE! And delicious!) and he had the steak rancheros....I would NEVER expect their New York steak to be as tender and flavorful as it was..OMG! I ate half of his steak and we took half the fish home! Wow! Then we had the fried ice cream with bananas and fire rum...VERY alcohol flavored. Id probably go with something a bit less next time. But still great! Our server and backwaiter were both very attentive and amazing! 

Tonight it was so busy so we sat at the bar while waiting. Had a mojito and pi√±a Bonita which was sweet but STRONG! Tipsy before hitting the table! The bartenders were slammed but still so sweet and helpful! Then I had a skinny marg on the rocks (fresh lime juice instead of sweet and sour) and let's just say I couldn't drive home! Had the steak cognac with mushrooms for him with the NY steak again and I had the bone in ribeye with cilantro lime sauce. Omg both were so tender and amazing! Cooked perfectly to a med rare and SOOOO huge and delicious! Service was great again from the management to the server and backwaiter along with the bartenders. 

We both work in very nice fine dining and steak houses in the Venetian on the strip and know good food, service and atmosphere....this place has it! 

I would HIGHLY recommend this restaurant for its drinks, food, service and VIEW of this strip/city!! We live down the street and have found our regular spot!
