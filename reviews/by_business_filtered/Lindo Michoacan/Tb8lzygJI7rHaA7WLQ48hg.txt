Great service!!  Our waiter (who had the hair of Clarke Gable, absolutely gorgeous) was attentive enough that we never wanted for anything, but not overly attentive to the point where I felt like every story I was telling the person I ate with was interrupted.  The food was good, though I've had better.  The drinks were delicious!  Good experience for sure.  I'll be back!
