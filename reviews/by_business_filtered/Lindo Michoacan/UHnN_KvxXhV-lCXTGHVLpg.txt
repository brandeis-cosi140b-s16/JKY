Amazing food and staff. Always feel at home here. When you're in there next time, make sure to have Joy make you a drink at the bar and to have Leo come say hello. Nicest people I've ever net in the business. One of the bussers Manuel is always on point and I date you to have your water glass get empty. Amazing place and prices are great for the portions. Also, go on a Friday or Saturday night to enjoy the live music.

Leo is amazing once again and Oswaldo is an amazing server!  Ask for him!
