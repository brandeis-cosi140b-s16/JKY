ambiance is energetic. spectacular view of the vegas strip, but not a very romantic place since it does get quite bustling.

food is very good. service is friendly. the dishes appear pricy but the portions are HUGE. 2 entrees for 3 people should be sufficient. the hubby and I ordered one entree each and after getting a bit too excited with their delicious chips and salsa, we pretty much had one full entree left over after we were done. will definitely visit again. seems very group/family friendly as well.

oh, the only "bad" thing was that parking was limited. honestly, their parking lot is a reasonable size, but it does seem to get very crowded, even on weeknights.
