Amazing views of the skyline of Vegas! This was an amazing Mexican restaurant from the decor to the ambiance to the food the only reason it's not a 5 star is because of some mediocre service. It was slow to start but ended up good at the end. I had the fajitas de Reyes which were amazing really good seasoned meat followed with the perfect amount of peppers onions and tomatoes. The rest of my party really enjoyed the food as well. The evenin was topped off with a mariachi band that was playing live music. This is not on the strip in fact no where near it and we wouldnt have know about it except for family that lives in lv. The fried ice cream was delicious and we all shared because the portions are very generous! Be ready to eat when you get there cuz from beginning to end it's all food!
