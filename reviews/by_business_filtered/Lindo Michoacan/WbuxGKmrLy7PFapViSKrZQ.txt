I like the view if you get a spot by the window, and the service is great.  The food is very tasty!  Try the chicken tie ester!  Yummy & spicey

Downfall:  the noise level is extreme!  Poor acoustics amplify every noise along with the   Live music. If you cant hear your date who is sitting next to you..,then your place is too loud.

Please keep small children at home, as the noise level startles them along with the ringing of the birthday bell ...causing them ti scream over the noise.
