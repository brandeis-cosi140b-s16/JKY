The food here is always 5 stars, but the service has been less than desirable the last few visits.  Margaritas are yummy in my tummy!

The fresh guacamole is the perfect start, with extra lime juice for me please.  I always get the garlic chicken mole', absolutely amazing 7 times and counting.  I wanted to try something different so I went with the steak fajitas and I might have a new favorite!

Did I mention they have one of the best view in Vegas with glass windows that make the best sunset setting.  We watched the fireworks there this past July 4th and it was great.
