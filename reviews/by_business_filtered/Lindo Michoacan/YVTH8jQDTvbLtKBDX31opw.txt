We stopped in this afternoon for margaritas and a lite snack.... this was my first time to this location, but I am definitely a Lindo fan from visits to the other locations! We sat at the bar and I LOVE the view, the service was great, they were very attentive but yet let us have our space to relax.... we enjoyed a few margaritas and enjoyed the wonderful chips and salsa (the salsa seemed spicier than normal today- which we LOVED!) and I am a huge fan of the bean dip they have as well. 

Lindo Michoacan is always a great choice!
