Oh boy! My boss is taking me and my coworkers out for Mexican food! What could be better?

The restaurant was oddly empty considering we arrived at noon and left around 2pm (in fact, there was no one there by the time we left.) The menu had tons of choices and even a special "vegetarian" section, highlighting the few meatless dishes available.

I ordered vegetable fajitas. They weren't bad. The vegetable choice was great, but it was lacking flavor. I suppose it was "healthier" that way, but if you're going in that direction, why not offer wheat or whole grain tortillas?

The prices were pretty high, but the servings are large enough for 2-3 small meals. The service was outstanding--I think I was offered a drink refill at least five or six times. My boss joked that we were getting great service because he had four women with him. He may have been right. I'm okay with that.

Oh, and if you order guacamole, someone will make it right in front of you, to your specifications. That was pretty neat.

I probably won't return, but it wasn't bad--just not outstanding.
