We've been here before and had a great experience, so when friends were in from out of town, we decided to take them here.
The staff is always friendly and helpful, especially if you have questions about the menu or would like the staff's opinion on a food or drink. The atmosphere is cute, lots of Mexican decor. The prices are good for the quantity and quality of food. Free chips with salsa and bean dip is always a plus. The salsa isn't the best so I stick with the beans.
On this time around we decided to share the Carne Fajitas de Res, love the hand made tortillas. The steak was a bit sparse, I was wishing we didn't share, just not enough for the 2 of us. But it was good. 
On other occasions we have got the Camarones Abuelito Timo, a delicious and flavorful...Shrimp stuffed with cheese and peppers, wrapped in bacon with a spicy mayo dipping sauce. I think they created this just for me. My husband loves to get the 
Enchiladas de Mole con Carne, perfectly cooked New York steak with cheese enchiladas all smothered in mole sauce.  All of there mixed drinks are well made. 
My friends ate every bite of their meals as well and said they loved it.
As we sat there we said " we need to come here more often".  Sounds like a good idea!
