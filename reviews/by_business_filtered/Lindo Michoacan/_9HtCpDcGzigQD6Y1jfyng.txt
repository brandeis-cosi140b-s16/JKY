Went here last Sunday morning, I've been to the other michoacan on sunset and always liked it. Didn't realize there was a location so close to me until seeing it on yelp. My gf had a craving for chilaquiles so we decided to give try this location out.
         We went her brother, his gf, and their uncle. The girls got the chilaquiles, the brother and I had the menudo, uncle had some shrimp dish. We also had a couple bloody Mary's and some horchata. The menudo was good, it had a nice clean flavor and wasn't gamey at all. Chilaquiles were ok and shrimp was just ok too. Everything seemed to be a little bland and we need to use a lot of condiments to add some spice. The bloody Mary's had great flavor but I would prefer them a bit stronger since they were $10 each.
       Overall it was ok but I enjoyed the other location we tried a little more. The service was decent except it took them like 15 mins to run our cards after we got the bill. Value is not that great, our bill was a little over $100 for some basic Mexican fare. Probably won't be back anytime soon, would rather drive a bit for better cheaper Mexican.
