Absolutely LOVE this restaurant! Authentic Mexican food with an amazing view of the city. Top notch quality service every time we go. I love how even if our server is busy, someone else will come up to our table to re fill drinks or ask us if we need anything. One of our favorites and a great date night for dinner!
