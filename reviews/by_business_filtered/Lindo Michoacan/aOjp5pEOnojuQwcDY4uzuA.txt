I'm coming here for the views and atmosphere.  Service is perfect, margaritas not too sweet, views incredible. 

My favorite dish is whole fish, fried and I understood that it is hit or miss. Sometimes it great, tender and juicy, sometimes its dry and overcooked. So unless i'm crazy hungry i stay on the safe side with fish ceviche. Ceviche is always done perfectly.
