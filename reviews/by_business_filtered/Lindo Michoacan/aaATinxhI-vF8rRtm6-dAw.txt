WE HAD OUR CREDIT CARD INFO STOLEN FROM THIS PLACE!!  BEWARE!!
We ate lunch here one afternoon about a month ago.  My partner used his business card as it was a business lunch - hasn't used this card in 6 months.  Well one of the tons of different staff that served us is a THIEF and skimmed the card and security code!  Two weeks later someone in New York is trying to use a perfect replica of the card to make purchases at gas stations and food.  Our credit card company caught if quickly as we have zero connections to New York.  Beware. They hired a roach of a person.  The nachos are not worth it!  I contacted a manager but for all I know he's in on the scam.  It was absolutely THIS place!
