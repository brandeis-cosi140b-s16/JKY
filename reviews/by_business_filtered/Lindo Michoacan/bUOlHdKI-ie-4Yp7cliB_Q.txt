The best view in town for sure!  The food is solid.  I really enjoyed the enchilada and taco combo with chicken.  They also have an amazing veggie option for their burritos and enchilada's that is filled with peppers, squash, carrots, and tons of goodness.  

I would stay away from the margarita's on the rocks and go blended.  The mix they use is a little sweat.  The beans that come out with the chips for free...a definite bonus.
