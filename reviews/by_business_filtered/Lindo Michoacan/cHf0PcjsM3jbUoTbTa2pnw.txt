My fiance and I met here.  However, when we met it was a very nice Italian restaurant.  We were sad to see the Italian place fail but are pleasantly surprised by the service and food quality of this fairly classy Mexican joint!

The only real negative experience was when I ordered a dish that was a Mexican take on steak.  The cut of steak was not very good with a lot of fat and gristle.  I want to state though that ALL OTHER meals I've eaten there were well above average!  In total, we've eaten here about 8 times.

So just stay away from any steak dishes and you're good to go.
