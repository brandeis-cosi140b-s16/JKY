Once again we had a great meal, great service and only a 10 minute wait on a Saturday night for a party of 6 without reservations. We ordered the Guacamole as an appetizer, along with the standard chips, salsa and beans served and it was perfection! The Cadillac Margarita was a little strong for me, but that is my typical response with any Tequila based drink, everyone else loved theirs and we all had a second round. Our server, I wish I could remember her name, was outstanding. She took considerable care to ensure our 'special' order was made as requested and was acceptable. She was courteous without being intrusive and we look forward to seeing her again. The beef burrito, enchilada style will put you in a comfy food coma, and every bite is worth it.
