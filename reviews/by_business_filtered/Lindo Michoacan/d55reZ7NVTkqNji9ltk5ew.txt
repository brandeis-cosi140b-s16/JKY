Yummy food, great portions. It was a little crowded, but it was a Saturday night, so what do you expect. I ordered sopitas as an appetizer and had the beef flautas for dinner. The sopitas were so filling, that I could only get through one flauta! I ate the rest the next day for lunch and they were still yummy. Make sure to come here hungry! I couldn't even imagine getting dessert, I was so full, but I did allow myself a glass of horchata, which didn't disappoint! Great food and great service!
