This is by far the best Mexican I've ever had! 

The chips come with salsa and beans that are actually quite delightful. The menu is extensive, which is a bit overwhelming. I had the chicken flautas and they were delicious! We also got the tableside guacamole which was sheer perfection. The drinks are hearty and the entre√©s come with a side of fideo soup. I had never experienced fideo before, but it's absolutely something I will be adding to our carousel of homey meals.
