Great fish tacos.  But salsa they serve with their chips... kind of not to my liking. And they also serve two bowls of refried beans to dip your chips in too.  That was weird. Or maybe I'm weird. I don't know.  But that was a first for me at a Mexican restaurant.  I mean, I know they serve beans as a side with your meal but as a dip for your chips? Weird. 

That's pretty much all I can say about this place. The ambiance though felt like a chain restaurant. 

This place was good, but not great.
