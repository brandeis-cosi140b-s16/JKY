I often base the tip on how long my water glass stays empty. They earned a bonus tonight. Good food, above average service, chili Colorado burrito very good. Most everything we have had here is tasty. Ask to sit by the window for a nice view of the strip. So why not five stars...well they are a little pricy but sometimes it's worth it...good food, good service...yeah worth it.
