The food, although it's different from what I'm used to, was delicious! The first time we went the waiter was awesome and nice. I am a little disappointed that they don't have mariachi but I'll live. The view is amazing, you can see the whole valley. And the atmosphere is great. The decorations were awesome! And apparently everyone celebrates their birthday there because they sing "las ma√±anitas" on a regular!
