I'm telling you, their guacamole is the best thing I have ever tasted. They make it fresh right in front of you at your table when you order it (I think it's a side dish; not the one that comes with the meals) and it is so so so yummy! They're dishes are great, and the complimentary chips and dips that come before the meal are so good; I almost got full before even getting my meal. The staff is friendly and they even have live music playing at night. 

A little side note; parking on weekends get crazy so get there early or eat here on the weekdays!
