Great View, Large Menu (literally).  It really helps to look through the food photos to help make your selection.  Thanks Yelpers!

The lunch menu has many selections for a great price.  I had the steak and shrimp fajita lunch and it was great.  I was happy to see that there is a lot more on this menu than just the fajita/burrito/enchilada and two meats you see at a lot of other Mexican Restaurants.  You could come here everyday for a month and order something different from the day before and not get board.

It's a great experience but as another yelper put it best "the food is good and the menu is vast, It's not the best Mexican [food] I've ever tasted, but it's good." - Kendra F.
