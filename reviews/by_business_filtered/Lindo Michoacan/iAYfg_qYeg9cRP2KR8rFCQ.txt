I reviewed this place about 3 years ago and my opinion has not changed. Still a great restaurant that excels in service.  Staff highly attentive, and really liked the three young lady greeters at front in regional dress.  Food of course great and varied.  We have a condo in Vegas and visit 4 or 5 times a year and this is often our default go to place.  Avoid it at Mexican Independence day though.  Real crowded with large groups and service suffers a bit.
