Lindo has great food, a fun atmosphere, and an amazing view of the strip! There menu has a lot of different options compared to most mexican restaurants and they are all reasonably priced. It's usually pretty busy so plan on waiting, but it will be worth your time. This is another place I would take my family and friends to when they come to visit
