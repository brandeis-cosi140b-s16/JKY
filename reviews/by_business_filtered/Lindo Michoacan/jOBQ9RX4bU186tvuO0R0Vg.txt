Very good food, decent service, and a very nice restaurant with a beautiful view. Extensive menu, A la Carte option is nice. Great for families. Beautiful bar with a strip view, too bad it's covered in poker machines. Very popular place. I live across the street, and most nights the cars are parked up along the street because the parking lot is full. 

GREAT margaritas.
