Really wanted to like this spot but theres nothin special about this place but the view of the city.
The food is almost flavorless and overpriced. I had the camarones a la diabla (spicy shrimp) nothin spicy about them in fact they where sweet, sucks cause thats my favorite dish but I can get a way better plate of this in North LV for half the price also almost 20 bucks for a shrimp cocktail with octupus, shoot I can pay 9 bucks at the robertos on green valley and horizon ridge for the same amount and taste way better. I'm sorry but I really wanted to like this place but the food just isn't that great put some flavor on it and give me a salsa with some kick to it I feel sorry for the people that think this is good mexican food cause they never experienced the real deal not to mention getting ripped off with these prices....
