We still enjoy coming to Lindo Michoacan with friends to have a quality Mexican meal. Great chips, beans and salsa. Very tasty margaritas, and whatever meal I have, the food is consistently good. 

The music can be a little too loud for me, but just sit in the dining room OR on the patio and you can avoid getting your ear blasted and having to yell at your table mates just to have a conversation. :)
