One star goes to the amazing bean dip that how can you possibly mess up? And the second star goes to the awesome quesso fundido. 

Moving on to the negatives....

The prices are ridiculously high considering how far from authentic this is to Mexican. The chilaquiles were terrible. The staff didn't seem to be completely "there". I've never been a huge fan of the Lindo chains....feel like they should try a lot harder to be more authentic with their food. They never fail to disappoint me.
