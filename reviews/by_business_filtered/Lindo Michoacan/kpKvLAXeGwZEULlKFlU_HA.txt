Just finished dinner here at Lindo Michoacan, it was fabulous. Just about the best Mexican restaurant in the valley. Had the Pipian, which is tongue in a special kind of Mol√© sauce, damn delicious. Order the drably made, table side made guacamole, it's definitely worth it. Plus the view from the bar is spectacular. Will come back again soon.
