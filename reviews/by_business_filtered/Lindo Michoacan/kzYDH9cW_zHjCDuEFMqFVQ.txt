I've been to quite a few of the Lindo Michocan restaurants here in Vegas and haven't been wowed yet. I tend to come here for birthdays of friends who are bit fans, but I don't really come here other wise. 

I like how the tortillas are freshly made in house! They are very delicious and have great texture! I also like the view from this particular location! Very romantic and great way to see the city. 

The sauces seem a bit flat and not quite what they probably could be. The mole was ok and I do enjoy their carnitas. Their tacos, enchiladas, and tamales aren't the best out there.  

I have yet to find a really really good place for Mexican food her in Vegas.
