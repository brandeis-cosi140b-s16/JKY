1 star.  Here is why: this is not Mexican Food.  This is food that has gone through some strange evolution to please it's local community.  The local community is happy with it: they are always packed... so in that case, okaaaaay... 

I am not going to claim to be a connoisseur of Mexican food, but well, let's just say I know good Mexican and New Mexican cuisine.  This is not it. 

We have given this place several tries.  Part of the reason for their success is really about location and clientele. They have an amazing view of downtown Las Vegas and there is absolutely no other legitimate competition in the area.   Oh one more thing: I think they load up the margaritas with so much bad tequila you would not be able to taste bad food if you wanted to. 

Here's the bottom line, if you can stomach the bad Mexican because you do not know any better, then have at it.  If you know good Mexican (and New Mexican) then stay away.  You will be disappointed over and over again. 

Just look at the clientele, they are extremely telling if the food is authentic or not.  And again, it may have it's own authenticity - an adaptation for it's local community...which is not for me.
