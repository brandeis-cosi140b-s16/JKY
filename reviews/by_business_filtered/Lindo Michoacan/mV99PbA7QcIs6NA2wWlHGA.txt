This review is long over due I have had the pleasure of enjoying this food on multiple occasions every time we have friends, family and just if the temptaion becomes too great we visit Lindo, I have had good, bad and horrible mexican food in this town but I will say in my opinion it does not get better then this.
Authentic, flavorful, fresh, original and served by an extremely attentive wait staff. My daughter and her fiance never miss an opprotunity to eat here when in town they live in California (where I am from) and thought all the best mexican food could be found... but I was wrong it took me 3 1/2 years to find this place and I will always be a loyal patron, if only for the table side guacamole, (yes I know this isnt impressive) but it is always flawless...the Pork Chili Verde has so much flavor like it has been cooked with love for hours. 
I have had breakfast, brunch, lunch and dinner here it never disappoints, it can be very busy on Holidays and weekends but it is worth the wait and the view did I mention the view? It is worth seeing especiall at sunset or after dark.
Try it you will like it if you enjoy authentic deep rich flavors and quality fare you will become addicted to this place.
