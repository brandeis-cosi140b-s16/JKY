We visited on a Sunday night over President's Day weekend and it was PACKED - even at 7pm, we had to wait 30 min for a table. The server was decently attentive but kept forgetting the kids' drinks and had to be reminded repeatedly.  The chips are house made, hot, and greasy - beware of filling up on them before the meal comes, especially on a long wait like we had!  And the accompanying dip came in two varieties:  uber spicy salsa (high bar for uber spicy here) and bland bean dip.  I found myself wishing for something moderate. The kids liked the bean dip, however. Thumbs up for the frozen margarita that helped wash it all down (for us -- lemonade for the kiddos :))  .  Do the skinny option for a more authentic experience, if you don't want that nasty sweet and sour mix.  OK - onto the entr√©e.  Everyone seemed  happy with their choice -- my wife got a goat soup that was unusual and tasty, from the bite I had. I got an orange roughy dish that was stuffed with shrimp, octopus, and cilantro/tomato mix, then lightly fried and coated in a creamy sauce that was --  yes, uber spicy!  And delicious.  I found myself wishing for two stomachs and regretting all of those chips, as there was no way I could finish it. All in all, considering that we live in Seattle and yearn for authentic Mexican, this fit the bill with some unique dishes we'd never tried before.
