The service is always good. The food is ok. For Wexican food i guess its ok for what it is. The prices are ok but should be lower due to the quality of the food. Its fast so it must not be fresh and made to order...
I only come here when a friend wants to go but def not my choice.
I prefer Juan's Flaming Fajitas over this place...
