We came at lunch. Wasn't to busy. Sat next to the window that over looks Las Vegas. Beautiful day, so we were able to enjoy the view. The service was top notch. Drinks never got below half a glass. 

The chips are everything you would expect. Delicious fresh and served with beans and salsa. Both of which were excellent. 

I ordered the carne Assad tacos. They don't mess around. Tons of meat. The rice and beans were on point and the guacamole was great. 

She ordered the pollo e creama (number 16 on the specials menu.) Man bat was seriously amazing. I should have ordered that as well!!

All in all a great experience. Great staff that were polite, great view, excellent food and amazing service. We will be back for sure.
