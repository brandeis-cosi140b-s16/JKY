Authentic Mexican restaurant with an amazing view in the city of Henderson. It is almost always packed when ever I come to dine. My husband and I usually grab a drink at the bar and admire the view before being seated. Every time I have dined there has been a mariachi band and live guitarist- makes the experience that more enjoyable. Their chips and salsa are delicious and are also served with bean dip! I usually order the tostada appetizer or the shrimp tacos, both delicious! Amazing food, affordable, and spectacular view of the strip- you can't beat it!
