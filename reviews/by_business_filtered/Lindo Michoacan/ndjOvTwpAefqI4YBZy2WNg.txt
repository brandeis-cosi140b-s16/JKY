Such amazing service. Ordered the fresh table-side guacamole and the shrimp fajitas. 

Our waiter was very attentive and came within 5 minutes of us ordering to make our table-side guacamole. They asked how much of the mix-ins to make our guacamole exactly the way we wanted. The guacamole tasted so fresh and had such little ingredients. All together, they used avocado, diced tomatoes, onions, cilantro and jalapeno; as well as dashes of salt and pepper and a squeeze of half a lime.

The shrimp fajitas came out very quickly as well. We asked for both flour and corn tortillas and it was not a problem. Will be coming back!
