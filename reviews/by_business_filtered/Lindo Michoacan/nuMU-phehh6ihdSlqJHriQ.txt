It's okay, I honestly don't see what all the hype is. I've been here twice. The first time was at lunch and I had a taco and an enchilada that tasted like the sauce was out of a can and uncooked. The second time for dinner was better. I had a skirt steak, which was good, but nothing I'd rave over. I miss El Jeffe's (creativity and flavor).

On the upside, the view is incredible. The service was alright and yes, the restaurant is loud, but you have to blame that on the previous owners that built the horrible Italian restaurant that was there.
