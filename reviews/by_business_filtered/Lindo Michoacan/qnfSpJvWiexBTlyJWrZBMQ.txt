I'd heard about the other Lindo Michoacan locations many times from my in-laws, just never mustered up the Mexican cravings enough to make the trip (yes we're pretty lazy!). So when we heard they opened one five minutes from our house, Hubby and I decided we'd finally see what all the fuss was about. 

Being that Mexican food is Hubby's favorite fare, we eat it a lot, with unfortunately not much satisfaction in the "authentic" arena besides the taco shops that blanket Vegas (Roberto's IS the Real Deal straight from SoCal). So trying LM's Chile Verde and Guacamole burrito combo made us both smile from ear to ear. It came with a Chicken Taco and a Chicken Enchillada, both of which were equally as delictable. And surprisingly their Chipotle Caesar Salad was insanely good with the little Sweet Cornbread bites that were very reminiscent of my all time favorite Sweet Corn Tamales at the original El Torito (SoCal).  [Sad to say they changed their dressing for the salad, so that one is a skip for now.]

Bottom line... LM is a great 'Autentico' Mexican food restaurant with a great view, and decently priced combos.  The Chile Verde will not steer you wrong, and neither will the friendly staff.  We're just so elated they finally graced the Henderson area with their yummy eats!
