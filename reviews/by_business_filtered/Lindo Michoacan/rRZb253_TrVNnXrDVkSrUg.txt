This is by far my favorite Mexican restaurant in town! My husband and I eat here about twice a month. Every time we go I try something new but my husband loves the Camarones Abuelito Timo so much he always orders it. Our favorite waiter Renee doesn't even ask him what he wants, he just knows. I have loved everything I have tried at Lindo. The views are fabulous, the food is beyond your typical Americanized Mexican food. The drinks are great, superb service, the live music always awesome, and some nights there is a great Mariachi band. Expect to wait for a table but who cares, it's worth it. Order a margarita, and enjoy!
