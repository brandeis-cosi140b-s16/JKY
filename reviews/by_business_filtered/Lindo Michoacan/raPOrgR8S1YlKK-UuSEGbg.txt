Me and my wife love this restaurant. I've only tried one bad thing on the menu (which was my bad because it was a Coca Cola marinaded steak and I hate sweet meats). They always have live music and delicious margaritas (often they are very heavy handed with the tequila which I love!). The salsa is good (nothing to write home about though) and they have really good guacamole. Good restaurant overall.
