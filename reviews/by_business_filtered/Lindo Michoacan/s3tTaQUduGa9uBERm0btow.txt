Winner of The Starbucks Syndrome Award. What is this award? Well everyone knows that Starbucks serves the worst coffee on planet earth and charge outrageous prices for same yet they continue to pack customers in for no other reason than the coolness factor and name recognition.

The same goes for this restaurant. It's in a well-to-do area without a lot of eating establishments and the people go because it's convenient and they can afford to throw their money away. 

Hence, if you are looking for a loud, noisy, place with mediocre food that costs as much or more than eating on the strip, this is your place! 

From the worst salsa I have ever eaten in my life to the greasy chips, I told my wife then we should run, not walk out of there. The average plate costs $15-20, which is simply absurd for what you get ....bland food with a lot of breading and little meat at a cost that will allow you to go to much nicer restaurants for a cheaper price.

Simply unbelievable that this place is in business. And, just like Starbucks, it just goes to show that American standards have become increasingly low compared to other places in the world. Hence, we throw away our money and don't hold people/establishments accountable for their actions and, in fact, reward them for ripping us off just as we do our politicians.
