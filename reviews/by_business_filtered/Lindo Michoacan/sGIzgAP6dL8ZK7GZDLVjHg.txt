"Stop Staring at Me!"

I'm always the best looking person here.
Or the most disgusting.
I mean come on, THEY always stare at me.
The patrons, the servers, the hostesses, the barmaids. Even the busgirl drops dishes when I enter.
Maybe it's my gorgeous blond hair. My svelte physique. My deep blue eyes people write poems about.
Perhaps it's the booger dangling from my nose, the toilet tissue perpetually affixed to my heel, the undone zipper at sub-waist level. Whatever the case, I LIKE this place.
Loads of entrees that come with chips, soup, tortillas, and, of course, pretty smiles from barmaids. 
There's a one-man band who shows near weekend time at 6, outdoor seating, video poker.
Yeah, baby.
I'm a simple guy so I love the bacon-wrapped shrimp, cognac chicken and carnitas.
I usually get a few salted rim Margaritas on the rocks and look at sports on one of the screens, desperate to fend off wanton stares of strangers. 
I was there today and a lady couldn't take her eyes off me.
She even started coughing uncontrollably before falling off her stool.
Come on....
If that's not fatal attraction, I don't know what is.
So come to Lindo Michoacan.
You might see me.
And you can leer, cough, fall, and enjoy fine food with booze and sports ALL AT THE SAME TIME!!!!!
Your life rocks.
