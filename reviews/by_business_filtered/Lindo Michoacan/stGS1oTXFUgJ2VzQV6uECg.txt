Come here at an odd time because it's always packed and it's hard to find a parking spot. It's a surprise to me that this place doesn't have at least 4 stars. You get a nice view of the strip and the food is fantastic. The staff don't seem frantic or annoyed even if they get so busy. They have so many loyal customers including myself. It can get pretty loud especially if there's anybody celebrating their birthday. So, if you're the grumpy kind or having a migraine headache, this is not the place for you.
