Their Chips and Beans are going to be the death of me! It's like you can't stop eating them and as soon as you are finished they bring more. It's so bad that we can't shop in the mall across the street because we know where we will end up! It doesn't hurt that the service is fantastic, the traditional Mexican menu is filled with fantastic items like the fido soup... But those chips and beans get in your head and start calling to you...
