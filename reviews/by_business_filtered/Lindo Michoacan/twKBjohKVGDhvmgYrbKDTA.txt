We used to go to Viva Michoacan and loved it and started out or evening trying to go there only to find out they were closed. So we decided to go to this one. Our last time here was ehh, but we decided to give it another chance especially because we were craving good mexican. This however was far from good mexican. My husband ordered the filet relleno and said it tasted like mayo and was disgusted by the chile relleno. I had the fajitas and they only came with two tortillas and were quite bland and over cooked and just tasted like cheap beef. At Viva these dishes were delicious but here they're far from. The ambiance was terrible as well. Viva would always have these great musicians singing and playing guitar but you could still have a conversation. This place was loud the musician was singing to a synthesizer that was terrible and so loud.  It was just painful.On top of the acoustics are so terrible in this location, even without the horrible music its still super loud. We won't be back and we're sad to lose one of our favorite mexican restaurants.
