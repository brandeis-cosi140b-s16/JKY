In the years since I wrote my first review, we've come to love Lindo Michoacan at this location. The staff is friendly and attentive, and the food never disappoints. The Mole Poblano is a family favorite, as is any of the carnitas dishes. And if you go, don't forget the table side guacamole. We try every Mexican place we come across, but we keep coming back to Lindo.
