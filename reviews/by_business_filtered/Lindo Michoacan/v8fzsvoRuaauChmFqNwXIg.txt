We have been coming here for years and had Antonio (there's two, so the tall one) as a server and he was awesome! It was a busy Friday night and my fiance is a little indecisive and Antonio was patient and answered all of her questions patiently, as though we were his only table (even though he probably was running around like crazy). I have a severe shellfish allergy and she likes to stress it to the server multiple times because another Mexican restaurant messed one once and I had to be rushed to the hospital. Antonio made it a point when he delivered the food to ensure us that he spoke with the kitchen and my food was safe. We liked him so much that when we came back a couple of weeks later we asked for Antonio. He knew who we were right away and told us before we even ordered that he made a note of my allergy and asked us if we wanted to order a shot of cazadores (like we ordered on our previous visit). Again, phenomenal service. The weekend after I proposed to my fiance our family came with us to Lindo to celebrate and we asked for Antonio. When he found out we got engaged he sent us 2 shots of cazadores and brought us a cheesecake to celebrate. He is truly a genuine individual who we now love to come see. The food is already phenomenal and now that we found Antonio we come once a week to eat and hang out with "our friend Antonio." When you come to Lindo , I suggest asking for Antonio and he will make you experience like no other...
