We went here over the weekend and I must say, they got my love again!
There was about a 10 minute wait which is not bad on a Saturday night. While waiting we ordered margaritas, muy Bueno!
Once seated we were in the front of the dining room with a great view of Las Vegas. I think LM has one of the better views of town. 
As usual I ordered the Ensalada Marinara which was spot on, ripe avocados, plenty of shrimp and pico de gallo! The rest of the group ordered fish tacos, a very large portion. A burrito and quesadilla for the girls. All very tasty and excellent service. 
If you have a craving for Mexican food with a view, this is the place.
