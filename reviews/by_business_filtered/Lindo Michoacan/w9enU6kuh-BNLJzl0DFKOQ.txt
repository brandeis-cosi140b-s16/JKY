The chips and bean dip were delicious! Almost at the very same moment we finished a basket, our waiter would pop out and give us a new one. He must have been hiding behind a planter and watching us or something. It was great, albeit a little creepy. As for the actual meal, I was so full of flour and refried beans that I only took a few bites and boxed the rest up.
