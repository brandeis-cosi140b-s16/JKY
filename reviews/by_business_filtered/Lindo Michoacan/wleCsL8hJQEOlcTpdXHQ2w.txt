It's our own fault for trying it but my son was in town and we had to dare each other to try the Food Network Special. It's called "Cry Today, Cry Tomorrow". It does not misrepresent the fact it is super hot, which it is but there is absolutely no flavor to the meal at all. If you're going to call attention to something, at least make an attempt at adding flavor to the heat. Tried the Chile Colorado at the Original location yesterday for lunch and again it was just bland, No flavor. I added my rice and beans to it so it had some flavor. Not impressed. There has got to be better nearby.
