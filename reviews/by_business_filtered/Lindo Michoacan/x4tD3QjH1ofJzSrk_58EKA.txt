We decided to go there yesterday after reading all the reviews and since we have never been there. We went there at 6 pm and were told that we would have a 15-20 min wait. We were OK with it. So we waited and waited. Our party had to wait for 35-40 min before we got our table. It was really frustating. After getting our table, our experience with the food was not any better. It took us around 45 min to get our food from the time we ordered and we just nibbled on the chips and salsa. No one came to ask if we needed more salsa or bean dip (our bean dip was empty). The chips were not freshly fried (not warm). Anyway, the food was just OK. I would not pay the price to go and eat there again. The food was just OK. The rice and beans tasted like out of a can. The only good thing about this place is the view of the strip. 
Really wanted to like it, came home very disappointed.
