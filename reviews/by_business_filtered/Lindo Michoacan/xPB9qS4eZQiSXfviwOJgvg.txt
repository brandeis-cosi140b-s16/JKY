I've eaten here many times while visiting Las Vegas . Unfortunately , today was very disappointing. My carne asada tacos were so bland and the rice and beans so ordinary that I could'nt believe it. My wife's  vegetable fajitas were greasy and unappealing. Clearly this restaurant is doing what other top rated Mexican restaurants are guilty of: get popular, raise your prices and fail at the quality of food served. What a shame. Also, the organic margarita priced at $13 was ridiculous. Sorry guys, I'm done with you. Good tacos, cold beer and no inflated pretenses will get my endorsement. By the way, service was poor. The server barely spoke to us and never came back during the meal.
