My husband and I love Mexican Food and saw this restaurant had good reviews so thought we'd try it while staying in Las Vegas.  It was a little drive for us but worth it...the food was great as was the service...we've been back twice!  We also love their restaurant on Desert In in Las Vegas....will definitely recommend to our friends when they visit Las Vegas!
