I had heard from a few people that the food at Lindo had "gone down hill" for a while. I had some relatives in town who love the place so we went last night. It was a great experience! Luckily we made reservations as it was packed full at 5:30. We were given a prime table on the windows behind the bar with that incredible view of the valley and strip below. Our server Martin provided outstanding service to us even though every table was full. 

Of course we started with margaritas and their fantastic guacamole which is made table side. 3 people ordered the Camarones abuelito timo which are large shrimp with cheese and peppers, wrapped in bacon and then fried. Hard to go wrong with that! They were great. Others had fajitas, enchiladas and the pescado Vallarta which is fish cooked in olive oil, wine, peppers, garlic and onions. She said it was "fabulous". Of course we ended with flan and fried ice cream. 

I took some pictures but by then the Patron margaritas had kicked in and they didn't come out to well :)  It may not be the most authentic mexican food in town, but I think Lindo does a great job and with a perfect location up on Horizon Ridge. If you haven't been in a while, give them another try.
