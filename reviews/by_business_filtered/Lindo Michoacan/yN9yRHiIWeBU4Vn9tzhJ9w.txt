Horrible!  Had a chimichanga.  The outer layer should be fried-NOT!  It was if the food was frozen then warmed in the oven.  No seasoning in the chicken itself, plain on top! No lettuce, or tomato, salsa, or options for salsa,  The chicken was dry & bland.  Then they give you a small scoop of rice (about 5 tbsp) clumped (did I mention no seasoning) We actually had to put salt on our food!  and the beans are powdered!  We didn't see one bean. The Chips & Salsa = well the chips were good but the salsa=Gross! Nothing is homemade, the food is frozen then warmed.  The only item homemade is the table-side guacamole.  And the service, the waiters acted is if we're bothering them lol...Utterly disappointing and seriously overpriced for the quality of food and service you receive.  When I first came to LV I was taken to the original LM on Eastern and loved it!  But now that they have added locations, this place has gone seriously down hill!  What happened??? Service=horrible, Food=disgusting, Price=The price didn't match the quality.  Will never return!!!!
