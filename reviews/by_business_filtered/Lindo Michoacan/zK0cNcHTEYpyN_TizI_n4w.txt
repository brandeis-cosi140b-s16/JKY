My mom and I love their fried whole mojarra with salad and beans.  We order it everytime we come here.  My dad loves their beef fajita and other beef dishes.  He said the beef are flavorful and very tender.  My husband always order their enchiladas and tacos.  He said they were very tasty. Service is excellent.  My parents live in Las Vegas and they come here once a week.  The hostess and servers know them already.  My dad tells me they have really great margaritas (cadillac I think).  I have to take his word for it as I do not drink but since he is very picky with his margarita, i'm sure it's excellent.
