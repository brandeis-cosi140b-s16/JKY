I'm not knowledgeable at all about Mexican food. Growing up in Hawaii, I think I could count with one hand the number of Mexican restaurant we had on O'ahu. I definitely have to broaden my experience in what delicious authentic Mexican dishes are supposed to taste like. However, it didn't stop me from enjoying my lunch here.

The staff was very friendly and patient. I asked our bartender what chicken dish she'd recommend for me. She named a few and I ordered the Trece (Pollo al Mojo de Ajo) and my boyfriend ordered Veintidos (Tacos de Camaron). Their lunch specials are definitely a good deal, ranging from $8.50 to $11.50, including a beverage, refill, rice beans, and tortillas. Our chips, salsa, and bean dip arrived immediately, and now I can see why people loved the salsa. I loved their flour tortillas, too.

We're wanting to come back for Cinco de Mayo, but wondering if we can brave the crowd, I'm sure it'll be packed. I almost forgot to say what an amazing view the restaurant had! 

I'd definitely come back for their food and service, it was great. Next time, I'll order dessert...fried ice cream....yum.
