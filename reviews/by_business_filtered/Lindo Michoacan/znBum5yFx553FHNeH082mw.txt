Excellent mexican food. I go for the tacos, soup and Ronaritas. I always order the lengua tacos, it comes with three tacos, beans and rice. They bring out chips with salsa and beans which is delicious. Its pretty quiet and the staff provides excellent service. Sometimes they can be a little much because everyone will ask you if you need anything every time they pass. It can be a little annoying but at least you aren't neglected the whole meal. Haven't tried the bar area but its worth checking out if you want a good mexican restaurant that's authentic.
