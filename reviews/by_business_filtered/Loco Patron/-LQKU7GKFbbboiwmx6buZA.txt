I decided to give this place another shot.  This time around I was sober, and thus have actual memories.

After grabbing a drink my friend and I decided to head out to the patio.  A group of 3 guys graciously let us share their table since the place was packed.  A short period later one of the guys pours his drink into the candle holder and storms off.  I made a comment about it being his time of the month and I'm not so sure they appreciated it because they all left.  Although, the most sober of the bunch seemed embarrassed.  Whatever, free table, woohoo!

Next table starts having a beer fight.  I'm not kidding.  

I then started feeling really old.

And overdressed.

An employee comes by to clean up the empty bottles from my table and notices the candle holder full of liquid.  I told him about the guy with PMDD.  He made a little joke about the the guy being upset over my rejection of him.  

Final analysis- Patron has some cool employees and some not so cool customers.
