Nothing too crazy here from what I see.  I gather it can however, get a tad bit wild during the weekends and especially around ASU.  

Overall, food was okay at best.  The salsa that came with the chips had too much lime.  Tasted like lime juice and the chips were store bought.  

I ordered the crunchy fish tacos.  Crunchy indeed it was, but again what's up with the lime.  I added a little bit on my tacos and again it was too much.  The guacamole sauce atop wasn't bad, but my tacos were overly seasoned already.  The crunchiness was there along with the cabbage mellowing it out; that was a nice welcome.  The rice and beans were out of a can as expected.  In the end, probably come for drinks but that's about it. - Enjoy!
