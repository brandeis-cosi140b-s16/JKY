Second time coming here ,the first was not very good but this time it was great service and food was fresh and on time 
Even thou was a game day the kitchen was fast
We ordered 3 burritos and a chicen quesadilla and had good flavors the burritos had warm and not toasted tortillas the ground beef wasjuicy and not over spicy rice and bean were well temperature cook without a sagui flavores or hard shells taste 
The service was fast and practical 
We got chip and salsa right away also fresh and warm chips,then got our waters and iced teas very fast remember its over 105 Temperature out there,Jaqueline was our server very knowledgeable. And didn't even write the order down and we got our food fast without mistakes.
I'm very happy with the service and definely I will be back andso my friends will too.
