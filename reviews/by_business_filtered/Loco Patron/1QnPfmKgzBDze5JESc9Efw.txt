I never thought I would find myself saying this, but I'm a fan of Loco Patron.  For some reason, and not to discredit Fred M., every time I've stopped by this place has been jammed.  It's especially great during spring training, as everyone's looking for an ice cold margarita to cool down after paying $8 for beers at the Giants stadium.

Service is usually pretty quick, even when the bar is packed.  That can be really tough to do and so few bars do it well.  The only downside is having a tough time finding a place to sit.  In fact, I'm not sure that I've ever even taken a seat in this bar.  My 'glass is half full' side tells me that at least you get to work the legs out a bit.

I've never eaten here so I can't comment on the food.  I often forget that people are even there to eat until I'm stumbling past their tables on the way to another bar.  Maybe some day I'll relax and grab a bite here to comment on that aspect.
