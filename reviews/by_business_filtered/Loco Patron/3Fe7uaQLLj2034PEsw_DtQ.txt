I am not from Arizona, but was in town for an event and stumbled upon this place while exploring. We wandered in because it looked busy and everyone seemed to be having a good time. 

It has an indoor and outdoor area as most restaurant/bars do here. You can sit at the bar, or they have booths and tables both inside and out. Most people seem just to stand around though

Not a bad crowd but seemed a little on the older side, but maybe it was just that particular day we went.

Decent priced drinks and food. We tried a few items (tacos, fries, onion rings) and they were alright. Typical bar food, nothing really to write home about.

Id stop back in here next time I visit Scottsdale.
