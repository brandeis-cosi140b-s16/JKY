Loco Patron is a great Mexican Cantina that is reasonable priced in Scottsdale, good food, good drinks, nice patio setting. We normally come here for lunch and BTW lunch specials Mon.-Fri. Only $9, a steal in Scottsdale. 

Service during lunch has always been good. Food and drinks has always been really good. We've never had a bad meal, the ground Smothered Burrito platter, Carne Asada platter, Crunchy Fish and Mahi Mahi taco, Loco Taco salad, Classic Taco salad, Enchiladas, and Tortilla soup are all excellent!

Fun Place just to kick back!
