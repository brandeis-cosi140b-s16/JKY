I'm a big fan of Loco Patron Tempe, and been visiting this location twice a week or more for over a year. It helps that I work upstairs in the building :). The food is always excellent, the server staff is exceptional espicially Alicia and McChrista, the atmosphere is always inviting.  The new menu (adopted from the Scottsdale location) is good, the new street tacos are excellent but I miss my Monday lunch special (3 enchiladas). Change is inevitable, so I adjust my priorities and move forward. This review covers the past when I should have posted glowing reviews many times, espicially during the FIFA World Cup. I highly recommend this location to many of my friends and co-workers with much enthusiasm.  They are not perfect, hence 4 stars, during busy times the server and kitchen staff can create longer wait times as they race to satisfy everyone's needs. May I suggest a cool iced tea or adult beverage of your choice and RELAX while you wait. The food will be well worth it once it arrives! Thanks for listening.    

A long time loyal fan
