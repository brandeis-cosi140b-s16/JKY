We walked in to grab some drinks and seated ourselves on the patio. After 25 minutes and never having anyone come and get our order, we re-seated ourselves inside. Still no one approached us. (There was no hostess so you were expected to seat yourself. Finally we moved to the bar and after some effort got the bartender to come over. We ordered several rounds of beers and margaritas and nothing was said to us other than a few grunts. We finally found a taco form and ordered a few.  We gave the form to the bartender and he took it (again without responding to us). The tacos were good but the service was horrendous. Won't go back as there are many places to spend your money that actually want your business. It was pretty empty on a beautiful Saturday afternoon. perhaps the bad service is a factor.
