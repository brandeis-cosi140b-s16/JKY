Still staying at a solid four stars after another meal last night. On Wednesday it is Happy Hour all day which was a nice surprise. Most tacos are 3 bucks, even the famous crispy ones. My choices were a soft ground beef and a crispy beef taco. The crispy is the highlight with a slice of fresh avocado on top and lots of flavor inside from two sauces. The bartender was on fire also with very strong margarita's for $5 each and all appetizers were on discount as well. The triple threat with a slightly spicy pineapple salsa and queso and chunky guac was well worth the 6 bucks. It was pretty empty, but the food is solid, plenty of TV's and stiff drinks make this place part of the Mexican rotation.
