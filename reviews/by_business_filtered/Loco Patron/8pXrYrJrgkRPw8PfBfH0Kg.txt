Shrimp grilled tacos were awesome! And the skinny margaritas with wild berry was yummy.  I would have given it 5 stars but our waitress was pretty much useless. How do you come to a table, after being waved down, and not ask everyone if they need another drink. Specially when the glass is empty. Then we had to stop her again before she took off because two others needed a drink. Then she brings the drink back, sets it at the edge of the table and doesn't even take the empty. Had to ask for more chips, than our check, didn't see if it was separate checks even tho the second half of our party came later. We pretty much stumped her with "put 50 on the blue card and the rest on the other". Maybe she should go home, since we seemed to be bothering her.
