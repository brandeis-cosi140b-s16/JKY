Loco Patron has long been a fixture on Scottsdale Road in Old Town Scottsdale, but I've always gone there more for the margaritas and barcrawler atmosphere than for the food. I haven't had any food at the Scottsdale location in several years, but I was highly impressed with the amazing happy hour offerings I sampled from the new Tempe location, which opened this past December on Mill Avenue right by the light rail.

Their happy hour runs from 3-7 p.m. daily and features a ton of hearty food options for very little moolah. On my recent visit there, my boyfriend and I shared tostadas ($5) and tacos ($3), which were basically the same thing, save for different cheeses -- go for the tacos with a corn tortilla and cojita cheese instead of their shredded mix, and you should be good.

We also got a cheese crisp, a steal at only $2! The food was all great and a really phenomenal value for the portion you got, too.

Plus, you get free chips and salsa with any meal, so we were definitely feeling full without spending a ton.

Besides the great food offerings, happy hour drinks are worth the visit, too, with $3 beers, wine and wells and jumbo beers starting at only $4.25. The Mill Avenue location also features a cool patio overlooking the busy street, and there's a huge bar and tons of televisions broadcasting sports throughout the venue. The service was fast and friendly, and it's nice that it's conveniently located to the light rail in case you have too many margaritas.
