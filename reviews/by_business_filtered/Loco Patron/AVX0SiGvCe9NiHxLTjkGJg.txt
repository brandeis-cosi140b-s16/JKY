Swung by here for drinks after work with friends.  We were amazed at how many people were here on a Tuesday night.  The place was busy.  The music is loud, which is perfect for the atmosphere and vibe here.

Since we already had dinner, we were only here for cold Beer.  I had a Dos XX Lager and the rest of the group had Heineken.

Service here was so/so.  Our server started out well by getting us our drinks right away, but she wasn't too attentive as the night went on....we had to flag her down whenever we needed a refill.

Although we weren't eating, we received complimentary Chips & Salsa....they were average.  The Salsa is very mild, no kick to it at all...what I like to call, Tomato Sauce Salsa.

I'll have to come back and try the food.
