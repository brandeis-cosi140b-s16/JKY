I love the tacos here. Taco Tuesday is awesome and I love to go here but there is always lack luster customer service. Tonight was especially awful. The bartenders were all on their phone and I found out that the bartender (Joe) had named our tab, which he should have had split; children. 

What was turning into a weekly trip for tacos is now the last time I'll ever set foot in a loco patron and I'll advise my friends to go elsewhere.

As far as the neglect from the people working there, it's guaranteed to happen.
