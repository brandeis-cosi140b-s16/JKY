My husband, my brother in-law and I walked into this bar at the end of the World Cup game today at 5pm on the dot. Outside the bar there was a sign that read "$1 American beers 3pm-6pm" the sign clearly EXPLICITLY stated until 6pm. When we inquired about the beer special the gentleman in the american flag t-shirt rudely informed us that the special "was only good until the end of the game and the game is over. The sign was only there to attract customers for the game and we are no longer offering the special." 

Needless to say this business certainly lost a new group of customers. When you advertise something you should honor it. I work in customer service and I would never treat anyone this way. There were many other possible outcomes for this situation that would've provided us a positive experience. We made our way next door to Cold Beers and Burgers and happily gave them our business. 

I would encourage whomever owns or manages this business to correct their signage before wrongly "correcting" their customers. We definitely will not be returning to this bar. Not only was there false advertising but the person behind the bar was also incredibly unfriendly.
