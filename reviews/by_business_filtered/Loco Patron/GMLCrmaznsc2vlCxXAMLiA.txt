Most of the reviews for this place seem to be short and sweet, and I can definitely see why. When I lived in Scottsdale I would occasionally stop here when gallivanting through Old Town for a drink or two. Nothing is really memorable about the place. It's a cheesy, Baja-style bar. I've never had the food, so I can't comment on it, but the margaritas are okay. I don't think the drink prices are exuberant or anything, there fine. When I was in town for a recent visit I used this place as a bridge between other bars, pretty much like I used to do. It's not a bad place to stop at for a drink or two when your out with friends, but not the place you'll want to hang out at all night. It's okay.
