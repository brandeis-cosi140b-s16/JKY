After an impromptu happy hour organized by none other than Georgie S I feel I need to write a review. There were fellow Yelpers and non-Yelpers alike. Everyone had a grand time. How can you not when there are $1/$2 tacos, $4 nachos, and $2 Dos Lager on draft?! 

I had the Mahi Mahi tacos on corn tortillas, which were $2. Plus 6ish Dos Equis. All for $35 including tip. Not too bad I thought. Our server was a little on the slow side, but we were having a good time and didn't mind too much. I tried the nachos and they were decent and for $4 nicely sized. We were sitting on the patio on a great early evening/night. Normally Tuesday nights are reserved for hockey, but being in between seasons a little HH was just what the doctor ordered. This night turned into an adventure with a drunken trip to the Grapevine. Solid!
