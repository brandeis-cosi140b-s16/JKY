Yes, this place gets packed as a bar in the evening hours, but peel away all that, and you have a decent Mexican restaurant.  I have had the burritos, enchiladas, and tostadas.  All good.  The guac there is especially good and pair great with a Mexican beer, but then again, what doesn't go well with a Mexican beer.  I will be back.
