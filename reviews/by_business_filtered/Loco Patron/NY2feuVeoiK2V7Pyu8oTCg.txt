I love the loco patron in Scottsdale.  We were at the one in Tempe and I got a drink but they didn't ask my wife what she wanted.  Then when she did finally ask she was done flirting with some guy, she acted pissed that my wife wanted a frozen drink.   When we went to leave she gave us a bill for $42 for two drinks.  When we said something about it we got  bitched  for complaining about the bill.  So much for the customer is always right.  Some people have know idea how a business makes money.  We was very embarrassed the couple next to us said they would pay our bill!  That was not the issue at all!!
