I'm surprised by all the negative reviews of Loco. I think it's a great spot to hangout that's slightly less low key than the rest of the Old Town bar scene. I frequented this place with both girl, guy friends and my boyfriend and never did anyone complain. Convenient location that's close to all that old town has to offer.  Crowd ranges from ASU kids to older folks but is often a nice mix. My only complaint would be that on Thursday or Friday nights there is sometimes a wait for a drink if you don't sit at the bar. Killer margaritas and a really nice patio to hang out on a warm night. I try to go back whenever I'm back on my old stomping grounds in AZ.
