Every time I have been here, the staff has been extremely rude. Granted, I am  a decade past 21 and this spot may be a bit young for my tastes.  Not a big fan of plastic and got a happy hour margarita with and the "plastic" glass was chipped and scratched all to hell. I asked for a new one since I cringed everytime I tried to get a bit of salt.  The Bartender was obviously irritated and replied.."It's plastic!"  then grabbed a new glass sans salt and poured it in.  NICE!
