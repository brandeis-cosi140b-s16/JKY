The wait staff is the best. I go during lunch all the time. Usually the old town scottsdale bars have terrible service . Not here. The tacos are some of the best I have had in Arizona. I hate queso but love the what they offer here. Bartender that is the waiter at lunch remembers me and my order. He always makes great recommendations to anyone I bring here, 5 stars all day long.
