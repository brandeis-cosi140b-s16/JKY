New Location! 

This place is close to work so me and the co-workers stopped in.  

Good:  Location and staff looked really busy/hard working....decently cheap drinks and food.  

Bad:  They were out of about 25% of the menu/unprepared and the food just wasn't that good.  I feel sorry for people that come to AZ and have "Mexican Food" at places like this.  Even the rice and beans (simple things) are just mediocre and have no character.  

I'm getting the vibe this is definitely more of a "drink" spot than a "food" spot.  After a few drinks...maybe everything will taste better!  
This place needs a little time to get its act together. I'm hopeful.
