Not too impressed. Our server was kind of ignoring us while she paid attention to bigger tables. One server just took my brothers plate and didn't ask if he was finished. Plus, with charging $1 for each basket of chips (1st one free) you'd think it would be a bigger basket with better salsa. 
Also our server would rush by and we would have to try to waive her down to order more. Only a few times she asked if we wanted another drink or more water. 
Felt very negleted. I understand it's St paddy's day, but on that kind of a holiday, you would stress customer service and over staff
 Especially with an all day concert up the road.
