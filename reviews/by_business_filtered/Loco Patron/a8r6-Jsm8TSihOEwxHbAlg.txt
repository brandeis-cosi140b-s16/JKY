Add this spot to your list of places to consume multiple cold ones. Other than that, this spot is only just OK. Loco Patron is an oldie but goodie in the fact that it's been around for awhile and continues to be decent. It's straight across the board decent, which isn't necessarily bad. Do they have decent food? Yes. Do they have decent drinks? Yes. Do they have a decent crowd? On occasion. 

If you are looking for a Taco Tuesday spot, a spot to day drink and a spot to enjoy a night out with friends, this is an option to consider.
