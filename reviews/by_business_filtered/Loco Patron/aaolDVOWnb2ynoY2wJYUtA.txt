Went back with some friends (it was convenient honestly); and was really disappointed.  Innitially sat by the bar; moved within seconds cause the bartender had an attitude... Not welcoming at all. Seriously, quit your job if you can't deal with people.

Sat in a high table. Waitress had a smile, but was not attentive.  Between forgetting the waters, taking forever to come take our orders, never cared to offer more chips, making us feel rushed "WHENEVER" she was by the table; what pissed me off is just having us wait for the bill to be picked up for quite awhile as she and other staff members walked by it. Eventually someone else (not her) picked it up.... I just didn't get it. Being that it was NOT busy. If it was busy, especially being a saturday night, then okay; give you a pass & a decent tip for trying. But nobody there cared. And being my 3rd time with the lack of a caring service; it's not a "bad night" excuse. 

Oh. The food sucked too.  I thought I was the only one, but when the 3 others complained about lack of taste and the meat being hard & rubbery; I knew I wasn't being a diva!  Lol! 

And I don't know who picks the music, they might have the worse DJ on Mills.... From Ol' Dirty Bastard & Tupac to EDM; it was hard to get a rhithym going there!!!! 

DEF THE LAST TIME! :(
