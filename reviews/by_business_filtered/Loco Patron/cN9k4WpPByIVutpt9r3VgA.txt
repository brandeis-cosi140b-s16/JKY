Had the mahi mahi fish tacos and a skinny margarita. Fish tacos were standard sub-par fare for $13. The flour tortilla was old and bland. Fish and fillings tasted ok though. Margarita was an utter disaster. I don't know what it was but it tasted gross. I had to add few more limes to make it less thick and bitter, but still only ended up drinking a third of it.

It'll do if you're just looking for somewhere with outdoor seating for a bite to eat, but there are better options in the area.
