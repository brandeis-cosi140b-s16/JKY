I really only come here for Taco Tuesday. Sometimes it's just myself and my husband, other times we have as many as 15. Service is pretty decent, they are great about splitting checks. They have food runners bring out the food so it's always a food auction. But, for dollar tacos, who can complain? The salsa is on the watery side, but it definitely has good flavor and doesn't stop me from eating it. It's nice that it's complimentary as well. 

I don't get here as often anymore because we moved from old town, but we still make the drive sometimes for taco Tuesday!
