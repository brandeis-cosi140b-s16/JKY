This place was recommended by a nearby hotel employee and they did not disappoint. Great atmosphere, sports on several TVs and friendly service. I had the chicken poblano enchiladas and can't remember the last time I was so impressed by an enchilada. I normally add salsa to all of my Mexican food but the sauce that came with this dish was so good I ordered chips (free) for the salsa. This place is a must try if you're in the mood for Mexican!
