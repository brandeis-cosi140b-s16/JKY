Good things about Loco Patron: has a nice sized patio; has a chill vibe making it a good spot to have a low-key drink on a nice day. 

Bad things about Loco Patron: THE SERVICE. There is a certain nepotism that occurs at Loco whenever you go. If you know someone there, you can get good service. If you don't, you will wait a long time to get acknowledged at the bar or at a table. Also, their employees drink there on their time off, and they always get served before the other customers. I've actually seen an off-the-clock employee attack a customer that was leaving. The customer got kicked out while the body guards protected the employee doing the attacking. 

I can excuse a bar for having bad food (most bars do), or for have expensive drinks (it is Old Town), but I cannot excuse the blatant favoritism and poor treatment they doll out to customers. I went on a many a day to Loco, but after being treated poorly many times I will never go back. There are plenty of other spots in Old Town that will deliver similar experience, without crappy service.
