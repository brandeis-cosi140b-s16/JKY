This little hangout is right off the light rail. If it is happy hour, it is a definite place to start out your drinking adventure. The bartenders were really friendly, it was a nice casual atmosphere, and the drink were cheap yet strong. The food didn't look so appetizing so we didn't order any, which is sad, because I love to eat and drink, but overall the place was okay.
