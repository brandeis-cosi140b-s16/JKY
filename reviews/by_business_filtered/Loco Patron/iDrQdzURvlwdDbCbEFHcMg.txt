The service sucks. Waitress took over 10 minutes to come take our order. Two other servers came by, saw we were waiting n trying to order, but refused to take our order n said our server would be coming. Lame service right there . Waitress finally came , totally sour attitude. (We hadn't even complained ). She disappeared again. Had to flag her down just to get the check . On top of all that, the music was horrible. Bad rap and country n I don't even know what category music. All in all, def not coming back. On the up side, my margarita was strong so left w a buzz :)
