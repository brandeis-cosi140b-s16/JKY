So I've been wanting to try Loco Patron for quite some time since Salty Sinorita's, Los Olivos, and Frank and Lupe's absolutely stink!!! We went in and were ignored .....almost left but thought we'd get a beer at the bar and be on our way. The beer was Ice COLD!! We were spotted and helped. We got the shredded beef and shredded pork tacos, 2 soft corn and 2 crunchy. Out of this world!!! Will I be back?? You betcha, plus tell my friends and family from out of state when they come to visit.
