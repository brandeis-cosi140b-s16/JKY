By far the best bar food in Old Town! The wings are the bomb, even better than Zipps in my opinion and I LOVE Zipps wings, and the tacos are unreal. They also have a full menu and I would highly recommend the Carne Asada. It's like $15 and comes with a bunch of sides and all of the fixings in case you want to make tacos. I normally just eat it like steak with sides but I have used everything you get to make tacos and it's the bomb! 

On top of the great food the drinks are good, I mean drinks are drinks anywhere but they have good prices and they are not weak. 

The service here is what really sets it apart from the rest of the bars in Old Town. I used to visit this bar on occasion when I lived in L.A. like 6-7 years ago and they still have a ton of the same people. It's great and they are so friendly. 

If anywhere in Old Town deserves 5 stars it is Loco Patron! -AJD
