Definitely a local spot. I have friends who live nearby so we went for a quick dinner. It's a New York-themed sports bar with the focus of football teams in the following order: 1. Buffalo Bills 2. Giants 3. Jets. So know that before you go watch the game. 

It was packed when we went there on a sunday night. They have some good outdoor seating/open air seating.

I just got a beer and a quesadilla and they were both decent but nothing special.

My problem with the place was the service. It was a little too lax. We had essentially 3 waiters coming by asking us the same questions but then not getting us the food or drinks. My friend ordered a wine and got it just before we were about to leave. Not a bad spot to watch the game as grab a beer but it's not a dining destination.
