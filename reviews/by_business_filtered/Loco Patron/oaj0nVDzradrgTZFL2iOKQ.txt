I went on $1 Taco Tuesday, and my drink was only $3. I thought this was a bargain! It was not busy when I was there. I was there in the afternoon. Maybe it gets busier in the evening. I preferred to go when it was not busy so I did not have to wait long for service. I sat on the outdoor patio, so the only bad thing about the place that I experienced was a homeless pan handler approach me on the patio and approach one other couple that was eating outdoors. If I had been sitting inside, this man would not of bothered me. However, the staff at Loco Patron asked the homeless man to leave. The bartender was extremely nice and I was satisfied with how the staff handled the situation with the vagrant. But I did go back to Loco Patron 3 days later and I saw the same homeless man hanging around the patio area again.
