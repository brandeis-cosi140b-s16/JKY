Now I have written some reviews about crappy places in the past but this might be hands down the absolute worst experience I have ever had at any restaurant in my entire life. Now this is incredibly gross so if you cant handle it don't read on. I went to loco patron for lunch like a year ago maybe things have changed. I ordered nothing special from the menu, all in all I would have given it like 2 and a half/ three stars. That is until a giant fucking cockroach crawled out of my food. Needless to say I am traumatized and will not go back there. To be honest I wasn't an asshole about it to the staff in fact I didn't say anything I just got the check and got the hell out of there. Now I have had bad experiences at places before, you know the old "hair that is obviously not mine in my food" routine. You know what eventually I am hungry enough that I can forgive that one for the right circumstances, but I will never forgive loco patron for what happened to me. Well don't tell my psychiatrist that she says forgiveness is healthy or some shit like that.
