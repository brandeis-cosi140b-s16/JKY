This was my first time here... Came after it was highly recommended by a coworker. She suggested I try their specialty- the pork tacos. Well let's just say this will likely be my last time here. $12 got me two tiny, greasy, tasteless tacos. They were pretty much shredded, bland pork in a super greasy hard shell with shredded iceberg lettuce and a sprinkle of cheese. I asked for the sour cream/guac on the side, but the tacos were  missing the sauce that the menu states is included. They came with a side of cold rice and beans that were also tasteless at best. I would give 0 stars if possible, but the bartender was prompt and friendly!
