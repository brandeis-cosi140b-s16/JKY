Yes, it does get cramped but look at the size of the bar..what do you expect?  I really wanted to give 4 stars because I have had great food experiences here but I have to agree with past posts about the crowd. 

The tacos are suprisingly great and the salsa is awesome!!!  It tastes like fresh tomatoes and none of that overly onion-y and garlic flavor some salsas have.  Keep it simple!  Food comes in a timely manner.  The muscular food runner guy was quick and on top of things. We had a pretty blond server and she was really attentive even though the place was packed.

$3 domestic and mexican beer all the time is a great deal while the mixed drinks are average (little weak).  So I give this bar 3.5 stars.
