came here again last night for a company holiday party and loco is still a great bar. even the doorman was good natured, which is sometimes difficult to find in scottsdale. 

despite having a group of maybe 25, our one waitress kept our drink and food orders  in quick succession. as soon as the cocktails were done, another was nearly immediately placed in front of me. i'm a big fan of margarita's so i had a few skinny margarita's and despite not tasting the alcohol at all, i somehow ended up with a buzz...go figure.

we've never eaten here until tonight, and i was pleasantly surprised at how good the appetizers were. as said before...a great staying power bar in an area with extremely high turnaround.
