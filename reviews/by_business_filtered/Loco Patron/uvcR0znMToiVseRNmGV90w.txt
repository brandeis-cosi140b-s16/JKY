THE GOOD:

While staying at the Hilton Garden Inn, Cowboy Ciao was recommended to us. However, when we arrived we saw that the patrons were all dressed up (not very cowboy) and the prices were quite high so we decided to walk around and we found Loco Patron and decided to give it a shot.  Boy am I glad we did.  We were fortunate enough to happen upon Loco Patron on a Tuesday and as other reviewers mention, this is Taco Tuesday night. $1 beef or chicken or $2 steak or fish tacos and $2 draft Mexican beers and $3 margaritas.

We each ordered three steak tacos. The meat is great, These tacos include lettuce, pico de gallo, cheese, and a guacamole sauce that has a bit of a kick to it. I ordered mine without lettuce cause that's how I roll and the tacos were excellent. I ordered a Dos Equis and Cris ordered a frozen strawberry margarita. The beer was ice cold and delicious and the margarita was one of the best I have ever tried. It was so good I ordered a second one for us to share after I finished my beer.

Our waitress was excellent and very attentive. She took good care of us.

The atmosphere is very casual and there are a dozen Best of Phoenix awards up on the wall.

The restaurant is clean and there is a large bar area. I will definitely be back to this venue.

Dinner for two with chips and salsa and alcohol was less than $20 (on Tuesday). Outstanding.

NEEDS IMPROVEMENT:

Honestly I cannot think of anything to add to this category. It was a great dining experience.
