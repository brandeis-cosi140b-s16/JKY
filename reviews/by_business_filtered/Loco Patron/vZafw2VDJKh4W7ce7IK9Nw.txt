Very disappointed, on the bottom of the Mexican food barrel. Ordered the Nachos with chicken. Got a plate of chips with a small mount of a weird melted white cheese on one side and a scoop of sour cream on the other. Beneath this was a scoop or two of black beans (straight from a can) with a good amount of oil. Some chunks of chicken, a few peppers. Not very pretty or appetizing. Had to eat most of it with fork and could not eat the bottom 1/4 of it as it was a mess of oil, runny cheese and soggy chips. Not much love put into this dish. My son had a couple of tacos, fish and chicken and his response was ".......not good". Looks like the place does pretty well as there were a number of customers outside with us, but from the conversation it appeared that most were first timers also. As far as I am concerned, I was a first timer and a last timer. With the amount of Mexican style place in town, this is one that can be avoided, Also seemed a bit over priced, Nachos, 2 tacos and 2 margaritas came to almost $50. I know its Scottsdale but........
