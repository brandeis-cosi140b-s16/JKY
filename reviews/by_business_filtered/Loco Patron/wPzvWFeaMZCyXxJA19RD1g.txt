Accidently found this while hungry after a meeting. The tacos were awesome! Got three different kinds to compare and my wife and I agree that each were excellent! A bit busy but that's good that people were clamoring for seats. The enchilada with red sauce is pretty standard. The refried beans were tasty and the chips and salsa felt homemade. Could've used more drink but waitress was busy. Only reason for the 4 stars. I'll be back!
