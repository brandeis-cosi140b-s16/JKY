Loco Patron has the best seafood tacos in town!!  Whether you go with the grilled mahi or the grilled shrimp, you will not be disappointed!  They are cooked perfectly and then served in warm corn tortillas and dressed with shredded cabbage, cheese and yummy sauce that I can't quite pin down yet.  

They have great lunch specials, and the service is always quick.  If you like tostadas, theirs is quite unique, they top them with a creamy avocado sauce...yum!

They also make a mean Chambord Margarita, and the patio is a great place for people watching when the weather is nice.  Of all the Mexican themed bars in Old Town, Loco Patron is my first choice to grab a taco and a margarita!
