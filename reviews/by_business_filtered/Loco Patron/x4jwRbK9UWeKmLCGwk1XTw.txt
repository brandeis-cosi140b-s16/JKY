I've been to this Loco Patron a few times, but never longer than about 15 minutes. 

Why am I giving a place 4 stars that I rushed out of so quickly? 

This place is the perfect spot to grab a drink if you have to wait for the Light Rail when heading downtown. I don't live real close to a light rail stop, so when I use it, I get dropped off at the station right next to the place (like, RIGHT next to this place), and inevitably miss the train I wanted to catch and have to kill 15-20 minutes. That's when I stop in here and grab a marg or beer.

It's a pretty spacious bar & always looks clean. This last time I stopped in was during Happy Hour, and I honestly never realized how good a HH Loco has. I don't ever hang out on Mill, but I'll continue to stop in here for a drink when using Light rail to head downtown. Also, now that I know what they're HH is like I'll keep Loco in mind when I go out in Scottsdale (I'm assuming both locations have the same specials).
