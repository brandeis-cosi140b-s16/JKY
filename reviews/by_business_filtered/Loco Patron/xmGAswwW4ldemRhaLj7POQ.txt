So the food here is actually pretty good we had street tacos and some tostada bites. The service however is absolutely horrific. We sat down for 20 minutes before flagging down a server to ask if they were doing table service. About 5 minutes after that a server finally came to take our order, however they came without menus. We ordered drinks and they took so long that I went to the bar and ordered a drink and finished it before the drink I ordered showed up. So if you want to wait an ungodly amount of time and be frustrated with your server for some pretty good but not spectacular food then by all means go for it, but I would suggest going next door instead to cold beer and cheeseburgers.
