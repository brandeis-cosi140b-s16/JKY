Take a trip to Mexico with out even leaving the city. 

I made my first trip here today with some co-workers for lunch. Parking was tight. 
 
I walked in the door to a very colorful (literally) scene packed full of people. Upon entering I was offered a sample of ricotta cheese on a piece of tostada.  What a great way to start a visit I love samples, I love cheese, and new places.

Words can not fully describe how eclectic this place is. There are many types of foods that you will not find anywhere else.

The perimeter of the market is dotted with cafe's from a Fish one, street deserts, juices, bakery and Mexican food. 

I oped for the fish cafe, I had the fried talipa vera cruz. There was several pieces of lightly battered talipa covered in a fresh mix of olives, peppers onions and tomatoes.  It came with 5 fresh corn tortillas, rice and beans all for $5.73.  

I took the meal to the other side of the store to have it with my friend who had Mexican food. I enhanced my meal with the many items from the salsa bar, included fried peppers, and a avocado salsa. It was a great meal especially for the price. 

My friend had the barbacoa, which he also really enjoyed.

Part of the fun was the sheer exotic nature of the whole market. My co worker who is from mexico said it was just like the markers in Mexico. 

I will return again as there are many many exotic (to me) things I still wish to try and at the low prices I can afford to try them all.
