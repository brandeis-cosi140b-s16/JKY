Don't pass this place by!!!  Several selling points:

1.  It will make any day of the week a staycation!  
2.  Agua Frescas - fair warning - you will be hooked in no time!
3.  Best and cheapest lunch in town!
4.  The meat counter is the best in town - like the butcher your mom grew up going to - not "supermarket-ish" at all
5.  THE FISH MARKET - OMG!  if you have ever lived near a coast with fresh fish markets - you will be as close as you can get to that in the DESERT!  Not to mention the Ceviche assortment ready to be packaged up and taken home - or eaten right there!
6.  Fruits and Vegetables - great prices

I normally wouldn't recommend going grocery shopping while hungry - but at this place it is a must!  Try everything - and take more home!
