this place was amazing! i was in AZ visiting some family who just moved to tempe and i was searching on yelp for some good mexican food. pro's ranch market sounded like a good choice since we could eat and shop there.

wow! it was just what i was looking for! i had three tacos - one fish and two carnitas along with a spicy bowl of seafood stew and a coke for just $8. and it was killer! we also bought all the fixin's to create our own carnitas for the following night and the total grocery bill was less than $20. 

here are just a few of the deals - limes for 99 cents/lb.; avocados 2 for $1; fresh made tortillas that were still warm upon purchase - $1.99 for 50! 

the sights and smells were incredible. later we learned that there are several locations in and around phoenix and my cousin vowed it would be his new grocery store of choice. 

do yourself a favor and visit this place!!
