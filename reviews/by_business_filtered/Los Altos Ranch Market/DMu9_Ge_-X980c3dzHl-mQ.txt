I have been going to this ranch market for at least eight years. Here is my review.
The foods are not the same as they used to be. We bought some tortillas and they usually last about a week, but they started growing mold about three days after.. never used to be this way. 
The service we had was terrible when we went for breakfast one morning. The guy at the counter was not very professional and made this face when we asked for eggs, it was like he only wanted us to buy something already made.  When we used to go before they were always more than willing to cook us whatever we needed. On my way back to my table, an employee even walked right into me with no apology!  It used to be so different here.
