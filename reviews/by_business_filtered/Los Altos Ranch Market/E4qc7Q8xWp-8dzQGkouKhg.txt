Just had the best fresh pressed juice ever for $6 for a huge drink. A great variety of fresh fruits and vegetables squeezed as I watched. Pineapples, beats, apples, cactus, orange.  Delicious.  This drink would've been $12 at a juice shop. 

I stumbled into the shop for some guacamole.  Got some great fresh shrimp ceviche.  What an incredible find!
