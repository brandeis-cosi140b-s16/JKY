This place is always crowded, noisy and kind of overwhelming.  But it is sooo worth it just to come in for one of their delicious agua frescas.  They have a stand near the produce section where they will ladle you a huge cup of iced fruit juice.  My favorites are the cantaloupe and the watermelon, but they're all good, the perfect thing to take the edge off a hot Phoenix day.
