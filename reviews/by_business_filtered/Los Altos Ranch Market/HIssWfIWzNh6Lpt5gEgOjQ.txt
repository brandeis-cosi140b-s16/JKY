For this pinche Gringo, this place rocks. 
It's a very festive place to both shop and dine. Their food offerings through their "Cafe" or whatever they call it is endless. 
It's a great spot to grab a cheap lunch. They are usually busy, so allow yourself 10-15 minutes between ordering and actually eating. 
Their Agua Frescos are delicious. I recommend the Melon. It's sweetened Cantaloupe puree, served on ice. There are little melon chunkies, small enough to slurp through a straw. 
Of all the food I've had there, it was good. Carnitas, carne asada gorditas, etc. 
So if you want to immerse yourself in good food and some lively people take a drive down to Ranch Market....
