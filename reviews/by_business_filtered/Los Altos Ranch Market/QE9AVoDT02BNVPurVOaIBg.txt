Gotta once a week for lunch.  Chile rellenos and tamales are to die for.  Throw some of those freshly made warm tortillas and I'm in Mexican food heaven. 

Bakery is excellent.  Still trying all the different treats. Half I don't know what they are but they are good.  

The staff is super nice and helpful. Always clean.  Kind of has the feeling of being at a bazaar.  Love it!!!   Glad it's on my way home from work.
