I love this place!    The meat is always fresh and affordable.  The fish too.  The veggies often fresher and more affordable than at other grocery stores in the area.

This is the only place I buy my corn chips or tortillas.  This is also where I enjoy coming to get a quick Mexican food fix.  Just last night I picked up a whole chicken prepared Asado (think grilled/brick chicken) for $5 which included fresh corn tortillas and a generous portion of their Salsa Molcajete (my favorite here).   Now I can get a roasted chicken here too, and while priced equally to Costco or Safeway...neither give you the tortillas and salsa that make it a meal.

Other times I have picked up some ceviche at the fish counter, and for the price/lb they include avocado, tostadas and  extra limes. Again a full meal.  They will also fillet or fry up any whole fresh fish right there for you. 

You can't forget your fresh pasteries, baked goods and cakes.  Or maybe just some Ice Cream or a large agua fresca in one of at least 6 flavors. Of course now that the fall is here they also serve up Mexican Hot Chocolate and Chompurado....

If you are in for a cultural experience stop in here.  Don't worry most people speak both English and Spanish.  I prefer to practice my Spanish when I stop in.
