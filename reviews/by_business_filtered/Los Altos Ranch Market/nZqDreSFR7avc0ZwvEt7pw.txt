The Ranch Market isn't necessarily Food City; grocery prices aren't rock-bottom. But why go to the Ranch Market to get Kraft macaroni and cheese? Seek out the products that are made here. They're cheaper and better!

They make their own tortillas here, which are inexpensive and fresh. You can literally watch them be made, packaged up, and placed on the shelf. The salsas that are made here are also delicious and taste homemade. The food in the restaurant part of the store has been nothing short of delicious in my opinion. If you don't speak Spanish however, there may be a slight language barrier during the ordering process, especially if you have modifications or special requests. Touch-up on your numbers because your order will be called out in Spanish via loud-speaker. 

The aguas frescas taste great and are cheap. I love tamarindo and papaya. Yes, there are going to be small bits in the drink - it's made from real fruit. If you can't handle that, they do sell Capri Sun juice boxes, too. 

All in all, the "authenticity" of this place isn't what should be in question. I think it is rather authentic. It's a Latin-oriented chain supermarket run by people who know about the products that community seeks. And that's exactly what it says it is, right?

Highlight: Live music in the aisle!
