A piece of Mexico downtown Phoenix. A common visit after hiking South Mountain, specially to drink some "aguas frescas". If you can, you can even mix horchata with any other flavor!!!!!

Many mexican products!! variety of chiles and salsas. This place is better than Food City. The carnitas they have, are just excellent! try them or take them home.
