My cousin lives across the street from Los Compadres. I was starving and decided to give it a shot. I called and placed my order to go. A red chile burrito with a side of cheese and sour cream. I got there and was shocked my burrito was only $5! Usually restuarants charge an arm and a leg for side items. I asked the girl for an iced tea to go and she gave it to me for free! I thought that was really sweet of her so I gave her a nice tip. I was very pleased with my food and I would't hesitate to come back. The restaurant isn't fancy just a good solid place to get cheap tasty Mexican food.
