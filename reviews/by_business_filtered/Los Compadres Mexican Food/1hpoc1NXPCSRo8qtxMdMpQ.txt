I live pretty close to this restaurant, so part of the attraction is how close it is....but the food is really great too!!! Not only is the food really good but it is reasonably priced. There are awesome combinations, the enchilada's are great (both red and green), the green chile burrito is super yummy too. Number 9 Combinaciones is perfect, a burrito (red or green) a taco (chicken is great) and an enchilada, I get machaca beef for the burro and enchilada....mmmmmmmm!

I actually have to stop myself eating there on both my days off, so instead I just get waaaay to much one day and have leftovers the next!
