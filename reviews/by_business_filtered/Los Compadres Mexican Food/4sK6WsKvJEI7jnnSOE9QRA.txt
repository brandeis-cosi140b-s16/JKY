I have been eating here since high school, so i can safley say bout 35 years. The food is still as good as it was when 15 of us would jump into Smitty's vw van and drive down for our 30 minuet lunch break. (West high of course) It has been owned by the same family since it opened in the early 1800's!!! Yes the cheese crisp are awesome but the tacos not the shredded beef but the regular tacos are the best in town. Order a couple they are sooo good. Love you Los.
