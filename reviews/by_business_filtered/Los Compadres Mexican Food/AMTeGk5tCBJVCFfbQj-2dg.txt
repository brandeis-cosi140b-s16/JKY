I must confess I've only tried this place ONE time. I was so un-impressed I have never bothered to go back.  Someone at my table actually commented that it tasted like there were white people in the kitchen trying to make Mexican food !!  Now that is just wrong and bad manners but unfortunately it was true.  I'm not even sure I'd ever give this place a second try.  It does seem to be a popular place though as every time I pass by it is packed on the weekends.  Maybe the customers have never had REALLY good Mexican food and don't know any better ??!!??
