Yummy, inexpensive classic Mexican food. Unfortunately, they are totally unreliable and inconsistent. I have ordered the bean/rice/green chile strips burrito FIVE different times and without fail it is wrong each and every time. Did I order green chile? No! I ordered green chile strips. Did I ask for rice and not get any? Yes! Why didn't I learn my lesson after my second visit? Glutton for punishment. And I'm a mediocre cook.
