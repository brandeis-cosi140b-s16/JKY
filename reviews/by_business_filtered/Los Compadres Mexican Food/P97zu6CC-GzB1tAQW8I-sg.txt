This restaurant opened in 1958, and I can see why it's still in business 56 years later! Los Compadres (we call it 'Old Los' since there was a newer (far less superior) sit-down location that opened on 23th Avenue) has been a dinner destination for my family since I can remember. I've grown up on their chips & deliciously spicy salsa (served up in squirt bottles so you can get it in all the right places) and bean & cheese burritos. In the 20+ years I've been frequenting this restaurant, I've only ventured from my usual a few times. But, throwing in an order of their amazing cheesy and oily 'cheese crisp' on special occasions is a family favorite.

Los Compadres is affordable, laid back, and a great spot for catching up with family and friends. Since you pay upfront at the counter, customers never feel rushed to leave. There have been times where my family and I will spend hours at 'our table' - sometimes we even need to order a few more helpings of chips (50 cents per order)! They also sell their chips and salsa (in pints) to go! Since I start craving it even just a few hours after leaving with a full belly, the to go option is a great plus.

Promise me that you won't go in thinking you'll be treated like royalty and have the chance to dine on tablecloths with fine china. Instead, expect to order at a counter, pick your table, stand up to get your food, and spend the rest of the time squirting salsa onto your delicious meal and catching up with loved ones without having to rush. 

Enjoy!! I'm already planning on stopping by for my favorite Mexican food when I'm back in town for Thanksgiving!
