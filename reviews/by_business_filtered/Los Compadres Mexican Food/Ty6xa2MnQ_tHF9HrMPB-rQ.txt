If you're looking for some FAST authentic,  old-school, old-Phoenix style Mexican food in Central Phoenix, this is the place.

Walk in.  Look up at menu. Go to the counter.  Order.  They hand you a drink-- they brew their own tea, you can get a beer, soda, whatever.  Pay.  Sit.  Oh So Fast, they'll call your number and you walk up and get a cafeteria style tray with your order.

Mini bean burritos on the lunch plate- yum!  Awesome cheese crisp with guacamole!  Fast. Cheap.  Good choice!

No real ambiance, but that's OK, you're not there for the faux finished walls and water feature anyway.
