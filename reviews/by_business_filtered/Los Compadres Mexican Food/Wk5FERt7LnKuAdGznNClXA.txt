Love coming to Los. I've been coming here forever. I love when I bring a new friend and they always are skeptical about eating there (based on location and how nerve racking the neighborhood is). Once we are finished I know they are all converts. Los Compadres is a gem and one of the only authentic mexican restaurants in Phoenix. It's family owned and I love that. I would give an arm and a leg to keep this place open. If you haven't tried it yet get your butt in there and shame on you.
