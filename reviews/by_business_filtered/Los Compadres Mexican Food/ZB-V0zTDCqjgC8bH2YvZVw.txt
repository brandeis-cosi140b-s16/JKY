Not gonna lie--when America's Taco Shop opened right down the road, I really thought this little local take-out place would quickly go out of business. I was gladly mistaken.

No frills Mexican food. Expect your sit down meal to include plastic forks and paper plates--but if you're looking for good Mexican food at a great price...YUM! Good service too.

#11 with an  enchilada $4.65  :)
