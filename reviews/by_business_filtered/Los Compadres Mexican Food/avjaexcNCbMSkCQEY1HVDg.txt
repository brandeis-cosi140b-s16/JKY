Walking around this area with a friend and she suggested we stop here for lunch. I can see why they have been in business for so long. Food was excellent. Interior is nice and cozy. I had combo a (taco, tortilla crisp, enchilada) and everything was so tasty. The guac was also super tasty. Not the best mexican food I have had in the valley, but it is up there. Will be back
