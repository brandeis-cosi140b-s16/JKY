Why 5 stars?

Freakin' awesome Mexican food, and CRAZY cheap prices!

So, I went a bit overboard (as always) in ordering.
I just wanted to try so many different thingsssss

I got:
Cheese crisp with green chile strips and guacamole
Mini green chile chimichanga
1 cheese enchilada
Side order of refried beans
Chips and salsa

All that food... .$15
And it ended up being way too much food.  WAY too much.

I loved everything...
EVERYTHING I SAY!

And that's truly a rarity.
