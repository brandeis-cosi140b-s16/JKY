If you're looking for a restaurant that has ambience, music, nice lighting and gives you a feeling of being welcomed, don't come here. The prices are not cheap enough to warrant such crappy customer service. 
And if you're looking for great quality food at affordable prices don't come here either.
The food is mediocre at best. This is a walk up to the counter and order. And when your order is ready they simply just yell "order ready" The atmosphere is reminiscent of a sad Mexican prison. In short, I would not recommend this place
