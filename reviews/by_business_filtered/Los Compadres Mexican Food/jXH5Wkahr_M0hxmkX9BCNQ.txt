This is the first day of my life
I swear I was born right in the doorway (side door not front entrance)
I went out in the rain suddenly everything changed
They're making burritos within my reach

Yours is the first face that I saw
I think I was bland before I met you
Now I don't know where I am
I don't know where I've been
But I know where I want to go (Los Compadres)

And so I thought I'd let you know
That lunch specials take a couple minutes
I especially am slow
But I realize that I need Los
And I wondered if I could come home (side door not front entrance)

Remember the time you drove all night
Just to feed me in the morning (two bean burritos with cheese)
And I thought it was strange you said everything changed
You felt as if you'd just woke up
And you said "this is the first day of my life
I'm glad I didn't die before I fed you
But now I don't care I could go anywhere with you
And I'd probably be happy"

So if you want to eat with me
With this menu there's no telling
We just have to wait and see
But I'd rather be working for a paycheck
Than waiting to win the lottery
Besides maybe this time is different
I mean I really think you like me
When my face is stuffed full with a chimi
