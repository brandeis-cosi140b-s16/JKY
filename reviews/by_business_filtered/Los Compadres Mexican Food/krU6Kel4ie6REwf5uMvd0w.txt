Los's (as our family calls it). I'm a native Phoenician and my grandparents were close friends of the V.s since this place was their home's back patio. If it feels homey, it's because it was a home, even while it was a restaurant.

I remember going there when I was little and to this day it's still the best cheese crisp in town. And they still serve the salsa in cafeteria-style squeezable ketchup bottles with the tips cut wider. The gloopy-gloop effect of the oh-so-good salsa on your cheese crisp is something a kid never forgets. My little brother and I used to compete to see who could put the most salsa on his slice of cheese crisp and then eat it. Fun.

I'm pretty picky about my Mexican food, so don't be put off when I say I like this place for the cheese crisps and that's it. If you wanted me to tell you what my favorite Mexican restaurant is, I'd have to ask you for which menu item. This place is more about the nostalgia for me than anything else. Great place to kick back and have a few cheese crisps.

LOL. I only do locally-owned businesses. If you're like-minded and are looking for an extremely casual, very cheap Mexican, but want something more established than your corner (insert-two-syllables-here)-berto's (my favorite is Fo-Fo), Los's is your best bet.

Recent edit: 5/13/2008. Last night's visit for a late cheese crisp revealed the secret. They bake-broil the tortilla in advance so it's crispy. Then pile on the cheese for your order and rebake. Fabulous.

Watch out for unbussed tables. Out of 20 tables, 10 were littered with plates from parties long gone. As I sat down, one departing diner offered me her table as she stacked her own plates on top of those at another table. Disgusting! I'm _totally_ calling Senora Lucy V.
