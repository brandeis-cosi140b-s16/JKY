I have been going to Los Compadres for most of my life and it's always been the same - OUTSTANDING. 

The restaurant is family owned, friendly, incredibly laid back., and they serve the tastiest, most authentic Mexican food north of the border.  Honestly, their beans are so DELICIOUS that I very rarely even order meat in my burritos.  On the rare occasion that I mix it up, I always go for the one and only green chile. 

If you are in the Phoenix, Scottsdale, Paradise Valley area.....RUN, don't walk, to Los Compadres.
