We love this place.  We never remember the name,  but our pet name for it is the paper plate restaurant.  LOVE this place!  Everyone we've taken here loves it and always goes back.  The food is FANTASTIC !
We heard there are sister resturants in Globe and Miami, AZ..... So off we drove!  This is a must!    My favorite is the green chili tostada.  YUM!
