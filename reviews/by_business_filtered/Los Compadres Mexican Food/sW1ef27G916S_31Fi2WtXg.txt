This is our go-to for take out mexican food.
Great prices and really good food.
I order my son the baby plate for less than $2 and he gets a heap of rice and beans and some shredded chicken.
I love the chicken taco with a ton of salsa.
Hubby is a green chili kind of guy and always gets a green chili burro.
Fresh chips are an added bonus even though you do have to pay extra for them.
The refried beans do have lard so we always order the whole beans and they are excellent.
