I LOVE this place!  Every time I visit Phoenix I eat here.  This is a no frills restaurant with authentic Mexican food.  The lunch specials are especially good because you get various items in small form so you can try a lot of different things.  I have NEVER had a bad meal here and been eating here for eight years.
