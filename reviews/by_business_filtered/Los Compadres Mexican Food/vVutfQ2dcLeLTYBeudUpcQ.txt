I have been eating here since i was shitting my diapers, that is many moons of Mexican goodness.  Los is no revelation to the cuisine of Mexico but is without a doubt solid, fresh, and tasty food. If you go for breakfast the Huevos are pretty epic, if it is lunch make sure to get the huge cheese crisp slathered with fresh guac. Everything else is completely solid but traditional for American Mexican food. They make there own fresh tortillas which are delicious.
