Good food must run in the family. A few months back we stopped here by chance and I am so glad we did.  Later, we found out that Los Compadres are cousins to my favorite mexican restaurant Casa Reynoso in Tempe. 

So many good things to eat here I just don't know where to start.
Here are some items on my favorites list:

The salsa and chips are yum-diggity. 
The mexican pizza 
Shredded beef taco 
Bean/cheese burro (with green chili strips)

Stay away from the red chile. Not that good.
