Try the bean burrito with extra butter and salsa!  THEE best in town!!  Been going here since 1974 and in 1997 moved an hour away so it became the half way meeting point for all our family.  The day I moved from my native AZ after 50 years of living in the Valley of the blazing hot sun....my oldest son showed up with a going away gift for mom....a plain brown bag of food?  My fav...a Los Compadres bean burrito w/extra butter and their fab salsa.  Now Los is a 7 hour drive from my house but you can bet we'll be there every time we visit Phx!!
