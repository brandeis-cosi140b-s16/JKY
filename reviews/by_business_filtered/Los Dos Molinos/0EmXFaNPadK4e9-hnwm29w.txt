My husband and I had been wanting to try this restaurant for a while and it did not disappoint! It was wonderful homemade New Mexican cuisine with just the right amount of heat. As long as your not afraid of spicy food everything is delicious. My husband had shredded beef and chicken tacos which were extremely flavorful and I had the Avodoba ribs which were recommended by our server, AMAZING! Our server, Jorge was one of the best servers we have had at a restaurant. He was friendly, personable, attentive and passionate about the food and drinks. We can't wait to come back!
