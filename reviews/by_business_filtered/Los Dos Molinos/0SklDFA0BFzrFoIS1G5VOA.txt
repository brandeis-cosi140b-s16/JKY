I have been eating at Los Dos for about 20 years now.  I love their combination plate with the taco and enchilada.  I also eat a lot of the green and red sauce with chips.  I do miss their weird, kind of dirt tasting, iced tea they used to serve when Morris was alive.  Also, they changed their chips recently to a less oily type - I prefer greasy, salty chips.  But, they still my number one most favorite restaurant.
