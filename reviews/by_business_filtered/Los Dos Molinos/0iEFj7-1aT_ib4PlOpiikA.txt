Some of the best New Mexican Mex you will ever find! Started by two sisters who moved to NYC and have the same restaurant there right in the city. 

It's always a toss up as to which one of the salsas (red or green) will be hottest. The adovado ribs are a must have as are some of the combination plates or enchiladas dinner. Also, the lemonade is fresh squeezed and perfectly tart! 

An old favorite of the AZ locals for many years!
