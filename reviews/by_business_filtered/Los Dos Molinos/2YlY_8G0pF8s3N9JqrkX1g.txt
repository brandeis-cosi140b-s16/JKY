Los Dos Molinos was located near my hotel, so I drove there one night without knowing much about the restaurant. I love it when you are not particularly expecting anything and the food turns out to be quite delicious. I did not think the salsas to be that hot, as some had mentioned, but I like my food quite hot. The service was friendly and efficient. Very large serving and quite reasonable for what you get and I certainly enjoyed a couple of large margaritas.
