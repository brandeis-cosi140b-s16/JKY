The best New Mexico food I've had outside the 505. The red salsa is good and spicy but the green salsa is SPICY! The carne adovada relleno and chimichange were excellent topped with their green chile sauce.

Service is a little on the slow side but also very polite. I would definitely recommend this restaurant and bar if you like spicy food!
