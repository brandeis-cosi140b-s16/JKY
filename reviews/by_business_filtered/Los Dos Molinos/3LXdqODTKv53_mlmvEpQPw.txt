We have been waiting for this all year.   We're actually able to sit on the patio enjoying a lovely Sunday brunch.  

After yesterday's storm burst from the weather cell out of the Gulf of Mexico, the temperature is absolutely gorgeous here in the valley!  This is what it is to live in Phoenix!

Spent the morning pulling weeds and transplanting mesquite trees to work up a hearty appetite for some yummy Mexican food.  Ordered my usual bean and cheese Burrito and consider doing enchilada style but meh went sans extra sauce to enjoy the amazing salsa!

I had the bean and cheese burrito Scott had the guacamole tostada and both were simply scrumptious.  Halfway through I kept telling Scott, "I'm full, I'm full." No matter how full I got, I just kept eating!

Looking for a relaxing, Sunday brunch with chips & beer?  Los Dos Molinos is the place to be!
