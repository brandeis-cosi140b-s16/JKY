Spicy is the word to describe the food. Its delicious though. Every person that works there is friendly and is willing to help you. 
If you're snobby and meaningless things like a menu are deal breakers and great food doesn't matter then go to a chain restaurant and leave room for true food lovers! I eaten there three times and plan returning several more :-P
