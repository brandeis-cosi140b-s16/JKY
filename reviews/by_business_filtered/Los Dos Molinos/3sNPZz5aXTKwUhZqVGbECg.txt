Meh. Tricolored chips? Really? Salsa? No taste except for spiciness. The $10 for the "Hand squeezed margarita" was money poorly spent for what was clearly a margarita made with a mix. The menu is sparse, with not too much of a selection and a la carte items starting at $7. The servers are clearly instructed to up sell, but we did appreciate the attention. The food came, and it was incredibly bland except for the one note punch of heat and the blanket of cheese on top. Two stars for the service, the tortilla and the portions, which are hearty. Overall, not worth the $42 for two people plus tip. Never again.
