This place is more than decent for those of us who lived in New Mexico and are looking for our food in Arizona. Even the strange architecture and decor remind me of something you might find in Albuquerque. The salsa was pretty great, but the chips seemed a bit stale and unimpressive. I'd love to see them revamp the chips to something fresh and warm to set the stage for their above average food. Service has always been ok, too. Go to Los Dos if you want pretty good food with a decent amount of spice and flavor in a unique atmosphere.
