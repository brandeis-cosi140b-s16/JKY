The fresh, warm chips and variety of salsa cannot be beaten! My favourite is the red salsa that comes with the chips. I could eat it by the spoonful, as I love spice with depth of flavor! Also the beans are some of the best I have ever had, you may see in the pictures that myself and the two I was with skipped the rice for a double helping of beans. Worth it, worth it, worth it!

Add in speed service, great drinks that come by the PITCHER (I recommend the Prickly Pear Margareta) and an atmosphere to boot and you have my version of  New Mexican Food Heaven.
