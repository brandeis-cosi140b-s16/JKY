I can't say enough about this place.  They are not your typical Mexican food place!  Their theme, "Some like it hot!" is exactly right.  If you can't handle chili heat, don't bother.  The family run off shoot of a Valley mainstay, the Chandler Blvd location offers crazy spicy Adovada ribs that are as good as they are hot.  You can also get the spicy pork in a burrito or enchiladas. Their beef tacos are over stuffed (not as spicy) and a meal unto themselves.  If you don't want the spice, try their carnitas, slow roasted pork.  Cheryl occasionally mixes up additional kinds salsas to supplement her normal spicy red or green salsas, so ask if they have anything mixed up. Their beans are flavorful and creamy.  Also, try their posole or menudo a if available.
