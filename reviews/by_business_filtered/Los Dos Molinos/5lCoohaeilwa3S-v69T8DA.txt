Was not able to eat there this time, was told a 25 minute wait time, stood at the bar for about 15 minutes, finally was able to order an overpriced margarita, that was below averge. After waiting an hour and 45 minutes, and several inquiries  about  our table,  manager told us they were cleaning off our table and we were next, manager then came and said sorry there was a problem , somebody with reservations would be seated before us. After standing for an hour and 50 minutes holding a baby, this is totally unacceptable customer service. We were lied to and given the runaround, while they seated five or six people below our name on the list.  The manager is very arrogant and has no customer service skills. We have eaten there before, food was decent but service is always lacking. We left very disappointed. We will never return to this establishment or refer anybody to this poorly run business.
