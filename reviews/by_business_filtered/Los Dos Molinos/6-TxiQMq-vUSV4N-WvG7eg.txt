Had lunch here today and LOVED LOVED LOVED it! Not sure of these negative reviews. They appear to be some haters. The vegetarian commenter guy, well come on dude. You and your boyfriend should call ahead and ask for veggie options. My daughter is veggie and I always do that. Anyhow, the chips with the 2 salsas were dynamite! Wow authentic spices and great flavor. $4 Negro Modelo cam out ice cold. I had the carnitas and they were fantastic! Huge portion too. i cook this often so I appreciated there version. My wife, who is from New Mexico and appreciates NM cuisine had the chicken chimi and said it was very good and PACKED with a ton of meat. Portions hear are huge with the meat! Yea meat! My wife ordered sopapillas with meal as all New Mexicans do and they are great. Only issue I felt the beans needed salt but they were cooked perfectly. 

Service was great. Laid back server was cool and very helpful - nice guy. The owners husband (Boyfriend?) was an exceptionally nice guy. Came to our table to explain the menu for over 5 minutes. I love when the service is menu guided to help dwell down to what you like. Thanks for that. 

We live rather far from here which stinks but will make a trip out again for that tasty food.
