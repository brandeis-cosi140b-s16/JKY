I have lived in the area way too long to not have ever been to this restaurant.  Met up with friends for Saturday dinner to rectify that.  Adovada tamales were, of course, spicy but also quite flavorful.  Some of the best chips and salsa I have ever had and I can verify that the Kick-Ass Margarita is aptly named.  Great food, great service, great experience.
