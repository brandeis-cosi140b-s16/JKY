This is my favorite mexican in town.  The food is fresh alsways good and when they tell you something will be hot and spicy believe it!  The new location is great with a  nice bar and nice rooms with tables.  The staff is friendly and know their stuff.  The recommendation I got was for a beef stacked enchilada dinner with the green chili.  It is now my favorite and I honestly think it is perhaps the best Mexican dish in town.  

The only downside is the parking lot.  I do not reallly like a parking lot that is lined with razor wire fences and hard to get in and out of - but I guess if the biggest complaint is the parking lot I can live with it.

Go, enjoy, have the enchilada and enjoy the heat!
