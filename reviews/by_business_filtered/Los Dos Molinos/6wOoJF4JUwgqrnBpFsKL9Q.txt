The food is decent but the margaritas are fresh and pack a punch.

My friend and I can put some salsa and chips down like no one's business so when we asked for another ramekin of salsa we thought our waiter was joking when he said "that'll be an additional 50 cents" (maybe it was 25 cents idk). We kinda laughed it off thinking he was pointing out how we devoured the first two ramekins.

Nope, he charged us. For Salsa!!!! Really?

I'll go back for the ritas but I'll try to control myself on the salsa.
