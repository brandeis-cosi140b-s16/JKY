Went in for lunch yesterday because I met one of the owners and his wife the other night and they told me to check it out. SO HAPPY I DID!! It was soooo good! I love Mexican food and I've never tried New Mexican food... this food is WAY better than any Mexican food I've ever had. I want to go back and try everything on the menu! There is so much flavor and spice in the food it's unbelievable. They also have a nice margarita menu!! I can't wait to go back many, many times! Everyone is very friendly!
