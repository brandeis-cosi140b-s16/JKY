Wonk - wonk - wonk...
Don't come to this restaurant if you are hungry apparently.  After waiting over an hour for food our appetizers came at the same time as MY meal.  My husbands dinner NEVER ARRIVED!!! Luckily it wasn't on the bill.  I asked for mine to be put in a to go box so we could go home and make him something.  My soup was put in a styrofoam container which meant that soup leaked out all over my car, it stunk like bad food for a few days.

If you have to go there either eat ahead of time or skip it and go to Secretos across the street.  Better drinks and service.
