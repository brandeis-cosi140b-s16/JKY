I've always enjoyed the Los Dos on Central Ave, but this location was a disappointment.  It seemed rather disorganized.  We went on an off night, so there wasn't a wait, but the service has a little off and the food seemed saltier than the Central location (which is plenty salty as it is).  Too bad, as I was really excited that these guys came into the neighborhood.  Maybe it will improve as time goes on.  I hope so.
