We saw this place on our way back from South Mountain park and decided to give it a try because it looked like it had a fun atmosphere. We came in and were seated immediately but after 10 minutes or so had not received a menu even though someone had already come by to take our drink orders. We managed to find a few menus on another table and then put in our order. The food was great. My wife normally doesn't like Pork but she ordered some anyway after the waiter recommended it and was surprised. I got the taco salad and it was one of the better ones Iv'e had. On our way out to the car we had some entertainment as a fight broke out between a couple junkies across the street and one of them chased the other down the middle of the road. So the food was great but the location of the South Phoenix one is a little scary after dark.
