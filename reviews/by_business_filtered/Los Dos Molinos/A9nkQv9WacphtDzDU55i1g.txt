My husband and sister-in-law are from New Mexico, so we wanted to try this place out. We had heard good things.

The chips were okay. Nothing fresh or extraordinary. The salsas packed a punch, as promised, and were quite fresh. The New Mexicans approved heartily.

The menu doesn't offer much in the way of healthy choices, so I went for the chicken taco salad. The item I received was quite literally that. It was a large platter with a very lonesome deep-fried shell with salad inside. It wasn't much bigger than a standard taco but cost $10. The shredded chicken on top was quite good, but I was really disappointed at the severe lack of... salad. There was very little iceberg lettuce there, and underneath that were beans that completely soaked through the bottom of the shell as well. To one side, a large tortilla chip had a scoop of sour cream and a scoop of guacamole. The guac was completely smooth and had no flavor at all. Since most of the menu boasts of a high heat level, it's like their non-hot items went to a bland extreme. I was pretty disappointed.

My husband and sister-in-law liked their enchiladas, though, and said the sauces added a lot of flavor and the meat was well done. My husband didn't like that the only side options were beans and rice. 

I would advise going elsewhere to use the bathroom, too. The ladies' room was extremely cramped. This is the first time I've had to say this in a Yelp review, but... the toilet paper was not good. 

So, the red and green sauces and the meats were well done, but we were not enthused by our experience. We wouldn't visit again.
