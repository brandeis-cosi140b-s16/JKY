Woah, I wish I had the experience that the other reviewers had. The service was the worst I've seen in years! They started out by taking my drink order, and totally ignoring my boyfriend sitting across from me. When they came back with mine, he asked for a coke to which they never delivered. We would of asked again, but they never checked up on us. They only came three times, to take our order, to give us our food and to give us our check. Plus, they forgot my boyfriend's taco and tried charging us for it! When we went up to pay, we told her about our experience and all she could say was "well, you should come back and get your taco." Um, no thanks, I think I'll stick with the Phoenix location. ;)
