My favorite place for amazing Mexican food!

I came here with a bunch of friends for the first time a while back. Never would I have expected such amazing food from this hidden treasure.

The restaurant: First of all, you wait outside in this crazy-awesome decorated patio, where the bar is opened to you and friends to have drinks while your table is being prepared. It gets pretty busy (and I can see why) so you can expect to enjoy the unique patio for a while. Which, is perfect when you're with a bunch of friends!

The bar: we had one drink: the HUGE pitcher of margaritas. It's about $25 and you get and entire pitcher of margaritas. They are probably some of the best ones I've had here in Phoenix.

The food: is truly amazing. I had the enchilada with a fried egg on top. The size was more than enough and everything about it was perfect!

The service: I really couldn't tell you how quick the service was. I was having such a great time with friends (and the margaritas) that time wasn't even on my mind. 

For a great time, awesome food and great margaritas, come here! :)
