I came to Los Dos Molinos recently as I got recommendation for "spicy" Mexican food.  People, the amount of spice level is no joke.  I felt like I was on fire when eating the salsa, and I have a pretty high tolerance for spice level.  If you check in on yelp, you get free cheese crisp, which is nice.  I think overall our food was fairly okay.  I did not eat much for that day, but my friend seemed to enjoy his pork burrito.
