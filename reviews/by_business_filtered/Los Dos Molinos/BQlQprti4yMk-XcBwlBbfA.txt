Meh!!!

I really wanted to give this place 1 star, but there was something I did like about this restaurant...... the diet coke! lol

I can get over bad service, which we did have, but the food was bleh! Way too spicy and pretty small for the price. I ordered a beef tamale and beans. The tamale was about a third of the size it should be and looked like someone had slapped it on the plate and put hot sauce on top to cover up the job. I am not a fan of whole beans, I like 'em refried. So, after burning my tongue and trying to get full off of the greasy chips I gave up. 

We actually had to go and get food somewhere else after we left. We were still hungry because most of our party of 5 did not eat the "food" we were served. I definitely will not be back. 

ps... they charge for soda and iced tea refills! I knew when I read that on the menu I was not going to be happy with this place.
