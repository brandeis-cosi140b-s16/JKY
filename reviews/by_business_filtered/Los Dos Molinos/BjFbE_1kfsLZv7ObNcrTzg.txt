Having been traveling these past 3 months straight, flying "Home" on Friday evenings have become an awesome treat! 
We head straight to Los Dos Molinos from the airport (date night ). 
Staff and service are the Best! with a smile! accommodating when running a bit late. Just call them on the phone and Takeout will be ready and waiting. 
The food is True New Mexican! Heat n Fire! The Roasted chilies are the best!! 
We enjoy Los Dos and continue to partake!
