Pretty good food.  The location is kind of scary, for a famous place.  i was a little disappointed in their lunch menu.  i am not a fan of paying $12 for a lunch plate.  i don't need 10 lbs of food at lunch time, but a nice $4-5 plate of food at lunch would be great.  I might return by myself, because the food is very spicy, and most people i hang out with don't like that.  it was even spicy for me and i don't mind that too much.
