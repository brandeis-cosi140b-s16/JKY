A close second on my list of favorite Mexican food restaurants of all time.  I had the green chili (or was it the red?) and it was spicy and filling.  My margarita was huge and no skimping on tequila occurred. 

All that food for a low price - it's no wonder this place is consistently voted one of the best in the Phoenix metro area.
