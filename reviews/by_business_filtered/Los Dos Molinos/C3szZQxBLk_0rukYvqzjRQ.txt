I've never written a review before, though I definitely read them when I'm looking at trying a new place!  However, I couldn't wait to get home tonight to write a review for Los Dos Molinos in Mesa.  I have been going to this restaurant for over 20 years, though I haven't been in a long time.  My boyfriend and I drove quite a distance to get here.  Bottom line, everything was horrible!  We ordered "kick ass" margaritas - they were fair.  For dinner, we got the adovada chimichanga with the green chili sauce and the red chili beef plate.  The chimichanga was soggy, not crispy at all, and the waiter, who was one of the family members, told us the green chili is hot.  There was NO spice to it!  And the soggy tortilla was absolutely unacceptable!  The red chili beef plate didn't scream "Where's the beef?", it screamed, "Where's the red chili sauce?!!!".  And the flour tortillas were the worst we have ever had.  They were the thickest tortilla we have ever seen, and they were so overcooked, that most of it was inedible.  They were stale, hard, and way too thick.  We were hungry, so we ate what we could.  When the family member finally came over and asked us how dinner was, and we relayed to him how awful it was...and handed him the inedible tortilla, which he made a grimace, he did absolutely nothing!  We were SO disappointed!  One of the things I was surprised about when I walked in was that at 5:30 on a Friday night, the restaurant was mostly empty.  Previously, years ago, when I had gone, you would wait for over an hour for a table, and it was worth it!  Not any more!  Don't waste your time or your money!  We will not be going back!
