I really like Los Dos Molinos - I have been going there on and off for close to 20 years!  The food is excellent Southwestern, New Mexico style cooking in a casual, traditional family-run restaurant environment.  

My only complaint is the same as one of my likes!  The food can be too hot!  There are not options to get the food a bit less hot (spicy!), so you have to be prepared for the spicy hot - but the flavor is well worth it!  I recently had the posole which was fantastic - and it is one of the few places outside of New Mexico where you can finish a meal off with Sopapillas (always a treat!).

Overall, I highly recommend Los Dos Molinos (but be prepared for even the menu items not marked as spicy to have some heat! - but great flavor!!).
