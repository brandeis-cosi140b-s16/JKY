I had heard about this place a few months back from someone who used to live in the area. She had said if you like food with heat you must come here. When we got to town we met up with a friend who lives here now. he said this was the place to eat. It is an experience. I wish I could have captured everything on video and posted it. My descriptions will not do this place justice. There is an outdoor patio area with all kinds of wall art, a fountain, 6-7 tables. We sat out there. Our server mentioned that they are known for their pork dishes, so this is what I tried. The pork was wonderful. I was very concerned about getting something too spicy, but our server just said to stay away from any thing labeled with chiles and I'd be fine. The portions were perfect. They serve margaritas by the pitcher. Los Dos is a must go if you're in Phoenix.
