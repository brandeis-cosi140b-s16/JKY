My husband and I are here most Friday nights. The food and service are amazing. We have been to a few of the other LDM and this is our favorite. Tacos are amazing, enchilada outstanding and my husband says the posole is the closest he has found to what he had growing up. I have tried most everything on the menu and haven't been disappointed yet. Ohh!!  If you are under the weather MUST HAVE green chile chicken stew.
