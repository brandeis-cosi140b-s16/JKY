Spicy. Really Spicy. If you enjoy heat, this is your place.  Went with friends that enjoy burn your face of heat. Me, not so much. I couldn't even touch my enchilada it was so flippin SPICY. Obviously I'm a total wimp and I've accepted it.  Chips were really tasty but again, I couldn't touch the salsa. Service was spectacular and food came out FAST. The guys ate my enchilada and called me a big baby and I drank margaritas, it was a win, win :) Cheers!
