I like the chili verde stew.  I have eaten here several times since the mid 90's and have tried most the items on the menu.  They make enchiladas old school style the way my grandmother made them.  The carnitas & pork plate is always good. The food is spicy so if you do not like hot spicy food beware. The wait staff is very friendly but we are a familiar face. Not the best Mexican food it is really more like New Mexican food but it is good. 
Some like it hot.
