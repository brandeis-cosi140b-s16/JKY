It's the best NEW MEXICAN food in the world at this moment in time.  I travel for work regularly to Albuquerque, Santa Fe, Taos, Pajuaque, Las Vegas NM, and all the other Meccas and I grew up in Grants.  Right now, at this location they are killing it for authentic!  It's not for everyone granted its really not for kids, families, or gringo girls and chicken tacos, it's for red chile sauceophiles and pork.  I have taken dozens of NM relatives and they agree to a person it's the best they've had in years!  I'd probably die without it.
