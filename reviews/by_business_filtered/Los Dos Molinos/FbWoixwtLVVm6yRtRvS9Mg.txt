This place won't LET me eat there.  Let me explain...
My wife and I were excited to have Los Dos in Ahwatukee since we loved the one on Central.  Food wise this place is awesome since I love my Mexican food spicy.

However, I have tried three times to eat there and I have given up.
First time was when they just opened.  I sat at the bar and nobody said a word to me for 10 minutes.  I have waited tables and all he had to do was acknowledge my presence and say he would be with me in a minute.  Nope.  He was busy taking inventory or something.  I looked around and other guests were rolling their eyes as though it wasn't just me.  Rather than deal with it, I just left.  Strike 1.
I swore I wouldn't go back, but I figured I would try again.  We went in on a weeknight and were told that there was no availability due to a private party.  Strike 2.
We tried again this past Sunday.  We find out it closes at 1 or 3 pm on Sunday.  Seriously?  Strike 3.
3 strikes you are out.  Their food has got to be great, but the management of this restaurant sucks!
