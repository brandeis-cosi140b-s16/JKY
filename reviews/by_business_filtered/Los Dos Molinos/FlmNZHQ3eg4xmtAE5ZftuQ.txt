I'm kind of a snob when it comes to Mexican food. I was raised on the homemade stuff all my life so generally I don't bother to go to a mexican restaurant. Why would I when I can get much better stuff at home?

Anyways, I was so pleased with Los Dos Molinos mexican food that it's now the place I suggest when our family is celebrating something.

Their stuff is HOT HOT HOT, but if you don't like hot you can let them know and they'll help you find something that isn't spicy. The prices are a little up there but in my opinion its worth it. I imagine that their kitchen is full of Mexican grandmothers...that's how authentic it feels. (Don't tell me otherwise because I really like this fantasy)

Their margaritas are really good too. You can tell it doesn't just come from a mix. 

and OH MY GOD THE SOPAPILLAS!!!!  

My dad works for a company that inspects the top of gas ranges and he serviced this restaurant and said that it was the cleanest restaurant kitchen he'd ever seen. (Believe me he has some horror stories)

My only problem is that it didn't feel like they had the air on at all. They have ceiling fans but come on...it's 115 outside.
