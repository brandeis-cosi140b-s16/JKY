I came here for lunch with my coworkers. Unfortunately we could not drink an margaritas because we had to go back to work, but the drink menu looked interesting. 
Overall, good food. I really enjoyed the New Mexico chili spices.  The food was spicy but not overbearing as I had been previously warned. I I ordered the adovado soft tacos.  Adovada was TASTY; tender, soft, moist, everything you want and more from meat. The rice and beans were standard.  Service was okay, nothing outstanding. I had to get up and ask the server for drink refills.
