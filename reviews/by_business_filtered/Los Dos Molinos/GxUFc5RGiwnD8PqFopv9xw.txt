This place is the shiz, and we are so happy to have one right down the street from our humble abode.

Definitely New Mexican cuisine with green and red chile on pretty much everything.  I usually opt for the green chili cheese enchiladas, which have a awesomely spicy sauce, fresh thick corn tortilla and a fried huevo as the icing on the cake...so good!  Of course comes with rice and beans and is a healthy portion for the price.

Chips and salsa are superb and we debate each visit which is spicier, the red or the green.  

I see a few bad-mediocre reviews of this place on Yelp and fools be trippin!  If you want spicy Mexican food, look no further than Los Dos Molinos, you won't be disappointed.
