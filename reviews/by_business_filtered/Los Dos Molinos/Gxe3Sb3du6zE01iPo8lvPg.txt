This place has really good food and really good service as well. They make it SPICY.

Anything on the menu with Adovada is delicious. The spice here is distinct and not the typical Mexican food spice, it is a hotter more intense flavor.  It is also nice because although the spice is there, it well compliments the food flavor. The chicken Tamales were top notch as well as the salsa. If you can handle spice you need to go here. It is great!!!!!

The place was clean and the service was good. 

They also have a very well stocked tequilla bar if you are into that.
