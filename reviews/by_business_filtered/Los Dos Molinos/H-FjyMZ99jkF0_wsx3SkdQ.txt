Not really inviting when you walk I there's a sign and the cactus caught my hand the thorn is so small I can't get it out. parking is bleh it has outside patio feel on the out side the inside looks dirty and all the Mexican tile in the floor and table looks hard to clean. The colors of a dirty rainbow exploded well I'll end there we've waited 25 minutes to give our order we had to catch some running by avoiding eye contact the food came 10 after order and its delicious had the Mexican pizza tastes like my grandma made it there pork is well flavored so I can see my self coming back they need more staff I don't under stand why they keep sitting people if there not taking there orders
