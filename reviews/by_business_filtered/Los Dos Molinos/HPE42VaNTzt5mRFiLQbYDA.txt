A TOTAL DIVE WITH AMAZING FOOD! Guy Fieri needs to go here, and I am emailing him to let him know about this place.  We went on Thursday, April 7th as it was my daughter's birthday and she chose this as her place to go for lunch. She had been here before but it was my first time. If you don't know where you are going you would pass right by this place, and from the outside it doesn't look like much. Once inside, you pick a table and a waiter/waitress will come to you. The decor is not fancy, but it is fun and festive. We were asked for our drink order, and then the chips and salsa arrived. They bring a pot of red salsa, and a pot of green salsa. AMAZING RED SALSA. Be warned the salsas are spicy. You can take a first taste,think nothing of it... .and then comes the heat. We did order 2 more pots of salsa (fyi there is a charge for extra salsa). I liked the red much more than the green. The green was good too, but the red salsa has a great flavor and heat. 
     My daughter ordered a bean chimichanga with red sauce, I ordered the chile relleno dinner and ice cold beer. Shocker I know that I didn't order a margarita. The food is very, very good. I love chile rellenos and my dinner at Los Dos didn't disappoint. My daughter's chimi plate was also very good. The flavor of the food is authentic, and so good! We ordered guacamole and it tasted like they just made it...so yummy!
     Parking can get very interesting during peak times so be aware. The service was great, and we will return here again. I can't wait to take my mom here, she will love it.
