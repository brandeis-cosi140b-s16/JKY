Cinco de Mayo - lunch on a  Monday.  Since they're closed Mondays - figured a great time to take advantage.  Well - it was good... but there are a LOT of good Mexican restaurants around here.  Nothing spectacular.  Both ordered dishes that included the Adovada ... it was hot - and I like hot.  But so much so that you really couldn't taste anything other than heat.  Oh well.  Next.
