This is American chain style Mexican. I've been ruined by legit Mexican restaurants.  The salsa's were good but so hot that you cannot keep eating them. You can have too much heat. Flautas were dry, have had better frozen from the grocery store. Carne Adovada burrito was pork and I think some seasoning. I used the red salsa in an attempt to save it. Filibertos Adovada is much better. Garlic shrimp. How can you mess it up. I'm not sure if i even tasted garlic. Shrimp is not their specialty. Red Chili burrito did have a lot of sauce, better than the Adovada but not worth the $8.50.
