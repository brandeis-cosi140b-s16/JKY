This place was voted Best Mexican food by Phoenix magazine??? THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE CARNE ASADA! What kind of Mexican restaurant is this? The service was horrible, the food spicy but mediocre and highly overpriced. I'm glad I ate there, so I know never to go back. You should try Los Picos Parrilla off of university and longmore, best Mexican restaurant in the east valley, hands down, i give them 5 stars.
