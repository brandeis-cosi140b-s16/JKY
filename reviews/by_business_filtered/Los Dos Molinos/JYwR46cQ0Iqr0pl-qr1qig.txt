I went to the one on Chandler and 40th.  The service was not good.  Our server did not explain the menu to me and it was my first time there.  I ordered the pork roast burrito, served enchilada style and I wanted rice and beans.  When my bill came I questioned it, because I was charged for two entrees.  I asked if this was right and she said yes "you ordered it this way."  Also, the whole technology is they are placing your order and billing on their tablets.  The tip was either 18, 20 or 25%, geez don't we have a right to give lower if the service was bad???  Again, she did not explain this process to someone who may not be familiar with new technology and seemed irritated when I questioned my bill.  I will go back and try something different.  I don't know if the pork was old, but it did not taste good at all!
