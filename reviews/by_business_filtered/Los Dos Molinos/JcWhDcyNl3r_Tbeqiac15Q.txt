We have a friend who said the salsa is way too hot. All I heard was "you must try Los Dos Molinos". We love spicy food and are always up to a challenge. 

It wasn't very busy when we got here so we were seated at a large booth in the middle. I started with a margarita and normally in flavored frozen margarita you often wonder if they forgot the tequila. Not here, wow it had quite the punch to it. I'm excited to find a place that can make a great margarita without skimping on the liquor. 

Yes, the salsa is hot and yes, you're going to hate it if you don't like spicy food. But, that's just the way it's gonna be. They bought two different varieties, a green and a red. I preferred the flavor of the green. 

My favorite thing to order in a Mexican restaurant are taco salads. The only thing that I found a little disappointing was they didn't have any dressing for the salad. I prefer a little Italian dressing with mine, this is the first place I've been to that didn't have any dressing options. The salad was good, but not great. 

The service was awesome. Everyone really seemed to be working as a team to pitch in and make sure we have everything we needed.
