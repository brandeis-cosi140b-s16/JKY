This place was rough. Their neon sign wasn't on tonight. We should have just assumed they were closed and moved on. The host was great. He sat us right away, and brought water and chips and salsa. We waited 15 minutes for the server to come and take our order. He didn't introduce himself or ask if we had any questions; he was very abrupt. I ordered the taco and enchilada combo, and my fianc√© ordered the carnitas plate. He said his food was average. The shredded beef taco was good. The meat had nice flavor and texture. The enchilada was awful. The red chili sauce was so spicy, and it had lots of seeds and chili skins in it. The texture and flavor were not good. We waited another 15 minutes until our server came back with the check. I wouldn't go back here.
