Ok this review has two parts the first one was the ambience and the people near me. It is definitely casual and there were a ton of locals in the place which is normally a good sign. I was dining by myself since I was travelling for work so I chose to ditch at the bar. Bad call. There were two guys also siting at the bar and before I knew it I was deep in conversation on topics that I had no despite to talk about. They kept encouraging me to choose ribs on the menu even though I said no ribs. Secondly they made fun of my margarita  choice and the guy next to me insisted that I try his margarita because he hadn't tried his yet. I said no thanks. He then suggested I use my straw. Ah still not interested. At this point the owner offered to move me but I said I was fine. 

Second portion the food. Wow I must say excellent and spicy. Even the chips and salsa gave me the head sweats. I ordered the burro and the owner suggested Christmas style which was half red and half green. Wow excellent again. The green left me wanting more water and more ice while the red did nothing to slow down the sweat firming on my forehead. Overall a great choice for food while in Phoenix. I will definitely be back and most likely will avoid the bar.
