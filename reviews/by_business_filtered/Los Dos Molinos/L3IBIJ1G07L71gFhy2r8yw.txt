They were open for Cinco de Mayo, very understaffed! Especially for Cinco! It took FOREVER TO EVEN GET WATER. Our friends had arrived 45 minutes earlier and had just gotten their margaritas. So my husband and I ordered ours, 15 minutes passed, nothing, 20, 25, 30 minutes and counting. We finally were able to flag a server down and he was like "oh your drinks should be waiting, they are probably at the bar waiting right now." We said "no thanks, can we just get the checks please?" Absolutely terrible service, but they were extremely understaffed.
