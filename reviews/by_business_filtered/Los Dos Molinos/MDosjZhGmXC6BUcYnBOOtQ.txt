First of all, it is New Mexican Cuisine, not Mexican, there is a HUGE difference.  If you are going to write a review, know what you are reviewing!  This basically means that the food is based around the Hatch chili being one of the prime ingredients.  It also means that is what you go there for.  It is hot or hotter depending on the crop.  If you order stuff that is not based on the hatch chili or the carne adovada, you are not getting it, just go eat at Taco bell and save the negative review.  Now that I have admonished the looky loos, the Carne Adovada is spectacular and there is none like it even in New Mexico.  The chilis are shipped over and they are very serious about how they prepare this dish.  I can say that I have eaten here and most of their locations for well over 20 years and have had nothing but fantastic food and VERY dangerous margaritas!  They have held this high standard consistently year after year, how many other business can say that?  Not many, if you want a cheese crisp with cheese and tortilla, they are fine, but what a waste of a trip!  If you do not like it hot, Taco Bell is a callin'!  :)
