I quite enjoyed my trip to Los Dos Molinos.  The atmosphere is pretty casual, so this isn't exactly a great spot to bring a fancy date or hold an important business meeting, but the layout, decor, and ambiance is great for a night out with friends or family.  The place isn't huge, but it's not small, and it's good for most groups.

Anyway, enough about the physical location: what really matters is food.  Los Dos Molinos makes great traditional-style Mexican food.  There's no avant garde inventiveness coming out of the kitchen or anything like that, but they have a huge menu with options for everyone, and the nice things is, if you are familiar with Mexican food, you'll feel right at home in their menu.  The ingredients are fairly high quality and fresh, and the food is executed just about perfectly.  And they make amazing salsa!

The prices aren't particularly low, but they're not bad - about average for this kind of place.  However, when you consider the mammoth size of their portions, two people could easily share a meal, or you could take some home and have two meals.  Not a bad value at all.

Overall, this is a great neighborhood Mexican joint.  They cook up hearty and delicious food that would appeal to everyone.  If you have friends or family in town from a place without a big Mexican food presence, Los Dos Molinos is a good option for showing them some of the great traditional cuisine we are so lucky to have in the Valley of the Sun.
