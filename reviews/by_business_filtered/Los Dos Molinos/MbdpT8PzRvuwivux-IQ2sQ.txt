Every time I visit Phoenix I dream about eating here!  There's no way I could possibly not eat here on a trip without regrets! 

We stopped in for a lunch before hitting another leg on our journey cross country.  We got a nice little sunny spot on the patio in January ( highly recommend visiting Phoenix in January ) .  The guy that seated us looked rather old school Arizonan, with mustache and a little Old West -- very hospitable yet fun to talk to.   I told him him I didn't want to get sunburn, and he assured me no chance on the gringo index for that today.  He was right. 

We ordered our drinks first.  Though I so wanted a Margarita or cold beer to go with the food, we could not really drink for our drive.  He suggested superior alternatives.  I had coffee in a french press that was mild enough to compliment the flavors of the hot food, not too bitter and it didn't require any sugar.  My mom had lemonade, and he added a touch of orange that was so good, I drank a good amount of it (glass was huge -- yippee more for me too!)

The food -- well I already knew how GOOD it was from my previous visit so  I was happy to share the experience with my mom.  We had the queso dip that was to die for...my mom said it was the best she ever had and she's in her late 60's.  Then we had tacos.  My mom had chicken so it was mild enough for her, while I ventured for the adovado - very hot pork melted heat yumminess !  The great effect of eating such hot food is it cools off your body temperature, so you feel like it's 10 degrees cooler.  On this day we didn't need it, but most often in Phoenix you do.

MMMmmm just thinking about that HOT yumminess makes my mouth water..

I highly recommend trying out some yummy HOTNESS anytime you're in town!

One thing to note - my first visit to Los Dos Molinos was in the late 90's when I lived here, though not at this location.  I did confirm this was a family-owned business, related to the other location.
