OKay here is my second review and of course it is of Mexican Food of course. Phoenix has so many great Mexican food Places. I love New Mexican style food and so when I was told of this place I looked on yelp and found mixed reviews. But if you like Hatch Chiles then this is the place for you. If you don't like HOTTT food then you can still eat here and get great authentic New Mexican Food but ask the server for recommendations that are not hot. The House Margaritas are very good and a necessity if you want to keep cool. You have to try it, you will love it!
