This place is worth the drive through the 'hood. 

It's Mexican food the way that your Mexican grandmother would have cooked it. Total home style....but seriously super spicy. I'm a fan of spicy foods, so I love Los Dos, but if you don't like it spicy, you'd better stick with Taco Bell or Macayo's.

Definitely 5 star food. I frickin' love this place!!!
