I've heard some people mention this place a few times and say it has great food. Being that I work a few doors down I called and placed a to go order. The man told me it would be 10 minutes. 20 minutes later I walked down and expected to grab my order and run back to work (being that I'm the only employee at the store and it needs to be closed when I'm not there). I got there and sat for over 15 minutes while a man kept running by me saying "I'll go check on your food, I'll go check on your food". The service was just lacking. 

Food tasted great but I probably won't be back.
