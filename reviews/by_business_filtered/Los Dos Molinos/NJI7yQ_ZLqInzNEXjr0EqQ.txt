"If you can't stand the heat--stay out of the kitchen"--that is their motto and they mean it. Absolutely the best New Mexican fare around. It is almost a hole in the wall,eclectic decoration and a very cheerful and friendly staff.
I generally have the Adovada or Carnitas--bring the cerveza please! Fantastic and flavorfull and plenty of heat--not for the meek.l. The wife loves an array of items but her fav's are the Burritos,Chimi's
 & Taco's--absoulutey authentic and fantastic. They serve a variety of draft and bottled beer as well as a full bar.
