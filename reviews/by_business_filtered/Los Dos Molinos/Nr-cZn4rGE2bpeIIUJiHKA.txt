Looking for some spicy, flavorful, Mexican cuisine chased with a great Margarita or an ice cold brew? Then this is the place to go. We've frequented the South Central location for years and we're so happy to have them put one in Ahwatukee. The only caveat is to be sure you are ready for some spicy food, if not, ask for one of the more mild dishes or you might be sorry. I was talking to the owner Cheryl last week and asked if she made Chicken Mole and she said yes, the best. She then offered to whip it up for us sometime but to let her know a couple of days ahead of time so she can get all the ingredients together. I let her know right then that if she could do it for next Friday I'd be there. I'm from New Mexico and have lived most of my life in AZ so I've had many opportunities to try pretty much all Mexican dishes and find that Tamales and Mole must be the most difficult because they are rarely as good as I expect. That being said, the Mole at Los Dos Molinos is either the best I've had or as good as the best and that was backed up by the others who ate it in our group. THANKS for an excellent meal and "kick ass" margaritas!
