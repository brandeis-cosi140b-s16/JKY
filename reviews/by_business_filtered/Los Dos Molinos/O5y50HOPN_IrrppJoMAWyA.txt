If customer service is important to you, then this is NOT the spot for you. Worst customer service experience from management I've seen in a long time. I was quoted a 25 min wait time and ended up waiting an hour and twenty five minutes. I asked multiple times for an update to be told that I was next over an hour span. The manager came by and let us know they were cleaning off our table. Within a couple of minutes, another employee came by to let us know they had to seat a reservation and that they put them at the table that we were about to dine. I explained to the manager that I come to their restaurant once per week and that I've been waiting over an hour when I was told originally there was a 25 min wait. He said he was sorry in the most condescending way and seemed very uninterested in my concern. I expressed my concern and that I felt as though my family and I were being looked over. The manager said if you don't like it, make a reservation next time and you won't have to wait. We immediately left this location and will choose not to revisit ever again.
