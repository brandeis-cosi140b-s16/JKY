Some of the best flavor and heat for Mexican! The service is terrific but because of the great food you should accept the fact there may be a little wait.

They have a patio while you wait for a margarita or pitcher of beer! My favorite is the chicken chimi with green chilli, its a must!

If you like spicy this is the place for you! If you don't like spicy have some chips no salsa and ice cream.
