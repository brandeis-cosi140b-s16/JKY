Before this was Los Dos Molinos it stood as Padres Mexican Cuisine owned by a father and son. I worked here for one summer so naturally when they sold Padres I returned a few months later to try out the new replacement. When I first walked in I was taken back by all the lights and carefully hung snowflakes (it was December) but it looked beautiful and set a very nice atmostphere to be in. The food was pretty good, not the most authentic mexican food I've had but there were no complaints about it. The same head bus boy from when I worked was still there giving attentive service as always! Over all still a really great place to go for dinner if youre in the area or want to try something new. I only wish that the owner would give in and start having live music every Friday night as Padres did. It makes for a nice edge and always drew tons of people in and of course was always a blast.
