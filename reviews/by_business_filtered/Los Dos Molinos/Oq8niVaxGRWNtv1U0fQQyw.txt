It was a rare cloudy day in Phoenix when I visited this place. I was hoping to try what I had been told is some of the spiciest Mexican food in town.  I went despite it being in a dangerous part of town. 

My friend and I arrived and the patio looked like a garage sale full of random colorful items cluttered about. Inside was a bit claustrophobic with low ceilings and decorations strewn about the walls.  

The tables had odd warnings about children and drink refills that did not seem fitting for a sit down restaurant. 

I ordered the Chile relleno plate.  After time our chips and salsa came. the chips were think, heavy and cold. The super hot salsa was not very spicy at all and apparently you only get one bowl as we never received any more, also quite odd for this format.  Our meals came and I was excited to try a spicy Chile however it was quite mediocre lacking much cheese filling or on top. The rice and beans were quite standard too. I would have enjoyed some salsa to put on my rice however they never bought any more.

We paid cash at the front cash register as the waiter will not handle your bill.

Overall this place seemed overpriced, low quality and a bit low brow. Go try Serrano's or Arriba for a better meal.
