Probably the BEST moistest, flavorful, awesome chicken burrito I have EVER eaten even after living in San Diego for 3 years.  I really wanted to give this place 5 stars, but there were several staff there that as far as I could tell were just there to exist, but the there were 2 male servers that were doing there best to keep everything running.  The salsa is spicy, but also very flavorful.  I will visit this place again.
