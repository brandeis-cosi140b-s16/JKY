I am a big fan of this place.  The food is excellent and the service we have experienced has been beyond friendly and first class.  I read some reviews that said the service was so so - but our food was reasonably quick, it was good and staff were wonderful with our kids!  Even gave them a cheese crisp shaped like Mickey Mouse and some balloons to take home.

This Los Dos is further away from my home than other locations, but when I am in that part of town I will be stopping in!
