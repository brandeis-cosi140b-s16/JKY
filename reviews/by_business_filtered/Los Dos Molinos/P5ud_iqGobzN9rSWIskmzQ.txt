Perhaps this was just a BAD night but I don't think so.  

When we first walked in we there was no one to greet us.  We waited, and waited, and waited and then after about 7 or 8 minutes a young man dressed in jeans (under his but with his boxer shorts showing) without smiling said "how many."  No joke!

We wanted to sit in the dining room but apparently there was some private function going on so they sat us in the bar where the lighting was brighter than the sun.  

We then (after about another 5 minutes) were greeted by male server who placed chips and salsa on the table.  And HE TOO was wearing his jean below his but with his underwear in plain sight!  I kid you not!

Overall, the service was poor at best... they were under-staffed and we had to get their attention for everything - water, more chips, more salsa, etc.

Oh, and we ordered a soup appetizer that they served at the same time with our entrees and thought nothing of it.  No apologies, no nothing... whoop, there it is!

Now the food... Wow... so salty and so bad.  I mean so bad that I can't even talk about it.  My meal, the "stacked enchiladas" was barely even edible.  I mean so salty it was almost sickening.  Honest.  Perhaps there was a fill-in chef this day because there was clearly a mistake.  And I could go on about the soup and the other meal but it really isn't worth it as it was all poor.

So very disappointed as we were told how great this place is/was.
