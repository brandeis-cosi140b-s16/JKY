Los Dos is the shiz-nittle-SNAP! Yes it is hot! DAMN HOT!!!

Folks, this is New Mexican food, not Mexican. New Mexico is home of the Hatch Chili, which they use... in everything, and not at all sparingly.

YOU WILL FEEL PAIN, especially if you get the green sauce. Deal with it.. or better yet, love it! 

This place is for seasoned, professional, iron tongued, steel stomached, sweating and sniffling half way through your meal, true spice connoisseurs.

Other than Thai restaurants that know what they are doing, and a few places with absolutely crazy suicide wings, you will not find burn like this at any other restaurant.

If you don't want spicy food go to one of the chain restaurants and get your boring Mexican food and go on with your boring life and continue writing boring reviews of flavorless places like Olive Garden or Applebees or Garcia's.

Sorry, had to get that out of my system. 

What is really fun is to bring folks or clients here from out of town the say the LOVE spicy food. "We'll see", I tell them...

They do have some less spicy alternatives, BUT...

Get the Adovada Burrito with Green Sauce and you will see God. Its a burrito I would punch my mother for. Tell your wimpy friends to get the sauce on the side, it helps control the heat.
