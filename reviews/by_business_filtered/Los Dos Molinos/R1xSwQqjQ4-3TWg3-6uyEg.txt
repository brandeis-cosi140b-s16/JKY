Do you like it HOT?  If so, this is the place for you.  If not, well, there's always Taco Hell...

It's about the food.  It's New Mexican style, it's generally spicy, and it's the best in the Phoenix metro area. There are some kinda mild items on the menu, but if you're looking for mild, stop kidding yourself, look somewhere else.  If you're looking for medium, do yourself a favor, look somewhere else.  If you are looking for the best balance of heat and flavor in the region, this is the place for you!  The salsas are great (and available for take-out).  The carne adovada (anything) is fantastic.  And the margaritas are good.

The servers are polite, and the service is good (if occasionally a bit on the slow side), but this place is not about the service-- it's about the food.

Parking can be a bit inconvenient; you may have to park in back. It's location in a little auto strip-mall is a bit odd, but this could be ideal if you also needed to have some body work done, or you wanted to buy a custom motorcycle. But it's not about the parking, or the location-- it's about the food!

So what's it gonna be?  Flavor and heat?  Or something else...
