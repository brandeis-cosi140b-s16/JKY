Walked in and the place seemed cool, super busy on a Tuesday which is indicative of good food. So service was stretched and  they knew it. ,We've all been there and it happens, especially at popular places. Margarita was nothing special, but MASSIVE. The hair in my carnitas was special haha. It happens and its not worth blasting but they could be SOOO muchbetter if they tried.
