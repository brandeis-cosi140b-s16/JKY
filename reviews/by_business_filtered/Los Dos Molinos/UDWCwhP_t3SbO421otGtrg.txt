First of all. This is not  traditional Mexican fare. It is New Mexico cuisine and makes extensive use of the famous Hatch Chile that is cultivated only in the Hatch valley of New Mexico.

With that said, this restaurant has become part of my weekly dining experience (for over 15 years now). You will never find a more flavorful or rewarding "Mexican" meal as long as you live, I've tried throughout the country.

One word of advise, once you've tried Los Dos you will never be satisfied with another "Mexican" restaurant. It has ruined an entire category of dining for me. I am so disappointed with all others that I can not enjoy them. I must return to Los Dos on a weekly basis to get my fix. There was even a period of two years in which I moved out of the Phoenix area and went to the extreme of scheduling flight layovers on my business trips destine for other parts of the country in order to dine here.

I frequent the finest restaurants in the Phoenix area and place Los Dos in the top ten of this city's best.

The wait can be extensive, especial on the weekends and the serve is often lacking to one degree or another, but it simply adds to the atmosphere and the overall experience within the walls of Tom Mix's old homestead (those of more advanced years may appreciate this knowledge).

Enjoy!

Oh Yeah! You better love it HOT!
