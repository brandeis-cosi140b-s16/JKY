We have been here several times now and it is not as hot as you may think...but, if you don't like hot food don't go even though service is good, ambiance quaint and servers are most likely family of mama Chef. 

Food is quite good. I understand meat dishes are incredible, but we stick to more vegetarian fare. The beans (yes have Manteca) are to die for and the guacamole is pretty darn tasty!  If you like spicy, drop in for a bite!
