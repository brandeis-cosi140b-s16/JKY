You better like very spicy or look somewhere else!
The best they have is their salsas and the handmade tortilla. I was disappointed with the tacos (taco bell style) but the other dishes are tasty and like any small Mexican family restaurant (nothing fancy in Mexico). 

We go once every 2 months with my bf and he loves the chile poblano. I've tried their pork dishes and yummmmy!. After living 5 years in Mexico, this taste is pretty close...still I miss real tacos ...como del taquero :(. I never try burritos in these so called "Mexican" places as this is not real Mexican food for me, so don't ask me how they taste. Their tres leches cake is just good!.

BTW the outside looks like a cheap bar...is not as nice looking as the one they have downtown PHX but inside same noisy and tasty environment.
