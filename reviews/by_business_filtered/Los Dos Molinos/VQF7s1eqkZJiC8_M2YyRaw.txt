I absolutely LOVE Los Dos...this is my new favorite mexican restaurant!  We go to the Mesa location and the service is excellent!  The posole wtih red sauce is my favorite on a Sunday morning, and my boyfried always gets the Adovada Ribs!  It is hot, flavorful and leaves you craving more each time!  Love, love, love it!
