First time here and so underwhelmed. Haven't been to the original location in years but with all the other exotic Mexican restaurants in the area I will not be back. Ordered the shrimp Veracruz (blech) watery sauce and cheese looked horrible! Not filling either. Kick ass margs taste like laundry detergent. So sorry to report this place is a total disappointment.
