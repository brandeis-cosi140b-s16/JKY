This place is OK, a little pricey for what you receive, seriously, over 2$ for a side of sour cream. Haven't been blown away by anything here, not a huge fan of their rice and beans, but their shredded beef burrito wasn't bad. I'd go here again if someone else wanted to, but otherwise it wouldn't be my first choice.
