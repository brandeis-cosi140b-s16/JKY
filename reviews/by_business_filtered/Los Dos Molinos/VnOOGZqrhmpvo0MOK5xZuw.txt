Los Dos Molinos is definitely a Chili Lovers Playground. The chips and Salsa start off your meal. The Red salsa is good and tastes rich and spicy. The Green salsa is not as spicy and my husband liked that one best. I had Red Enchiladas with eggs on top and I will definitely order that again. My husband ordered the Spicy Shrimp and the shrimp was a very large size. It was so good. The waiter treated us to Flan which is one of my husbands favorite desserts. Anyone that likes New Mexico Chile won't be disappointed with the meals. We will definitely return there on our next trip to Phoenix..
