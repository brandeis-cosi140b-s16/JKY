This place was hard to find.  I should have just kept driving but I wanted Mexican food.  Be warned their food is extremely spicy.  It will numb your lips and make you flushed.  If that is your kind of food, drop on by.

The yelp checkin is for cheesy something or other.  It is a entire pizza pie of  cheese melted on a tortilla.  I had no idea it was going to be so huge.  Save this for a group.

The place is loud and child friendly.  This means they do not ask their patrons to control their children so they are running around and generally making a nuisance of themselves. 

I spent over $20 on food and drink i didnt enjoy or even eat all of itl  It was a pity. I could have dined at a place with better ambience and food.  Glad I have good Mexican places at home.
