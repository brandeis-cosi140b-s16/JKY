Not a good place for large groups.  They gave the check to the wrong guy even though I told our server to give me the check.  Before I knew the poor guy got it he had already paid.  Horribly embarrassing for me, and it would have never happened if I had chosen a restaurant that was more skilled with large groups.

Awesome good mexican food, though.  I would recommend Los Dos for very casual meals with no more than 4 people.
