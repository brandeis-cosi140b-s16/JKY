Yummy. Great New Mexican food. Spicy just the way I like it. There are  dishes such as Garlic Shrimp that are mild, but why when you can have braised ribs with enchilada sauce with home made corn tortillas and spicy red and green sauce. Not for the faint of heart. your nose will run but the flavor is well worth the little heat you will experience. Thanks Brian for taking us here. We'll be back I hope.
