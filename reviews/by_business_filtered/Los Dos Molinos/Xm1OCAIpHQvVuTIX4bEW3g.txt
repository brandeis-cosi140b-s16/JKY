Nope. They get one star for the strawberry margarita and cheese crisp.  One more star for their green salsa... YUM.  As for the rest of our meal?  I ordered flautas and my date ordered a salad.  We love spicy food, but this is just spice with no flavor. The food was just  tasteless, lacking & underwhelming. THE SERVICE WAS ATROCIOUS.  Yes, atrocious.
