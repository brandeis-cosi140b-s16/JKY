Flying into town on business, this was my first stop before I even made it to the resort.  It came highly recommended by a local and it was delicious!  

I had the Chimichanga, Adovada, Christmas-style.  I know that probably doesn't make any sense, but if you've read my reviews and you trust my opinion, do it.  It's a chimi stuffed with the most amazing meat, topped with both their famous red and green sauces.  Hot and spicy!  Yum!  

Drinks.  Oh boy.  Big and refreshing.  I had what the referred to as a "kick ass" margarita.  My bestie had a sangria margarita and another friend had something with "dog" in the title.  It was a frozen margarita with a Corona in it.  I've been down that road before.  I decided to stick with the "kick ass" margs.  I had two...or was it three?
