Stopped here pretty late on a Thursday night. Very "busy" decorations all oevr the place, but it was pretty original and we liked it. I ordered the carnitas plate and it was VERY tender (which was good) but seemed to be lacking a little flavor (not so good). Our appetizer was good, the servers seemed very busy but they were still pleasant, so overall it was a good experience.
