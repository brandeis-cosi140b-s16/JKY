I think this place has really settled in since it opened. They have a set menu now that is smaller than the Mesa and Phoenix location, but I really have enjoyed everything I have had there.  The food is very spicy so be warned.  Even the salsa they give you is usually very very hot.   The two owners are usually working the restaurant during lunch and they have always greeted me and been very social and fun.  They seem to really like the place and want you to have a good time.  On the weekends make sure you call for reservations and you should have no problem with seating.  I took some friends there one friday night and I didn't get our servers name, but she was very entertaining and made the whole night a blast.

Things to try:
- Guacamole ( A +++)
- Chile Reno ( my favorite )
