Mmmmmm....   Roasted Pork Green Chili Burrito!  Literally as long as my forearm and totally tasty.  I hadn't been here since they moved from their downtown location, and think the new location lacks some of the funkiness that made the old location a hit.  I definitely can't complain though, because the new place is much closer to my neck of the woods.  

I can't figure out the parking though, there is not much of it, and the alley to the rear of the building is a bit narrow.  I was a little concerned about leaving my car back there even in the middle of the day.  Also, there is another lot that I saw customers parking in, but it is surrounded with barbed wire and clearly states that the parking area is owned by the car dealership not the restaurant and that violators will be towed.

Food is great though...  Just wished I was driving a rental.
