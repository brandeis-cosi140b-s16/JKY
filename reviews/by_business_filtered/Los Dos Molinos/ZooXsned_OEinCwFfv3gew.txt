I love the salsa!!!  We ventured down here a few weeks ago for dinner...unfortunately they didn't have fish tacos...but the food was fantastic! When we arrived, we looked over the decor. It was refreshing to eat in a 'free standing' location and not part of a strip mall. As we went to enter, the ladies in front of us stopped because they were doing a birthday celebration for one of the tables - if you want to embarrass the birthday person - Take them here! They do a ceremony where all the employees sing and they create a fire with sugar in a bowl. There was a wait, but it was short. I had the 'Los Dos" Flautas Dinner with one chicken and one shredded beef.  I thought the flautas were great. Dave had the Carnitas, and I did have a little taste and they were good too! I was also very pleased the service, very attentive and helpful. Why only four stars? They overcharged us for a flour tortilla, and once again I wish the rice and beans were better. 

Overall - great food with a great experience. The table next to us was eating the ribs and chili - we are definitely going back to try those!
