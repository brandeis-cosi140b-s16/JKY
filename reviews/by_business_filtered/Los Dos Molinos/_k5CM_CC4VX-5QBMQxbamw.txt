THis is my all time favorite restaurant. I used to live 10 minutes away and ate there all of the time
The food is super spicy.. spicier then I have ever had anywhere else.
Fresh and service has always been great. DEFINITELY not for people who do not like it spicy!

The blue corn open face enchiladas with the egg on top is what my dreams are made of! 
Awesome place..
