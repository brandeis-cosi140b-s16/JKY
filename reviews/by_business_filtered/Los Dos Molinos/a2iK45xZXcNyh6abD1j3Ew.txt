Yes, the salsa is hot.  So much so, that your seared taste buds might not be able to enjoy the culinary splendor that is the rest of your meal.  Great traditional New Mexican fare.  Spend your time with one of their pork dishes or rellenos. 
Great friendly service.  And they've got a great "this is what you'd get if you drove through a small town in New Mexico on a Friday night and were looking for a place to eat and mingle with the locals" kind of ambiance.
