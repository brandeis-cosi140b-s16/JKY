From the way people were talking I expected to not even be able to finish due to the spice but I found it to be perfectly hot. 

Maybe its all the years of eating spicy Thai food, or maybe its just that people in Phoenix don't eat spicy food.

Shredded beef was seasoned perfectly and the green chili was the best I've had since I lived in Colorado.

Highly recommended.
