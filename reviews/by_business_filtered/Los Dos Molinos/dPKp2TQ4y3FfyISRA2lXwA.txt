The glory that is Los Dos Molinos. If you haven't been, and you are reading this review, GO! I love this place. It was how I converted my east coast husband to the religion of Mexican food. The reviewers that claim it's too hot are clearly feeble. I love the green chili. I also love the enchiladas specifically because of the thick, delicious corn tortillas. You must get a margarita too - they are huge and full of booze (in other words, exactly as they should be).
