My first impression was good: the chips were adequate and the salsa seemed fresh.  Beyond that, the chicken taco salad was bland, the chicken burro was too salty and dry, and the chile relleno was excessively salty and cheesy.  Los Dos Molinos demonstrates that quantity is not necessarily better than quality as the saltiness of almost all the dishes overwhelmed any other flavor and the large portion sizes were futile.  The largest culprit was the beef tamale, which was so salty it was inedible.

Some redeeming factors were the service and live music.
