Los Dos is many an Arizona native's favorite Mexican food place. And it has the (well-deserved) reputation for the spiciest food around! They also have a hoppin' cantina.

There is a lot of tragedy and triumph behind the Los Dos Molinos franchise. Owners Victoria and Eddie have turned to food and work as a way through the grief of loosing two children in two separate car accidents. Today, the family business is bigger and better than ever-- with the newest location opened by a daughter in New York City!
