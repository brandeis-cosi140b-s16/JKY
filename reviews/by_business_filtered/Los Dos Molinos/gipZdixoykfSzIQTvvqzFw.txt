Unfortunately not a great place for service! We went with a group of friends and chose this place because of the Phoenix magazine review...disappointed to say the least. The food was pretty good. I had a chicken burrito and the guacamole was amazing! But the owner was extremely rude! They wouldn't seat or even take a soda order for my friends before we got there. When there was two tables open on the patio the the waiter asked us to choose one, when I sat down the "owner" walked by and asked if I would like to sit at a dirty table (well...not really) in an extremely rude demeaning tone. That was the FIRST of many unfortunate happening at this restaurant specifically with the lady owner.  Our waiter, a younger guy that said she was family was actually very nice and apologetic that she was not a happy person...obviously we could tell that by the way we were treated. Will not make the drive back...
