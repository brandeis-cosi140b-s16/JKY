I've lived all over the USA and spent 5 years overseas.   Of all those places, the one thing I missed most (more than anything else, from any place I've ever called home) was food from Los Dos Molinos.   

Quite simply, it is so good, so unique, so spicy ... once you are hooked you can't live without it.   I will literally go into withdrawal (and depression) if I don't get this food on a regular basis.  Yes, it is VERY spicy ... but with such incredible flavor.   

The best dish, in my opinion, is the Adovada casserole.   Think of a tamale lasagna with advovada pork filling.   This would be my last meal on earth if I had a choice.   The Adovada Ribs are excellent as well.

PS - You can order some of their amazing salsa for take away.   Just in case you need a stash at home like me.
