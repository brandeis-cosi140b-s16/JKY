I like Mexican food and I love spicy food, so I was told to go to Los Dos Molions; I did and was let down.

While the salsa was more spicy than most, it was not the runny nose, sweat on my forehead spice I was expecting.

I also thought the service was infrequent between visits to the table, we always seemed to be out of drinks.
