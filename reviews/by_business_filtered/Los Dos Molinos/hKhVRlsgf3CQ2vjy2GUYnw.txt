We just had dinner there tonight, man this place was a dissapointment.  I ordered a 15 dollar pork rib platter.  The tortilla it came with must have been a day old, the beans were nasty, the ribs themselves tasted like absolute garbage, like they were crockpotted all day with no seasoning at all and had more fat in them than the lady sitting next to me.  Had 3 bites and asked for a box and left.  This is not the same Los Dos Malinos that's on Central, that location rocks, the menu here is totally different and the food was gross.  $4 dollar beers, overpriced food, this place won't last long out here unless they get their stuff together quick.  I would rather have ate some rankass Fillibertos carne asada burrito than what I just had for dinner tonight, I'm starving Im going to Mcdonalds to get this taste out of my mouth.
