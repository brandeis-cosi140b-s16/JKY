This place used to be the bomb for HOT food. Our recent visit included poor service, bland salsa and really gross greasy tacos. Our table looked like had not been wiped down and our waiter didn't even acknowledge us. This was our main stay for delicious New Mexico hot chili but now it has been so gringoized (yes I know it not a real word) my 90 year old grandma could eat it. So disappointed  that they couldn't stay true to their roots. We will have to make do with trips to New Mexico for awesome chili.
