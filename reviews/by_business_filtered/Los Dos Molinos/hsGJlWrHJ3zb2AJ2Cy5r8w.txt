Loved the decor and considering this is a Phoenix staple, im sure it hasnt changed in a long time. Food was very fresh and the service was excellent.

We had Dinner with a good friend visiting from NY, he had never had real Mexican food, I had the Posole"red" it was nice and spicy.

MY friend loved the selection of Mexican beers. He said it was the best Mexican food he had ever had.

This will be my new tradition for visitiors to AZ.

Cant wait to go back when the weather is nice and sit outside!
