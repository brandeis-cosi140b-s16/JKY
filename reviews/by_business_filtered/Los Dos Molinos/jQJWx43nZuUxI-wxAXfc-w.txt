We went around 5PM on a Saturday and enjoyed everything we had. For $47 before tip, we had 2 beers, one huge margarita, the queso appetizer, 2 entrees, and an order of sopapillas with honey for dessert (a bargain!). The servers were working as a team so there was constantly someone checking up on us, they were very attentive. 

The $5 queso dip is a steal for that price (also, this was the spiciest item we had, and everything was spicy, so that says something, be warned!). 

The "medium" Kick Ass margarita was HUGE. My dining partner had the carne adovada chimichanga and I had the adovada chile relleno, both were very spicy but very delicious. The sweetness of the honey & sopapillas helped us cool our tastebuds to end our meal.

If you like spicy food and green chile, this is the place for you. If you do not like spicy food, do not go here (no one wants to hear about how it was too spicy for you if you have already been warned that they specialize in SPICY). We will be back!
