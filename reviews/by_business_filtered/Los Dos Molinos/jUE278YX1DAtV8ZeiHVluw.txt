I think that I shall ever see,
Mexican restaurant wanna-bes.
Restaurants whose salsa leaves me flat
Whose margaritas  are not all that

Whose chimichangas are half fried
And n'ere a fresh avacodo eyed
And just because we are in the States
Should not warrent Mexican second rate

Oh that mediocrity could be removed
Phoenicians could be Mexican proved
Spicy, saucy, hot and  with much con queso
The difference would be Los Dos Molinos

The difference here is not cosmetic
The difference here will turn the skeptic
If the tomales here were put to test
You'd find them more than worth your quest

But bring the burrito to the table now
To really get the sense of their real "wow"...

Much more than this I cannot say
Eat, sing, dance and saute'.
