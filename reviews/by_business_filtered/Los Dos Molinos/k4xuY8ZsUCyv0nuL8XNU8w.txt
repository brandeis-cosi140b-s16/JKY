I was glad to hear that Los Dos had opened a restaurant in Chandler.  As always, the food is only good if you like it hot and choices for those that don't are limited.  However, the restaurant is nice, the service is great and the food is, well, hot.  If you like any of the other Los Dos locations, you will not be let down by this one.
