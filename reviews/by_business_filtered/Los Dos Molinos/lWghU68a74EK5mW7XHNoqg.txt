The staff at Los dos molinos are incredible. We were getting ready to head to the airport and told them that we had craved their amazing spicy food for a whole year. We had tried them one year prior on a business trip. When they heard this, they packed our additional food items we had ordered for the plane ride home and added in a bunch of extra to remember them by. They treated us like family and we will be going back every time were in Phoenix. Even if it's just a layover.
