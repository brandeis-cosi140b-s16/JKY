Came here with my husband... He had told me that this place was getting great reviews and all, that the food was great as well as service, so I took his word for it. Well, truthfully. He was wrong, we had terrible service and the food was not that good as well. We first walked in and it wasn't that busy. A guy asked us if we were gonna take a table for two, we told him we wanted to look at the menu to see what we would order to go. He said okay. We looked over the menu, and we were ready to order so I went up to the front desk to tell him we were ready, adjust when we were gonna tell him, he completely ignored me as a group of four people walked in and attended to them first, that pissed us both off. After he sat them he took my order. Then as we were about to pay this lady comes back and pretty much shoves the check of our order in front of me in very ill mannered way and tells is angrily our total. The only reason I'm actually giving this place two stars and not one is because of the manager. He was very nice and was asking not just us but everyone in the restaurant if everything was good or if we needed anything at all. Other than that, the service was horrible. The food was half good and half not too good. Truthfully I rather go down the street to a "filibertos" type of place than come here again.
