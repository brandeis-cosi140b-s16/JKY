Love, love, love this place! Finally decided to put my two sense in on this place.  I've been going here for years and I am never dissapointed.  
 The food is excellent , the margaritas are amazing  and the salsa is hard to beat!  I'm a fan of both the green and red!  In addition the staff is always super accommodating and friendly. 
 I always recommend to friends and visitors to the area if they're looking for great food and atmosphere.
