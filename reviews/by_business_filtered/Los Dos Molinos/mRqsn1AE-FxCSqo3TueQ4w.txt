Super spicy and delicious New Mexico style cuisine. We had three different entrees and all were wonderful. The margaritas were especially tasty, large, and not too sweet. We'd definitely come back! My only complaint is that I wish they had a few more vegetarian options.

Try: The Enchilada Dinner (with red chili and blue corn tortilla)
