I was a regular every Friday afternoon for lunch.  I went in on a Friday for Happy Hour and after sitting at the bar for 45 minutes I was told I had to move by the bartender.  When I asked why? The bartender told that 2 people that come in more than I do are going to take the seats we occupied.  When we moved to our new seats, I told the bartender that I thought that was rude.  I was then handed a bill and told that I did not need to come back.  I have brought numerous people into this establishment and spent almost every Friday there for lunch for about 6 months straight.  Sucks that I will not be going back because they have good food.  The service is terrible.
