...what the others have said.....an echo...

On a recent sojourn to Phoenix, I overheard a colleague mention his favorite Mexican establishment to some others...and the word "spicy" was mentioned with reverance several times. So, being a devotee of the higher scofield numbers, I interjected myself into the otherwise private conversation.

One thing led to another....to my good fortune. [I was otherwise condemned to hotel fare.]

Everything was excellent...including the [multi flavored] ambience and it being hard to find. [The name of the place is merely painted on the top of the building in an industrial area...and illuminated with a couple of dim bulbs -- no figurative message intended.]

But....and this is enough of a "but" to zap the fifth star -- the table chips were seemingly out of a bag?!?!?!? HUH?! WHAT?!?!? That excellently spiced salsa [not for the faint of heart as others have noted] was wasted!! Why not homemade tortillas with some body....gloriously fried in lard like my favorite Mex-place in Pomona, CA??

That's my only quibble....when in the Phoenix area....GO! [They're motto is "Some Like it Hot"]

I give it a 300,000 plus on the Scofield scale!
