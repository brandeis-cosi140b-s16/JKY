Food is ok but for the love of Pete lose the  iPad check pay system! We want paper checks!!!  After having lunch with friends we were shown our individual bills on an iPad and asked to finger sign. Lunch with one entree and no drink was over $22 each with tax and tip. Really?  No detail of our bills and no paper receipts. Bad!!!
