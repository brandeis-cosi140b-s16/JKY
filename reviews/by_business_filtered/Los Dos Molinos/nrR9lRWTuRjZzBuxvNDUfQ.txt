Heard so many positive reviews and word of mouth.  So I was excited to try this place, especially with all the hype that they use all the New Mexico related marketing.  My instinct should have kept me away.  The way any respectible New Mexican knows you splell Chile (with an E at the end), this should have been the first sign at how bad it was going to be.  Anybody that is used to real New Mexican fare, don't go here!  The food is absolutely atrocious.  I feel so ripped off that I had to overpay for this garbage, yes overpay, it way overpriced and the drinks are watered down.  I really feel for the people that have not had the chance to eat real quality food and they think this place is special.  Wow!  Stay away!
