Los Dos Molinos is always a treat.

I've had the chance to visit all their locations in the Phoenix area. The Mesa and South Phoenix restaurants never disappoint.

The green and red salsa are both HOT (really, hot) so be prepared. It's a welcome change from some of the milder restaurants in the area. This isn't Macayos. If you don't like spicy food - steer clear.

I recommend the beef tacos or the enchilada platter (it comes with an egg on top to help cool your mouth down). 

The employees are extremely friendly.

Great experience every time.

Bon appetite.
