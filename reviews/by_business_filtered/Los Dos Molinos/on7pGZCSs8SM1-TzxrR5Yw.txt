Wow, so disappointed. A few people I work with told me how great this place was, so I finally decided to give it a try. I am personally a huge fan of Los Taquitos Mexican Grill over on Elliot but hey, I'll try anything once.

My daughter and I went in, just after 5pm, to be greeted but no one. Finally a guy walks out of the back and seats us. We are sitting in the bar area which is fine cause the place was empty other than an older couple sitting in the back corner.  We got our chips and salsa and wow, just, yuck. The runny green one tasted like raw garlic and the red pasty one was hot but flavorless. 

After looking over the menus we were both shocked at the limitation of it. My daughter asked the server the difference between the regular tostada and the guacamole one, she was told the regular one was just shell and beans. She questioned about lettuce and tomato and he said, no, maybe, sometimes to make it look nice.... I am sorry, WHAT? 

I ordered a chicken Chimichanga with red sauce, the red sauce tasted like powdered chili power and chimi itself was soggy with dry chicken in it. My daughters guacamole tostada was soggy as well. The rice and beans side dish, that they charge 4 bucks for, was disgusting, the rice was clumped together with congealed cheese on it and the beans looked like the Ranch brand beans directly out of the can.

Service was so slow, but I did see one of the bartenders and what was either the owner or manager chatting with people who were seemly regulars. 

All I can say is never again, I'd rather go to a 'hole in the wall' like Los Taquitos for good quality food, than this over priced wanna be restaurant. The outdoor patio and table service don't make up for the crap food and horrid staff.
