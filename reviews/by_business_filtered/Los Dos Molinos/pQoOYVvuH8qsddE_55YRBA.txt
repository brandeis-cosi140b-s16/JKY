Was excited to come to his location as I had a frat experience with the South Phoenix location but was disappointed early.  Our waiter was not friendly (said we can't have one soft shell and one hard shell on taco platter), didn't care we were there (didn't check on us until we were done w meal), and just have me a bad feel for this location where I won't go back.  Nice job!
