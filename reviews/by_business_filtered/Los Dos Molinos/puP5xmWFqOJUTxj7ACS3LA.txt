Good stuff! They ain't kidding about the heat -- I had a good scalp sweat going just from the tasty chips and salsa -- but it's a flavorful kick, the way it should be (and the first thing delivered to the table was a pitcher of water, FTW);. Stopped by before a concert at The Nile, and the staff could not have been friendlier. The food was flavorful and there were a host of specials to choose from, including options for vegetarians and those looking for something less volcanic. Prices were very reasonable, and the house frozen marg was the size of a baby head and well-suited to quenching the fire from the Chiles. The capsaicin in chiles releases endorphins in your brain that can be addictive, and I'll be back for another hit.
