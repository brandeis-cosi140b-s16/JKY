Really good food! Just as all the other reviewers have mentioned the salsa is SPICY! Some of the food items have a chili next to them to indicate it's a spicy menu item.... So take the warning! 
Received a free cheese crisp for checking in on Yelp and it was delicious!
The staff wasn't overly talkative/friendly until we told them how much we liked the food but they weren't rude either. We were one of three tables that sat at the same time so probably just time managing!

Overall... I'd go back! :)
