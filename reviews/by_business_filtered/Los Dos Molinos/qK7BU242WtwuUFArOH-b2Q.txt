Customer service was really good. Each employee was friendly to us.  They made us feel welcome.

The restaurant itself is nothing fancy. Has some gaudy decor but it makes you feel like the food is going to be good.  :). Sometime the best places are the little hole in a walls. 

The first bowls of chips and salsa are free but the second are $1 each. The red and green salsa taste good and are spicy. Taste home made to me. I don't typically like green salsa but I liked this one.

The cheese crisp was not crispy.  I would suggest telling them you want it crispy so that they will cook it longer.

What I noticed is the spicy dishes taste good but the other items like tacos, tostada, rice, beans are bland.

Sister ordered combo #3 taco, tostada rice and beans. The meat in the taco was bland and mushy. Had a weird flavor.  The rice tasted packaged. The whole beans had no seasoning.

I ordered Adovada Rib dinner. This was cooked well. Lots of flavor and spice. I got the same packaged tasting rice. My beans were in a red sauce that tasted like it was canned. The tortilla was very dry and hard. 

Daughter ordered a beef and bean tostada. When she picked it up for a bite, she only had half a shell. We looked underneath the mound of beans and lettuce but the other half of the shell was missing!

I really wanted to like this place. Living in Mesa you'd think there would be better Mexican restaurants to choose from. This one is marked off my list.
