Wow, don't understand why everyone doesn't give this place 4-5 stars.  Other than Elote in Sedona, this is the best Mexican food  I have had in AZ.  First the atmosphere is fun, authentic and vibrant.  Our waiter was Mexican and excellent.  Finally I had an enchilada that had a homemade sauce.  Usually it is so thick that it tastes almost painted on.  Not here.  My daughters had burritos that were perfect.  We finished off the meal with heavenly sopapillas and ice cream.   I will come back here again and again.  It's excellent.
