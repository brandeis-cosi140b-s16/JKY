So I was shopping at Trader Joe's and remembered I hadn't had lunch or dinner, it was now about 8 pm so I broke down and went over to Los Dos Molinos. I had heard it was great food, and as usual, I took that with many grains of salt. Let's say I wasn't disappointed because I expected nothing special - but I did expect it to be edible - it barely was.

To start I ordered a margarita, the house margarita which was almost $10. God awful, so I asked the girl behind the bar to add some 7up to it - then more ice, then more ice, and it was still syrupy, limy, nasty sewer water disgusting. Then came the chips and salsa. Even worse. Maybe "Authentic" Mexican tortilla chips are supposed to be as hard as wood-chips, but that's not how I prefer them. Broken teeth is not part of a pleasant dining experience. The salsa was gross,  some smoky-spicy garbage and other green nonsense, nothing fresh or flavorful. 

So now I try to salvage this dinner with the guacamole. Mind you, I was starving, otherwise I would have left already. The guacamole was a good size portion and wasn't that expensive (everything else was) but again, it was very bland. I ate it all because I was ravenous.

By now I wasn't even halfway through my margarita when I ordered a beer. I didn't want to soil my dinner with that margarita sludge, and the Shrimp Veracruz looked tantalizing and authentic. So the bartender brings my beer - but doesn't bother to ask about the 2/3 full margarita sitting there. I never touched it again.

The entree arrives, not the biggest portion, but enough, and it looks good. But it was quite bland. I was expecting it to be flavorful, at least spicy, but nope- no imagination or care put into it. This place is quite typical of the Phoenix area - mediocre food with poor service. I can only blame myself for even giving it a try.
