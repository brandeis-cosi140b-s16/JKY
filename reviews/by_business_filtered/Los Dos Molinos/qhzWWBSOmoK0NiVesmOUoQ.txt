Hubby and I are from out of state and found this place for Sunday lunch. They gave us complimentary chips & salsa which the waiter warned us to take it easy coz it's chili based (which means really spicy). Im glad he did that coz I can't tolerate too much spicy food. I still ate some anyways coz it's so good. For entrees I got shrimp ajo (garlic butter sauce with rice, flour tortilla & beans) and hubby got the taco salad. We both liked it coz of the authentic taste and ingredients. Staff is very friendly & service was great. We'll definitely come back when we visit Arizona next time.
