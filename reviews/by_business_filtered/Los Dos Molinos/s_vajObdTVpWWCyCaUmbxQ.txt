One too many stars  wanted to try a new place with high rates from Yelp. I found 
Los Dos Molinos. When I walk in the restaurant It was very dark and it also had a very weird smell  inside. Thank god I had to watch my hands so I used the restroom and its was dark and very dirty but wait it gets better. I found a huge roach in the sink     
I'm not sure why this restaurant is open but if I was you don't go to Los Dos Molinos.
