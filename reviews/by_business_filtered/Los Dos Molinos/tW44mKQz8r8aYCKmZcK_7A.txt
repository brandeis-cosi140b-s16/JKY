I now refuse to return, in spite of having had great food here in the past.  I showed up with a lady I am dating at 8:40pm on a Saturday night for a late dinner.  It seemed like a ghost town in there and I had to wait a few minutes just to have someone tell me, "Sorry our kitchen is closed."  The posted closing time online is 2 a.m.  Do I expect the kitchen open that late?  No, but I think dinner before 9pm on a Saturday night is a reasonable expectation. So, based on that experience I'm demoting my four star review to a three, and refusing to return.
