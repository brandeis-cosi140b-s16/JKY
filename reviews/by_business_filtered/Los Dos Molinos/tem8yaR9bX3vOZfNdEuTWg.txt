Great food, neat location. Salsa is fantastic. Worth the wait to get in. Favorite meal is the enchiladas with the egg on top. Everything is good. If you only have time to go to one Mexican restaurant in Phoenix this is the one. Only problem (and the reason I only gave it 4 stars) is that they close the place or go on vacation randomly and even if you call to make sure the place is open they do not update their phone message. We have gone there two or three times and found the place closed on a night they normally are open even though their message said they were open. We have also been to the Mesa and Downtown locations and while the food is as good it is not the same experience as going to the Central Ave. location.
