I don't know if they just had an off night, if I ordered the wrong thing (the "red chili plate"), or if their quality of food has deteriorated; but I was sorely disappointed during my last visit. I've always liked the atmosphere at the other "Los Dos" better, (I mean come on, the "red chili plate" is aka "chile colorado" at any other Mexican restaurant), but at least the food used to be good. This last time, the food was bland, the tortillas were greasy, I could have gotten better guacamole at Chipotle, and the poppers were store bought (yes, I know, dumb mistake- they just sounded good at the time). My recommendations: try the "green chile plate" (aka "chile verde" at any other Mexican restaurant). Try the other "Los Dos", the one off Central. Or maybe, try some other place.
