Authentic Mexican food, SPICY, and delicious. Everyone else, just get over their paper menus, not a big deal, so cry about it somewhere else. It says on it that it's a temp menu anyway. Service has always been good, it's a kind of hole in the wall place so I'm not expecting perfection anyways, just good authentic food, and that's what you get. You don't like it, go across the street and get your "Mexican food" from a certain other place! Ring a BELL?
