My new standard for Mexican food!  The food is perfectly spicy walking the delicate balance of spice and flavor.  The staff was extremely friendly and helpful.  The only complaint I could imagine is that the food and salsa is too spicy, but of you like spicy food, you'll love Los Dos Molinos.  I can't wait to return!
