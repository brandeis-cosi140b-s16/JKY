The food was okay. I had the beef burrito enchilada style with black beans and rice. The rice had a ton of cheese on it...which was strange. Chips were brought out pretty slowly, and one of the batches was all crumbs. Lots of different salsas though, which were all good. We paid the extra six bucks for the higher level pitcher of tequila and it was bad. Bitter, store bought mix, and barely cold. They did replace it which was nice and appreciated. But I mean, seriously...they have to know those margaritas are bad. My water got refilled. Once. At the beginning of the meal. Being that the service was so slow, I went the entire SECOND hour without water. Dessert came out incredibly slow, then the server acted annoyed that WE had to shuffle dirty plates around to make room. Plates HE should have cleared. The amount of time this meal took and the quality of drinks do do not make this mediocre food worth it. Most likely won't visit again.
