I have been eating at Los dos for years and there was a time I would have given the New Mexico chile inspired (Los dos Molinos means the two grinders a reference to grinding Chile)  themed restaurant 6 stars if that was an option. Their self proclaimed motto "some like it hot" is an understatement and an anthem there is not spicier more flavorful green and red chile anywhere in the valley.

Unfortunately over the years consistency of product has suffered. Recently as many amazing meals like the one I had today as awful ones that had me swearing I would never come back. For this reason I must knock off 1 star....when it's good it's great and I would and will take the chance again and again.

The chile and margaritas are why you go here if you don't like spicy, don't go...there islots of flavor but it is also HOT. You can also order any dish "Christmas style" which means you want both red and green chile, only way to go IMO. 

Finally get a designated driver your going to want to suck down the amazing and high octane margaritas to put that fire out and after 2 walking is hard and driving out of the question.
