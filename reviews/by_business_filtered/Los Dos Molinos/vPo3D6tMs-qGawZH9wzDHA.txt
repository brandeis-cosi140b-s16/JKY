I am not going to say this is the fanciest nor best Mexican food I have ever had, but it is up in the top 20%. There hours are a little weird; and the place fills up fast. I am a spicy type of soul; so this is really the place for me. If you are going to go with a pitcher of Margarita's; I recommend upgrading a bit. The prices are reasonable, but the charges for extra salsa kind of irked me a bit. The crew there is a little slow paced, as I noticed many people had the same feeling we did. The location is a little out of the loop, but after a Dbacks or Sun's game, it is well worth the extra ten minute drive south!
