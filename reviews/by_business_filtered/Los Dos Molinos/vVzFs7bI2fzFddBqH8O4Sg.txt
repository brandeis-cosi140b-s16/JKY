If I could give zero star I would. Awful policies....I asked them to put my beans on a separate plate but Then I would get charged extra....just to slap it on a separate plate.  I then asked for an extra empty plate and they charge you extra for that.   This place really needs to rethink their policies, they could care less about customers. At least the server was nice.
