I hardly ever just give one star as I'm a silver lining type of gal, but there was none to be found here.  I don't know what kind of Mexican food this is, or what you all consider Mexican, but this was not for me.  Started with the chips and salsa, which were pretty flavorless and should have been a red flag.  I ordered the enchilada plate with an egg on top.  What I got is not what I have ever seen an enchilada look or taste like.  It was like a layer of fried cornmeal, some shredded beef, no wait, a pile a shredded beef, and some chile sauce that I wound not classify as red chile.  I tired really hard to suck it up and give it a try, but it only got less and less appetizing.  Then we ordered the sopaipillas and they were just meh, not worth the calories.  The waitress was not very friendly and I can't believe I spent $45 to feel physically sick.  Will not be going back....ever.
