Can't believe the good hype this place gets.  Very disappointed. Had heard such good reviews everywhere.  The margaritas, too pricey - served in plastic glasses - were weak and a few steps below lime aid - we waited in the patio - had to get our own drinks and no chips/salsa while we waited for our table -  food was decent but nothing to rave about, really lame to have to pay extras for additional chips and salsa and the forks were ,even though not plastic, like something out of a camping or picnic kit - won't go back - too many other really good Mexican places in the valley."
