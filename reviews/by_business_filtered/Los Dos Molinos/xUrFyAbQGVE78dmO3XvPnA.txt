The salsa is spicy and the margaritas are strong.  The food is spicy but I could handle hotter.  The portions are reasonable and the prices are moderate.  The owner can regularly be seen there and has stopped to see how I'm doing more often then not.  I prefer the mesa location over the Phoenix one simply because it's easier to get to and usually less crowded.
