My mom is visiting from Alaska and she is a huge fan of Los Dos Molinos so it was a must that we went there to eat.

I love spicy food so I do enjoy this place, but on this visit the harsh reality sunk in that this place is really just average.  Food is good and service is fine but nothing to really make me crave going back again and again.  

I always get the adovado ribs which are a bit spicy but good.  I also enjoy their green salsa that comes out with chips as it has some good heat to it.  

Overall it's A-OK New Mexican food but I think the novalty has worn off for me now.
