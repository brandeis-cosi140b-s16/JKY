Atmosphere...Dirty. Tacky. Poorly Lit.  They had half of the restaurant closed...but for no apparent reason. 

Service...mediocre, at best.  The bus boy and bartender were great, our waitress was one of the worst I've ever experienced.  We had to ask three times for silverware.

Seating...We had a party of 7, and were sat at a table that was meant to seat 4.  They added extra chairs, but never thought to push an extra table up, even though they weren't even remotely busy.

Drinks...Good.  Strong and tasty. 

Food...Spicy but cliche.  Nothing that really sets them apart, adding some extra chiles does not an amazing meal make.  The "fresh" chips were burnt and rancid. 

I've had better food with exponentially better service nearly everywhere else. I doubt I'll be back, especially not to this location.
