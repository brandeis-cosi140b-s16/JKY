Your search for quality spicy New Mexican food is over! I was greeted by a very friendly bartender that explained their kick ass margarita in a humorous way. I was then promptly served green hatch chile and red chile salsas with crispy tortilla chips. 

Ordering was a no brainer as I went for the best looking and proclaimed house speciality, Adovado Ribs. Fall apart tender, spicy and flavorful with a fresh tortilla, beans and rice. 

I grew up eating Mexican / TexMex in Fort Worth Texas and spent many years with this type of food in various towns and pueblos in New Mexico. I travel here often for business and have searched for many years in Phoenix area for that flavor which is only a state away. I am happy to say I finally found it. 

Did I mention the service was top notch and the place was spotless? No? Well, it was and that's a big deal to me.
