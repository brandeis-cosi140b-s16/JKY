Went there for lunch today.  Food was good (at least the portion that made it to me!), but when the server handed me my plate, he let go of it before I had it (he was reaching across the table from the other side) and he spilt the guacamole and sour cream onto my shirt and pants.  Thankfully I caught the rest of the plate before it all slid off.  He stood there for a moment looking at me and then just continued serving food and walked away as if nothing happened!  Thankfully the people I was with gave me some extra napkins they had.  Wiped it up as best I could and hopefully it'll come out in the laundry at home.  Needless to say I'm not impressed by the service.
