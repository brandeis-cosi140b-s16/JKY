I do not like you either.

I mean its obvious you must not like me, serving shredded chicken in a burrito that tastes CANNED!

You call that salsa? That is hot sauce in a cup. Come on. I like spicy food, but give a guy some options here.

No bar area either...thats kind of lame.

So yeah, we won't ever be friends. I'll be down the street at Pancho's instead.
