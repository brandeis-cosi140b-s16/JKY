Best breakfast burritos in Tempe.  The only other place I ever go is Texanos, but in the breakfast burrito category, I think Favs has them beat.  Everything is well priced and tastes great.  They even have a pool table and some video games now!  Def check out their nachos too!  They are not to pass up!
