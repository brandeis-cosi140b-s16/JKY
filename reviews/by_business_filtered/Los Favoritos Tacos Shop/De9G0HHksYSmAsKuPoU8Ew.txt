Where do I even begin with this amazing place?! I have been a loyal Los Faves customer ever since the first bite I took of the chorizo breakfast burrito which has since changed my life. The chorizo burrito has become a very close ally of mine for too hungover mornings. It saves me every time I eat it. I have a couple times tried other burritos or meals, like the enchiladas and quesadillas and have never been disappointed. Each out of state visitor I have is automatically taken here to experience the spice of real Mexican food. I have never had a visitor do anything less than rave about this place. It is now within walking distance of my apartment, which is a real shame...for my diet. I love Los Faves and if you live in Tempe and haven't tried it out you are really doing yourself a disservice. Los Faves or Die.
