The food is on par with Filberto's but this restaurant STINKS - literally! Their oversized street style tacos are actually pretty good, but the SMELL of this restaurant is a nauseating unholy combination of burning cooking oil, disinfectant and insecticide that could kill anyone's appetite. And to top it off, a big horsefly died at my table while I was eating. Disgusting!
