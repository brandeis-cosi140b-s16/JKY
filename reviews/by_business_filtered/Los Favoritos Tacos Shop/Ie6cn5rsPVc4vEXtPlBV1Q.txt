Oh. My. Goodness.  Since I'm vegetarian, I can only get a bean and cheese burrito (yes, I know the beans are made of lard).  But I still love this place!

+ Prices are cheap!  Good, cheap Mexican food always sounds good to me.

- Location.  Kind of hidden, hard to find.

+ Horchata.  Yes, mmm, horchata.  It's really, really good here.

+ Better than Filly B's by far.  Just the right amount of beans and cheese in a warm but moist tortilla.  Heaven in a wrapper.
