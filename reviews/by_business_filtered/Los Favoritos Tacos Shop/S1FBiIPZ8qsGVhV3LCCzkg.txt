Tasty Mexican food with reasonable prices.  Their breakfast burritos are quite large and filling.  I had the chorizo burrito, which also comes with potatoes and eggs.  It was pretty good, although I wish there were more chorizo in the burrito for the flavor of the meat to fully manifest itself.  I also tried some chimichanga, which was equally large and filling.  They also have very refreshing horchata.  The other nice detail about this restaurant is that they are open until midnight every day except Sunday, which is open until 10 P.M.
