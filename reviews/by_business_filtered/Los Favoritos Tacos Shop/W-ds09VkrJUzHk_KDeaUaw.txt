I went to Los Favs this afternoon. Although I've been here countless times since I've moved, today showed me exactly how much I love this place. 

For a completely unnecessary reason the cashier was being talked down upon by a unfriendly gentlemen customer. Instead of retaliating, she kindly handled him his refill and went about her workday. This takes a truly amazing person to not give in when others are pushing you. When I stepped up to give me order she was nothing but friendly to me. That alone in my books is enough to keep me coming back time and time again.

Aside from the customer service, the food is always delicious, generously portioned and speedy. I make it a point take all of my out-of-town friends here when they visit. Highly recommend. If I could give more than five stars, I would.
