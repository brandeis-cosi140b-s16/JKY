As a current chandler resident for the past 3.5 years I have grown quite fond of Los favoritos for some time for a few reasons.  One being the red salsa which is not watery like Disgusting Filly B's. Any secondly their carne asada is a whole hell of a lot better most of the time than Filly B's as well. But for Some Bizarre reason this Los Favs doesn't quite make par for me as far as taste tests go compared to the Chandler Location. There is this strong salty taste every time I have had their carne asada fries and I highly doubt they salt their french fries then load on more salty stuff. Then they just kind of dab the sour cream on one side and guacamole on another.  Now I know this sounds like I am just being over critical and picky as can be I am just extremely used to the pizzaz and way of doing things at the other location.  I will be trying their burritos next time so I can see how those turn out, a little nervous but I will give them one more shot.
