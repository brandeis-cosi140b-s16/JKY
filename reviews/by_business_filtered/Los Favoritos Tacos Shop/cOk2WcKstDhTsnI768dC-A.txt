My favorite thing are the shrimp tacos. I think they are $2.50 and quite delicious. The location is right around the corner from my apartment so my boyfriend and I frequent the place. My boyfriend likes the breakfast burrito and the super burrito, which is like 2 feet long, but it still has a lot of filling inside.
