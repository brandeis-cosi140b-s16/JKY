I came here last night after craving carne asada all day.  So I hopped on over here after work and almost missed it because it's tucked away and it's super small.  The burrito did not disappoint.  Carne asada was perfectly seasoned, tortilla warm and slightly toasted, guacamole and pico de gallo with just enough kick... I admit that I'm drooling just a little bit right now as a write this.  If it came with a little rice inside I would have given this place 4 stars.
