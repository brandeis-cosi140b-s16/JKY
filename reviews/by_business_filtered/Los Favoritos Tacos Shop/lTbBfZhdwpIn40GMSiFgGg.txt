Nasty. Absolutely some of worst food I've ever eaten. No joke. This is pretty much Taco Bell. Icky. They put bagged cheese on every dish including chips and guac? We threw over half our food away because I felt sick eating it. Seriously there are FAR better authentic taco shops close by that are fantastic. 

However the customer service was friendly and quick.
