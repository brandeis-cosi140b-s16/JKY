Overall, los favoritos is a pretty good spot for some fast tacos at an affordable price.

The chicken taco has an interesting flavor and texture with the crispy shell and the onion and green pepper mixed in with the shredded chicken. I would order this again.

Carne asada is pretty standard, guac is smooth and has a good flavor.
