I always give taco shops a fair shot! But omg..I think this place only stays in business because of surrounding bars! I was completely sober and having a craving...ate here for dinner one night. (can't speak for breakfast time)  Everything is watered down! From the chili sauces to the beans!! Taco shop looks like a cafeteria...very empty, nothing on the walls. The chicken was dark meat and mostly fat. I will not eat here again. Which is a shame because I live so close.
