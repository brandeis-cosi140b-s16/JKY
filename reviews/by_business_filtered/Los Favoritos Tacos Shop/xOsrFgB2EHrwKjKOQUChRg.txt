Oh sweat baby Jesus. This is my favorite fast mexican spot in AZ. I would never step into a Filibertos ever again because of Los Favs. I used to live in the apartments located next to this plaza and decided to give it a shot since it smelled so good. Carne Asada Fries are what I recommend with lots of green and red sauce. DO IT, DO IT NOW!! Oh and if you're around for breakfast, do the chorizo plate...you will not be disappointed.
