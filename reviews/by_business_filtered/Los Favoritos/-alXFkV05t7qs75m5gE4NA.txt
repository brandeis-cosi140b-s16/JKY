Typically I love the place. However, last Sunday I placed a phone order. Placed an order for one steak and egg with extra egg and add guacamole, & 3 bacon,cheese & potatoes burro with egg... After I repeated order at least 3 times over the phone ENGLISH & SPANISH! she still manages to mess it up and when i get there after seeing my order i was upset and the lady called me a lair lol the audacity of her. PLEASE GET SOMEONE THAT UNDERSTANDS BOTH LANGUAGES!
