Service stinks here!  i was looking right at the board and pointed to the two taco combo.  I got just 2 tacos not the combo and when I asked where the beans and rice were they acted like i was imposing on them.  If someone orders two tacos don't' you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart?  Then they tossed the beans and rice in the bag and made a huge mess out of everything.  I guess 'cause I am a gringo they simply just don't care!
