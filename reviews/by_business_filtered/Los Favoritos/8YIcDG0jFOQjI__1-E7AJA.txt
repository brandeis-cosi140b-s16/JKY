Growing up on the North Side, where Mexican food is everywhere.  I am a bit of a snob when it comes to this. 

My boyfriend and I moved to Chandler from Tempe and said oh let's get tacos! 
We go to Los Favoritos and the cashier girl, was RUDE.  The food was medicore, the decor the same. 
But the biggest issue was the beans. Seriously, rice and beans are a STAPLE.  
The rice was decent, the beans just tasted like chicken broth. I thought beans had lard. But shit this gringa found better elsewhere.
