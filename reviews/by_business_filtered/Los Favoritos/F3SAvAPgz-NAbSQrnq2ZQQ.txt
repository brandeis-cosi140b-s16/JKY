Oh Los Faves, you sure know how to make a great breakfast burrito. What I love about Los Faves is that their burritos are not greasy, and they offer them with either flour or whole wheat tortilla. I'm boring with my order and usually get a sausage burrito, and sometimes a quesadilla. Their quesadilla is made with American cheese and not with queso blanco. On weekend mornings, expect a long wait with orders (around 15-20 minutes) since they get really busy. It's a good place to get a nice warm burrito and do yourself a favor and ask for the salsa verde, it gives the right kick to deliciousness!
