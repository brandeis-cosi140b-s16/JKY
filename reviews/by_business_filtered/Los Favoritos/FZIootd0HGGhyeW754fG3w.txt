Breakfast burritos are awesome!  Choose from bacon, sausage, ham ... or my favorite - no meat.  Really good food.  In a hurry or don't want to wait? No problem - call ahead and your order will be ready when you get there.

We usually place our order and then head next door to Starbucks and get our morning caffeine fix...by the time we get back - order is ready!  

Prices are reasonable.  Service is good.  Food is what you'd expect.  Nachos, burritos, enchilada plates are all very good.  Taquitos can be a little dry, but hey - that's what sour cream is for. Right?
Oh yeah - tons of FREE parking!
