This place is amazing -- the food is great, and the service is friendly. Of course, at some times when it gets slammed, there may be a bit of a language barrier (obviously, a lot of Spanish-speakers work there), but it usually isn't a problem. They have a good technique of getting out the simpler meals quicker because waiting on a large meal to get something small would be just insane. I go here every Saturday and feed 3 people for under $20...it's a ritual, now! I've definitely recommended this place to people, and I'm never going to stop!
