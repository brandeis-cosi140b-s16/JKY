Los Whatever

This place is just a step above *bertos.  Just your standard, run of the mill "Mexican"  food.  Like most Mexican food, it's "OK".  Nothing special here.  I had the carne asada platter with a drink, it came to $9.11.  A conspiracy?  Perhaps.  I don't see what the big deal here is, nor do I understand how anyone with papillae can give this place 5-stars.
