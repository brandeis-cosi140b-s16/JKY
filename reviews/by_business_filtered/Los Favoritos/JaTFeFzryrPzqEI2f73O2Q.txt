I had the beef taco and cheese enchilada combo with beans and rice. The beans and rice were pretty standard. The cheese enchilada was quite cheesy and tasty. The beef taco was just OK, but that's partly my fault. I was expecting ground beef, but you have to specifically ask for it, so the next time I will go in I'll try that.
