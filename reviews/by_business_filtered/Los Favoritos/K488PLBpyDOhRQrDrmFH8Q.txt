My son Daniel kept buggin me to try this place, but I was reluctant. No good reason. I just already have my fave taco shops, and plus the bland strip-mall experior just didn't shout "Eat here" to me.

But he got to choose where to eat the other night after his National Honor Society induction ceremony, and he chose here. 

I gotta say, my kid really is smart. Los Favoritos is definitely a notch above typical fast-food-ish Mexican. On my son's recommendation, I got the "breakfast" chorizo burrito (served all day). It was on a tortilla the size of a small planet, and stuffed full of savory & spicy meat, cheese, potato and egg.  My husband ordered carne asada, and Daniel got chili rellenos. They were wonderful! 

The service was ify, simply becuase communication was a bit hard with non-English native speakers. But they get an A for effort.

I guess I owe Los Favoritos an apology for judging it on outward appearances alone. I'll certainly be going back!
