I come to Los Favoritos All the time! I love their burritos!! They are sometimes on point depends on who makes it. Today was a horrible experience!!! I ordered a side of chips with pico de gallo and guacamole. They charged me for 2 pico de gallos and didn't give me any guacamole. I went back in the restaurant and asked them to please give me the guacamole. They charged me the same amount they charged me for the pico de gallo but they gave me only 1, 2 oz souffl√© cup. I was debating the two women there about the charge. They both got rude and upset with me. I explained to them that I run a restaurant myself and I can't believe how they are refusing to just give me another after the fact I paid for it.  VERY POOR POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE! 
I am very disappointed and unfortunately will not be bringing my family back.
