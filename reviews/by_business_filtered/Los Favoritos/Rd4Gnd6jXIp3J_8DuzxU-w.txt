This is a clean place with good service... But the food is just not great. The breakfast and Carne Asada burritos were not bad, just nothing to write home about. However, their chicken tacos had some sort of dehydrated chicken or something. The wife had a hard time eating it.

I debated giving a third star, but when eating your food is an unpleasant struggle, you get no third star.
