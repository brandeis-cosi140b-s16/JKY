This went from a 2 star to a 3 star only because other yelpers talked about the chorizo. 

On the downside, although the food was good this time (chorizo with double rice and beans), the service was just ok and the bathrooms were kinda dirty. It was right before closing so they probably hadnt cleaned them in a few hours. 

Probably not going to go back anytime soon.
