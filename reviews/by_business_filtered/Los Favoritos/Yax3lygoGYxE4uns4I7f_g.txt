I cannot even begin to explain the love I have and have had for this place since it opened. I used to live next door and it was always my Sunday breakfast spot. Now that I'm back home, it has become my 3 times a week breakfast spot - yes, I live on the west side and yes I am willing to drive 20 miles for their California burrito. I don't care about gas prices or photo radar.. all I care about is their burritos and green salsa... Its delicious, bursting with flavor, perfect tortillas and a whole lot of authentic Mexican love wrapped inside.

Not only this, but its CLEAN, which is rare for a joint like this and not only that, but the staff are NICE, and speak excellent English, which I dig because my Spanish absolutely blows.. They're always smiling and they even remember what you want.. All I have to do these days is walk in and my burrito is already being prepared. Before I even pay. What is better than that?

If you love potatoes, like myself.. try the California. If you like the usual carne asada.. theirs is excellent...  Actually, if you just enjoy Mexican food in general, eat here.. its real, good non greasy, tasty, orgasmic Mexican food and the Horchata is delish and their enchiladas are spectacular..

God, why must I live so far away??
