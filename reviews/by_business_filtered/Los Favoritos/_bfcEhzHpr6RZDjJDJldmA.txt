Go somewhere else. Really bad service and mediocre food. I don't understand crappy rude service. Why? We pay your bills. Really snarky counter girl really got under my skin. Ordered my food and no eye contact or a thank you.  Gave her my corporate credit card to pay and she snaps back its declined. I told her it was impossible as there's 12 thousand in there and asked her to run it again. She literally rolled her eyes at me. No really she rolled her eyes at me like I'm some deadbeat who can't pay for a 6 dollar burro. Of course it went through. No thanks or eye contact again. Come to get my food she walked away without asking me if I needed anything. Had to wait and ask for my soda cup. She pours me a solo cup of water without ice and walks away. Have to wait for her to come back and ask for my cup again. She shoots me the stink eye and says she doesn't remember charging me for a drink. Brings me a small cup when my receipt says MD Soda $1.65. Again she lays out a snarky comment saying nearly under her breath that she hadn't charged me for the soda and now I'm annoyed further from her remarks inferring I'm a scammer and looked right in her eye and said You know what. ..you did charge me. Had a carne asada burro with beans no rice. Bland food. Everything needs salt. No love in this food at all.
