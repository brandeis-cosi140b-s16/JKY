I usually eat here and it's good but today I found a hair in my food. I was upset and asked the cashier to refund my money and she asked if she can give me another burrito instead. I of course said no because it'll just have another hair in it. She then gave me money back but didn't even give me the full amount. She also never apologized for their terrible customer service. I'll never come back here again, it's dirty and all of the tables were a mess.
