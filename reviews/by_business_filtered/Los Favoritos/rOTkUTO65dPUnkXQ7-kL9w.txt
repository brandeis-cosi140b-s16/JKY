I loved coming here until this ignorant lady started talking bad about me in Spanish..it was a Saturday and the business was packed. She rushed my order into her register and got it wrong. When I picked up my order and nicely brought it to her attention (no big deal we all make mistakes) she rudly started arguing with me that I was wrong. That wasn't enough for her she began to tell her co-workers that I was being a nuisance & didn't know what I was talking about. Well...... ¡Si entiendo español perfectamente!
A la otra, muchacha pecosa no tienes que ser tan grocera. Mala educada..
