This taco shop has nothing on the shops in TJ my California burrito tasted like soup rolled up in a tortilla it was gross and super hot! My idea was it was gonna be pollo asado con avacado maybe black beans and sour cream but I got something so gross and the adobado burro was not seasoned pork it was full of grease!!!
