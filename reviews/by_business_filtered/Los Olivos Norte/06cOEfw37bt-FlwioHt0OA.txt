Two years ago, it would have had a 5 star rating from me. I live nearby and go at least once a week for a quick bite. Their salsa is the best. I like their food, but the service has declined beyond acceptable. They can have 10 people in the restaurant and you may wait ...and wait. The food also isn't as good as it once was. Makes me sad, because I really liked it so much more in the past.
