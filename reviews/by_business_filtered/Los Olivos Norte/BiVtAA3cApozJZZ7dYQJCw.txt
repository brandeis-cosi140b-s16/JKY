Ugh this place is Nasty !!!! Overpriced & tonight's meal was inedible had to send back. I went for a birthday dinner have been here multiple time each time gets more disappointing the service is ok that's why I would give the one star but next time I will not return. There was a party of 9 of us there & at least 3 of us got sick within 2 hrs of eating here must have been the salsa & cheese crisp which we all had to bad cause that was the only editable part that I had ;( I have been to the other location many times & it's a step up but this location I would stay clear of so many other choices near by.
