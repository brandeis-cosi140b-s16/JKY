Holy delicious! Los Olivos is the best Mexican restaurant I've had; which is saying something because I live in Arizona. I absolutely love their tacos and enchiladas. They have great lunch specials during the week; this is my favorite lunch spot. 

Request to the owners: Bring back the complimentary bean dip, please!
