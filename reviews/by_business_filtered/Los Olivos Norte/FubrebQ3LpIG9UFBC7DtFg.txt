The best example North Scottsdale has of traditional Phoenix sonoran mexican food.  Los Olivos restaurants have been around forever - at least since the '60's.  The food is great if not fancy, and the place is pretty free of gimmicks.  You can get your fix of cheese crisps (aka quesadillas for you CA transplants), deep fried tacos, chimichangas, combination plates with so much sauce and cheese you can't tell what's underneath but it all works together to taste so good.  Los Olivos still plops down the free chips and salsa right when you sit down so you're good an full when that combo plate comes and glad for it.  The atmosphere is more like a nice mexican diner than mexican cantina and service is solid. They often have mariachis playing on weekend nights.  Margaritas aren't great, but the beer is cold.  Don't bother with dessert.  Cheap eats for all the food, especially since you won't be hungry for another 24 hours.  If you're in North Scottsdale and in the mood for traditional Phoenix style mexican food, Los Olivos is a great choice.
