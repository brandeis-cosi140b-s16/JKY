I could drink their salsa it was so fresh and delicious.  I had the chile rellenos, which was also good, but too spicy for my taste.  The server was young and not very attentive.  We had to beg to get our drinks filled.  The food overall was good, not the best I'd ever had.  The price was a little more than what the food was worth.
