This place is one of my favorites to bring anyone who would like to have great Mexican food that knows what good Mexican food tastes like.  I've been going here for several years and it is always delicious.  

They have become my exclusive provider of chicken quesadillas (shredded chicken that is).  Theirs is the best and I will not order one anywhere else in the WORLD as they just don't compare. 

The waiters are great.  They get their job done, they are friendly and quick.  They won't stand around and chat with you - which is not a negative.  

Excellent margarita's - they are not from a mix and they are amazing.  

Love, love, love this place.
