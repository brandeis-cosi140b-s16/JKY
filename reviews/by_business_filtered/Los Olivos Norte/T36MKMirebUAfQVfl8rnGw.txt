The Northern sister property of the Los Olivos in Old Town Scottsdale, this is one of our family's favorite choices for Mexican food.  We enjoy the Cheese Crisps and Enchilada & Taco combo.

Of course, complimentary Chips & Salsa is offered here.  What I like is that they offer a really spicy Salsa and a Mild one.  I love the spicy stuff and the rest of the family enjoys the mild.

We've dined here several times and have had decent service each time.
