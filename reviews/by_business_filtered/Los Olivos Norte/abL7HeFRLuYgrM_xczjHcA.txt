I say that good service carries a higher point power than good food. She disagrees. I say it's a 4 based on my rating system, she says it's a 3. I'm going with the higher point total BECAUSE IT'S MYYYYYYYY YELP PAGE. NEENER. 

We went here on a Thursday night at 7pm. It was croaking dead. Weird. Have all of the "new money" Scottsdale-ites had their real estate/mortgage/advertising/partner in a law firm income dry up? Flame away. I have seen far fewer small body Benz's and Beemers in Scottsdale as of late. Just saying... I digress.  

It was all old people, and a few people sitting at the bar. Read; people with some money and a few single people needing to get out of their 900sq ft. apartment.

The service was fantastic. No complaints. The food was definitely quality. Not the best ever, but we were just going for good, reliable Mexi-chow for a reasonable price. We found it at Los Olivos. 

We may not agree on points, or ratings, but we agree that it was good all the way around and we will definitely go back if we're out that way.
