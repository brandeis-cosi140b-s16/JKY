Great for large parties, shabby-cute, serving standard heavy Mexican fare.  

This place is a big favorite with my coworkers so I've been here many times over the years.  I recommend the fajitas, which are tasty as long as you don't expect them to be a healthy option (not a taste-the-flavor-of-fresh-veggies situation).  

The chips and salsa are nice, the portions are large and the seating is great for large parties with no reservation, but that does make it a pretty loud place (don't come here thinking you can effectively discuss business).
