Went here for a quick dinner. Food was just average, not too special and not as good as I would expect in the Mexican restaurant. I had an impression that we were a bit neglected by the waiter and waitress, maybe because we had a small order and didn't feel like drinking tons of alcohol, not sure. Salsa was good, but I need a bit more to Mexican restaurant than a good salsa.
