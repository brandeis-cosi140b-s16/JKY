Los Olivios is a solid 3 stars.  We get take out from here every now and then and have stopped in a couple of times after shopping.  

This is one of my go to spots when I have vague cravings (hmmm, I know I want something that is good with a cold beer, cheap and spicy) or when I just want to pick on a bunch of stuff.  Both of these vague signals from my appetite are served by Los Olivios mini menu. We've tried the mini beef tacos, mini chicken flautas and the mini bean tostadas - decent and consistent.  We also really like the Mary Lou with red chile con carne - it's one big delicious pile of slop. Honestly, all of the food is based upon your wanting some deep fried piggishness but there are times that's just what you crave (at least I do).

Pretty good salsa at this place too but I agree that the weird carafe style bottles they're served in are inconvenient though if you know a habitual double dipper, this is the place to bring them.

You get a bucket of ok food at a cheap price.  It could easily be 2.5 stars but I think it deserves the extra .5 for consistency.

 Not "real" Mexican but A-OK.
