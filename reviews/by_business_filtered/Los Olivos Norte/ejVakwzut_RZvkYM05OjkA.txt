Met up with the International Supper Club last week before the Magic Mike showing. The chips and salsa/guac were pretty good, and I ordered a margarita that was on special that day. Lindsey was kind enough to order some cheese quesadillas for the table, and after having a bite I decided to get a chicken quesadilla. It didn't take too long to come out, but it wasn't as crispy as the cheese one when it came out, in fact it was a little soggy :( Everything else's food looked good, and the restaurant is actually way bigger than I thought (there were two large groups in the back). It's not in my 'hood, but if I was in the area I may stop by for HH or try lunch or dinner again.
