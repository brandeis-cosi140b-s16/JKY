Sadly, in the past couple of months, this place has declined. Service is non-existent.  I have been sitting here in the bar for 10inutes after sitting in the dining room for 15 minutes with zero acknowledgement.  The youngish girl with long dark red hair and bangs is rude and inept. I am only sitti g here to write this, then leaving. Sad. It was my favorite.
