As for Mexican food it runs about a three star restaurant. The reason I gave it a 2 star it's because the wait staff had issues bring your order out. It's always nice to get your appetizer 10 minutes after you got your main course. I'm going to try and add a picture of how you use the salsa they give you. I have never used a flat plate to dump salsa on and try and scoop it up with multiple chips to make it work. I had the shredded beef burrito it tasted good nothing special about it whatsoever. The beans and rice actually tasted better than the burrito did. My wife had the chimichanga also shredded beef it was good. There's nothing spectacular whatsoever. I would also have to say this place is probably about 30 percent more expensive than it should be. I really don't think the value to the amount of food you get is there and we will not return because of that and the really horrible wait staff service we received.
