Chips and salsa are pretty taste and free. Service was just ok as there was only one poor guy trying to take care of about 10 of us. Also you cannot order happy hour in the dining room only at the bar and you cannot order it at the bar and bring it to your table. Boo!!! I may give them another try sometime soon.
