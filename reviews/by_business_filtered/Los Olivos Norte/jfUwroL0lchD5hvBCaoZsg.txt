Why does it seem like there is an inverse relationship with the size and quality of restaurants? Unfortunately for Los Olivos, this means that although they are a super-sized restaurant (I think my whole neighborhood would fit in here for dinner), their service and food are lacking.

I was dining with a large group and our servers seemed overwhelmed and confused the entire time.  I asked for water. Twice. I left my meal STILL thirsty.  Isn't water one of those things that restaurants bring patrons no matter what?  I ordered a margarita with no salt.  Would've been delicious... except it was loaded up with a salty rim. Bleh.  My friend and I shared the Pollo Fundido, which was pretty standard.  No complaints about it, but nothing stood out either. 

Would I return? Nope.  There are SO many quality Mexican food restaurants in town that I will be choosing somewhere else next time!
