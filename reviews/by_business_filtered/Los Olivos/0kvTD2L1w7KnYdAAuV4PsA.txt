Quick and satisfying. Overall, it was ok but definitely not the best in the area. I went with a few friends on a Tuesday for drinks and tacos for taco Tuesday. Apparently there is no taco Tuesday but that was my friends fault not theirs. I had the fajitas and they were actually pretty solid. 

My girlfriend had a really bad experience though. She ordered nachos and frankly they were just bad. Dry chicken and bad cheese. Do. Not. Order. 

The services was pretty good. The lady that served us was very kind and she did take care of our requests. She waved some of the extra costs that are normally included to accommodate us. 

Overall it was a fine experience but I definitely would not end up here as my first choice.
