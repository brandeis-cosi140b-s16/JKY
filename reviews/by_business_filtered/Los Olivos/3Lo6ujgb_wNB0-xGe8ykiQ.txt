Took in some Los Olivos after a ballgame at Scottsdale Stadium.  We were referred there as "the best Mexican around." I sure hope not.

It actually wasn't bad - but hardly the best. The chicken in the taco was a little plain, and the enchilada sauce was "meh." The server was sweet, but didn't get my order straight (ordered a beef enchi, but got a chicken one).

Extra points for cool decor, excellent margaritas and a bomb fried ice cream dessert. 3.25 stars.
