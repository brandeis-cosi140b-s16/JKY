I had one dinner here a few months back and I enjoyed it. The service was great and the food was pretty good. It's not the best I've had and it wasn't mind-blowing, but it was still good, and I plan to go again soon. If I remember correctly I had the chicken enchiladas, (a benchmark I use for mexican/southwest restaurants). I'd definitely recommend it.
