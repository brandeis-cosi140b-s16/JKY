Not sure where all the 3+ star reviews are coming from on this one.   Tired Mexican place in Scottsdale, with very mediocre food.

We had a cheese crisp with chicken and a mexican salad.   Both were bland and you could easily make better Mexican food at home!

it was also weird that they serve their salsa in carafes and you have to pour it on a plate and try to scoop it up with their stale chips.   Have you ever heard of bowls people??
