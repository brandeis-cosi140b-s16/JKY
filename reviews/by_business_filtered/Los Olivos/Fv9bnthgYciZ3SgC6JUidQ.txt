Food was hot.  That was about it. The food was bland..  The margaritas were skunky. The service was slow.  It felt like the staff wanted to be anywhere else.  The overall appearance wasn't very clean.  Had to flag down waitress for drink refills.. Never got a chip refill.  Overall very disappointing for a place that use to be great.
