Our family has been coming to Los Olivos for as long as I've been alive. A true Scottsdale landmark. Their tamales are fresh made and delicious, and their chile relleno is among the best I've had. Despite its popularity, it still has the feel of a family run restaurant. On the down side, I feel their drinks are over-iced, and their fish tacos are not the best. I also don't care for the shredded beef they use, but maybe that's just because I'm used to ground beef. Check it out!
