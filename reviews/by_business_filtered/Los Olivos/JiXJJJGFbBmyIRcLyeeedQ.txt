Yuck.  I only went here because my manager was in town with me and says that he always goes here when he's in Scottsdale.  I'm honestly not sure why.  The food was mediocre at best.  I had enchiladas which were dry and gross, and no one else seemed to like their meals - except my manager who had tacos.  Maybe that is the thing to get?  I did really enjoy my margaritas (I may or may not have had almost a whole pitcher all by myself), but that was about it.
