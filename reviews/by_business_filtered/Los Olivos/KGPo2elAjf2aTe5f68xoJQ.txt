Yeah, it's in Scottsdale.  Yeah the menu is inconsistent.  I don't give a rat's ass. This place is the BOMB dot com.  Their shredded beef chimichanga is the best hangover cure ever.  (Props to my bro for pointing it out) and their Chile Relleno is awesome.  The atmosphere is cool and weird, it's right next to SMoCA and it's still family owned and operated.

Also, step off the salsa.  The salsa fresca in the little caraffe.. you know the one with piles of fresh tomatoes and cilantro and onions and peppers?  It rocks my world.  It's not the only salsa that makes my tongue do the Snoopy dance, but it's certainly one of them.

The service isn't always fabulous but it's never been bad.  I admit the first time I went here I wasn't overly impressed.  It turns out I ordered badly.  The trick to enjoying this place is to get one of the dishes they do well.  For me that's the shredded beef chimi, the chille relleno and cheese enchiladas in that order.
