Although it is not my favorite Mexican restaurant in the valley, Los Olivos is definitely my first choice for Mexican food in Old Town Scottsdale. The building itself has unique architecture (although it would be nice if they didn't need a sign that asks people not to climb on it) and according to the menu, a great deal of history. The location is also great, being in close proximity to Old Town Shopping and the Scottsdale Civic Center Mall. Further, the first time I went to Los Olivos, there was a mariachi band playing in the dining room.

What I am forgetting in this review... oh yes... food!

The meal starts with two varieties of salsa and a basket of warm tortilla chips. I was pleased to find that the hot salsa was actually hot. I've tried the enchiladas and the burro (which is definitely not a burrito) and while both were tasty, I didn't find either to be anything special. One thing that did stand out to me was the Mexican style rice served with both dishes. I can't think of any better way to describe it than to say they got it "right". I could go on about the number of franchised Mexican and southwestern restaurants I've been to that screw up this basic side.

The prices and portions are reasonable, although with a group of five, all wanting to pay with plastic, it was frustrating that they weren't willing to split the check (and there was a sign posted stating this).
