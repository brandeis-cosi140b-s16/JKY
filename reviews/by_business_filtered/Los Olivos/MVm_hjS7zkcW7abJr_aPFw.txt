We went here for mothers day with a group of 25 people, grandmas and all. My Shrimp chimichanga was amazing and the rice and beans were out of this world, cramped but honestly accommodating such a large party on short notice on a holiday makes up for it in my book. Will return, great mixed drinks as well. Wonderful service.
