This place is awesome - great food, comfortable ambiance and convenient location near Scottsdale's civic center (and old-town).  The  Margaritas were flavorful (not too strong) and the wait staff was super-friendly.  We ordered the nachos for the table and I tried a burrito along with some of a fish taco and some traditional beans.  Nothing super fancy on the menu - just wholesome, authentic Mexican food.  Be sure to check out the "blue room" when you enter into the dining rooms... neat architecture!
