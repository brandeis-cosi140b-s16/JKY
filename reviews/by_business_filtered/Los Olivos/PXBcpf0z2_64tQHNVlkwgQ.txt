My mom and I came here on the recommendation of our hotel desk agent and we were very pleased! We had tacos, tostadas, and enchiladas, and of course, a beer and margarita! Everything was authentic, fresh, and nailed the Mexican craving we were having. We are visiting from out of town but we have already planned to stop here when we return to Scottsdale next year. The layout and decor are so unique and charming. It was a great experience, and the staff was so gracious!
