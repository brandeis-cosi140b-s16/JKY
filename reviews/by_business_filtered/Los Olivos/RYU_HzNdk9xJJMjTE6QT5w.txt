We ate here on Cinco De Mayo. It was packed but we still had good service and didn't have to wait for a table. We were seated next to the fish tank which was great because it kept my 2 year old daughter fascinated. The decor is very interesting and there are plants and neat windows that give you the sensation of being in an underwater cafe.

The chips were yummy. We polished off like 3 baskets of them. The salsa was okay and yes it came in a carafe and we had to ask for bowls. Not quite sure how to fit my chip in a carafe.

I ordered the frozen strawberry margarita with no booze. It was okay but I've had better. My daughter liked it.
I ordered a chicken chimichanga because the guy at the table next to me was eating a shrimp one, and his looked PHENOMENAL. Mine was okay but after I got it I wished I ordered the same one the other guy had.

My husband ordered a carnitas burro. It was, literally, meat in a tortilla. There was nothing else in it. No cheese, no tomatoes. Just meat. And it was completely dry. He wasn't thrilled. 

We got a cheese quesadilla for our daughter, and that was good. 

We would eat there again because it's better than the other Mexican places we have tried around here (hard to believe I can't find a decent one when we are so close to Mexico!) but my husband said he would order something different.
