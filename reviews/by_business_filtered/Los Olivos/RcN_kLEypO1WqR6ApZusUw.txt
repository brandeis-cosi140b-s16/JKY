It starts with the chips and salsa which the chips are bland, the salsa is liquedy and tasteless.  The margaritas are good but small and pricey.  I ordered the carna asada and enchilada.  The carna asada was quite good, the enchilada was non-existent.  I think they just gave me the shell of it and was buried under I guess what was beans and rice with cheese.  The plates are gross looking.  Wasn't worth 15.95 that's for sure.  I think this place takes advantage of people, nothing special and not worth the money for the poor quality of food.
