my go-to mexican place!

i've been eating here for years and i love this restaurant.  it could probably use a bit of a makeover, but the food is authentic, fresh and delicious.

i probably eat here once or twice a month and i've never been disappointed.  they have a pretty huge menu, so there's lots of options for everyone.  they have some of the best chips and salsa in the valley-i always order an extra pint when i get takeout because it's really that good. the salsa has tons of fresh veggies and jalape√±os diced up, so it's super tasty with the perfect amount of spice.

some of my favorite things on the menu are the cheese crisp with green chile, the mexican flag (3 enchiladas-1 beef with red sauce, 1 cheese with sour cream, 1 cheese with green chili pepper), and their beef chimi.  their tamales and tacos are great too! 

oh and if you're feeling lazy, you can get their food delivered from delicious deliveries!
