It 's sad. But as other reviewers have shared, this place has gone down hill in all ways. Rude staff, slower than molasses service, DIRTY, sloppy, unappealing food (that is expensive), margaritas that taste like some tangy, sour tasting kool-aid-- and if you are unlucky enough to be seated in what I call the "after thought" corridor, you will nearly suffocate from the lack of circulation and heat (the narrow little seating area off the main dining area). I was EMBARRASSED after having taken out of town visitors to this place. I used to always rely on this place for decent food & experience.  What a shame it is to watch what used to be a valley destination go to complete waste.
