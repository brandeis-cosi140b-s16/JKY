I wish i liked this place more because I love Mexican food, it's in a great location and it's huge. However, I think the food is pretty bland. There are so many good Mexican restaurants in Phoenix and I just don't think this measures up. I am a big fan of fish tacos and the ones here are just meh. Also, the last time we went someone ordered the queso with chorizo and everyone's stomach was hurting for a good 24 hrs after. I also think it's a bit overpriced.
