I don't know how long Los Olivos has been around, but by the looks of it, it seems like a pretty long time! Old Town doesn't have many old-style Mexican food restaurants with a classic atmosphere like Los Olivos. For this reason, Los Olivos gets four stores in my book. 

Los Olivos reminds me of Mexican food restaurants I used to visit as a child. They have fiesta-themed decorations, plenty of decorated tile, an adobe mission style atmosphere and good food and drinks. Yes, there is better food in the Valley...much better in fact. However, Los Olivos is a good choice if you want to have a casual dinner in a festively-themed atmosphere that serve margaritas in pitchers! 

For food, I eat the same type of Mexican food everywhere I go, and the same goes for Los Olivos. I like their guacamole, quesadillas, chile rellenaos and chicken burritos. As for the margaritas, they are classic margaritas that go down smoothly. Again, this restaurant gets the stars mostly for a festive atmosphere and decent cuisine and cocktails to accompany it.
