I like Los Olivos and regardless of their server issues I am understanding because they hire long-term staff and often family members. Some of the oddest server moments I've had are here, but I simply cannot give them a bad review for that because I keep coming back for the food. Their salsa is delicious, margaritas are perfect, and their cheese crisp was a part of my diet for a long time before I moved away from eating so much cheese...

One thing I will mention (especially if you are vegan), they use cottage cheese in their guac. I don't think that's right, it's clearly a cheap filler ingredient. Make sure to ask for it regular and they'll make it for you. That response was what got them four stars instead of anything less :)
