I enjoyed the rice and beans, both very tasty. The decor was a trip. 

The chicken tacos though...hmm. They were alright but I wasn't expecting there to be fried chicken inside. I was really hoping for it to come shredded. I wished it said that on the menu because I wouldn't have ordered it. 

I'd definitely go back if I was in the area, and just get something other than the chicken.
