Quaint little Mexican place in Old Town Scottsdale. 

I kept hearing good things about Los Olivos, so we came out here on a whim in July. 

The inside was pretty neat, different themes for each room. 

Our server seemed to be agitated with our presence, but was nice enough to bring us waters from the get go.

She even rushed us to order, umm whoa, simmer down, lady. 

Cadillac Margarita will rock your world. Not bad for $8. 

The salsas were lacking spice, and quite watery. 

Dude had the Sonoran Enchilada, which was almost as good as his Nanas! So good. Wish I had ordered that, as I got a chili relleno, and should have known better. It was meh, eggy and runny. 

We each had a green corn tamale, and those weren't horrible but not good either. 

Pretty bummed after hearing such great things about Los Olivos from friends, but will have to give them at least one more try and perhaps update this review.
