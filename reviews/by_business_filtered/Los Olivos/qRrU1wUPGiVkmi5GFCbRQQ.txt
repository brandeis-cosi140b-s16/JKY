A poor example of Mexican food in Phoenix. The food was mediocre, the service terrible, and the prices far too high for this lack of quality. We ordered a pitcher of margaritas and were disappointed there as well. The margaritas lacked any real taste and we were charged $35 for the pitcher (price not listed on the menu). When we tried to voice our concerns to the manager, we were told too bad, that's the way it is. This place is just a tourist trap in Old Town Scottsdale.
