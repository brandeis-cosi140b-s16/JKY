This place was good... service friendly and very prompt.

Reminds me of La Pinata in the SF bay area..

Salsas were really good. They put the salsa in little bottles, so it's really really hard to eat it. And, a lot goes to waste because it's hard to scoop it off of a flat plate. That was kinda weird, but the flavors were spot on.

Started with a sampler plate- all chicken items= chimichanga, mini tacos, flautas... chicken meat was all white, and very fresh, and cooked really well. The guac on the plate was outstanding!  Really good flavors..especially when the salsa was added to the items.

Sis had chicken enchiladas, said they were outstanding. The enchilada sauce had a nice red pepper flavor. Not spicy at all- just a wonderful deep flavor.

I had a 3 item plate- beef taco, cheese enchilada and pork tamale. The tamale was soft and creamy and cooked perfectly. The taco was delicious- the beef was shredded and really tasty. The cheese enchilada was BIG! Not the normal skinny thing that you get at some places. Everything was fresh and really good.

I should have tried something else that my regulars. I'm not from the area- but if I'm ever back, I'd order the pollo ala crema... sounded great.
