My family and I have been going here for the past 20 years and they NEVER lose their quality. My favorite is the Chicken Enchiladas with red sauce. It is so authentic and delicious- I have not been able to find these kinds of enchiladas anywhere else. 

My parents usually get the chicken chimi enchilada style, and think it is the greatest thing on their menu. I would opt for the chicken enchiladas. Remember Mexican food is heavy, so go with a good appetite. Portions are quite large, too.

Setting is very old-but has been family operated forever. 
Great to go casually or to enjoy some real mexican food!!
