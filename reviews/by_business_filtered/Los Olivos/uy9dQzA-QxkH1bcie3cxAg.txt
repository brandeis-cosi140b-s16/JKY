I ate at this restaurant often back 12 years ago. Then once I got a cold cheese enchilada back around 2004. I decided to give this place a huge break. It was 7 years total! I ate here on August 5, 2011 for lunch with a friend. The place has not changed except for they did remodel the bathrooms. The bar and entire restaurant is still the same. I had a green chile tamale and tried a cheese enchilada again. My enchilada was very hot inside not cold and the green corn tamale was pretty good as well. The reason why I gave them only 3 stars instead of 4 or 5 is because the staff is not friendly at all. It was almost like they were bothered that they had to work. If the staff was friendly and not bordering rude they would of earned 4 stars.
