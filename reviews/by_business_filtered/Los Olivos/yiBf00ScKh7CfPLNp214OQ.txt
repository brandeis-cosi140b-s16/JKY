Hands down best mexican restaurant in town! Great atmosphere and amazing food.
Service could be better but what restaurants service is good?
Relatively cheap. Last time there was 5 of us with multiple drinks with our meals and it only came out to $120.
I'd recommend taking outbid towners here or a date.
