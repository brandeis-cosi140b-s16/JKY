We went here for my father's birthday. I really want to like this place. It was one of our favorite places when we moved to the area in 2003. Sadly, the overall ambiance and quality has gone downhill.

THE GOOD - The salsas were all very good and very fresh. Our waitress, Toni, was really wonderful. She has been there for decades, and her husband is part of the Corral family that owns the place. My wife got the chimichanga and she enjoyed it, although she didn't care much for the rice. My mom liked her chicken quesadilla. My dad got a fried ice cream for his birthday, that was also good. The excellent service and welcoming disposition deserved and got a 20% tip.

THE BAD - There was a hair in my salsa. The salsa itself was great, but the hair was a bummer. I ordered the fish tacos, and when they came, the fish smell was as fragrant as the funkiest clambake. Now I love sushi, and I have a couple of pounds of ceviche in my fridge. I made my peace with fish. But when it smells, well, I can't eat it. The texture was tough to the fork, too. I was sad, but I had to send it back. I dislike being a pain and sending stuff back. I was once a waiter, too, and I never want to be THAT customer to my wait staff. I ended up having a vegetarian burrito that was okay, but inside was a 1-inch-long woody stem. I usually love rice, but the rice here seemed overcooked, dry and with an oily aftertaste. It was likely in hot holding for quite some time.

In conclusion, this used to be a beautiful place. It still is, but it has been neglected. A little paint would go a long way. Some dishes could use a little more care. In spite of the variability with the food, the service was good, and I would love to see Los Olivos back to its former glory.
