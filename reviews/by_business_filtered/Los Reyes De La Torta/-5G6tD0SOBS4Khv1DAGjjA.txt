I have been to this place many, many, many time. 

It never disappoints. 

I am purely in love with their tortas and even though their are bit out of my way I do not mind driving when I crave torta. 

Service is also great and I love laid back atmosphere. 

Food is super filing and super delicious. 

When you have your cheating day and want something filling and greasy but yet so good, please go and check them out. 

. Muchas Gracias Los Reyes crew!!!!!
