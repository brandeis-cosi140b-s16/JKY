I was excited to try out this new restaurant since I saw the signs go up a few weeks ago.  I've heard such good things from the other locations and saw them on man vs food.  Unfortunately like a lot of other reviewers I found the service to be sub par.  The waitress did not know many very basic questions about the menu.  I'm OK with a learning curve with this being a new restaurant but everything I asked she had to go ask someone else about.  It didn't seem she knew much about the menu.  I also felt their was a language gap as her English phrasing came across harsh and rude.  If I knew Spanish I feel the entire experience might have been better.  The food came in a reasonable amount of time and everyone enjoyed their meal.  The price was very reasonable.  Overall my only complaint was the service but I'll give them some time to iron out the service and I will come back again.
