This place was packed on a holiday Monday at 2pm!! Had a short 10 min wait. Ordered pi√±a agua fresca to share.. Awesome! Had the shrimp app with the absolute best tasting ceviche I have ever had!! We ordered the beef king tacos and huaraches. Alot of awesome food!! 
Friendly atmosphere.. Mexican music... Best bang for the buck!! Can't wait to bring my parents! 
Autentico!!
