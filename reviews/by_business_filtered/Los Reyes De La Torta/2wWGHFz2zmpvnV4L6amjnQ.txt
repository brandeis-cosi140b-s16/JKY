I'm starting to have some withdrawal syndrome of true authentic Mexican food.

Since I saw on Man vs Food los Reyes de la Torta and I drive by at least 3 days a week, I decided to give it a try.

I got by fix to-go so I don't know about the dine-in experience, although while I was waiting the air got a little thick from the cooking.

I tried the Hawaiian torta, the pambazo and the milanesa (breaded steak).

The Hawaiian was pretty good although the pork element was a little overwhelming. A little off from the Mexican pierna.

The pambazo was too moist and the "papas con chorizo" got lost in the other (mediocre) flavors. I would like a kick of chorizo flavor with cubed potatoes, less salsa in the bun, and less lettuce. This was disappointing for me.

The best part, the milanesa torta. It, on its own gets the 4 stars for this place. Tasteful, nice portion (could feed 2 or 3), ripe avocado, jalapenos, nothing not to love of this torta.

It's good to have something from the Mexican kitchen that it's not tacos!
