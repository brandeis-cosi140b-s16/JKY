I've been here twice and have throughly enjoyed my experience. The restaurant is clean and staff is very friendly. They serve you chips and salsa while you wait for your food, but our meals were ready within 10 minutes! The portion size was also  very generous.The food was tasty and the staff always checked to make sure we were happy and our drinks were filled. My only wish is that they served alcoholic beverages. I will definitely be back!
