No french fries: strike one
Waitresses are pretty but really slow; not rude but indifferent.
They decided to clean the floor around us with a huge amount of bleach: gross fumes :(
My torta de pierna was delicious but not so much so that it makes me want to come back.
Sorry. I just had a bad enough experience to not want to come back.
