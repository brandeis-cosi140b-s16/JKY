Yum, Yum, Yum!  Like everyone else I came here because of man vs. food and the great ratings on yelp.  This place is for sure a "hole-in-the-wall" joint, but at the end of the day what matters is the food.  I found the food to be extremely unique with fatty ingredients, but surprisingly not "fatty" tasting.  In all reality these sandwiches are HUGE.  I personally ate half of a half of the famous torta and some chicken quesadilla and I was done until the morning.  The aqua fresca was also right on point.  I had the pina one and it was delicious.  

To sum it up, I really liked this place.  I plan on going back to try some of the great looking mexican food they have.  We didn't have to wait and the service was just fine.  Give this place a try... it is worth it for the experience alone, but the food doesn't hurt - that's for sure.
