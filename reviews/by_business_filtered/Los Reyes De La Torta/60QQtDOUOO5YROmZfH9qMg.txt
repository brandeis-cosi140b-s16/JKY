they started off with chips and 3 different types of salsas, each 1 better than the next, the shrimp ceviche was to die for! I had never had a torta until now and I can't believe I've missed out this place the 8 years I've lived in phoenix... I left this place wanting more. we had the carne asada taco and the steak norteno torta w chipotle mayo grilled onions avacado and tomato! we left this place full as can bee and for cheap! safe to say we will be back!
