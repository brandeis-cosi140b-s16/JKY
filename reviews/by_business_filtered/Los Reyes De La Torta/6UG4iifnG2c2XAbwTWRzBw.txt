We love taking friends and family here when they visit Phoenix, as you simply don't come across gems like this on the East coast. They're known for their tortas, which are simply phenomenal, but they also have great options for breakfast. They don't have a liquor license, so there's no margaritas to pair with your massive sandwiches, but they do have a wide variety of fresh juice options. This place is super authentic and the staff is very friendly and quick to bring your food and top off your drinks.
