I was very excited to try this place since it seemed to have good reviews, I was starving, and it was close. 

It took ten minutes to park at the other end of the trashed out strip mall it's located in, and I seriously felt like I might be robbed by the locals I had to walk through to get to the place. It was packed when I walked in, and I asked if I could get a sandwich to go. The trashy looking hostess rolled her eyes at me and said they were filming right now and not making anything. There were a ton of people there for lunch, and people walked in behind me and were seated. The hostess smiled at me and said "sor-ry" in a sing songy rudeness I seriously couldn't even believe. I just looked at her, and left.

It's really sad how hostile the place was, and how rudely the staff behaved. So much for a great sandwich. I will stick to 13 north, where the service and food are good, and I don't have to wade through garbage to get there.
