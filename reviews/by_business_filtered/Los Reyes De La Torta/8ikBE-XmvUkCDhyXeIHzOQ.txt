This place has awesome food and low prices. I eat there at the very least monthly. Everyone I have taken ends up being a repeat customer.
Know for their Tortas but everything I've tried is fresh and full of flavor. Try the Shrimp plate! The Burritos are huge, the quesadillas are so big I can't finish them. My favorite is the Chorizo Quesadilla. 
The rice has a flavor all its own and not heavy like most rice
