Rad food. Only gripe is that the spice level is Midwestern mild. Aside from the tiny bottle of chile pequin hot sauce, there was hardly any spice to anything. That was great for the toddler in tow, because she could eat it all, and even slurped full spoonfuls of their salsa (which was odd). 

Norteno de res torta is my favorite packed with steak and avocado. Chorizo is really well flavored too (and not at all spicy). But the quesadilla maiz en estilo del rey is the way to go! Gigantic homemade corn tortilla folded over melty cheese and your choice of filling, topped with cotija and crema and cilantro. So tasty. 

I've tried their namesake torta del rey before, and only recommend it if you are getting the sandwich to go because that monster is unwieldy (unless you can unhinge your jaw like a snake) and will fall apart despite your best intentions. But then it turns into a sampler platter of every meat they offer? Anyway, at least at home your glutton ways are masked from sight, and you can get as bad as you wanna be on that behemoth torta. 

Aguas are good too. Watermelon for life.
