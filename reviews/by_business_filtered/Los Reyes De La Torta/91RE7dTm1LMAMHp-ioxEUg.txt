To start, we were served some complementary chips and salsa but the chips to salty... The horchata I order I returned it because it was just not right, it tasted just like whole milk( it's supposed to be rice milk!!) .... We order the quesadilla and a torta the food is def overpriced and it is missing a lot of flavor, the charge you extra for everything like more salsa or even limes!! .... But I should say that the waitress was very nice, so in conclusion the service was great but the food is not good
