I've been wanting to try this place out ever since I saw it on Man Vs. Food. I finally got around to it since it was close to my new doctor's office. I ordered the Torta Del Rey and a papaya cremosa. The torta was exactly what I envisioned,  layers of meat goodness. The papaya cremosa was what really surprised me. Most boba places I frequent use powdered papaya flavor, but with this I could actually taste/ feel the bits of fresh papaya they used. I haven't had a good papaya drink in years and this is definitely one of the best ones I've ever had. They also have an extensive menu with items like burros, tacos and ceviche.  And the restaurant is actually bigger than it looks from the outside. I can't wait to come back to try out the other items!
