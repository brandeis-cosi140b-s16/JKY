My sister is here from NY and she's on a Mexican food hunt. We went here and ordered a bistec burrito, king beef tacos, and a chicken quesadilla, and horchata. 

The food was delicious! It was so authentic and flavorful! The flavors of the grilled opinion and jalepenos meshed so well together for a tasty kick in the mouth! I'm super picky about guacamole and I loved theres. It was creamy with the right amount of flavor. The horchata was ok, it was a little too ricey for my liking, but I liked that it wasn't super sweet.  My sister was very happy! I can't wait to try their tortas! The food was definitely 5 stars for Mexican food.

The prices were great! We got all that for about $30.00.

The only reason they lost a star from me is because the girls up front are lacking personalities. They are very pretty but very unprofessional.
