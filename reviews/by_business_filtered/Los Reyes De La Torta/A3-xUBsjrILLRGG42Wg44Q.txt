Very good mexican place. Quite dive/hole in the wall, and the neighborhood isn't the best, but don't be intimidated. They truly have amazing, authentic mexican food. It is always clean when I go there, the food is fresh and portion size quite generous. I'd describe it is Mexico City food rather than street food. I appreciate the detail they put into their cooking including plates that are always garnished to perfection. Worth a trip
