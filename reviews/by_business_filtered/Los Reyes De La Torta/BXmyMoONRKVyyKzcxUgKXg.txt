My friend Megan and I stopped by before she flew back to Boston. We started off by ordering a couple of agua frescas. Mango for me and Strawberry for Megan. I usually get watermelon but I was in the mood to switch things up. I was looking forward to a cold refreshing drink but what I got was warm liquid mango. No bueno. I wasn't in the mood to complain so I just asked for a glass of water when I ordered the USA torta. The USA torta has breaded chicken, ham, pineapple, melted cheese, and chipotle mayo. The sandwich was so delicious I don't think I can get myself to order anything else ever again. Megan enjoyed her jamon torta but I don't think it was as good as mine! I really like this restaurant but the food is so filling and bad for you I can only eat here every once in awhile.
