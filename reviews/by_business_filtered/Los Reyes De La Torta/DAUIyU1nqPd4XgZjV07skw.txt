You want authentic mexican food? Say no more. Head over to this restaurant and your mexcan taste buds will be satisfied, no doubt. This place has been my favorite mexican food place for over 10 years and there is so much variety and flavor. 

I would recommend the Alambre de Camarones (Shrimp with beans and rice) or a Qusadilla estilo del Rey (really good quesadilla). The staff is friendly and I've never had a problem with the food. The owner is awesome too. He's friendly and REALLY likes to talk. Lol 

Anyway, definitely recommend this restaurant.
