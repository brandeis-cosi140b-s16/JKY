This is some artery clogging bowel busting goodness.
The big, juicy Amber Rose-esque torta del rey will make Yeezy jealous.  Meat, meat, and meat stacked up high.
Paired with a cantaloupe aqua de fresca and you have a winner.

I'd only hoped that the chorizo was cooked a little more to a crisp, but with all that stuff piled on it's hard to notice.  Also, it's a mexican joint, no?  How about some tortilla chips instead of ruffles, or am I missing something?  That's like eating my pho w/ spaghetti.

But it's cheap and service is good and worth a stop just to experience the Man v Food tour.
