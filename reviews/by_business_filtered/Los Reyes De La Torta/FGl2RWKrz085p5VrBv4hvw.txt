My boss took a few of us here on 07-15-10 because he saw it on Man vs. Food. We ordered their famous Del Rey Torta and this meal was huge and absolutely delicious! I was only able to consume half the sandwich, you can surely bring a friend to split the meal. I would definitely go back and order this again. They also give you a red and green salsa. The red one is great cuz its got some heat after you keep eating some. Their ceviche is wonderful too!

I also had their flan, but I wasn't a big fan of it. I make my own and mine is creamy and sweet. Theirs is...the opposite.

Our order of water took awhile. The one in the group that ordered Coke got their drink first, probably cuz they paid for their drink...joking. But I ended up requesting to get our waters then they brought it.

Overall, it was a great experience and I definitely need to stop for the Del Rey Torta again and bring some friends.
