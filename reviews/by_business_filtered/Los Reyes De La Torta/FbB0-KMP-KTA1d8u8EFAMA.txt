For what they advertise, they knock it out of the park with their Torta's.  I am sure there are places in Mexico that can rival them, but in the US I have yet to find a place that can rival the variety and fair prices of these tortas.  I ordered one of their new asada tortas served with salad and grilled peppers and freshly made salsa all was delicious.  The bread they use for the torta is really fresh and taste great.  love the avocados they use as well.  My wife ordered the first torta on the menu torta dela reyes filled with egg, chorizo, avocado, sausages, and pork slices.  Very filling torta for a great price, had left  overs for a filling breakfast the next morning.
