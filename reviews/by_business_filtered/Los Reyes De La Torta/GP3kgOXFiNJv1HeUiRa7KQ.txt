Come hungry.  Really hungry.   The fact that Adam of Man v. Food fame came here to eat should tell you something.  You can feed an entire family of four for like 20 bucks.  The tortas are loaded with protein and even come with lays ruffle potato chips.  They have ceviche tostadas and bebidas liquidos (mango is an all time fave) but you can get something that is healthier involving beets and vegetables which looks cool but tastes like sweetened v8.  It is super busy, happy families, hungry locals, a tv in the corner that is usually playing soccer or some variety show.  Old School Phoenix.
