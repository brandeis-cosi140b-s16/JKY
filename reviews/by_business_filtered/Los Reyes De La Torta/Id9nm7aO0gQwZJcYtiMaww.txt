I read about Los Reyes on Yelp earlier this year and have really wanted to try it. My boyfriend and I went on Friday and we REALLY enjoyed it! I used to be obsessed with tortas when I lived down in Guadalajara, so I was especially excited. I ordered a torta with chopped steak, onions, peppers, cheese, beans, avocado and more. Delicious! I could only eat half (half is about the size of a burger). I also got an horchata - really refreshing after the spicy-ness of the peppers and hot sauce. 

My boyfriend got a steak torta and a Mandarin Soda. He LOVED it. He somehow managed to eat the whole thing! 

Definitely want to go back and try more of their food and fresh juices. Highly recommend Los Reyes!!!
