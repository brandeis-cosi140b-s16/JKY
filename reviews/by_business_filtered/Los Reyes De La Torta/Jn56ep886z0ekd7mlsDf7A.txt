I've been here so many times I've lost count.  I love this place.  I have many friends that feel the same way so there's never a shortage of people that want to go here with me.  My only problem is that their closest location to me is 20 minutes from my house; I wish they'd open one closer.  I need them to open one near Tatum and Thunderbird; it would be a raving success.

I've had many of their sandwiches (Tortas), plates (Platillos) and Quesadillas.  I've never had one bad meal.  My friends frequently order their Burros, although I've yet to try them because there's so many other things I want to try.  Perhaps my favorite time to go is for breakfast.  All their breakfast items are excellent but my favorite is their Huevos Rancheros, which is not like any Huevos I've ever had.

It gets very busy around lunch time so I try as best I can to avoid going there from noon until 1:00 pm because there is always a wait.  

Their service is wonderful.  Even when they are busy the food comes out fast.  There servers are always rushing around but they take care of the customers and this place is like a well-oiled machine.

Adam Richman ("Man vs. Food") did a segment on his TV show here several years ago.  If you haven't seen it, go to their website and it is available to view.

This is a unique, different and wonderful Mexican restaurant.  Don't expect the typical.
