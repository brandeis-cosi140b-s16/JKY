We arrived at Los Reyes and was promptly seated. After about ten minutes the waitress came to take our order. We ordered one piña colada and two margaritas. Come to find they were non alcoholic, which was not apparent when ordering from the menu. The food was así así and service was mediocre at best. Will not be returning.
