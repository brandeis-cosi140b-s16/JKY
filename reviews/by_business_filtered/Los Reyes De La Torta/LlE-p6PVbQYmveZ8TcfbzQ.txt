OMG!!! This place is SO good! I got the Torta Nortena Steak, my wife got one of the Quesadillas (Which was the largest one I have ever seen) This food is just so freaking awesome! The tortas I believe are made fresh every day and maybe even there. Light and delicious, the toppings on the Tortas are so simple yet so yummy. 

This is a warning people!!! If you go, you will be addicted and you WILL go back over and over!!! If you go on a weekend, plan on waiting as it gets very crowded. Take out here as well. 

YUMMY!!!!!!
