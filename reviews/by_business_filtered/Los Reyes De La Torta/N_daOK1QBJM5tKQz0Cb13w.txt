This place is AMAZING. My husband and I ordered the Hawaiian torta and I ordered horchata and we both LOVED it all. The tortas are pretty large, and I'm glad we read that they were a sharable size, since we weren't all that hungry. 
Wish so much we had tortas like this one in Colorado.. will definitely be going back when we get back to Phoenix!
