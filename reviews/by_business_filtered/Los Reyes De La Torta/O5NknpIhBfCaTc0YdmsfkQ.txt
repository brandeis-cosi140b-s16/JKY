Perfect example of a great restaurant that lives in a crappy place. From the outside one might be scared to go in... it's in Sunnyslope for cripes sake! The tortas, and aguas frescas are both incredible. They blow a lot of other "torta" restaurants I've been to out of the water. The atmosphere is pretty bare bones, but they have done a nice job of making it feel welcoming and festive. There are always lots of kids there and lots going on, so be ready for a non-relaxing meal, but a very delicious one at that. The portions are enormous, and most people would be able to split one sandwich. Just watch your back around the area.
