Food here ranges from the delicious to the absurd.  If it reads like a gimmick, it probably is so be warned.  On my most recent trip I tried the del Rey - my goodness, what a heaping pile of meat.  There was egg, pork, cheese, ham, chorizo, some kind of hot dog, avocado and who knows what else.  I dumped their salsa on top (delicious!) and experienced pleasure through about half the sandwich, then very quickly reached a threshold and now I probably won't be able to eat a torta or any kind of processed meat for about a month without curling up into ball and sobbing.  In past trips I've chosen smaller, less ambitious items and made it through the visit purely in the pleasure zone.

Outside of the entr√©es, another reason we come here is the aquas frescas -  again, a bit gimmicky in that they are humongous, super sweet and come decked out with garnishes and umbrellas and such.  But they are quite delicious and great to share -- only problem is the wife always orders the regular, and I prefer them with sweetened condensed milk...
