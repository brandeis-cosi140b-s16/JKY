I won't lie .... I saw this restaurant featured on Man vs Food and had absolutely ZERO desire to eat here.  The sight of the food did not look appetizing to me.  OMG was I wrong! I went here to celebrate a co-worker's promotion and I absolutely raved about it for the rest of the day.  I had the Alambre de pollo Torta and I couldn't have been happier.  First off, the torta is massive. The only reason I got as close as I did to finishing it was because it was so amazing, I couldn't put it down.  Second off, well, it's amazing.  The only downside is that it gets crowded easily because it's still a pretty small place and because we went at lunch, it took an awfully long time to get our food ---- granted, we were a party of 8 so I'm not surprised.  I would definitely go again and would DEFINITELY recommend it to someone who's hungry!!
