I have been coming to Los Reyes de la Torta for a couple of years with my coworkers for lunch and I have enjoyed every meal.  Their menu is huge with many different variations of burritos, quesadillas, tacos and much more.

I typically get a burrito that comes with steak, jalape√±os, beans, onions and I ask for no avocado or cilantro. They have always been flavorful, hot, fresh and a bit spicy.

My co-workers get the quesadillas, other burritos and taco and they have always enjoyed their food.

They are always on point with flavor, consistency, service and even during lunch you can find a table or two.

I look forward to next time.
