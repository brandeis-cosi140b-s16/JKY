There was a time when I would have thought the Del Rey Torta was a fantastic conglomeration of meat. I must be getting old or something because the sandwich seemed like an obnoxious amalgamation of low quality meats. I had my fair share of overeating just to say I did; I legitimately felt like I'd be sick if I ate this whole thing. Were I visit again, I'd probably get a "normal" torta and be good with that.

P.S. - The watermelon aqua fresca was fantastic.
