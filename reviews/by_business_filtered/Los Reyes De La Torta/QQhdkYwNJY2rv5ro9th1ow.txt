The food was decent, nothing spectacular about the food. I had a corn tortilla chicken quesadilla, it had the right amount of spice and flavor. I also got the Watermelon Aqua Fresca it was refreshing in the 100 plus  weather. 

The service was why I gave the restaurant three stars. We had seven people in our group. We all ordered aqua Fresca's and it took over 10 minutes to get drinks to the table.  I never got the water I requested.  The food took a while as well and the waitress didn't really stop by to see if we needed anything else.
