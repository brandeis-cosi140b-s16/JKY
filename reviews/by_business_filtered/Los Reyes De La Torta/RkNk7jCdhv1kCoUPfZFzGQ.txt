Came here and was not disappointed.  The wait was a little long but the torta was delicious.  I had tried a couple of different tortas but they just do not compare.  I do not know if it is the ingredients, the chefs, or the combinations they have, but there tortas put all the rest to shame.  It is a good things I do not live in Phoenix or I would gain about 50lbs on these tortas alone.  Anytime I am within an hour drive of this place I will have to stop to get maybe one, two, or even three tortas just to satiate my craving.
