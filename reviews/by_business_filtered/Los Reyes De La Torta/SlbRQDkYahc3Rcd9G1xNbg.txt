I went here with my dad for lunch a few days ago and it was seriously tasty. We split the torta nortena with chicken and the chicken ranchera torta and both were delicious. My only complaint was the nortena's bottom half of the bread was soaked through so I had to eat it with a knife and fork, but the flavor was spicy and delicious. The ranchera was even better, it had a lot of flavor for being a more simple sandwich. I would definitely come back here again....
