Really good - Really HUGE sandwiches!! I'm a big dude and I couldn't finish it all! Very good selection, servers were nice too - the only negative was they push these giant margaritas that are pretty pricey yet, no booze! It's in no way a deal breaker but our server did not mention it - we had to ask...

Stop in - you will enjoy it!
