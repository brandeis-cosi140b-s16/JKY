Great torta nortena. My gf told me about the place, as she saw it on man v food as well.  I was in that area and decided to stop.  The nortena has steak, chipotle mayo, cheese, avocado, grilled onion and don't know what else.

The bread was really good. Nice and soft, perfectly toasted. I love sandwiches, but not the panera type places.  My dream sandwich is a Cuban sandwich in a puerto rican bakery.  But, this torta sure gives that a run for its money.  I'll be frequenting this place. Probably the best, most authentic Mexican place I've been here in Phoenix.
