We have been here twice now and had the same experience. Great food and friendly staff but to get something to drink takes a really long time. We were seated, ordered and got our food before we even got our drinks. We also asked for water and never got it. Also napkins seem to be very scarce here and you really need them. If you don't mind slow service and want great authentic Mexican food then I would recommend this place.
