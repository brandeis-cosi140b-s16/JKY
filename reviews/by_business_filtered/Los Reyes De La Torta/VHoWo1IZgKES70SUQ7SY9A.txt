SO I have read all of the other great reviews and really wanted to go to this restaurant. Maybe I just don't get it. I mean, I have never had a torte, so I didn't know what to expect and the staff was not very helpful. My husband, sister, and I were seated immediately. They both ordered margaritas, but when they found out there was no liquor involved, they decided against a $6 juice. I didn't blame them! We started off with the queso---not what we expected, in a good way! The cheese is actually melted, but not soupy, and is not served with tortilla chips, but, instead, a tortilla. When I asked for chips, the waitress looked at me like I was a complete idiot and told me they didn't have them. Was this something I should have known? I guess. Next, our entrees arrived. I wimped out and ordered a chicken burrito. My husband ordered the breaded beef torta, and my sister, a shrimp quesadilla. Again, I am not sure what breaded beef is supposed to taste like, but I tasted my husband's torta, and the beef was dry and not flavorful. The sandwich is huge, so I guess that is a plus. My burrito was good. My sister's quesadilla was HUGE and  filled with rice and lettuce--unexpected. 
Overall, not bad, but not great. The food is super inexpensive. I felt like there was some insider information we were not privy to. The menu does not describe the meals very well, and the waitress seemed to be annoyed that we didn't know what we are doing. Maybe we are just used to more Tex/Mex food.
