Very crowded on a weekday lunch and I can see why! Largest quesadillas I have ever seen.  Loved the corn tortillas. The burrito in enchilada sauce was also good but smaller than the quesadilla! I ate half of the del rey torta and it was good but the chips that accompany are boring. The tres leches could also be better. Next time I want to try one of the fruity drinks.
