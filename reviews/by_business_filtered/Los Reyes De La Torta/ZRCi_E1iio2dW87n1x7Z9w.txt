Being from Oklahoma, I've had plenty of "Mexican" food. There's some amazing tex mex, but as far as authentic Mexican places and taquerias go, it's like you have to know a guy who knows a guy. It's not always easy to find a good one.

Searching for Mexican on Yelp while here from out of town, I see Los Reyes De La Torta is near the top of the list. One look at the menu prices and the photos of the Torta Del Rey, and me and the lady knew we had to check it out.

Of course we both got aguas frescas; I got the mango and she got the strawberry esquimos. Both were served in huge glasses with fresh fruit, hers was good enough she had to have a second.

I had to try the Torta Del Rey and see what all the fuss was about and it was worth it. It came packed with layer upon layer of delicious meat: some kind of breaded beef, pork, some scrambled eggs wrapped around hot dogs, cheese, avocado, and a bit of refried beans.. oh man. It was so good my lady stole half my plate! Not cool! 

I got her back by munching on her peluche, essentially a mix of the meats inside the Torta Del rey, but sautéed with onions, peppers, jalapeños and pineapple. Delicious, but we both agreed not as good as the torta. 

Altogether it was an extremely filling and tasty experience. There are really exciting and uniquely Mexican flavors in the food here, and Los Reyes De La Torta call themselves the kings for a reason. This place is special.
