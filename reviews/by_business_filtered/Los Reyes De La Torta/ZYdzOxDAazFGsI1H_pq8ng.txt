I am going to repeat the EXACT words used when I took my first bite of food.....Stupid Good.  Yes that is the best I could pull out my expansive vocabulary.  This is, quite literally the best Mexican food I have had in my life.   I mean, most of the patrons of this fine establishment are Hispanic.  I always say, if the patrons of a restaurant match the ethnicity of the cuisine, EAT THERE!  The last thing I want to see in an Asian or Mexican or Thai restaurant is all white folk!!

I have been here several times, and nothing is bad. Even their home made juices are amazing. I constantly find myself ordering the V8.  I also love the Chorizo Fundito and the Massa Quesadilla is SOOOO GOOOD!
