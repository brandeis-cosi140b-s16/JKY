I ordered a Torta Mexicana and three asada tacos to go with the anticipation it would the best kept secret. I have to say the Asada had no flavor. The bread was good with the torta all the ingredients are as fresh as your gonna get. The food smelt better than it tasted. It wasn't bad , but I don't think I would come back for more. I really don't get all the hype.
