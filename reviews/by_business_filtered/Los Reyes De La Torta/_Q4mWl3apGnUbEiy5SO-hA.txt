This was a tough review.  They advertise Mexico City cuisine, to me it was pretty much Sonoran. The food was very tasty, I had a torta where the bread was dipped in a guarillo sauce. The problem with it was that it was all bread with very little filling, but I still loved the flavors.  The place is pretty big with not much crowd. I hope they make it. They would probably have been better off in a smaller establishment.
