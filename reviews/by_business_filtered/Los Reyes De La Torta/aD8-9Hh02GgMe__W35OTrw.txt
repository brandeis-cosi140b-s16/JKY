Every time I drive by this place, I get a little thrill down my spine. MMMM! 
Where else can you go to experience a bit of heaven between two soft pieces of bread? 
I met Mr. Hottie and Foodie Bear for lunch one afternoon at Los Reyes. I will say that I'm not a HUGE fan of sandwiches, but when it's free, what the heck? I walked in to the strip mall establishment and was met by the aroma of grilled onions and meat! So far, so good! 
Once seated, I found my eyes wandering around the menu and wishing I could eat everything on it! 
After sipping on a delicious horchata, and pondering the menu, I decided on the Torta el Rey which means "torta that has everything but the kitchen sink in it" (loosely translated)! This AMAZING sammie came with breaded thin beef steak, ham, chorizo, fried egg, cheese, avocado, lettuce, tomato, and jalapeno! This is CERTAINLY not something you want to feed a family member who is at risk of kicking the bucket due to heart or kidney issues. Consider yourself warned. I will say that if you eat this sandwich, you are bound to fall in love with it. It's a dangerous, forbidden love, but a love you will cherish nonetheless. 
One of the issues I have with sandwiches is the bread. In previous experience, the tortas that I ate had terribly boring bread, or bread that was way too hard. Los Reyes' bread was yummy! It was grilled and and crusty, but not so crusty that you cut your mouth or it's too hard. The ingredients of the torta were all well made and delicious. Everything was HOT where it needed to be and cold and fresh where that needed to be! Perfecto! 
So why is that 5th star missing? I want to head back to try another torta to be sure of a 5 star rating! 
Looking forward to it!
