Come here, and you won't need to eat anything for the rest of the day. Seriously. I had my torta around 1 pm, it's 10 pm now, and I am not even close to hungry, 

This is the place you may have seen in the Food Netowork's "Man vs. Food." I didn't get the monstrosity of a torta featured on the show but instead opted for the El Rey, the first one on the menu. 

Whoah. This thing was HUGE. And stuffed with every imaginable sort of deliciousness, from breaded beef,  sausages and ham to fried egg, cheese, avocado and a delectable spicy chipotle mayo sauce. 

The perfect lunch for a 110-degree August day in Phoenix. OK, not really-- I felt like I was going to faint a couple of times. But I soldiered on, and was able to (almost) finish the whole thing with the help of copious amounts of ice water. 

Oh, it's also worth mentioning that whoever owns this place does not hire anything but the cutest Hispanic girls, all with their hair tied up in perky pony tails. 

And like most other cheap eateries in Phoenix, you can make it out the door for under 10 bucks and stuffed fuller than a Tokyo subway train. 

Can't wait to get back to the "Torta Kings!"
