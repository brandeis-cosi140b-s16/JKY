If there were only 5 Mexican Restaurants I could eat in Phoenix.  I would put Marisco's Playa Hermosa number 1, and Los Reyes prolly 4th or 5th.   This place is good.  They have a variety of Torta's and a others such as tacos, burritos, etc.  My girlfriend and I shared the Torta Del Rey and some other dish she ordered.  Overall pretty good, I would come back if I'm in the area.
