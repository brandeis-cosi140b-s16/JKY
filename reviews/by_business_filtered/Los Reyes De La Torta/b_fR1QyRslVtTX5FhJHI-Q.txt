Delicious! Waiting too long to try this place. I could've been spending my money on tortas here ALL THIS TIME!! I ordered a chicken torta and requested the tinga-style chicken. Freakin amazing, fresh and light choice for this hotter-than-hell Phoenix summer. I'll be returning soon to try other great priced, creative dishes here.
