5 stars all the way!  Heard about this place from Man v Food so I gotta try it out.  Got there on a sunday noon and the place was packed!  Decided that I didn't want to wait 30-50 minutes for table so we got it to go.  The famoud del ray torta lived up to its billing. It's probably the best one I've ever had and definitely the biggest.  Only wish I don't live so far away or I'll be a regular here.
