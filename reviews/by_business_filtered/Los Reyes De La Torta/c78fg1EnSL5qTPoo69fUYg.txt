I've heard a lot about this place so we decided to do the drive up to North Phoenix.   I walked in and the whole "Man vs Food" situation was posted everywhere.  I decided to order the claim to fame giant king cavalier torta. I ordered an agua de piña and it was great and when i asked for chips and salsa the server said they only had potato chips and no tortilla chips.............. (weird)........ Ok- so no chips LOL.  The torta arrived and it was HUGE!!! So I'm all excited about this giant Mexican sandwich but then I realized that I'm not going to be able to bite into it because it's so huge (that's what she said- I know) ok so I split the sandwich in half to only have one top portion half to start ingesting.  There is every animal inside of this thing. Literally.  Ham, pork chop, hot dog, shredded chicken, carne Asada, and fried chicken, and chicken fried steak ( I think?) ok so like the top half started out good but then I got grossed out with all the meat and then took off the fried chicken an chicken fried steak.  Then I threw off the hot dogs.  Then I just decided I was disgusted and just left it.  I honestly thought I was going to vomit on the way home because I just ingested who knows how many calories and didn't even find joy in it.  Oh- and our bill was $38.00 (the sandwich is $20 alone plus I got the agua de piña and a sprite.  I tried it at least? Bleh.
