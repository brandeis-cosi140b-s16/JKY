Whenever I have a craving for Mexican Food, this place satisfies.  Been eating here like 3-4 times in the last week.  The only downfall is that the food will slow you down for a few hours afterward but is worth it sometimes.  Dishes I love this week: plato de asada, beef burro (big burrito), lunch asada with rice and beans.  All fabulous!
