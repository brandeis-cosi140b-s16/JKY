I went to this place with a few friends of mine and they warned be ahead of the time that there may be a line. With that in mind, I left my house 20 minutes late.  By the time I got there, they were barely being seated.  The food was delicious.  The only problem was my waiter didn't speak English.  

The agua fresca was amazing!  Must try this place.
