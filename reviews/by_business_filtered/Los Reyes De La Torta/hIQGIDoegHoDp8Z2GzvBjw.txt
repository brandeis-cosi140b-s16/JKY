Yay!  I'm still a fan and I think this Torta is "As good as it Get's!! If your craving a really tasty torta, Mexican sammich, you can not beat Los Reyes De La Torta, aka the Mexican Sammich King!! 

The shrimp ceviche is DELISH!!  They have a super duper salads also for a great app or as a meal.  But it's the torta's that I come here for!!  Yes they have loads of other things on their menu you can choose from if your not a torta kinda person, but then I would ask; "why are you here?  Seriously?"  :-)

The Torta Del Rey is crazy tasy but ginormous!!  You better have a HUGE appetite or plan to share this with a friend.  They still throw everything on this bad boy but the kitchen sink : -)  I would also suggest their Ranchera de pollo o res with either grilled chicken or steak, guac, fresh cheese, chopped onion & cilantro & a chipotle dressing.  or their Nortena de pollo o res with either grilled chicken or steak, onions & jalapenos with chipotle sauce, melted cheese, refried beans, tomato, avocado.  

It's all good at Los Reyes De La Torta!!  I hope you give them a try if you haven't already!!  I'm looking forward to my next visit so I can try their new torta, King Carlos V.  It looks AWESOME!! I hope to see you there.
