I was really excited to try this place after seeing this restaurant on Man v. Food. I'm going to get down to the point. This place was totally not worth it. It took about an hour before we were able to order our food after being seated, My friend ordered a margarita and they failed to tell us that they did not have their liquor license yet and it was going to be a virgin margarita. I ordered their asada burrito with red sauce on top and it was horrible. There was barely any meat but a lot of fat and chewy pieces inside. I can honestly say that I've had a better asada burrito at Filiberto's. Our waiter was young but nice. I probably won't come back.
