I came here a while back with my boyfriend after us seeing it on Man v. Food. He had the Del Rey, but again he doesn't have a bottom to his stomach so it only put a dent in his appetite. I had the torta nortena, I have a semi-tolerance for spicy and this peaked over the edge for me but it was none the less great!

Just a few notes, when we came here on a Sunday night there was no line and parking wasn't bad but I can only imagine if you come at another time because the parking lot and the restaurant is small. And also there is another restaurant with this exact same name so make sure you're going to the right one!
