I will have to admit that because of the location and unfamiliarity of it, I was somewhat apprehensive about trying Los Reyes de la Torta. Now, I am so glad I did. This Mexico City style Mexican food was not only tasty but 1 Torta would have been more than two people with a good appetite could eat. I had the Torta Del Rey, filled with beef, pork, ham, chorizo, cheese, a fried egg, and then topped with avocado, beans, tomatoes, onions, and jalapeno. At first I thought it was an unusual combination but I was wrong, it was very flavorful. I will definitely have that again! 

The location is in a small strip mall and parking is limited. This is a great neighborhood restaurant and the price is more than reasonable!
