My husband and I are kind of Mexican food snobs -- he grew up in Mexico City and takes grave offense to any kind of bell peppers in his food, which was tough when we lived in Texas.  Because  we've been burned often by Mexican places filling cheese enchiladas with Velveeta and similar atrocities, it's a hard sell to get us to try new Mexican restaurants.  But Man vs. Food (plus several enthusiastic recommendations by our friends) won out, and we had to go to try Los Reyes.  It is amazing!  They have things on the menu I haven't even seen since the last time we visited Mexico City (like alambres) and an amazing selection of food at good prices.  My husband had the milanesa torta; milanesa is one of those foods you think should be easy to make but that can go terribly wrong.  His was perfect, and he had no complaints about anything. They also have an amazing collection of fresh fruit juices, including some of the more unusual mixes like the vampiro.  My sincronizada was terrific.  The service was great, too -- our waitress checked up on us several times, as did the other wait staff.  One word of caution:  the guacamole is really more like just flat out avocado.  It's not bad at all, but it wasn't what I was expecting.  Still, this place definitely exceeded my expectations and we'll absolutely be back!
