Came here for the tortas. Tried the Cuban torta, pollo tacos, pollo burrito, and ceviche tostadas. Oh can't forget the wonderful watermelon Aguas frescas. The Cuban torta was ham and cheese with Chinese BBQ pork, it was good. The burrito although small for a burrito was filled with pollo, salsa, avocados, and beans. This was pretty good except for the size, I would consider this not big enough for a meal. The pollo tacos were ok, simple enough.  But the star of the meal and unexpected winner, which in retrospect probably eclipsed the other meal components was the shrimp ceviche tostada, we got two large and they were incredible. Spicy and fresh and savory.  I could have had two of these and maybe a shrimp coctel. Well I'm assuming the shrimp coctel is wonderful also. Need to come back and try more sea food at this wonderful place.
