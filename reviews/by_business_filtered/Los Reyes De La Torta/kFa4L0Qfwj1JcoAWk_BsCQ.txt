Finally decided to check this spot out and they did not dissapoint! I got the Torta el Rey that basicaly had everything you could fit on a killer toasted talera roll. It had pork, hotdog, beef, ham, cheese, avocado, tomatoes and probably a few hundred other things. The sandwich was around $8 and WELL worth it. I can't wait to go back and try a more "normal " torta, but I"m alllll in
