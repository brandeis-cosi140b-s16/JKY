My grandma lives like 3 blocks away and i had no idea man vs. food had been here i know a lot of places are way too hyped up to be on the show but this one makes perfect sense. I was extremely shockingly surprised. 
I did not come in to sit down and get the full on experience but some day i can promise you i will be back again to get the amazing Del ray torta. Like the past review by JT M. I am kind of glad i do not live very close to my grandma otherwise that would make me gain an extra 15-20 lbs at least probably. 

Before i ordered i was seriously contemplating all these crazy items together in one sandwich trying to figure out if all these things would be good together. But i took the chance and am pleasantly happy with my decision and so is my boyfriend as well.  He would sneak bites when i brought it over to his friends and was like "theirs a hot dog in here!" i was like weird ya i know. But its all perfect together. I cannot wait to go back to try all the different agua frescas flavors. especially the horchata because that is my personal favorite. All i know at this time is the food is amazing and i cannot wait to go back.
