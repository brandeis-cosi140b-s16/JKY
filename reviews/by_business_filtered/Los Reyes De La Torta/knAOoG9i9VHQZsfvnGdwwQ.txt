Recently moved to the Slope and glad that Los Reyes reigns supreme here. The tortas (Mexican sandwiches) are huge, they are delicious, and they will, they will, rock you. But what else would you expect from Los Reyes de la Torta? What you might not know is that their non-torta items are at least as good. Whatever the cheese they use (a white cheese, cotija maybe?) is delicious, not like the cheese used typically at the more Americanized places (which are also good, not trying to knock those). And the aguas frescas are very tasty as well; it's like drinking fruit! This place lives up to the hype so go check it out, but be prepared to wait because it's usually busy even during the week.
