Holy shit my mouth is so happy. Tacos were excellent and authentic, not to mention loaded with meat and cheese. The aguas frescas watermelon was so good I swear I heard angels sing when I drank it. You should definitely go try it, all these reviews are no joke man this is the place to get down on some Mexican food
