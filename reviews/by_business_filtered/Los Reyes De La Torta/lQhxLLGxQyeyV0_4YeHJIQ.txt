What? I was so shocked by my experience here!! I feel like I was told that I won a new Audi R8 and went down to the dealership and was given a 1986 Club Car Golf Cart. Have my tastebuds died from all of my martini nights? Don't I know Mexican food? My foodie confidence has taken a massive hit. Do I start at Taco Bell and work my way back to the Big Leagues? Damn you Los Reyes!! I thought I should write down how I felt about my torta to start my process back. 

Dear Carne Asada, you were treated with such disrespect and were left without flavor and Mexican flare! I was so looking forward to meeting you and seeing why so many loved you. Carne Asada, you're like all those girls in SoCal with the fake boobs and lips. Such a disappointment to find out! The one saving grace you have is your roll, but that roll only hides what you lack inside. Empty and souless! 

Where do I go now? Where are the real Carne Asada's out there? Do I need to go south of the border? I know my perfect Carne Asada Torta is out there. Juicy, flavorful and every bit tasty! I'm going to keep looking, but I won't be fooled by Los Reyes again.
