The reviews are true, this place rocks in a big way. I've been wanting to try go here for months and finally found the time during a vacation day and was blown away by the food. Incredible flavors, piping hot as it just came off the grill, not from under a heat lamp. My wife and I both had the Torta Nortena, it was huge and delicious! Comes with your choice of chips or salad, get the salad! Fresh lettuce, radish, cucumbers, & a grill jalapeno and onion-mouth watering. The menu is huge and I can't wait to go back and try some of the other dishes. A friend that was with us got a platter and had to bring half of it home. The prices are very, very reasonable for what you get. I'll be taking all my out of town friends here. If they thought Chino Bandito was cool, wait until they get a taste of LRDLT!
