Ordered the Del Rey.  While it was good, I wish I would have spent a little more time studying the menu because I would have ordered something different.

But no would'a, should'a, could'as.  So what I ordered was ok, maybe even a little more than ok.  A few observations...

- A really biiiiggggg sandwich that comes out of the kitchen reeeeaaaallllllyyyy hot.  Almost too big and too hot to eat.
- The hot dogs (or whatever they were) seemed to be of sketchy provenance.  I pulled them off the sandwich.
- The avocado/guacamole on the sandwich was very good.
- The bread/roll doesn't hold up to the size and composition of the sandwich...I ended up eating with a knife and fork.  Not complaining...just commenting.
