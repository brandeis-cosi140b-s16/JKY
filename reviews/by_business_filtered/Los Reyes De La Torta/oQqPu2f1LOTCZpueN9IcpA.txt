2nd time here. The food is okay nothing really special and a bit over priced for the flavor.  1st time they took forever to take our order.  2nd we got it to go. Get home and they had given us the wrong order! Call to tell them and of course i do not want to drive 10miles just to go back an exchange it.  The manager wouldn't even offer a discount or a freakin apology!  Last time I go there. I wouldn't recommend this location. Unless you want crappy service.
