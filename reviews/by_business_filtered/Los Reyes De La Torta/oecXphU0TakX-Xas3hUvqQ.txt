After reading many rave reviews my girl and I decided to go there for an early dinner last night. We ordered a carne asada quesadilla as an appetizer to share. I am not exaggerating one bit when I say it was the greatest quesadilla she and I both have EVER had! I had an agua de limon to drink and it was amazing! We both had the Ranchera de Pollo Torta and it was pretty good in my opinion, she thought it was just ok. I cannot wait to go back and try more of their delicious food!
I have decided that besides the amazing quesadillas and good aguas frescas this place is just average.
