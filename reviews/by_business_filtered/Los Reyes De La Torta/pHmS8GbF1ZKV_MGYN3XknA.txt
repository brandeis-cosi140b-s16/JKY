Well, I don't think I'm "super cool" for liking this place, but I guess I am "totally down with the hole in the wall places in the hood." Just playing Samantha O. :)

Really though, I think Los Reyes de la Torta is fantastic! I went last week for the first time in about a year and I forgot how good it is. All I've had so far is the Torta Nortena (with the steak, not chicken) and the steak tacos. Both were incredible, especially the Torta Nortena, which has grilled steak, onion, jalapenos, melted cheese, chipotle, tomato, avocado, and chipotle mayo. It's huge and it's fucking awesome. 

I haven't had a burrito here yet, but after seeing what the patrons at the next table had, it's on my to-do list. The burritos were about the size of my forearm and looked delicious. Los Reyes de la Torta may be famous for their King Torta seen on Man Vs Food, but to be honest I'd never get that one. It has way too many kinds of meat and it's total overkill. But hey that's me, maybe you'll like it. Eat this sandwich in under 15 minutes and it's free.
