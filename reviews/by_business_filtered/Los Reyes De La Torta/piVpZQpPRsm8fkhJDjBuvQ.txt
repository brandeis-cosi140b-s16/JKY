Was wanting some Mexican food so did a Yelp search and found LRdlT.  Awesome!  We both had a torta; mine was the small version and was more than enough for me.  Hubby got the Cubano and enjoyed that as well.  The small torta is a good size and comes with small salad with radishes and cukes.  Whereas, the Cubano is just that, a sandwich.  The place was packed, service pleasant, food delish.  We'll be back.
