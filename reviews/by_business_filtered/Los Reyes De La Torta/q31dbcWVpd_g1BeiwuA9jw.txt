Went here with my job and also because it was on Man versus Food.

The food was good however I ate the carne asada torta and had a cantalope drink to wash it all down.

They have some sandwiches that are just plain disgusting looking but beauty is in the eye and mouth of the beholder.  My co-wroker had a sandwish with ham, ground beef, hot dogs, another type of meat, cheese.... you get the picture.  Not my cup o tea but apparently something he wanted.
