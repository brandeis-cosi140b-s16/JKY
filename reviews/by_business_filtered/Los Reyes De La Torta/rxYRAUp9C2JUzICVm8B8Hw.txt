I'm still a fan, just a disappointed fan.  Popped in for a refreshing watermelon juice.  This time it was for a juice take-away and I got to watch the bartender prepare it and I discovered to my horror that they add sugar to the juice!  I can't believe it, now I'm going to have to remember to say no sugar, no azucar.  I should have known it was too good to be true.  Okay, I'll stop whining.
