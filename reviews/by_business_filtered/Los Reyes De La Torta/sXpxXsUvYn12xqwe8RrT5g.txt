I quickly found a parking right in front of the restaurant. I could smell the food instantly. I walked in at noon and was seated immediately in the main room where the kitchen is. I noticed two additional rooms - one to the left that looked like more of a party room with a bar and one room to the right that had a big screen TV in it. The staff was very helpful. I ordered the 3 King Tacos for $8.99. You get your choice of chicken or steak, not both.  The meal is served with guacamole and rice or salad. The orange sauce they serve on the side is HOT!

Oh yeah, and the waitresses look half-decent, too, on top of their friendly service.
