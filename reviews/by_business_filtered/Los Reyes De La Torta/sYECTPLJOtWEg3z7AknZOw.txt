Oh yum, this place, as the other reviewers have raved is great.

Their definitely known for their tortas, but a great find in the pork loin tacos as well.  The server was a little surprised when they saw that I had ordered both those dishes.  I finished them both.

The Mexicana, carne asada torta, had fresh bread, good mix of avocados and sides making this a great mexican sandwich.  The carne asada was good.  The Pierna, pork loin tacos, were moist and just right.  Good amount of toppings and the salsa was a good addition to the street style tacos.

The aguas frescas, I had the papaya drink which was refreshing.
