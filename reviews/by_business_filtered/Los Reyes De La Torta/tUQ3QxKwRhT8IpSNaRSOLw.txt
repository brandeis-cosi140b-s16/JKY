After seeing it on Man vs. Food, I had to try this out for myself.  The atmosphere was pleasant, and the food was pretty good for the price, but there was nothing that really jumped out at me.

I had the Torta del Rey, which has a ridiculous amount of food inside: eggs, ham, pork, chorizo, beef, cheese, tomatoes, jalapenos, avocado, and onions (I skipped the refried beans).  And I'm pretty sure there was a plain boiled hot dog in there somewhere.  It's interesting to have all of those meats in the same bite, but none of them really were spectacular.  The best of the bunch was probably the breaded beef, so maybe a sandwich focused on that beef might be a little more memorable.

When I saw that they have potato chips instead of the more common tortilla chips, I figured they must be good.  I've had some excellent homemade chips at several places in town.  But unfortunately, these were just original Ruffles, complete with the preservatives and grease.

For the price, I'd go again if I was in the area, but I don't think I'd make a special trip again.
