So, so good. Great enchiladas (oh god the fresh cheese), amazing burros (get the bistec with red sauce), cactus tacos, giant tortas, and more. Don't let the former Denny 's look from outside throw you off. This place is great. Service is friendly and on top of it plus the chips and salsa are delish.
