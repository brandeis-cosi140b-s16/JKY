Yummo!! 10x better than Paquime tortas! They are very generous with their meat portions in their tortas, rice and beans are excellent! Quesadillas are to die for. I have to stand up and applaud Reyes de la Torta for their mouthwatering aguas frescas! I've had watermelon, strawberry, and mango. I kid you not... Tastes like you're biting into the actual fruit! So refreshing!! They are served in a large goblet. If you're lucky you'll get a tiny umbrella :) 

Place is somewhat small so it's a bit crowded if it's busy that day but I'm willing to look past it because of their delicious food!
