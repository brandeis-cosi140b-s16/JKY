Listen, don't let the location fool you, this place is awesome... go, go, go... the food, the service, the food, the fooooooddd...! super yummy... super delish.  Listen, you must try it, the place is clean, feels like home.   I super recommend this place, even if you pick it up and take it home... do it, try it.  Try the Torta Nortena beef or chicken.  I love the shrimp tostadas... the hamburgers are amazing too... go, and go soon...
