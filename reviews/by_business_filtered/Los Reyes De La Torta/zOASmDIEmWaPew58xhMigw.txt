I had seen this restaurant on yelp and decided to give it a try. I'm new to the area here for a short time trying different places. The service was good the atmosphere was welcoming. I thought the asada torta I had was tasty but I wouldn't say it was the best I've ever had. The meat was seasoned well but I prefer it chopped instead of sliced.  The chicken tacos were so so. I will be visiting again to try other things on the menu.
