This is the best mexican place in the phoenix area, except for maybe Barrio Cafe.  The food here is pretty fantastic and the margaritas are tasty (if a bit overpriced).  Considering I pretty much hated all the food in Phoenix or Scottsdale, this review should go pretty far.  The guac is great, the tortilla soup is hearty, filling, and tasty, and the shrimp dish is amazing.  Cheesy, with tortilla strips and loads of shrimp.  Well balanced.  I hate phoenix, but I love sombrero's. 

Don't get take out, it loses its flavor.  Plus dining outside is pretty dope.
