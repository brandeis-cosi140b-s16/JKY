I like the feel on the patio and the bar was pretty cool looking.The service was fast but the parking was limited.

I didnt eat here but I did hang out and have drinks and chips. The chips were ok but the salsa was Fabulous! I probably had 4 bowls of it.

Once again, I got my favorite Cruz Tequila Margarita. Steve behind the bar recomended it and made me a deliciouse one with gran marnier? whatever it was, it was delicious and we had 2 each at the table. I always like a place that recomends my favorite drinks!

I would go back, the drinks are good and the atmosphere was nice
