My wife and I have eaten here for many years and loved it.  The last couple times were not so good and last night (9/25/10) was awful.  The margarita was weak tasting and half way through it, it was like bad water - all for $8.50.  They have also changed the salsa and we don't think it was very flavorful.

We had the tomato and cheese appetizer, which was very tasty but the salt level was extremely high.  My wife ordered the chicken mole and I ordered the pork dish in green sauce (not the carnitas).  We do not typically send food back but my wife's chicken was very tough.  They brought a second dish, which was more tender - this leads me to believe the first chicken was either leftover or burnt and they just covered it in sauce and served it.  My pork and the sauce it was in was tasty but over half the pork was either solid fat or grisly meat.  I happen to like leaner cuts.

We ate at the bar and watched the bartender make the margarita mix in a bucket.  After making the mix, he poured an awful lot of water on top of it.  No wonder our $8.50 drinks were so watery.  We have been told the owner does not allow the wait staff to come in until 15 minutes before opening - likely to save costs.  Unfortunately, the cost cutting has also affected the food and drink quality.

Sorry - this restaurant is off our list permanently.
