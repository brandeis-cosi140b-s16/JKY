Four of us went last night and we were lucky enough to get seats at the bar. Yay!  We had Steve's patron margaritas, the tower of guacamole and the carne asada tacos with pico de gallo- to start. It was all delicious- Another round of margaritas and I had the seafood crepes. I don't know what anyone else had because I was in a food coma. (and on my second margarita)  I usually order the seafood crepes but they were particularly delicious last night. 
We had dessert- something steve recommended and it was divine. I can't remember what it was..it was after my second margarita- it was a cake thing...or other.
Ohhhkay. Topped it all off with a Rome Popay or at least that's how it's pronounced. I love it. I could bathe in it!

Don't miss out on their REVERSE HAPPY HOUR from 9-11 with $5.00 menu items and drinks. Plus all the douchebags are gone by then and you might get a seat at the bar. Geoff and Steve are both so friendly and personable. I could go on and on just about those two.
GO!
btw- I wasn't driving.
