We ate inside. We only had to wait a couple of minutes at around 6. The service was very good and attentive. The food also was very good. We had the chips and guacamole and corn bread souffle with mole sauce to start. For main course we had chicken fajita with mole sauce with a side of refried beans and vegetables. I was very satisfied and would come back here again.
