I arrived at Los Sombrero's around 7:30 pm on a Friday night. Although it's located on a major street, the restaurant has a nice 'tucked-away' feeling. 

There was plenty of parking, and plenty of seating, which I definitely was not expecting on a Friday night. While it wasn't busy, it was by no means a ghost town. There were plenty of people there to give it a lively atmosphere, but there was enough space to give it a more private feel in the outdoors area where my girlfriend and I sat. 

Our waitress came to us rather quickly after we were seated. She was professional, friendly, and very efficient all evening. The food was good, not amazing. I ordered 3 soft shell chicken tacos, and the portions were not huge. I ordered a side of rice too, but wasn't a huge fan of it and felt that it was a tad overcooked.The chips and salsa that we had was absolutely delicious! I was a very big fan of the salsa, as well as the chips. 

All in all, the atmosphere was fun, but nothing too special. The food was average, but the service was great.
