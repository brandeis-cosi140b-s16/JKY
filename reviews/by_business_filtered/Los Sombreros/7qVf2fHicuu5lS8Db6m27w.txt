We ventured up Scottsdale Road on Monday night because my inlaws wanted to take us out for dinner and they wanted Mexican. The sign for the restaurant out front is not that big, so definitely pay attention. The patio is really cute, but we opted to sit inside. Inside is small and cozy with exposed brick. I felt instantly at home.

My mother-in-law and I had the House Special margaritas which we both liked, although I have to say that the margaritas my mother-in-law makes at home are way better. For appetizer, we tried the queso fundido with crab which we all loved. Nice pieces of lump crabmeat and a nice manageable size for an appetizer. For dinner, I had the chicken tacos which were delicious. The chicken was cooked perfectly and there was plenty of it in the tacos. Even though it's listed as an appetizer, it was more than enough food for me for dinner especially after eating the queso fundido. My mother-in-law had the goat cheese and blue cheese crepes with pomegranate sauce; I snagged a bite...delicious! My father-in-law had the seafood tacos which he really liked (I didn't get to sample them). My husband had the crab enchiladas which I also snagged a bite of...they were good and the tomato chipotle sauce gave the dish a nice kick. We did however both taste a bit of shell which was unfortunate.

Our server was really nice and paid just the right amount of attention to us. I didn't get a chance to see the final bill since my father-in-law was paying, but the prices were very reasonable considering the amount of food you received. I think the most expensive entree I saw was about $20 which includes two sides. Definitely a place we will return to especially when it's nice out to sit on the patio.
