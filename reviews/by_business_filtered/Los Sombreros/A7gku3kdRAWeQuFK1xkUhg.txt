Although the decor was nice (besides fitting 20 tables in a 10x13 room),   the place was expensive with barely any menu options for a mexican food restaraunt.   It was VERY glorified where peopledriving Lambo's feel better about themselves for spending $23 on a chili relleno...I think not.  We finished our beers and our "Herdez" canned tasting salsa and went elsewhere for some real mexican grub.
