Didn't like the salsa or the chips - and that's a pretty important component of Mexican food. They were kinda rude to us as well... although I will say they were attentive and informative. I guess it's just that they had us feeling like we weren't good enough to eat there. They were pretty strict about substitutions too - as in, they were against them. They don't seem to want to let you have flour tortillas instead of corn. Personally, I find corn tortillas to be quite vile.

Another staple they offer that wasn't very impressive was the margarita. It tasted like just a grocery store-bought mix that they stuck expensive tequilla in (if you pay extra - the standard issue is Cuervo). I had some tacos and they were good, but they didn't blow me away. They did end up agreeing to make them with flour tortillas, but as the dish was handed to me I was informed that they would never do it that way for me again. Huh? Wow, so I had a one of a kind meal.

My rating may be a little misleading because I think other people would like it more than I did. I think it's a nice environment - cute little restaurant inside, and great patio outside (that would be better when it's not so hot). I want to give this a 2.5, but can't and I don't consider this to be a 3... however, as you can see from the other reviews, I'm in the minority here. 

I think I may be a little too fussy and cheap to eat here - I like my food simple and they over-complicate the dishes and over-charge for them. They won't let me substitute things (which is something you can't do to a fussy person) or even leave something off the dish. This indicates to me either a level of pretentiousness or some degree of incompetence... I think it's the former rather than the latter. The prices for the entrees are way too high for what you're getting. The value just isn't there for me. My friend says this is his favorite Mexican restaurant, so maybe this might be your kinda place.
