My girlfriend and I ate here during Phoenix Restaurant week.  We had rapid and friendly service.  

We had 3 courses and my girlfriend had a Margarita.  Everything had the gooey deliciousness that I expect from Mexican food.   The Chile Colorado had a lot of spice, so come ready for a lot of powerful flavor!
