Charming little place, not very crowded and has a DELIGHTFUL large patio area.  A friend and I came here after a morning with our children at the Desert Botanical Garden, hungry and tired.

CONS:
Only one person seemed to be working (around 2pm) and we had to wait to be seated and then for menus.

There wasn't a lot of menu options, especially for kids.

Slow service, 

No chips and salsa unless you order it (even though the meals were really small).

Kind of pricey $10-$12 for 2 or 3 tacos and beans OR rice.

The kids meals were teeny tiny, and my daughter never usually finishes any of them.  She could have eaten 3 of the quesadillas, they were so small.  Good thing they were like $1.50 or $2.

They got the order wrong, I ordered beans and rice came.  When I got the server's attention and told him, he brought the beans right away.

PROS:

The food was delicious and unique, like nothing I'd ever had before.  I ordered the seafood tacos and they were great!  My daughter liked her quesadilla.

We felt welcome on the patio, even though we stayed for like 3 hours visiting.  Later when we were the only ones there, they didn't mind that our kids went and sat up at a high table by the bar and talked (but they were well behaved).

They were friendly and the place was charming and well kept.

Kids prices were great, but you might need to order 2.

I would love to come back soon but this time I'll order the chips and salsa.
