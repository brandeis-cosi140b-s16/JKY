The food is outstanding. The appetizer and main course winners of the night were the queso fundido with chorizo and black beans, homemade guacamole, smoked chicken enchiladas, green tamales and the chile rellenos with chipotle pork. Do yourself a favor and DO NOT MISS the crepes cajeta for dessert. They are unbelievable! The only disappointment of the evening was the service. We were one of only three tables being served at that hour, and our server was not at all timely about pouring water or bringing extra dishes when we asked for them. That said, the food is absolutely worth future visits.
