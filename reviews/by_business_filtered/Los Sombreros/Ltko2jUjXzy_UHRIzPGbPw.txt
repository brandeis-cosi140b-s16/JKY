I really enjoy this place! It is not my favorite Mexican restaurant in the valley, but it still has very good food and it is not priced too high. 

The queso fundido and guacamole are great starters. I have tried a good amount of things on the menu, but my absolute favorite has to be the blue crab enchiladas. It was a risky move ordering them, but it was so worth it. I have been here a few times and each time I have to order them. 

The margaritas are also worth a try. This is probably my second favorite Mexican restaurant after Barrio Cafe.
