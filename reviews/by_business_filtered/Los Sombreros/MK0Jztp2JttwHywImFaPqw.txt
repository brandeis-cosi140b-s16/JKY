I've been here twice now, once was a solid 4-stars, the other, a solid 1-star.  I must add, the 4-star experience may have been clouded by their ($13) Patron Margarita.

First meal was a wonderful Carne Adobada with black beans and rice.  Meat was tender and juicy, sauce was GLUTEN-FREE and super tasty.  I thoroughly enjoyed this meal, however, the $16 price tag was a little steep.

My second meal was Carnitas and they sucked.  The pork was tough and lacked any real flavor and came topped with literally a teaspoon of pico de gallo leaving the plate 90% plain pork and 100% boring.

I do like the fact they have their gluten-free options highlighted on their online menu, and can provide that same menu in-store, on-demand.

I'm 1 for 2 at this place, perhaps I'll try it again, but if I don't, I'm sure I won't lose any sleep over it.
