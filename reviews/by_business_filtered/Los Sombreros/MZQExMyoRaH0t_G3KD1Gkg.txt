I tried this place after falling in love with the restaurant in Sedona called Elote. I found out the owner used to own this so figured what the heck.

Not quite in the same ballpark. But that could also be because he no longer works there and the foods were quite a bit different.

Very good mexican but went with too high of hopes unfortunately.
