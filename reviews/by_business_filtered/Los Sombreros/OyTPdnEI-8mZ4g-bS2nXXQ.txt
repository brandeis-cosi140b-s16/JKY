I met a group of friends here and we all loved the food and atmosphere. The guacamole is fantastic along with the hibiscus enchiladas.  I spilt the chicken enchilada dinner and we both loved the slightly spicy flavor. The patio has nice ambience and the wait staff was excellent. It's not the cheapest restaurant around but it's worth it. I'll definitely be back.
