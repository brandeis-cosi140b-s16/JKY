Food was decent, but definitely not worth the price.  Dinner for two with 1 drink each was over 60 bucks! For Mexican food! I had roasted pork with a chipotle sauce.  Nothing to write home about, and the sides of rice and beans were more of an afterthought.  The 2 stars in this review are for the pleasant atmosphere on the patio - that was the best part of the meal.
