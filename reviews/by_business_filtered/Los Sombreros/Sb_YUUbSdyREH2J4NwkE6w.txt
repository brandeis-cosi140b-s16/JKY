simply put, I think this is the best Mex restaurant in the valley.  At least of all the ones I have eaten at.

Get the guac salad.  SO GOOD!!!


Also the mole sauce is to die for and even better their pork in chipotle sauce.  In fact I have eaten their many many times and had nothing less than an exceptional meal.

LOVE IT!
