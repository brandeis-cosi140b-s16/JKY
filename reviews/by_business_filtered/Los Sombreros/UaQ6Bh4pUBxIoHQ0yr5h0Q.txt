I must say I am slightly disappointed to see all the low stars. I recently went to dinner here with some out of town guests and my family. It was a bit crazy and busy,  so we got some margaritas at the bar while we waited  for a table. The margaritas were delicious- we each tried a few different ones, and all of them were delicious. As we began our meal we started off with chips, salsa, and guacamole. The guac was delicious and fresh, however I could have used a little more spice in the salsa. Also I was a little taken aback by the wagon wheel chips but after a bite or two, I could see why some people may enjoy them.  My one major gripe about this place was the fact that it seemed like our waitress disappeared for a bit. We had finished chips and salsa and our first round of drinks before she came back to take our dinner orders. I had the crab enchiladas. They were amazing. I also tried a bite of my dads seafood crepes, and now I know next time what I will be getting. Everyone seemed to enjoy their food, and we took leftovers home, which were just as delicious. I would definitely like to go here again, but hopefully with better service. I would eat here again.
