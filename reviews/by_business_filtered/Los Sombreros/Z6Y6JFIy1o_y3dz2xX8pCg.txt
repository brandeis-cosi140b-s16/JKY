I am totally shocked that some on here have had bad experiences because, in my view, this is as good as it gets.  I've been a big fan of Los Sombreros since I first went to it when it was located in the strip mall by the Big Lots.  There was absolutely nothing I could complain about there - not Tex Mex, but real Mexican food.  The salsa is smoky and five star.  I am personally a fan of battery-acid hot food and they had a habanaro salsa that was, well, YIKES and YUM at the same time.  The guacamole is one of the best I've ever had and the seafood tacos appetizer is something I absolutely love and think of often made with crema - not Americanized sour cream.   They are amazing.  I also am in love with the crab enchiladas and the puerco en mole verde.  My husband - a definite mole afcionado, loves their mole poblano and rates it second to none.  Margaritas are very good and the chocolate tamal with that carmel sauce and ice cream....wow.  I have taken four different people here on different occasions and all of them agreed it was sublime.
