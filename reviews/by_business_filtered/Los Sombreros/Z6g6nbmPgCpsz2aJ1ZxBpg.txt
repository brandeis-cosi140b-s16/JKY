Wow. This place caught me off guard the first time I meandered through the door. From the street, it looks like it's going to be another average mexican food joint, but take one step inside and you'll immediately notice that this place has something to offer.

The food is the most authentic, best presented Mexican I've ever had at a restaurant in AZ, down the line from apps to desserts. The ambiance is perfect and befitting of a gem like this. 

Servings are good size, so much so that I found it to be a little pricey for only two, but I highly recommend it on all accounts for groups of four or more.
