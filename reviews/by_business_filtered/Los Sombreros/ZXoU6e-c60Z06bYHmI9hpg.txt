The servers here are super friendly and are great at recommending items from the menu and their likes and dislikes about a particular dish. I have eaten at this restaurant a few times and the food has been consistently fresh and excellent in taste and presentation. It is not your typical Mexican food. This place serves dishes that one would not find in Los Olivos or La Tolteca. I had the green and black bean corn tamales. They are phenomenal! The queso fundido dip is fabulous as well. I like how it is a small, quaint place. If you want to avoid the rush go around 4:30 pm. otherwise outside seating will be the next best bet aside from waiting for a table inside since the place holds around 35 people total.
