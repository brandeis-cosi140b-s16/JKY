"morrrrre liquor?" My husband teases me by saying that when he wants to go to Los Sombreros. We've been going to Los for at least 4 years. We love the food and we love Steve, the Scottish Bartender. In fact, if we drive through and the place is packed, we'll go have a cocktail somewhere else and then come back...and wait until a seat at the bar opens up. He makes a kick a** patron margarita and knows more about tequila than a person should.:) The seafood crepes are my favorite, my husband gets the enchiladas with mole sauce. I love topping the night off with one of steves - I'm totally going to blow it here- roma pope- 
It's in a blue glass with melted ice cream and an orange slice and of course- tequila.. 
Even if it's sweltering hot- go. The patron margaritas make up for it.
