My wife and I travel to Arizona on occasion to visit my daughter and Los Sombreros was a big favorite of ours. After a several year hiatus we returned and came back looking forward to another great meal. Unfortunately, it was only so so. From reading the reviews, evidently the husband/wife team here have divorced and the wife now runs this location while the husband has opened a new place in Sedona. We ate on the patio as always and both had the snapper fish dish. Previously it was a whole fish, now just a filet and nothing special. The chips, two salsas and guacamole wee great, everything else just OK. This restaurant always seemed to be a great example of authentic Mexican cuisine, now that best thing I can say about it is that's it's better that the national chains. Next visit I'll be exploring other Mexican restaurants in the area and hoping that Los Sombreros will return to its formal glory. Will also try the husbands place in Sedona to see what he's up to.
