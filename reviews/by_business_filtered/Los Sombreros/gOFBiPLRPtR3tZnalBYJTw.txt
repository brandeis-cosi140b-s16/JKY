Go.  Just do it.  

You'll walk in the backside of the restaurant to enter and pass the nice patio.  You'll enter a door that splits the bar from the kitchen.  You'll see lined up a bunch of wonderful appetizers and entrees and you'll wonder why you have put up with inadequate food during your trip to Scottsdale.  You'll sit down and get a wonderful server and laugh and eat (get the guac and queso fundito!) and wonder that maybe there is a bit of magic left in Scottsdale, a town where a lot of the native magic has been bottled and bleed away.

It's a great little place and you'll know that for such a small place to make it they have to construct interesting and tasty dishes like Hibiscus Enchiladas.  

One of the best meals I've ever had in the Phoenix metro area.  It's a casual, romantic, and fulfilling experience.
