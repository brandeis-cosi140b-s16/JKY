Went with a groupon - Probably the most disappointed i have been with one.  I am not sure what I had as it did not resemble what I had ordered (I thought anyway) and it was tasteless.  I just wanted to be done and really did not want to order anything else.  I have tried many Mexican restaurants in the valley and this has been my only disappointment, normally I am pleasantly surprised.  Sorry folks.
