My goodness me! It's a regular "Dump on Los Sombreros Festival" here in Yelpland. Hey, people -- it's a perfectly fine Mexican restaurant. Well, maybe it's not perfect, but my meals here over the past five years have always been good, and I consider Los Sombreros a great place to take out-of-town guests. If I were to grade it on a pretentiousness scale, it actually rates better and is more inviting than Barrio Cafe. So give the place a break -- try the guacamole, the chicken mole, the lamb adobo, any of the skirt steak entrees and any of the seafood dishes.
