Food was delicious great ambiance almost feels like a little place in Mexico. The patio looked relaxing but was still a little hot out. Definitely go back for the dishes that I wanted but did not order. Chille rellenos were excellent as well as the chocolate tamale which is great with coffee. If you are interested in a little something different with very bold flavors and fresh ingredients its a must.
