This is the best Mexican meal we've had in Phoenix.

- Molotes Poblano (spicy):  3 crispy masa patties stuffed generously with chorizo and potato with roasted tomato and a big heap of their popular guacamole 

- Green Corn Tamales:  2 moist and light tamales filled with a subtly sweet corn filling

- Blue Crab Enchiladas: lots of crab with perfectly sauteed squashes and black beans

There was no charge for the large basket of perfectly fried chips and spicy salsa.  Service was super helpful and friendly.  The patio was made even more enjoyable by the cool evening breezes.
