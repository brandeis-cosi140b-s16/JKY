I thought all was lost in Scottsdale, how could we be living so close to Mexico and not have a descent Mexican restaurant and then I found Los Sombreros. My goodness the food is amazing, the margaritas, to die for. The entire staff was extremely helpful. They just cant go wrong. 

I have only been there twice and both times I was thoroughly impressed. I had the Enchiladas de pollo my first time, delicious, and my dining partner had the Mole Poblano (He's from Mexico City and he said its one of the best mole hes had in the states) 
Second time around I had the Tacos dorados, and a few appetizers, the guacamole and the Tortilla soup are a must, they are outrageously awesome. 
The only down side is it can get pretty warm inside, we ask to move outside to the misted patio and were completely comfortable.
