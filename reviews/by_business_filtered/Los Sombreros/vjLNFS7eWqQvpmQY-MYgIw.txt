Los dos Molinos is really good. This is better. Amazing food, and a great back patio to enjoy a margarita in the right months. Might be the best Mexican food (or New Mexican food) in the Valley. The tamales are spotlighted in the New York Times. It can be slow and the waits can be looooong to get a table. But grab a marg at the bar and you won't care - and it will be worth the wait. Great for out of towners.
