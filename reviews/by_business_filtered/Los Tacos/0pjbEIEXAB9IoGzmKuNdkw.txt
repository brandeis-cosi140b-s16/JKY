I came to this place because TACOS EL GORDO was packed!  My family and I didn't want to wait in line. This place is crazy expensive, the meat has no flavor at all, they put sour cream in your tacos that's not a taco?! When I ordered mine I asked for no sour cream or beans in my Taco and Then come to look at my receipt and they charged me extra for "extra meat" that I didn't even ask for. Another family was here they said the same thing and got charge the same amount as us. Never coming to this place again. Super disappointment
