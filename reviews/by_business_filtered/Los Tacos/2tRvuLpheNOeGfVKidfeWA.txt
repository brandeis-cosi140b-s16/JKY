The wait is LOOONG, but the food pays for itself. I ordered "2 carnitas tacos" and one "carne asada torta" on a Sun. afternoon, and I waited 30 minutes. I should have brought a book, to go along the wait, but just forgot this time! Anyway, the food is always delicious and that is how I am able to keep my mouth shut by not complaining over the long wait. If you don't mind waiting for good food, go to this place. It will be worth it!
