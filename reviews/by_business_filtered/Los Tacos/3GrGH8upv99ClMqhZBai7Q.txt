I did a backwards Yelp on this place: I see it while I'm driving to/from lunch at work all the time, so I looked it up here. Seemed to be a safe bet! I pulled up to the drive-through and looked at the menu. I had downloaded their menu beforehand, so I knew exactly what I wanted: one taco al pastor and an order of chips & salsa. $5 and change for my meal, which is awesome. The service was superquick.

Took the food back to the office and dug in. I was unimpressed with the meat in my taco. It had a strange sweet flavor that I'd never tasted in al pastor before. However, the double tortilla and green salsa were great. The order of chips is enormous and delicious. The pico that came with the chips was eh. Definitely needed a lot more acidity and heat.

All in all, I'll be going back and trying other things on the menu. Looking forward to it!
