OMG, how have i lived here 12 years and never been to Los Tacos????

Went with a friend after a day at the pool. I wanted Tacos and she wanted Shrimp Cocktail. I jumped on Yelp, TADA! Los Tacos. We arrived around 6pm, completely empty. The Staff were GREAT! They made recommendations since neither of us had been. I had carne asada and the al pastor Tacos. She had the large Cocktail and Aqua Sandia. She said it was the BEST she has ever had. I must say both tacos were great but I did like the pastor the most. The cashier was correct in saying that 2 tacos are huge. We had chips and salsa, just have to order it, $2.00. They also have salsa, pico and fab guac!

I will be taking my hubby there this weekend, he loves Shrimp Cocktail.... Just wish they were open later!!!!!
