I was a bit upset that my friends were taking me to eat tacos in Vegas. I'm from Los Angeles. We have the best taco spots around. However, these tacos are a bit different. They are very very good. They put beans in their tacos. Kind of weird to me. But it worked. I would come back to this place. Good stuff.
