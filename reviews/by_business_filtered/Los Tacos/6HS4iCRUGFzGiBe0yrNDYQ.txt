THE BEST TACOS I HAVE EVER EATEN IN MY LIFE! There I said it lol. Honestly these tacos were so amazing I want to go back to Vegas all the time, not for the clubs, I want to go for this place!! The fully loaded tacos are to die for. Not to mention there is a bottle of green sauce on your table to enjoy as much as you want with a squeeze. A BOTTLE. Need I say more? P.S. I ate at both locations in my last Vegas trip and both were delicious. However this location is in a nicer neighborhood and the manager was beyond friendly! Please open a location in SoCal!!!!
