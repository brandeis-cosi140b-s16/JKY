I got excited to try this place after seeing a 4.5 star review.  I am a sucker for good carne asada tacos so I ordered the carne asada tacos with onions, beans, and cilantro and a fish tostada to go. When I came home, no onions and cilantro. WTF? My taco was a little on the bland side. The meat was decent but the seasoning was bland. The beans with my tacos didn't work for me either. 

I don't understand all the rave reviews for this place. The fish tostada was alright but after looking at some of the food photos, I got jipped on the avocado. I got 1/2-1/3 of the avocado slices. I was going to give 3 stars but since they forgot my toppings and shorted me on my avocado slices,  I'm taking off a star.
