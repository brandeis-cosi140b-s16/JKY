Seriously, this is one of the best taco places in town. 

I can go on and on about all the reasons it's so good, but you're probably hungry so I'll skip to the chase: the carne asada is amazing. Whether it's in taco or burrito form, the meat is awesome. I don't know how they do it, but it's the best. 

You should know that you're going to pay more for tacos here than you might at Pepe's or Tacos Mexico or a place like that. But it's so worth it! I believe I paid something like $10 last time I went there (burrito, chips, drink), whereas I usually pay more like $6 at Pepe's for a similar meal... but the extra $4 is so worth it!

You should stop reading this review right now and be on your way to get some tacos there. Take me with you.
