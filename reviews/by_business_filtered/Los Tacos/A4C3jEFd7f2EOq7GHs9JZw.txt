I know this joint is called Los Tacos but in my book they're called Los Burritos!

I have only tried their tacos once, which were pretty good but I always come for the burritos, I think you get more bang for your buck that way. I'm one of those people who tries something the first time and continually orders the same thing on each visit, I'm weird like that, I won't order anything else and don't even want to try anything else.

The meat is always seasoned just right, juicy and soft. Guacamole and cheese will cost you a bit extra but to me it's worth it. There's no way you could ever go wrong with guacamole and cheese. I think life would be better if all the dishes on earth had both. 

When dining in you get your food pretty fast. Drive through could be very slow, specially during lunch rush hour so I won't hold them against that. It's totally understandable. This will always be my go to burrito place, on average I spend a little less than $10 on lunch here including a drink, their agua de pina is oh so thirst quenching, I la la love it! Give them a try, I dare you!
