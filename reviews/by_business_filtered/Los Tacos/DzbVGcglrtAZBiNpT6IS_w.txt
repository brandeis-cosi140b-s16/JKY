Signature seafood cocktail, soft tacos with an almost complete selection of meats (pastor, barbacoa, asada, carnitas, beef, etc), rice and beans served in a casserole, burritos, tortas, and the requisite fried fish selection, this place has everything that a hole-in-the-wall Mexican joint should.  Always a good sign, I'm one of only two or three white people eating there every time I go.  Practice your Spanish before you enter.  Most employees don't speak the gringo.  Jukebox playing Mexican music. A drive-thru.  Holla! I love this place.  It only gets three stars, though, because we have to leave room up top for the truly fine Mexican restaurants.  Maya in NYC being one of them.
