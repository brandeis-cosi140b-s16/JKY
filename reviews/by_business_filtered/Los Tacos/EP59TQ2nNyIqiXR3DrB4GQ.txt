When you arrive in Vegas, this should be your first meal. It's hard to find the once famous Vegas deal of $2.99 all-you-can eat buffet. Inexpensive stuff your face deals have been replaced by trendy restaurants "run" by chef's with TV shows. 

So now, the best deal in Vegas is Los Tacos. The best Mexican food you can find served by friendly staff at a great price.

On second thought, this should be the last place you eat before you leave Vegas. Make sure you save $5 for a couple of great tacos!
