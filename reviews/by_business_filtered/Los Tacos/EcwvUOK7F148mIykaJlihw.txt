NOTE: prices on their website are wrong. Most items are $0.50 - $1 more expensive in store. Guessing the website is simply not kept up to date.

Delicious vegetarian tacos but a bit pricey at $3.50 each. They should really discount the vegetarian ones as opposed to pricing them the same as the meat.

The tostada de ceviche & tostada de camaron w/ avocado are really good as well and a unique offering but I believe they were around $5 each with the avocado as opposed to the $3.25 + $0.85 noted on their website.

Overall, good food and relatively clean but the value isn't there. It isn't expensive but it isn't cheap either. I would come back if I'm in the neighborhood or in the mood for the tostadas since they're harder to find but don't think it will be a regular spot. There are plenty of places with food of the same quality with similar pricing + larger portions or similar portions + lower prices.
