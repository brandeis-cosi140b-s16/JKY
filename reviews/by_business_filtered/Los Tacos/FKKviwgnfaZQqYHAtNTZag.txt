I only found this place because of yelp. I wasn't full after eating lunch so I went out to get a second helping and found this place. I got the lengua burrito with all the toppings. The service is friendly and the atmosphere is reminiscent of SoCal Mexican eateries, so it was great to feel like I'm back home. What I liked was that the burrito was well-portioned, and I usually eat a lot in one sitting. It's far from home, but I would recommend the trip for anyone looking for good Mexican food at a fair price. And the food is definitely comparable to the Mexican eateries in LA.
