AMAZING.. I spoke with the owner who originates from San Francisco. His father owns La Taqueria in the Mission and he use's the same recipes as his dad's restaurant in S.F.  If you want to try the most delicious carnita's burrito ever..come here to Los Tacos. the meat is tender, the beans, have a nice salty flavor, and the rice is perfect. add all three main ingredients together with some cheese and a flour tortilla..heaven. I have had a lot of carnita's burrito's in my time..but this has to be, hand's down the best I have EVER eaten. If your from the bay area and your looking for a mission style burrito, look no further. Los Tocos has you covered. so good...
