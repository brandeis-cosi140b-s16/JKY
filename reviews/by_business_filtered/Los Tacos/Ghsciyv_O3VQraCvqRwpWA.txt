So I went to Los Tacos for the 1st time yesterday, I was really, really hoping for something better, especially for the price.  I ordered 2 carne asada tacos with everything and at 4.50 a pop I would have rather gone to an acutal sit down restaurant.  Now the tacos are big but the carne asada did not taste well at all! I was so hoping for this to be amazing. But sadly I will have to pass on Los Tacos.
