8.85 for one burrito, and the customer service was horrible!! Food is good, but I will never think it's ok to pay 8.85 for a medium sized burrito.  I've been a guest for years, however the continue to raise their prices, if you ask for anything on the side they actually charge you more.  When tacos el gordo opened next door, I thought Los tacos would come around and price their food competitively.... nope, they responded by raising t heir prices!!!  

You can tell the business is suffering, drove to Tacos El gordo, this is my #1 place to go to, but damn... it was packed to the max, so I went to Los tacos, there was a family in the dining area and NO LINE to order... it was empty.  Then when they told me my total was 8.85 for one Cabeza burrito, no drink or sides, I turned around and walked out... no wonder it's empty.  

Good food, bad customer service, SUPER EXPENSIVE.... nope, they've lost a customer
