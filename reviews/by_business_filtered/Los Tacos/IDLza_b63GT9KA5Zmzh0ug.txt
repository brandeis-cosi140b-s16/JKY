The other place was packed so we went here.

This is your basic quick serve taqueria.  The service was pretty good.  Prices cheap.

The tacos are a little different and I can say I liked the style.

The tacos start with the tortilla on the grill with jack cheese.  Then the taco is made with the warm tortilla and the cheese.  I had the carnitas, lingua, and chorizo. the meat is topped with guacamole, salsa and sour cream.  The tacos are huge.  I usually eat 3 or 4 tacos at other places but 2 of these tacos was plenty.  

5 tacos and 2 drinks (they charged me for water) came to $26.  That was a little steep for tacos.  I kinda feel like I was overcharged but I just paid.  Trying to discuss the prices of my order would have been to much trouble with the language barrier.

Other than that - I like the cheese and sour cream on the tacos.
