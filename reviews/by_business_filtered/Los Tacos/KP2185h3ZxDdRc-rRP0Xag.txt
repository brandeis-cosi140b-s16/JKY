I don't know what happened to this place.  I used to eat here at least once a week and LOVED their food.  They recently raised their prices and seemingly lowered the food quality.  The junior carne asada burrito was always my go to....a good sized burrito for $3.  I'd order it without beans and it cost me an extra .60.  Since when do places charge to take things OFF?!  Oh wait....okay, .60, I'll deal with it.  NOW they are charging $4.25 for the same burrito and a DOLLAR to NOT have beans in it.  What the fuck?  My junior carne asada burrito w/just meat n cheese was almost $7 the other day (because of course cheese is extra too...as is sour cream, avacado, etc.).  It was lacking in the meat department and had a huge glob of cheese.  So disappointing.  :(
