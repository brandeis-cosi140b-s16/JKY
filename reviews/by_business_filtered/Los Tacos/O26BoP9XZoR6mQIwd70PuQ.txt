I stopped in for lunch and the place was filled with white, car-salesman-looking guys. That should tell you something right there. The food itself isn't that bad (at least some of it), but it's pricey. $3.00 for a taco. If you want sour cream or guacamole that's going to cost you extra. 

I ordered one carne asada taco, one al pastor taco, a cheese quesadilla, and a pineapple fruit drink. I tend to like my food on the mild side, so when I think something is bland, that means it's totally devoid of flavor. That was the case with their carne asada. It was hardly seasoned, if at all. The al pastor was much better. Tender pieces of pork with a little bit of a kick to them. Both tacos were large and overflowing w/ meat, onions and cilantro. Definitely enough to fill an average person up.

For the quesadilla you have the option of either a corn tortilla or flour tortilla. I went with the flour and the outside of it was perfectly crispy and flaky.

The pineapple drink was delicious as well.

It was $11.46 for the lunch, which seems incredibly expensive considering I could eat across the street at Los Parados for cheaper and get better food. 

On the bright side, Los Tacos is very clean and has a drive thru.
