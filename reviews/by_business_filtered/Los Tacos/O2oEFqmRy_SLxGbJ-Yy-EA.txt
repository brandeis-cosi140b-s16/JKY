When I get a taco craving, I'll hit this up after I get off work. Love there carne asada. Recently I ventured and tried there al pastor... Mmmm, my new favorite. I like it exactly how they make it, do not add any of the extras they offer. Oh and I like there green sauce. Next time I'm going to try an al pastor burrito!
