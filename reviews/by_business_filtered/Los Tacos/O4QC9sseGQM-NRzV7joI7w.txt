Los tacos has the best tacos in vegas for my taste. Is not just a regular taco, every taco is a meal. You have to use both hands to handle.the waffle shape taco!!!!the shrimp cocktail is very good. The service is excellent and evryone is so helpful. I visit los tacos very often and family that visit from out of state love this place too.
