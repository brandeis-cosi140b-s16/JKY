'Rito only review!!

Tough one to call here. Needed a quick bit and out of nowhere come Los Tacos. Checked out the menu and the $3 tacos really sent me for a loop, so I went for a burrito (I don't know why I even tried NOT to eat one). 5$ and change nets you a 'rito, but it's only meat and beans. Guac, sour cream and cheese will run you an extra $1.50. If you can turn down that magical combo of toppings, you're a better man than I. End total was $7 and change. The 'rito result was mixed. It had just below average girth and solid length, which I think would make most people happy (although the rumor is women enjoy....). Anyway, it was solid. The al pastor wasn't the greatest, but honestly if you peep my pic, you can see that even below average meat was masked by the toppings. It was a good 'rito. Not great. Not 5-star.  3.5 star with a bump bc it had a drive thru. I'll go taco diving next time and report back... Wait....
