What a dump. I thought my friends were taking me a decent Mexican place to get a late dinner. Uh uh. Los Tacos was run down, grimy and full of graffiti on the bathroom walls. 
The food was ok. They have a pretty limited menu. Just the basics of Mexican food. I had a carne asada burrito, some rice (which was hard), some beans and a soft drink. I spent over $9 on all of that! Not worth it, but I was hungry. 
One big plus was the nice people. They were helpful and got us what we needed when asked. They didn't seem to mind that we were the only ones there and went ahead and blasted their ranchero music from the juke box. It was funny actually.
