Sorry Bert P. and Mr. Larios ... although I appreciate Mr. Larios intention of a nice lunch, this place is a run-down, expensive-for-what-it-is run-of-the-mill "Mexican place."  Looking around I don't think the clientele would really know what good Mexican is.  Perhaps it's authentic to some.

All one needs to know about Mexican in the context of what this place is trying to be is found in the Los Feliz section of Los Angeles and its name is Yucas and they have a James Beard Award.

The torta I had at "Los Runs the day after" was made from something other than beef I suspect.  An old whipped donkey perhaps?  I hasten to think what else it could have been.  No only that but the beef-like-substance was friggin' grey.  The guacamole seemed as though whomever made it "got bored" and just left it lumpy, sour and without much flavour.

This place is probably best left to the locals who think this place is amazing.  

If you want to try a true icon of the genre, come to Los Angeles and check out Yuca's.
