Saw this gem listed in the desert companion magazine on cheap eats in vegas, this issue has been priceless in finding great spots and reassuring myself I know good food by seeing some of my favorites already listed. 

1 Taco for 3.00?! really? 
        I can get 39 cent tacos at del taco! 

These are some serious tacos with some great ingredients and they are big. I've ordered the carne asada and the chicken tacos on two separate occasions. Both are great but the carne asada is my winner.

Here's a tip, they ask you i f you want cheese, guacamole and sour cream, each one of those is an 'add-on' and they come with a price. Your 3.00 taco can turn into $4-5 for it, without it they still hold themselves perfectly fine. The first time I had it without, the second I had it with! 

This place offers a drive thru, the staff is friendly and the service is not too slow.
