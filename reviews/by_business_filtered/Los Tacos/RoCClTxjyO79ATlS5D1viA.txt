OMG a great hot spot. If you're in Vegas & want a GOOD taco. This is the place! 
Tacos are reg size tortillas. You can make 2 tacos out of 1. 
I also had a tostada de camaron with avocado .......Very good. 
Salsa at table is also very good on ANYTHING. 
Prices are a lil high for your average taco but  soooooo worth every penny.
I'll be stopping by when I come back to Vegas
