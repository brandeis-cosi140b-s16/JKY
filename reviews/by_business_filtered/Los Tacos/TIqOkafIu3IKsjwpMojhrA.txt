Let me preface this by saying the tacos here are good. They really are. I  don't think they are the best tacos ever, but are solid.  It seems to be be a bit pricey, e.g., $3 for one taco.

The portions are big and at least for the tacos, wrapped in two tortillas.  They also give you a lot of meat, so I usually order one taco and make two with the extra tortilla and meat.  My experience has been that the carne asada is the best, the chicken can be a little dry sometimes.   

The aguas frescas are a must.  My favorite is mango.  It takes just like ... mango!  In all seriousness, I think Los Tacos has the best agua frescas in town.  They actually taste like the fruit, instead of water with a hint of fruit flavor.
