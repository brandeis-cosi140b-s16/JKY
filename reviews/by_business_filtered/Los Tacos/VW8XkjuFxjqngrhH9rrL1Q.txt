First of all, I refuse to give any Mexican restaurants or taquerias 5 stars when they do not make their own tortillas. I am starting to realize that many restaurants out here in Las Vegas -do not. That being said- the carne asada burrito I put down yesterday was pretty close to perfect. The steak itself was cooked perfectly and was so freakin' flavorful. I was pleasantly surprised to see whole pinto beans inside of my burrito instead of standard re fried beans. The green salsa was OK- not great. In my opinion, spending $9.24 on a burrito and a drink was a few dollars too much. I like the fact that this place offers a drive thru, and will come back to try some other menu items. Bottom line, this place is a solid choice for fast authentic Mexican food despite being a little pricey.
