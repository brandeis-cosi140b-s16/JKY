This place was good. And it was very cheap too.
It has a fast food vibe, but takes just a little longer than BK or McDs. 

The tacos were tasty...a lot of choices, but I got the pork carnitas with sour cream. I asked for the pico on the side, but they forgot it.  There was a good green sauce at the table, so I didn't need it. 

I would come again for some quick tacos at a low price.
