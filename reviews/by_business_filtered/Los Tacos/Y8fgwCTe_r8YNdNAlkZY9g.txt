If you've never eaten here, once you do, you'll never want to eat anywhere else.  This place is golden.  I feel like it needs to be protected as my little secret, but, it also needs to be known for its superior quality and taste.  Sometimes, the wait is a little long (during lunch hour rush) but its so very worth every last succulent morsel.  I'm mostly into carnitas  and crane asada, but my hubby loves the shrimp cocktail and my co-workers tear up the tongue tacos....yes, that's right.  It's so darn good....if this place goes out of business because of our failing economy, I'll die.
