think i may have found one of the best mexican joints in viva las vegas. thanks to a friend, this evening i was introduced to a delicious veggie burrito! =) 

first impression?:
clean, BUSY!, flippin cheap, simple, and aroma that will make your stomach growl as soon as that front door meets your hand. 

my hearty burrito was only $3.25ish... and freaking DE-lish! 

last impression?:
full, satisfied, and thinking about my next visit. 

guess what? there's a drive-thru! =)
