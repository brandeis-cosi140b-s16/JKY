Goodbye hubby, I'm leaving you to run off with the lengua tacos from Los Tacos.  And I think I'll have an affair with their shrimp tostadas as well.  Tee hee.

The space is comfortable, air-conditioned with benches and a pretty outdoor patio with "bar chairs".  There are 2 TVs showing Mexican channels.  Their tacos are about 1-2 dollars more than Tacos El Gordo (depending if you want the works) but man... are they worth it!!!  

Hubby had the carne asada plate which comes with beans, rice, tortillas, and vegetables.  He was happy with this, it was a substantial piece of meat, but I do wish it had more oil.  The salsa was good, as well as their nacho chips., then I had their shrimp tostada with avocado ($4.00) but man oh man it was soooo good!  And very filling.  I also tried their Al Pastor and Lengua tacos.  The Al Pastor meat is not as heavily seasoned as I'm accustomed too in other taco shops, and they serve their version with beans.  This was ok.  But the lengua taco.. that was mind blowing!!!  It had HUGE chunks of extremely tender and savory lengua (beef tongue) that is prepared and cooked well because it does not have a very strong gamey taste/smell like in other taco joints.   If you have not tried beef tongue, this is the perfect introduction for you.  The owner said they make the lengua batch fresh every day and never serve leftovers.  I'm remembering that lengua and forgetting my husband again.  Hehe.  Can't wait to go back!!!
