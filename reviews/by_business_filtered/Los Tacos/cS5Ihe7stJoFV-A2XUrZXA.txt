OUTSTANDING!!! This place has the MOST delicious food. The carne asada tacos with everything (cheese, sour cream, and guacamole) are phenomenal! The ingredients are so fresh, the meat has a nice grilled smokiness to it, and the green chile sauce (always served on the side) tops it all off perfectly! The staff is very friendly and the place is always clean (at least the one in Sahara is).
