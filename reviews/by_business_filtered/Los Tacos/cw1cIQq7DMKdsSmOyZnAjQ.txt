Great authentic-fast Mexican food. This place is close to my work and I come here a few times a month. But, recent experiences have changed my opinion. Firstly, they got rid of their grilled chicken...ok not that big of deal. Then they started to get stingy with their hot sauces when in the drive-thru.... their hot sauces are in containers at each table in the restaurant....how can they limit the hot sauce???? CASH ONLY DISCLAIMER!!! They now only take cash, because merchant fees are too expensive! Seriously!!? You have a drive thru...and your cash only! This place is not that special for me to go to bank for.
