I have been going to the location on Charleston since I was eight! Amazing and convenient food is served here people.
Their seafood cocktails are literally some of the best I've had. I usually get the quesadillas and add beans with carne asada. For their regular tacos I definitely enjoy the carne asada,  their lengua (at times its salty tho), el pastor, and chicken ( all with avocado and cream too!) Their green sauce is such a good additional topping as well! 
Their drinks are awesome too, horchata, jamaica, and ive tried the mango too which is awesome. Check it out!
