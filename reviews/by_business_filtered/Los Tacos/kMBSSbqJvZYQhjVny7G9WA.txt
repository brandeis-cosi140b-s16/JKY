I LOVE Mexican food. These tacos are A-May-Zing! One taco does me just fine as the helpings are large. The carne-asada are to die for. The meat is juicy and tender and the whopping helpings of sour cream and guacamole make this taco one of the best I've ever had. Not too greasy and quick to our table. Yum!
