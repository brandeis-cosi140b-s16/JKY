Came to las vegas for a 3 day weekend that included the best ufc main card ever ufc 189 and the ultimate fighter finale...woke up craving tacos after a very awesome hot n very heavy night; -)  we actually were gonna go to tacos el Gordo but saw the ridiculous line...for tacos. No thanks I'll gladly pay with cash but not with time. My beautiful curvy gf suggested we go next door. I'm learning to not second guess her and do what her beautiful mouth says. I had 4 tacos. 2 buche and 2 carnitas she had 2 carnitas and 2 asada. She couldn't finish the asada tacos. But because she was full. The tacos were amazing. Juicy and full of flavor. Awesome horchata and Jamaica. I would have given 5 stars but the workers kept staring at my lovely gf's yummy triple d's and the layout is awkward. U pay right next to where u wait for ur food so u crowd one area fast. Also it's pretty pricy for street tacos. 8 tacos and 2 regular drinks over $45
