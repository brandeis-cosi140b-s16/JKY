We wanted to go to our usual Taqueria restaurant, but they were no longer there.  I searched on Yelp and found a few options.  We were going to go to Tacos El Gordo, but the place was packed and my hubby wanted a burrito not just tacos.  We walked across the way to Los Tacos which had different options to choose from like burritos, tacos, quesadilla, chips & salsa.  I had two tacos - the carne asada and chicken, and their tacos are huge compared to the street tacos.  You can order the taco with everything - meat, beans, cheese, guacamole, sour cream, salsa, or add what you want, but they charge per topping.  The tacos were good and very filling.  My hubby had the carne asada burrito, and thought it was too small and salty.  My daughter had the chicken quesadilla.  For drinks we had the melon juice and mango juice - the melon juice was good, but the mango juice was too sweet.
