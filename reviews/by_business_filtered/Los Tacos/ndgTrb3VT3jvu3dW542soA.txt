I was told by a reputable source that Los Tacos were the best tacos in the US. I won't go that far, but they are damn tasty. Living in SoCal I'm used to an abundance of decent to good Mexican. These tacos were fresh, and more like a burrito stuffed into two soft taco shells than an actual taco. I had the carne asada and although I had two pieces of grizzly meat, I also had a pile of fresh guac, sour cream, and some cheese. I held off on the beans, but you can have them for the same $3 a taco price. My biggest problem with the tacos was the lack of flavor and spice. The salsa was bland and the meat lightly seasoned. Low on salt, which I heartily appreciated since too often bad meat is hidden by salt, but a little more cilantro and lime marinade or a peppier salsa would have made this an amazing taco instead of just a very good one.

The location I went to is grungy but authentic. I really enjoyed listening to the latino rap while staring at the mariachi mural on the wall. The cashier looked like a dude who just wanted to be part of Entourage...not a guy working the cashier window at a taco stand in Las Vegas. Sometimes life IS better than fiction.
