My girlfriend recommended this place to me and I'm really glad she did! Don't be discouraged by their modest exterior, this place makes great food! I think some of the extras may be a bit overpriced, but if you like those sorts of things then go for it! Their tacos and quesadillas are among the best I've had since moving to Vegas from New York ten plus years ago. We'll be back!
