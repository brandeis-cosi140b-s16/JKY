I really have no idea why I was so calm about my last visit.  I should have added like, 12 exclamation points for how good the food was.  I had forgotten to add that we ordered the large shrimp cocktail; it was to-die-for.  The cost: $13.25 and the shrimp were large and plentiful, we did not mind the cost.  We're going back to Vegas in 2 weeks and definitely plan to return.
