I have been coming to Los Tacos for the last 8 years, and since my first bite of a carne taco with everything on it, I've been hooked! Whenever, I'm in town or my friends visit I make sure to take them! My current favorite on menu is a vegetarian burrito with everything on it with chips and salsa with a medium horchata.

But for me the loyalty towards this restaurant goes further than it being just a place to grab a quick bite. A little over a year ago, a dear friend of mine got into a horrible car accident. (She was part of a group of my friends/coworkers that regularly went there). The Los Tacos answered to the tragedy by donating towards her treatment. They didn't have to but they did and that kindness is something I always remember when I go there (or any location of there's ). 

The staff is very friendly and in my eight years going have only had one negative experience (I blame my friend for that one lol.) 

Just keep in mind lunchtime is super busy!
