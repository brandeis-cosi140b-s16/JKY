Conclusion:
  Bypass everything else and go here. Don't waste your time, it's a no-brainer.  If it was a little closer to work I would come here every other day at least (I wouldn't say that about any other place)

Rundown:
-Neighborhood is sketchy (no offense)
-DRIVE-THRU!!!
-Phenomenal Food
-A little pricey for random mexican place but worth every penny
-Phenomenal Food
-Not near the strip
-Not for the tourista
-Cost/Benefit skewed far towards benefit

Detail/Context:
  Moved to Vegas recently and showed up here with my buddy at the insistence of a local (we came by the day before but it was closed around 10PM)  We walked in and ordered instantly (lucky?)

  2xCarne asada burritos and a carne quesadilla, OMG the flavor was perfect, the ingredients were fresh and the meat was cooked and seasoned perfectly.  We were sad we couldn't eat more.

  I can't wait to go back
