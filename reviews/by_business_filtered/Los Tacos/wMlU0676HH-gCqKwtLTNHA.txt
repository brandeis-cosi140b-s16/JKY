Los Tacos is delish! Seriously the best! My mouth waters for it many days after I've had it. I mean it is right now thinking about it! 

I've only had the tacos and I've had beef and chicken. I'll probably get the pork next to try it. I get it with everything, sour cream, salsa, and cheese, for and extra $1.50. Making it almost a $5.00 taco! But it's worth it and way better then any $10.00 fast food meal! The only other food I've tried are the chips and salsa and they are pretty average. The BF gets a carne asada burrito with everything and it's amazing as well. 

I get the Strawberry Drink, it's awesome! Nice and refreshing! 

Try this place you won't be disappointed! Be ready to order they move fast and you can feel pressured to order before you you really decided what you wanted!
