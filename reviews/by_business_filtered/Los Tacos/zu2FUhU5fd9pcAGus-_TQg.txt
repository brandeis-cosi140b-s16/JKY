My absolute favorite place to fufill my taco cravings. My personal favorite is their vegetarian tacos (minus sour cream, extra red hot sauce, add jalepenos). I'm not a big meat eater but their carne asada is delicious and moist. They offer plenty of agua fresca flavors  which pairs well with their food. Service is always friendly and efficient. As expected, it can get crowded during lunch hours but I think it's worth it. Unfortunately, all their locations are in the north end of the valley. The complete opposite of where I live. Ugh. But maybe that's a good thing or else I would weigh 20 pounds more.
