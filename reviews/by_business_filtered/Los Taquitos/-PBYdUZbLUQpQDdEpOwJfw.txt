It's no lie. Soooo good. We are from the greater Los Angeles area and so have had many levels of Mexican food. From Not Really Mexican to Tacos in Mexico. This place was so good that we went BACK UP to the counter and ordered more.  Worth the short drive across Glendale from baseball spring training land...
