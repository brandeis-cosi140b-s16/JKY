We came across Los Taquitos at the Taco Festival in Scottsdale a few years back and been going there ever since. The staff is always friendly, the place is clean and the prices cannot be beat!  My favorite is the carne asada tacos (Mexican street tacos) and they are 1.15 a piece, you cannot beat that! Definitely worth a try, you will not be disappointed. :)
