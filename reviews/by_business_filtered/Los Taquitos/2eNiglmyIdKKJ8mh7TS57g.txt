Seriously the best street tacos/burritos North of the border. DO NOT spend another $ at Taco Bell, Del Taco, Macayo's, On the Border,Burrito Co.-NOWHERE! Why would you when this gem sits neatly tucked into a local strip mall?! For $5-$8 you can have the most authentic Mexican food around. Family owned, and operated by the "sisters" -Watch the Diners Drive ins and Dives Food network show, it ROCKS! Peek through the pick up window and watch everyone feverishly chopping, stewing, and griddle-ing EVERYTHING. Carnitas-Bomb! Carne Asada-Wicked good. Chicken-Superb. Homemade Habanero sauce is on FIRE! So are their other sauces(red or green in your own squirt bottle). Only complaint is layout of the place, when it's busy you'll see. 50%  of the restaurant's seating area are for separate boys/girls restrooms. They need a remodel, but that won't stop me from becoming the Duke here.
