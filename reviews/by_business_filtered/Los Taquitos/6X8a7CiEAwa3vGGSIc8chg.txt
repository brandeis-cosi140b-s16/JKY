Well,  what can I say... this place sure has gone downhill. I ate here in the past and it was good. BUT NOT TONIGHT!

Ordered Chips/salsa, Chimichanga, ... all was BLAND and no flavor.
Friend ordered: Pollo enchalada w/ beans and rice...same story Bland and old bean and rice.

ONLY THING I HAD THAT WAS GOOD WAS THE CORONA. LOL
 I had to look around again to make sure I was in a mexican joint. I will def not be back. Over priced too.

I suggest u go anywhere else but here.
