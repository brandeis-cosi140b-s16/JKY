Cute little restaurant. Cheap prices.  I love the black and white photography too. Food for me was pretty average; it was tasty and hit the spot for sure but it wasn't anything I would crave. That being said, I did wolf down my carne asada tacos with reckless abandon. The meat had a tinge of pink (which I loved) and was tender, nicely marinaded and would have been perfect with just a smidge more salt. Mine came out with out the prerequisite onion and cilantro, so double check for that. Beans and rice that come with meal were so not a generous portion....but it was all good since the rice was a wee bit bland, I suggest beans over rice for sure. Love the pickled carrots, and jalape√±os at the salsa bar, but I wished they had salsa that you could dip out instead of the few squeeze bottles.  When I was there, one table had basically all of the salsa bottles, leaving everyone else to either ask if they were finished, wistfully wish they would hurry up and finish or do without. 

They do serve drinks, and have a pretty big menu, which is supplemented with brunch specials. Nice spot for an easy quick meal.
