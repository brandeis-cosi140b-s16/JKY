Perfect late night meal! Got in just before they closed at 9pm...super clean, modern, and worthy of more than just a quick take out stop.  


Didn't see any taquitos on the menu...might have been the evening of beverage sampling that was catching up to me. Ended up with a lengua/carnitas burro and Jeannie chose two street fish tacos....both orders were super tasty! 

Need to hit this for lunch, or maybe some menudo for breakfast, one day!
