GO HERE. Seriously, just go. Stop reading this review and go eat some tacos because I don't want this place to shut down. It's surprisingly uncrowded for such a nice little Mexican spot. Granted, it's new, and I hear their other location does pretty well so maybe they just need a little while to get their following in this neighborhood. (Watch, everyone reads my glowing review and pretty soon I won't even be able to get a table).

Their margaritas are perfect, and their $1 tacos from 4-7 pm during the week can't be beat.  The staff is super friendly and the food comes out quickly.  Love their beans, so make sure to get a side of those with your happy hour tacos.  Last Friday my husband and I stopped in, got 2 margaritas, 5 tacos, chips and salsa, and a side of rice and beans for $15.  Such a steal.
