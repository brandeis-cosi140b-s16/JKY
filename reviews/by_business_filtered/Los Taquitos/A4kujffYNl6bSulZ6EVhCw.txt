Viva Los Taquitos! Go to Los Taq for what they are - a walk-up restaurant with fun atmosphere, limited service and amazing food. Our favorites to grab and go: Chicken or Carne Asada burritos. Eating in: LOVE me some chicken tostada - the best I've had! Carne Torta is to die for either way, as is their Pico de Gallo! I've used Los Taq to cater too (pick up) and was thrilled with the experience. A note for those who are looking for the "Cheers" environment: My husband and i are there anywhere from 2-5 times per week. If the ladies at the counter don't know us, we simply take an interest in getting to know them! Nothing will come between me and my tostada!
