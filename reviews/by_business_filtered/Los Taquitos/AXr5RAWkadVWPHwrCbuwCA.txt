Came here for taco Tuesday with a friend. Carne asada, pastor, and carnitas were $1 each and lengua was 1.50 (although, I did not know this until I bought 4 of them) they were out of pastor so I also ordered carnitas. My favorite tacos of all time are lengua so when I had a bite of these bad boys I was I heaven! Soooo darn good! Carnitas... Not so much, so I'm glad I only ordered the one. The meat was dry and almost tasted like soap! Horchata was delicious but gets a little grainy at the end. 

The restaurant itself was spacious with a patio area as well. There's a bar you can sit at. Staff is friendly. Overall very nice and clean! Great salsa and merengue music in the background.

I will definitely come again!
