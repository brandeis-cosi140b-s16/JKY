I had the pleasure of being one of only 30 attendees to the grand opening of Los Taquitos Mexican Grill last night, and I was absolutely impressed!!  The menu features all of your mexican favorites, from street tacos to burritos to quesadillas to a delicious shrimp civiche.  The food is exceptionally priced (think around $5.00 or less for pretty much any item), but is no indication of the excellent quality and delicious flavors that await you in every bite!

The margaritas were absolutely phenomenal, and had I not been the driver, I would have been stuck there for hours just trying all of the different flavors available (such as Blood Orange, Prickly Pear, and Pomegranite).

Their salsa selection was also extensive, ranging from a light, tangy Pico de Gallo, to their uber-spicy jabenero salsa (eat with caution!!).

The location is convenient, the atmosphere was fun and casual (the place is small, but cute), the patio area (although tiny) was nice (and covered), and the owners were all SO friendly. Yes it was the Grand Opening, but I was still impressed that ALL involved made the effort to mingle with each table, introduce themselves, and chit chat throughout the evening.  Overall, I give this place a solid two thumbs up!
