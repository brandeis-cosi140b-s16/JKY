The carne asada torta is great. Terrific flavors, soft bread, tender meat. Actually anything with the carne asada or the carnitas is good. And the ladies in the kitchen and behind the counter are super sweet. It's good place to stop by for lunch or you can phone your order in and they'll usually have it ready within 10 to 15 minutes.
