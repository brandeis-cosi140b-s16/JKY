The second location for Los Taquitos opened on October 8th, 2010, and WOW!  It's delightful.

I've been searching for fast, delicious takeout in the 16th street/Glendale area for a few weeks now.  Up until last Saturday I was tortured by a sign:  

'Coming Soon'

Finally the wait is over and I can now enjoy delicious tacos for lunch.  The menu is varied, with anything from breakfast burritos to tortas, but I can't seem to make it past the tacos.

Anyone familiar with the original location will understand the simple joy of the street tacos.  Small tortillas (double wrapped), well prepared meat, onions and cilantro.  You can't mess with that perfection.

The Tortillas are light and delicious, and hold up to the meat well.  And the meat, ah the meat.  The choices are chicken, carne asada, carnitas and al pastor.  Shrimp is also available.

I've tried each of the meat selections.  The carne asada is very tender.  The chicken is cooked to perfection as well.  Really though, it's the pig parts that really stand out.

The al pastor is wonderfully flavored, with just a hint of crispness.  The carnitas are divine.  I don't know how they pack that much flavor into such a small taco, but it's far and away my favorite.

Another big plus (for me) is the size of the tacos.  They're small, maybe two or three bites apiece.  Ordered individually it's a great way to sample a variety of tacos.  For me, I allow myself only two after hitting the gym.  I reward myself with tacos, and I challenge you to find a better system.

Since it's a new location there are a few minor issues, mostly dealing with the register system and some slowness with expediting food.  I have no doubt that this will work itself out in no time.

To conclude, I now have my go to lunch spot during the work week.  I'm also willing to bet I'll be stopping by on the weekends too.  Hell, I'll probably work out more thanks to my Taco Reward Plan.
