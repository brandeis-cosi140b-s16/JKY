This is our local joint and the place we go when we can't come up with a better idea and/or don't feel much like cooking.  Not to say that we could replicate what they produce or that there are better ideas for dinner, I meant to say 'Los Taquitos is our go to place for great food, friendly service and reasonable prices'.

Typically we get the veggie burro (bean, rices, potatoes, peppers and onions) with a side of bombero sauce (which is super delicious spicy goodness).  Chips and salsa is great as well, with a sometimes spicy serrano and red onion dominated, almost pickled salsa.  They also have a red and green sauce to vary up the bites on your goodies, but I typically roll bombero sauce.  I would probably drink the stuff if they let me.

Family and friends dig into the carne asada burros and street tacos and everyone we've taken here has been very happy with the food.

Check the specials board as it changes on occasion and we've had some great rellenos and tamales at Los Taquitos as well.
