One of my favorite lunch spots! Inexpensive but authentic mexican food. The bombero burrito is worth the drive. One of the spiciest mexican dishes ive had, but not overwhelming spicy. When visitors come to town and want authentic mexican food, we take them to Los Toquitos. Our visitors have all requested to go back anytime they come in town. I highly recommend checking this place out.
