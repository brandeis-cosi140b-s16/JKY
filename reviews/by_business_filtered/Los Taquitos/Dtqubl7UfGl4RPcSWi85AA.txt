I'd love to give this place a 5, but the food and service are inconsistent. We've gotten amazing taquitos here, and other times they've been burnt to a crisp and old tasting. Love the flavor of the beans, but the consistency is too thin and watery. The service you get will entirely depend on who is working at the counter -- one girl in particular is amazing, the others average, and one is always terrible. The horchata tastes like red hot candies (cloyingly sweet with artificial flavor) so I never bother, but I like both their red and green salsas. Definitely tends to be on the dirty side (floors, tables, etc.).
