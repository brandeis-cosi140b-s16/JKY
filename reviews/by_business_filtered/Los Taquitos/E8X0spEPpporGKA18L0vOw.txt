The food is the reason for the rating.  I've tried almost all of the caucasian-eating food on the menu (i don't do tongue or internal organs).  Everything has been excellent, and the red sauce ties it all together.  

The only distraction I had was the service.  Maybe they were too busy, maybe the place is too small for people over 6 feet tall... i'm not sure what it was, but all the employees I've seen are cold, impersonal, and stiff.  It could also be a first-impression thing, because of an incident that happened during my first visit.  I had ordered and paid for my food, then I backed away from the counter so the next group in line could order (remember, this place is too small).  The employee yells out my number for pickup, and when I raised my hand, the cashier hands the tray to me over the heads of shorter customers at the counter.  I didn't mind since I'm a little taller than most, but I felt for the ladies under my tray.

If food is your thing, then you need to try this place.

If service is your thing, then you should keep searching for another place.
