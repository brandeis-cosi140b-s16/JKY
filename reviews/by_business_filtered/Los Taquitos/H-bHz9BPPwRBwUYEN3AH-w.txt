Ehhh...My husband got tacos, they were pretty good! I got tamales because I am a sucker for homemade tamales, they were the worst tamales I have ever had. They were super dry, no flavor, very little meat. Just plain gross. I will stick to making my own. It was just ok, we would maybe go back for tacos but it was nothing amazing. I think I'm missing the hype.
