Go here!!!  Excellent hole-in-the-wall Mexican joint.  I've lived in Phoenix for eight years and love Mexican and this is now my favorite option for cheap and tasty Mex.  

The meats are at the core of what makes this place special.  They have unique marinades and they cook their meats just right.  The carne asada and carnitas are the showstoppers.  

It seems like there's just a little twist to everything they do, like using red onions with the carne asada--atypical, but what a great combo.  They have special salsas for each dish, and you generally don't need to add anything, as the food is packed with balanced flavors.

The burritos and tacos are kick-ass, and the horchata is awesome.  Don't miss this place.
