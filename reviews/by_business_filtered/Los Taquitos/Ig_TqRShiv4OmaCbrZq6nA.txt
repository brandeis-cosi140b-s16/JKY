I've been wanting to try Los Taquitos even before I knew it had been on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives and I finally got the chance.  The inside it exactly what I expected, nothing fancy, booths and some tables.  I found it a little odd that the counter where you order is so small and the drink lids, napkins, condiments and plasticware are right next to it.  If there had been a line it would have been very awkward.  I ordered a chicken burrito, enchilada style with rice and beans and a drink.  When I went to get my drink they were out of Diet Coke, it came out as just water.  Ok, I thought maybe they had been super busy as it was about 1pm on a weekday.  Lunch rush perhaps.  I took a seat and waited for my number to be called.  The burrito was good, nothing that knocked my socks off but a decent burrito.  The rice was nice and fluffly but the beans just lacked flavor.  They were blah.  Will I come back?  Sure but I will try the tacos next time and hope that they can rearrange that counter a bit.
