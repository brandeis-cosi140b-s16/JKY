Visited early November.  Few tables so getting there on off-hours proved a wise choice.

GREAT carne asada (street) tacos.  Must have eaten 8 of them.  Had the refried beans also which were tasty.  They give you like 4 choices of salsa in squeeze bottles for whatever your palette or mood which was great as I could combine a couple to get exactly what I wanted.

Service was fast but slow enough to know that they made my tacos after I ordered them.

As good as my favorite stand in Tijuana?  No but about the best I've had on this side of the border so far.
