This place is fantastic!  I often went to their Ahwatukee location and was so excited when I realized they had another place right by my new address.
The location they're in is considered a "death spot" since every restaurant that has tried to make a go of it there has failed.  I can only hope this place catches on because I'll go into a deep depression if they don't make it here.  
This is REAL authentic Mexican food and the best I've had anywhere.  I love the street tacos and even the beans are the best I've ever had.
Go now!!!
