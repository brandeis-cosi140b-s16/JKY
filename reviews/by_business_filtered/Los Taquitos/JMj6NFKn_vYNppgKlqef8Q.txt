Another winner for Ahwatukee!  

This morning I had to run to the grocery store to pick a few things and decided to get some major points with the BF by bringing home a breakfast burrito!  I got there around 8:20 and saw on the door that Los Taquitos doesn't open until 9 on Sunday.  No biggie, I thought.  It should be around 9 by the time I'm done at the store.

So I take my time browsing the grocery aisles to ensure a 9 am departure.  Walk in the door of Los Taquitos at 9:00 exactly and am successful in getting order #1 for the day!

Chorizo and potato for him, tacos for me.  As much as I love the breakfast burritos, I find them a little too heavy for me first thing in the morning.  So I started getting two tacos instead.  Usually, I get one carne asada and one chicken, on corn tortillas, of course!  The meat is delicious, the taco is tasty, and it's a perfect way to indulge in the goodness of Los Taquitos without feeling like I need a nap right after breakfast.

The service is quick and friendly, the place is clean, and the salsa is good (I prefer the green over the red, or both)!  As Guy says "winner, winner, chicken dinner!"  Well, I know he isn't the only one that says that . . . but he does work it in quite often!  Ok, and this isn't exactly a chicken dinner . . . but, you get the point, right?  Just go to Los Taquitos! =)
