I grew up on Mexican food, and I am really picky. I'm from San Diego and I miss miss miss the taco shops I grew up eating at. I had up until this point settled on Fili B's because every taco shop in AZ I have tried has disappointed me. Until Los Taquitos! 

 I have now eaten at Los Taquitos 3 times! First time I tried Carne Asada tacos and Carnitas tacos, both were really good! The Carnitas tacos were moist and flavorful! WOW! We also had a quesadilla, and it was creamy buttery deliciousness. Have had both items a second time and I am still SOLD! Oh and their Salsa's are really good, too!

 I also tried their Pozole, which was a good size portion and very flavorful, a little too salty for my tastes, but I would order it again for my Pozole fix! 

If you are looking for a new taco shop...maybe you should find a different one because this one is mine now and I don't want to share! Just Kidding! 

Oh and here's an important tip if you like Mexican food...Don't order Tamales at restaurants or taco shops, if you have had a real tamale made at home. They are always too dry and disappointing! And I don't think you can judge a TACO SHOP by an enchilada/tamale...try a taco or burrito...I truly believe that not everything at one restaurant can be great! In my opinion!
