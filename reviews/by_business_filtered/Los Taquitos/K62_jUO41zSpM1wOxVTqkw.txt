Very pleased on my first visit to Los Taquitos!! Very clean, casual, simple menu and GREAT FOOD!! My husband and I both ordered the street taco meal, absolutely delish!! The beans were simple but out of this world flavor! Staff very kind and quick! For 2 dinners and a soda $16!!! Can't wait to go back and try everything else Los Taquitos has to offer!
