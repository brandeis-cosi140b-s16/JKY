Carne asada tortas are amazing! The down side is that they always get my order wrong. I keep telling them no salsa on my tacos. Their red salsa is kinda hot so I would like to enjoy my meal without exploding later. No matter what I do, they always add the salsa. I put it with it because the food is so damn good. Not that this has anything to do with the food, but the woman who is always up at the register looks like she rolled out of bed and didn't shower. Her bra straps are always showing and it looks really unprofessional. It's kind of gross actually. If she is the first and/or only person the customers are going to see, I think she should at least look more presentable. She is representing the restaurant. Other than that, the food is amazing!
