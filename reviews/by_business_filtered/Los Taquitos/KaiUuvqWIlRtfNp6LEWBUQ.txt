The food was just ok. Had a chicken burrito.  The filling was not very much, the portion size was small (mostly tortilla), they gave a bunch of rice & beans, both were under seasoned. On the burrito, the tortilla was hard.  Chicken enchiladas were ok..  Shrimp tacos were good, the shrimp was seasoned well.  :/ was hoping for way more out of this place.
