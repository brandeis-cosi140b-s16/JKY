I normally love Los Taquitos - I am pretty sure they make the best nachos in Phoenix and their burritos are normally delicious, but after tonight my opinion has changed.  I ordered a bean and cheese burrito with sour cream and my roommate ordered the bean nachos to go tonight.  Everything else in the order was correct, so I do not think this was a mix up with someone else's order.  My burrito had hardly any beans and a ridiculous amount of fried egg whites.  I found some egg whites within the first few bites and pulled it out thinking maybe they cooked egg whites near my burrito and it slipped in.  I was wrong.  The amount of egg whites in my burrito equaled the amount of about 4-5 eggs.  I placed my order via phone about 15 minutes before closing, so possibly they didn't have any beans left but this was not okay.  It was disgusting in flavor and texture.  If this is a new menu feature, please warn people because many are allergic to egg whites.  Taco Bell has better bean and cheese burritos.  Disgusting.
