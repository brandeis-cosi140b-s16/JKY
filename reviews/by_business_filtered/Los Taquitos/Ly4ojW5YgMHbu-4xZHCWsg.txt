I live in Portland, so while we have Mexican food here, it is not quite the best Mexican food you'll ever find.

When down in Phoenix on a work trip, I thought, "I'm pretty close to Mexico, I should have Mexican." I picked Los Taquitos because it was pretty close by and the reviews were pretty good.

I was totally happy with my Cheese Enchiladas to go. The girl at the register was nice and the food was good. No complaints.
