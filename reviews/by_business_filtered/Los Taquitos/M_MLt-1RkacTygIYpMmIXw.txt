Never a disappointment! The tortilla can really make or break a burrito and this place tops this list for authentic tortillas! Their red salsa is the perfect blend of spices, it's so delicious I have to put it on every single bite! My favorite thing to order is the AZ style burrito with steak. I have never tasted meat like it before! It's smokey and tender, juicy and flavorful with a hit of spice, just so tasty!
