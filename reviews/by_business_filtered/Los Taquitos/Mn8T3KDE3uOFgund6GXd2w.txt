In Phoenix for a business meeting and loaded the food network app to find a diners drive ins and dives. This place was first on the list. What a gem to find. Hands down the best tacos I've ever eaten. Taco Tuesday so I got the el pastor. The salsas were awesome and the heat was felt for hours. Just like I like it. I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a taco fix. Too bad that they aren't located in my home town because I would be there every day.
