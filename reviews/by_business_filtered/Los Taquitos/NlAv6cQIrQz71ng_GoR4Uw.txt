My wife and I decided to try a new place tonight for dinner,  and with all the great reviews here we decided this sounded good.  The place is fast food setup, but it not very fast. When we arrived the place was not busy at 6:30 dinner time.  The girl at the register was very new. She didn't know what some of the menu items were even. My wife ordered 3 chicken tacos,  and she got 3 shrimp tacos instead.  I tried the Carna Asada Taco combo, and a bowl of Passole. That was $23 with one Ice Tea. Not on the cheap side,  that's for sure.  

Well after waiting about 15 minutes for our food, and the order being wrong,  my wife was not happy.  I have to say that the food was very simple,  and very traditional Mexican recipes, I found the Carna Asada tacos to be dry and lacking in flavor. The Passole was just homany, and pork in a thin red broth.  That's how the peasants make it.  The refried beans where not over mashed,  like most places make them,   but they put to much water in them to make them cheaper.  The Spanish rice was again very simple,  but good. 

IMHO For the money there are lots of better places.
