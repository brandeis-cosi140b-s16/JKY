Good food & prices. Decent customer service. Not bad, not good. Today the rice was not cooked well. Not gross. Just not as good as usual.  The shrimp street tacos are good. They did over charge my card by a couple bucks & did nothing to fix it when I told them. I still wonder why they don't have WiFi for the customers. Good place though. I wouldn't come here though if it weren't close to me.
