Have been coming here for a few years and I'm rarely disappointed. I appreciate that they have taken their time to grow slowly and maintain the integrity of the food and the original concept. I get the same quality of food whether I'm at the Ahwatukee location or the 16th street location. I'm loving the newly remodeled Ahwatukee location!  It's so much larger, has great character, and some of the artwork has been carried over. My only negative, and it's small, are the prices. They're a little more expensive than I'd like and that means more time between visits but I totally support this place!
