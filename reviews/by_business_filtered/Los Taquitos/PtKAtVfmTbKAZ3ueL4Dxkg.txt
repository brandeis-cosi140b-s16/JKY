Top-notch Mexican food from an unassuming storefront in an otherwise generic shopping center.  I was turned on to Los Taquitos by a friend who, despite certain dietary restrictions, will indulge in the tacos here when she needs her street food fix.  Coming from California, I have been mystified and befuddled by the lack of good, cheap Mom-and-Pop Mexican food joints in the Phoenix Metro Area.  It seems that when I have gone out exploring, I have been completely disappointed with bland, underseasoned, cafteria-style Mexican food that seems to be de rigeur in these parts.  This is not the case with Los Taquitos.

The food here is a tremendous value.  You spend no more than you would at any other Mexican food hole-in-the-wall, but the flavor and attention to texture and food preparation is exceptional.  The hard-shell tacos have the proper jaw-rattling crunch, and the meat is well-seasoned and tasty.  They don't require too much hot sauce because they are so savory on their own, but the house-made green and red sauce condiments, add the perfect amount of heat and brightness.  I have also sampled the carne asada burrito, served enchilada-style (i.e., smothered in red simmer sauce), and found it to be spot-on as far as texture and taste.  The flour tortilla is soft and sturdy, whereas the beef is toothsome and appropriately salty and spicy.

I fear that I have been ruined for all other quick-and-dirty Mexican food joints after eating here.  Los Taquitos sets the bar very high for this niche of restaurant, and the service is prompt despite the crowds of loyal patrons that jam-pack themselves into this small little place for a taste of spicy, savory, satisfying Mexican food heaven.
