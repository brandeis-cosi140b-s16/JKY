The service was very friendly but this is just fast food Mexican.  I think the quality of the food is good but it isn't exceptional.  I found the place perfectly clean.  My daughter loved her tacos and I had the enchiladas that were very good but nothing to write home about.  The pico was very good and the guacamole was average--but you can't expect more given the fast food nature of the place.  Come here for good food at a reasonable price but don't expect this to be Los Dos Molinos.
