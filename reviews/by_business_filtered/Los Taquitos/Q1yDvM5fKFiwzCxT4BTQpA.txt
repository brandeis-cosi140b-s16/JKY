A friend of ours invited us to join him and his family here for an impromptu low-key birthday dinner recently. Low-key it was, but tasty. 

I don't ever voluntarily just go out for Mexican food. I just don't get excited about it. There isn't anything about Mexican food that I love and just have to have. But if I have some, I enjoy it. I would have given this place 2 stars, but "Meh... I've had better" is not quite true. It was good, in and of itself, I can't really say I've had better. I've definitely had worse!

So here we were, at Los Taquitos, having, well... taquitos. 

The name is appropriate. These tacos were tiny street tacos. My husband and I had a pork, chicken and steak taco, with some rice and beans. I could do without the rice and beans. They weren't very exciting. But then again, the place is not called "Los Rice & Beanitos". The tacos were delicious, loved the flavors, and would probably only order the carnitas tacos if I ever find myself there again. That was the best one.

The birthday boy and I wanted to cap off the meal with a Flan, but were bummed to learn they'd already run out for the night. Boo.
