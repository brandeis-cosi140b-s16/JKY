Thought was supposed to be HOT, but was'nt more like tooo sweet!!!
I got the Fireman carnita burrito really was disappointed so far Arizona's Mexican foods is way to BLAND and wife has'nt found any she likes!!!
The girl that took my order was nice and polite and the carnita meat tasted good but that's all !!! my 2 star rating is on the high side!!!
