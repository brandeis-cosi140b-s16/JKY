I wasn't sure what to give Los Taquitos, 3 or 4 stars. Maybe 3.5. I had flautas with rice and beans. Flautas were pretty good, but c'mon, your rice and bean were bluuugh. I poured salsa over it to make it edible. Hubby ordered chili verde and enjoyed it tremendously. Don't bother with the rice and beans.
