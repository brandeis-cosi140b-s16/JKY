Excellent food...nice moist tamales, great carne asada...ordered $45 worth of food and it was all good.  The service is excellent as well.  Very nice people.  Highly recomended.  Its funny but in Arizona, where you would think you would find bomb mexican food, good authentic mexican food is rare.  I love this place...will deffinatly be back!!!
