I saw this on DD&amp;D a few weeks ago.  It is a little bit of a drive for me, but I decided to take my daughters over there for a Saturday lunch.

Once I walked in I realized I had been here before a few years ago with a friend that lived in the neighborhood.  He really liked the place.  

I ordered tacos, chicken, pork and carne asada.   I got an enchillada for the girls. 

The girls didn't like the enchilada and the sauce seemed pretty boring and kind of sweet.

The rice was about as plain as could be, but the beens were kind of special.  They were closer to straight pinto beans then refried beans.  The were lightly mashed with plenty of bean chunks in a light sauce.  The bean flavor was strong.  The girls liked the beans mixed with rice and I enjoyed the beans and mexican cheese.

The chicken taquito was the best of the bunch.  The marinated pork took second but was a little dry.  The carne asada brought up the bottom.  It had a bit of a gassy taste and was far behind the great carne asada at El Sol.  

The tacos here are small as the name suggests but three of them are plenty for a lunch.  

I would like to go back for a Diablo burro and to try the fish tacos.

Overall this is an above average fast food place and the best place I have found for street tacos.
