I found another Mexican joint to add to my rotation! Cute atmosphere, cheap booze, friendly service, and tasty food. 

I ordered a chili relleno and grilled veggie burro. The chili relleno was good, definitely unique. It was huge and filled with potatoes and cheese and covered in a delicious sauce. As a vegetarian, I love potatoes in Mexican food. They are filling and tasty and I don't see why more places would use potatoes for their Mexican dishes. They are dirt cheap.The grilled veggie burrito was delicious. Filled with beans, rice, grilled veggies (POTATOES!) it was super good. It was a little dry and I would have liked some hot sauce but all the hot sauce bottles were being used by other tables. (Hint, hint... more hot sauce bottles please!) My husband had the bombero burrito which he said was quite spicy but very tasty. 

We will be back!
