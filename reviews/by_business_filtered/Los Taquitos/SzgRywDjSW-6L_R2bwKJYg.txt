This is my new favorite small restaurant for Mexican food! I have been here 3 times and liked everything I ordered. The chile relleno burrito is great. The Arizona burrito is really a treat with the added pieces of bacon inside the burrito with potato and meat. I went last Friday for a business lunch and had the tacos. They are to die for! Ok!  fellow gringo's don't forget to ask for some limes to squeeze on top of your food. It will really give your food that bam!
