I ordered take-out last night from Los Taquitos, upon the recommendation of a friend and a few Yelp reviews. I ordered the shrimp fajitas meal  (meals come with rice and beans) and my daughter had the kid's meal with a bean burrito. We also ordered chips and salsa.  15 minutes to pickup, and it was ready when we got there.  The total was $16.75, which I thought was a bit high considering what we ordered. 
The inside has an unexpected, modern bar with about five stools. The register lines are right behind those stools. It just seemed odd and out of place. The three women at the registers had their act together, but could improve on friendliness. 
So, we paid and were on our way, and I remembered the lady on the phone telling me to remind the person who rings us up that we get a drink with the kid's meal. Indeed, we did need to go back and get the drink cup. I just would prefer that it wasn't my job to remind them of something when they could easily write a note or symbol on the bag to remind themselves. 
So, we got home and opened it all up and tried it out. My shrimp fajitas came with the bare minimum...meaning no traditional condiments. Poor assumption on my part, I guess. None-the-less, they tasted pretty good, but nothing special. 
Now the chips and salsa - I mean, how can you go wrong? You can go wrong when the salsa is so hot that it burns for your mouth for five minutes after one bite and you end up not eating them and wasting your extra $2.50. 
One last issue. I noticed later that they charged me a dollar more than the price on their menu online. 
Not sure I'll go back, but if I do, it will be to try the $1 tacos.
