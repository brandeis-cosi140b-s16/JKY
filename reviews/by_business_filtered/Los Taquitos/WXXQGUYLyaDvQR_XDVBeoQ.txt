We found Los Taquito's before Triple D did...and we were almost disappointed that it was going to be on the show. We didn't want to find the place so busy at lunch that we couldn't go there....TOO LATE. :) Seems Guy let the cheese out of the taco. It's always busy at lunch. Dinner isn't so bad during week- busy wise. Now the food...my hispanic husband loves the place, as does my son...it's not that I don't...but honestly we eat there so often that I'm getting a little burnt out right now! That's a good thing - if you've never tried it before... YUMMY. Love the nacho's...messy- they are so high! Love the green chili - not hot, flavorful but not hot. My son tried the green sauce on his tacos once and they were so hot they were kicking his butt, so the kind gal that works there gave him a whole plate of cheese to tone it down. It helped a little...but how kind was that.
Anyway--- please stay away...or if you have to go...save us a spot for 3! :) e
