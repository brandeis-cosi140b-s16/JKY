Very good food.  One day after having a miserable lunch at Manuel's in Tempe I was able to make up for it by having dinner here.  The food here was much better, right away I knew it was going to be a big improvement, even the chips were good, fresh and tasty.

For an entree I had the chile relleno (what I had tried to have at Manuel's) and was very pleased.  The chile options weren't overly spicy, but they had good flavor.  I will definitely come back when in the area again.
