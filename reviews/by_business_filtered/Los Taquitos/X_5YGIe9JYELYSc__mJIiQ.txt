I wanted to love this place....but a couple things stood in the way. 

Start with the girl taking our order....she was rude and impatient. She tried to end our order 3 times. I kept have to say..."wait he's with me too" (took my crews out to lunch). 

Good was good and tacos were good. However, I kept getting a weird burnt taste in my mouth. I'm assuming the meat got a little burnt, which can happen. 

I will be back, because overall it was A O K. Want to give it another shot, and hopefully the meat won't be burnt.
