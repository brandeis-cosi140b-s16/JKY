This place was featured on Diners and Dives, so we had high expectations.  We had 4 types of tacos and a shrimp burrito.  The carne asada tacos were the best ones, but the meat was a bit dry.  The lengua was alright but the pieces were too big.  The shrimp burrito had very few small shrimp in it.   We live in Scottsdale, and I don't think we'll make the trip to eat there again.
