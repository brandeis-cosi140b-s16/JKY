Second time here. New remodel since I've been here. Looks nice. 

With that being said - the food quality has gone way downhill. It's flat out terrible actually. Poor, hard, dry chicken. El pastor isn't shaved - rather small ground pieces soaking in a red sauce. No limes, no guac w/ tacos. And the beans - mushy, unappealing, and under-seasoned. I wouldn't serve those beans to my dog. The place stays busy at lunch (cheap food I'd guess) Streams and streams of people. They must have no clue what Mexican food is. Definitely won't be back. Never. Adios. Believe the other negative reviews - I didn't - I wish I would have. 

This is phoenix people. Find a more "authentic" spot and you'll be much happier.
