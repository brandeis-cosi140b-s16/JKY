I was sitting on my couch figuring out where to get a good hamburger when Diners, Drive Inns, and Dives came on and there it was Los Taquitos.  Just ten minutes away too.  I drove over to this little hole in the wall and got the Bombero with carnitas.  The sauce on top was...the bomb!  Sweet, spicy, smoky kind of like a mole sauce.  I had the meal with rice and beans which was good to soak up all that heavenly sauce.  I will definitely be going there again.
