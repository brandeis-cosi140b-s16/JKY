I finally got a chance to check out this Diners Drive-In and Dives spot.  I am glad I did as the food was good and they serve posole  on a daily basis.  

I got the posole and a shrimp ceviche tostada.  The tostada was great nice and thick to hold up with the ceviche on it and not get soggy fast.  The flavor was great and there was plenty of shrimp.  The posole was good not as spicy as I like but that was fixed with some Tapatio sauce and then it was great.  

If you are in the area I recommend this place and I will be back for sure to try the tacos eveyone is raving about in their reviews.
