Oh My God! The street tacos, the chilaquiles, the flan, the salsas! This is a great place to get good authentic Mexican food and also some of the "Americanized" dishes (sour creme, sauce-covered burritos, cheddar cheese). I stick to the street tacos and chilaquiles but the menu is really large. They have taco Tuesdays ($1 per taco) but beware, it gets busy.
