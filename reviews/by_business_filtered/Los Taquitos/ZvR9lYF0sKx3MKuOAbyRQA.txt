Good food. Very simple menu. I tried the street tacos and the 'bombero burrito'. Street tacos were good, salsa selection is somewhat limited, but that's ok, the tacos are good and the pricing is justified. The bombero burrito is also decently priced, its an interesting taste, and it was a new taste for me. Not a bad thing to try. I like this place, but I've had better I think. Although, if you wanted carne asada and were on Elliot and I-10, I'd go here. Carne asada is much better than the stuff from next door.
