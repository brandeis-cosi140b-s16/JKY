While visiting from LA my wife and I yelped this place and decided to give it a try. I usually judge a Mexican restaurant by it's salsa because there are only so many ways to make tacos. So with that said let me tell you, the red and green salsa were exploding with flavor and just the right amount of heat... The bomb!!!! I had carnitas tacos and the carnitas was probably the best I have ever had! The red salsa complemented the tacos without taking away from the flavor of the meat! I also had a cheese enchilada and the enchilada was just as good as the tacos...very authentic!!!! We have a lot of good taco joints back in Los Angeles but Los Taquitos was soooo good I tried to talk my wife into moving to Pheonix.
