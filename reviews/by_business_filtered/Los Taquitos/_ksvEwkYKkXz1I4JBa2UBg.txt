um... yum! How had I not been here before? I work in the neighborhood and had been meaning to come here for a long time, but never got around to it. I finally went to Los Taquitos and was pleasantly surprised. The line was loooong, but went fairly quickly considering the size (we waited about 20 min in line). I came on a taco tuesday (1$ chicken and al pastor tacos) and had one al pastor taco, one carne asada taco, and a beef tamale. Each item was delicious and fresh tasting. The sauces on the meats were perfect and the salsas were perfectly spiced to complement the food. The tamale had a nice consistency and the meat was tender. I would definitely come here again, but maybe try to come at an off time.
