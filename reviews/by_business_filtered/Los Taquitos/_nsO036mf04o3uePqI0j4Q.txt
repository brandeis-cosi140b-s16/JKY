I heard about this from DDD, but I wasn't going to hold that against it.  This place is fantastic having delicious food and reasonable prices.  What more could you ask for?  They have the best Chile Reno Burrito I have had in the area. I order it enchilada style since they have great sauce.  The tortilla is soft and fresh made wrapped around a chile reno, rice, and potatoes. It is fantastic.  They have red and green sauce for all their food get extra green sauce, it's spicy and addictive.  The tostadas are really good as well if you want something crunchy to go with your tacos.  The staff are always friendly and the food comes out pretty quick for how busy they always are.  It's a pretty small place so it can fill up at busier times, but you can always get it to go and it's still just as good.
