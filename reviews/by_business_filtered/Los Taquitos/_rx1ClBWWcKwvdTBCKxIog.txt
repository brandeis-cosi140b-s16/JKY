Great tacos! We stopped by here when we were moving accross the country because we had seen it on DDD. We were not disapointed! They have very authentic taco's. It's a little place but their taco and taco sauce have huge flavor. I had carne asada and the carnitas taco and both were comparable to what I could get at the better places in southern CA. I also ate a tamale and it was pretty good for a restraunt tamale. If you are in Phoenix and want some mexican food, go here. you can easily find out why if you search for it in youtube.
