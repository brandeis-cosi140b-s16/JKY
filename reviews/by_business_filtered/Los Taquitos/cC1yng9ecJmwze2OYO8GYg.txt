Well, I'm gonna be honest. The service is good. The food is bad. Sauces taste nasty. meat is not the freshest. The prices are ridiculous. 4 dollars for a bean and chez burrito?????  I'm sorry I would rather have a filbertos in this place.... at least I know that I'm gonna eat bad food. Just bc the "guy" shows up 5 years ago doesn't mean you have good food now. Redo the menu and prices. No Beuno.
