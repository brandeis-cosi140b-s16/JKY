There are some businesses you really want to root for and hope they do well.
Los Taquitos is one of those businesses for me.

The best thing about this location is the pretty ladies that work there.  :)

I've been here twice to lackluster dining experiences.

Today I ordered the special which was a chimichanga and drink for $6.99. Not bad except for the fact I got the wrong chimichanga. I got chicken instead the beef chimichanga I ordered.

I also ordered the rolled tacos which is an order of 3 taquitos for $5.25.  If the food were of gourmet quality I could easily see paying that but for the quality, the amount served should be twice that.  The rolled tacos are OK just way over-priced.

I'd really like to give this place one more try which is something that I never due after two really mediocre experiences.

They do serve beer and wine so it might just be a nice place to relax and have some chips and salsa.  I've only been during lunch when I'm the only person in the restaurant. Maybe the cool crowd hangs here during the evenings. Who knows?

We'll see.
