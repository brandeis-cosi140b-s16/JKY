I cannot find a better chili relleno anywhere. Believe me, I've been searching for years. And the tacos are amazing, too! They also have great salsa. I would happily eat here every single day. As I write this review, my mouth is watering. The service isn't bad either, just laid back nice people at a counter. The only negative is that they don't sell booze with their spectacular food.
