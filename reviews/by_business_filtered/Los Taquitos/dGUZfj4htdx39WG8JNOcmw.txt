We went to Los Taquitos today.  My mom and I had the street tacos and we really liked them. My dad had the bombero burrito and he liked it and he likes spicy food but said he wouldn't order it again. The bombero sauce has a little smoky flavor and neither of us are a fan of the smoky flavor in sauces unless it's barbeque.   My nephew had the chicken enchiladas with the green chili sauce and he liked them.   VERY affordable good food. I would go back. :-)

I believe they are remodeling which they need to do mostly cuz of the order area, soda area, and condiment area.  It is so congested in that area. It was FREEZING in there today, they need to turn the heat on.
