This is the second location and its AWESOME!!!  They took it up a big step with a nice dining and outdoor patio area plus a BAR! Same great food and low prices, friendly staff as always.  Carne asada, carnitas & fish taco plate is mouth watering.  Cheese Quesadilla with carne asada is as tasty as ever.  Oh they have a flat screen HDTV to watch the games too!!
