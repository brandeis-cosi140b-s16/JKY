Tacos, tacos, tacos......how can something so simple be this great? Having seen this place being featured on DDD we had to try it out and it was worth every penny! I have a thing for always trying the "odd" menu items so I've tried the tongue tacos and cabeza (head/cheek) burrito and to me there is nothing better on the menu! This place is rather small which makes it perfect if you're there with some friends or a special someone! My friend loves the shrimp ceviche though I havent tried it myself. Go to this place for some great authentic, local and quite tasty food.......probably some of the best the east alley has to offer!
