Not a bad lunch.

Pros:  
The food was flavorful, hot and cheap
The shrimp chevice tostada was DELICIOUS


Cons:
The location is too small and the line was literally all the way to the door and there is no convenient place for those waiting for their food to stand.  Very awkward.
I didn't like the seasoning on the carne asada street tacos.  I wanted to taste the meat without some unexpected, red seasoning on it.  It was too spicy and when I order carne asada I usually expect it to come unseasoned, or at least without some weird red seasoning all over it.  (That's not what the carne asada street tacos I get in Mexico taste like; they are served unseasoned with shredded cabbage, a lime wedge and some pico de gallo.)

Anyway, aside from the super crowded place and the weird carne asada street taco, I did like it.  I'll be back for more of those delicious, shrimp cevice tostadas.
