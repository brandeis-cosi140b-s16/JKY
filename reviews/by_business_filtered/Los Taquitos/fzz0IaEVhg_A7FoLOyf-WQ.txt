I wish Los Taquitos existed in my town. I visited this spot while on vacation, on my next to last day, and wish I had gone earlier so I could have eaten here multiple times. 

This restaurant is located in a smallish strip mall. It has a very casual atmosphere, a walk up counter for ordering and a bunch of booths and tables to eat at. There are colorful murals on the walls, actually pretty cute. 

The employees were friendly and helpful, and my co-eater and I both got a combo and a sope. I would say the tacos were the best draw, followed by the enchiladas, then the tamales. The rice and beans were tasty too. The sauce on the enchilada and tamale was delicious. I really wish I was able to try more. This place is on my to-do list for the next time I'm in the area! 

I hear they're putting a Los Taquitos outpost in PHX airport. How about one in New York next?!
