This is a great little neighborhood spot to grab a quick and delicious Mexican bite to eat. Order at the counter and they'll call your number when your food is up. I went for the street tacos...al pastor and chicken. The tacos al pastor were terrific, with a rich, spicy sauce on the tender pork. The chicken also had a spicy marinade; both were double wrapped in perfect little corn tortillas. The salsa bar has 2 types of yummy home made salsa...red and green...as well as some pickled veggies and fresh lime with which to flavor your food. I got 3 tacos, rice and beans and a fountain drink for under $10. Nice.
