Living in Scottsdale and commuting to Chandler for work everyday, I think I have eaten from the nices Latin restaurants (Distrito) to the hole in the ground (yes, not wall) ones.  

Los Taquitos has to be my favorite of all from top to bottom.  Walking in, I got the feeling I was in San Luis RC or Rocky point joint.  There's enough seating for a lunch crowd and a few outdoor seats when it gets crowded (or too cold inside).  

I ordered the Combo plate which came with three meats, beans, and rice.  I also got a side salsa, and I made a quick grab for the usual red salsa in a bottle.  

The three meats were flavorful and distinct.  I liked the beef which had a nice char to it.  The beans were the usual, but the rice was amazing.  It looks normal, but it was buttery, soft, and melted in your mouth.  The side salsa they give you is also a standout.  It was very fresh with a hint of sweetness to it which I'm wondering if it could be a pickled melon?

Hands down it's the place to go when I get a craving for Mexican food in the East Valley.
