This was my first visit.  So, I went with a #37 combination plate.  It had a taco, enchilada and a tamale.  All was very good but the tamale was dry (?) as it had already been unwrapped and had a chance to dry out before I received my meal.  The counter help was real nice.

The meals are served on black plastic plates.  The plastic utensils are long handled.  They offer Coke products and tea.  They were out of Mr Pibb during my visit.

It was good enough that I will stop back in.  And I would recommend the place to others.
