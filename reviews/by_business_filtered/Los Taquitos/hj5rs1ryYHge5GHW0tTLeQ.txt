I've had this one on the back burner for a while as I am rarely in this area but heard great things.  That said, stopped in after a round of golf for 3 (okay 4) Chicken tacos and was very impressed.  Simple, crisp, ingredients and outstanding flavor.  Everything a taco should be.  In fact, if they had Cerveza on site I could knock out a dozen.  That good.  Bonus was it was Taco Tuesday so only $1 each.  Love it and will return.

Only downside is the small location (but we stopped in for a late lunch around 2:30 so not an issue) and no beer.  I'm truly not an alcoholic but nothing improves a taco like a cold one.
