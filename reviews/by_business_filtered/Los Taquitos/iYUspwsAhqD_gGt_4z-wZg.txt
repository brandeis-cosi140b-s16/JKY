I had the 3 taco combo (carnitas, beef, and chicken) with beans and rice and added a fish taco.  Each one had it's own specific flavor and topping.  Everything was extremely fresh.  I think that the fish taco was my favorite.  The rice and beans seemed like they were good and you could tell they didnt come out of a can.  I didnt see any beer, which would have been great with the tacos.  But oh well. The mural itself is worth the trip.  it's really awesome.
