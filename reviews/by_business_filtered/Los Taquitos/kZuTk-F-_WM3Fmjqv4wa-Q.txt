So good. Small little joint on the beaten path with excellent food at a great price. Authentic street tacos, burritos and tamales all made fresh. This was my first visit, it was busy at lunch time which I'm told is the norm, but for good reason. You'll have a few minutes in line to figure out what you want to order, take advantage of your time there and be ready to order when it's your turn. You won't be disappointed!
