I was out in Phoenix in October. My Dad had mentioned seeing the Triple D show on Los Toquitos and said I might want to try it when I was there. A few friends in Phoenix said the same. We finally made it there on our last day in town. Glad we went there after the lunch rush because the dining room is pretty small. There was outside seating available though. 

The food was really good, I had the Carne Asada tacos, my son had the fish tacos. Both were excellent but the real surprise was how good the refried beans where. Usually the rice and beans are an afterthought and not much effort goes into them. The green sauce on the table was terrific too. I will definitely be back next time I am in the Phoenix area.
