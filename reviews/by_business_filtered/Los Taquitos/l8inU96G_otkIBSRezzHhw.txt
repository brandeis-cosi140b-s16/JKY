My boyfriend recently moved to Ahwatukee and we'd been on the lookout for another dive-y Mexican joint to replace our beloved El Bravo in Sunnyslope. After hitting two pizza places on a Monday night, both of which were closed, we made our way over to Los Taquitos. It's a bit easy to miss, tucked between the Safeway and Walgreens on Elliot and 48th st.

Right away, the place showed promise. Total dive-y interior, but without being dirty or unwelcoming. Counter service, formica tables/booths, fluorescent lighting, etc. We ordered and sat down to await our hopefully-tasty dinner.

While this place is no El Bravo, it was very, very tasty. We both ordered the #31, a Chimichanga combo plate (he got the steak and I got the grilled chicken), and fountain drinks. All total, the bill was under $19! I was pleasantly surprised to notice that the chimis were served with sides of sour cream and guac at no extra charge. Tasty guac, too, if not a little salty. Excellent rice and refried beans. So many Mexican places seem to serve the rice as an afterthought, but here it was very flavorful.

The chicken in my chimi was very tasty and cooked well. My bf's steak chimi was very good, the meat had a great grilled taste. Two kinds of bottled salsa on the table, one green and one red. I only tried the green and it wasn't that flavorful really. Just sort of spicy.

We were really glad we finally made it to Los Taquitos and hope to come back soon :)
