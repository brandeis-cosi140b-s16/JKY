WOWSERS!!! This place is delicious. 

F: I tried the carne asada and shrimp street tacos. They were just right. The only thing I didn't like was the shrimp taco needed just a little more flavor. They are grilled which I think taste better than the fried. I tried my brother's burrito and was pretty good. Wasn't overflowing with ingredients like other places. The red salsa is soooo good, better than green. Trust me.

S: The service was great. The register hottie knew what was in the food. Made some great recommendations, especially about which salsa to use for my tacos and burrito.

I highly recommend Los Taquitos, even if you live far, it is worth it. Give your taste buds a reward. Go now! Why are you still reading!?
