I just started working graveyard shift at my company and a colleague told me Los Taquitos was very close! Let me just say yesterday was my first day eating there... I ordered Pozole and 2 chicken tamales... And I came right back today! Today I ordered the enchiladas and 2 more of those delicious chicken tamales!!! The pozole was amazing!!! The soup comes with your choice of corn or flour tortillas of chips on the side. Oh and I had to order take out, food was hot and prepared great! Everyone was nice and professional. Very clean establishment. I can tell very fresh ingredients! As far as the pic the enchilada literally rolled / were upside down from my driving so I am not sure how the original presentation was. The enchiladas were half rojo half verde (red/green) which is really nice for an indecisive individual as myself lol! They were pretty good, I've had better, but I overall I would order again. Did I mention the tamales?!?! I put verde on them so flavorful... I must confess I think I am in love with them! Great prices and I hear there is $1 taco Tuesday!

Update: today is 12/17 I have a problem and literally addicted to this place lol! 3rd day in a row!!! Tried lengua taco, best I've had in my life and I have tried many at other places. Asada quesadilla is good... A different seasoning on the meet that I have not had before... Maybe it's chipotle because I usually don't order that flavor but still tasty. And the Horchata is unbelievably awesome!
