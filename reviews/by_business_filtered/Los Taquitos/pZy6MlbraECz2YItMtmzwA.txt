Sup par mexican food, with average service, in a grimy establishment.  This place is barely a notch above the crappy filaberto's that infest the phoenix area.  

Bland taco meats on walmart quality tortillas, and other cliche combos of meat, beans, & tortillas that is supposed to be "authentic" mexican food.  It's not even a bang for the buck as many places serve much better food for less.
