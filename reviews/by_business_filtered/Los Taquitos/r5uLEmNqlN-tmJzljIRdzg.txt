On recommendation from food network I came here and had tacos:  carne asada, and marinated pork and carnitas pork.  The tacos were the best ice ever eaten anywhere.  If I could explain the absolute explosion of flavor in my mouth in a word, it would be inappropiate for children... They are that good!   I also got a tamale that was a little dry unfortunately but I'll give them a pass on it.   I have a Arizona carne asada burrito waiting for later.  The girl at the counter said they are even better if you take them home and eat them later.   Outside watching people coming is comical.   Customers walk toward this place with such intent in their step as if the food were about to run out!  They scan to the sides eyeing up other people also making a bee line to the door and you can see them speed up...  I mean it is that good.  I'm from Baltimore and here in Phoenix looking for the best tacos... I beleieve I've scored!
