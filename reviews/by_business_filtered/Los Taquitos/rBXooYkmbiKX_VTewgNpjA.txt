After enjoying the food at their Tukee location a few times, I wondered if  the same flavors were available at their North Phoenix location. And happily, yes, they are. This is good stuff. There's a certain kick and complexity to the taste that you don't get in even the hearty Mexican drive-thrus like Filiberto's and such. It makes the extra cost seem worth it.

And note that I am comparing this, a relatively nice sit-down-type place, to  Filiberto's. Any comparisons to Garcias or other pre-fab GringoMex outlets aren't fair. To the GringoMex, I mean. LT blows them out of the water.

Anyway, they care about their food and it shows. The decor here is much better than in Tukee, which seems more or less like a taco shop set up in a hall closet. They even have a bar with a happy hour at this location.

The prices are higher than expected, but not extraordinary.

BTW: I think the photogenic nature of the counter help probably helped the place get that shot on Drive-in's Diners and Dives. Just sayin . . .
