Stopped in last evening with family. Ordered a quesadilla, smothered bean burrito and a smothered pork burrito, chips, salsa and guacamole. The chips, salsa and guacamole hit the mark. Everything else was below grade and cold. One of the gals (very pleasant) stopped by to see how things were and happily returned the plates to the kitchen to be heated up. Sadly, all that did was kinda warm things up, deform the plastic plates and make the tortillas chewy. Not a good experience.
