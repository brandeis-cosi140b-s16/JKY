Tried Los Taquitos today for lunch for the first time based on YELP reviews!  Once again - Thanks YELP!!

The food was excellent, I had the fish tacos, and my lunch date had the carne asada and lengua tacos - all were excellent.  We plan to go back there and experience more of their menu (I'm a sucker for Pozole - looking forward to trying theirs).

The restaurant is a bit cramped during the lunch hour with the people in line to order tripping over the people waiting for their orders and all being elbowed by the people trying to either pick up their food when it's ready or fill their drinks ("bit cramped" was an understatement).  Our plan of attack for future visits is to go at an off time, possible for a late lunch, hoping it won't be so packed then.
