I'm a sucker for carbs - burritos, rice, refried beans, you name it.  On a normal day, I'd get a burrito and be on my merry way but today I was greedy, and bit off more than I could chew (literally and figuratively).  I got a shrimp burrito meal.  I am stuffed and have no regrets.  Except that I realized on the way home, I forgot to get some of their amazing horchata.  Taking off a star cause of the girl at register who kept forgetting her previous sentence, and repeated everything at least twice.  If the food had been anything but amazing, this would have bugged the crap out of me, but thank god for their food.  It's been 4 hours - I'm still full.
