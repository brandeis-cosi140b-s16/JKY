Kinda torn about this place.

I'm a "hard shell taco" guy.  Just never have developed a liking for soft tacos.  I love tortillas, both corn and flour, but as a taco, I just don't dig that style.  If I want a soft tortilla, I'll order a burrito.

OK, enough about me.  On to the Los Taquitos review.

The Good:

The beans were very good.  Darker in color than your average re-fried beans, and had a "fuller" taste.  I and my 11-yr-old daughter both nommed the heck out of them.

The Carne Asada was very well-flavored and barely not too dry,  "walking the line" between moist and dry.

The salsa they provided in a plastic squirt bottle was VERY good - the right amount of heat (more than average) and with a good chile taste.  Had my daughter searching for watery relief.

The kids liked the chicken in the tacos.  Noticeably moist and flavorful. 

My daughter was a big fan of the cheese on the tacos.  Not sure what kind it was, but it was good.

The "Not-So-Good":

We had the hard shell tacos.  The shells were "VERY" hard.  Hard to the point that the whole taco collapsed after the first or second bite.  If they changed to a slightly better hard taco shell, these tacos would improve quite a bit.

The marinated pork was very dry, and neither of my kids liked the taste of the seasonings.

The meat portion of each taco was a little on the "skimpy" side.  We had massive amounts of shell left over with no meat remaining, after the tacos fell apart and we started eating the pile.

The "Blah":

The rice was standard, very bland.

So, all in all, this is a decent place.  I've been eating Mexican food in Texas, Arizona, and in a few other countries for most of the last 35 years.  This place is an above-average spot which could improve.

But anyone who says this is the "best Mexican food" has just not had enough of it to know better.
