I love this place, it's one of my favorite Diner Drive In and Dives, and I enjoy stopping anytime I get a chance and am going through the Phoenix area.  The restaurant area has expanded, and it looked cleaner and nicer than ever.  They are doing well.  I normally order the triple taco place with rice and beans, and it never fails to amaze me - the flavors in the meats are cooked in just perfectly.  I had a combo this time of chicken, carne asada, and carnitas - all excellent with the absolute right amount of spice.  Perfectly flavored rice, and just the right amount of cheese in the beans.  There were no tables outside like there have been in the past, and we had our dog with us, so they had no problem letting us taking a table outside, and we put it back when we were done!!  This is the perfect along the freeway fast and delicious stand-by!
