I stopped by on a Wednesday about 5:30. I got the pollo flautas with beans and rice. They came with sour cream and guacamole. The flautas were crisp and the chicken was tender.  Beans were good and traditional. But the rice!!! Reminded me of my grandpa's Mexican rice and I was so happy to experience it once more!  I will definitely be back.
