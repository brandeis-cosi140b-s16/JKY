This is definitely one of my favorite Mexican places to visit when I'm back home from school. I usually get a marinated pork burrito with red sauce on top, and it is absolutely delicious. It's spicy and tastes extremely authentic considering that this restaurant is located in Ahwatukee. It's a nice little hole-in-the-wall place that is especially great for pick-up orders.
