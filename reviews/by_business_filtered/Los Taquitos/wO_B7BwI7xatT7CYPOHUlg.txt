In the mood for quick and amazing Mexican food? Los Taquitos is the place to go! Weather it be for Street Tacos, a massive Burrito, or tamales, you can expect an awesome meal here.

Meg and I have come to Los Taquitos more times than I can count. The service is always quick and friendly. With their new renovations they now have a wide open and colorful dining area with plenty of tables for groups big and small.

Of the many things we've had, it's a tie between the Street Tacos and the Tamales plate as my favorite. The three street taco plate comes with all the fixings, your choice of taco meat (which can be different for each one), rice and beans. I recommend their Carne Asada which has the perfect flavor to it.

The tamale plate is the closest thing to my Nana's homemade tamales I've found here in the valley. The beef tamales were really fluffy with spicy red chili beef cooked in. The plate comes with two tamales which, like the tacos, can be a mix of their three flavors: Beef, Chicken, or Cheese. 

I can go on and on about all the things we've had there because we keep coming back any time we get the chance. The food speaks for itself as some of the best in Phoenix.
