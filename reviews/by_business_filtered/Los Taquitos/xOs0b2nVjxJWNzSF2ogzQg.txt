Great little restaurant, great service. Just down the street from the Hilton Resort.  Quality food.  We had a wet carne asana burritos and street tacos.  Very tasty and delicious.  If you are staying at the Hilton and want quality food and service, you won't be disappointed.  Stay away from Aunt Chiladas across the street from Hilton it's horrible.
