We go here often because it's right by our house and also because the food is really good and nicely priced. We kind of have our regulars now: I'll always get the carne asada tacos and my wife will order the fish tacos and neither of those (sides included) ever seems to disappoint. 

We did venture from our favorites in the beginning and everything we had was still good but we settled on our usuals. The only menu item we didn't really enjoy was the enchiladas. They weren't horrible but definitely not anything we'd order again. It's also pretty tough to make good enchiladas in a short amount of time though (IMO). 

Overall, good cheap taco spot with some amazing rice as well!
