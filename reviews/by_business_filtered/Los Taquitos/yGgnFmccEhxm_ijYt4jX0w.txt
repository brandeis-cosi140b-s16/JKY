My favorite taco spot, period.

I usually eat 7-8 (street) tacos in a sitting....the carnitas, carne asada, chicken are my favorites in that order.  Rice and beans finish the job nicely.

I brought a coworker from Costa Rica here.  He didn't like the food in ANY of the local restaurants I took him to because none of the meat had the great flavor he was used to...except for this place.  He was horking down 12-15 carne asada tacos in one sitting!  Insanity, but a testament to how good their food is.  

Five stars, every time.
