Came here because my husband and I were looking for a really good taco shop in the area. We are used to San Diego tacos so we hoped AZ could measure up to CA shops. This place DEFINITELY measured up. 

Nice and clean dining area, friendly staff and yummy food. I got the AZ style Carne asada burrito. Which was pretty much guacamole, rice and beans inside the burrito. Didn't make sense but it was deeeeeeelicious.  My hubby had a Carne asada taco and tostada.  They were super yummy! Their happy hour started at 4 pm so we ordered a beer and a house margarita. The margarita was strong and very tasty. 

Apparently they have a good taco tuesday, I think $1 tacos or something.  Definitely coming back to check it out.
