Win!  We were recommeded to try this place by Mr. Guy Fieri and Diners, Drive-ins and Dives.  Previously we'd had some misses with his recommendations.  Turns out this place is pretty kick ass.  Simple menu items and very affordably priced.  Now you're asking... how does it taste?  Ah. Mazing.

Got gitchya some.
