I ordered Carne Asada torta and 3 tacos(cabeza, chicken, and pastor).  All was very good flavor.  The cost was $16, which is not bad for the amount of food, but they were a little light on the meat, I'm sure it's a good business model, but I would expect a lot of meat for the price.  I would recommend if you are looking for very flavorful Mexican food!
