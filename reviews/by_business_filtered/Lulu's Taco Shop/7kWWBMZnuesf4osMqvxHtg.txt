Great great great tacos!
I go to a restaurant for the food first.  As long as it is clean, and Lulu's is, then sitting in, what looks like a used McDonalds booth, doesn't bother me a bit.  Afterall, it's a taco shop!
I like the fish tacos (the small ones) and I usually order 3 of them.  I like how they are made and it reminds me of what you can normally find in Mexico, not at these chain restaurants.
The Ceviche tostada is really good too, but is difficult to eat, so don't wear your sunday best.
Not in the mood for fish, then try the carne asada tacos or any other kind for that matter.

Lulu's is a great place and a break from the Americanized Mexican Food, we see everyday.

Enjoy it for what it is!
