Lulu's isn't cheap.
Now that I got that out of the way let me say that I love Lulu's chicken Enchiladas.
LOVE.
No, the tortillas are not homemade.
No, there isn't anything else on the menu that is exceptional.
Lulu's chicken enchiladas are graced by an amazingly delicious marinade and sauce unparalleled by other local eateries. Ask them to leave the onions off! I think it is a yellow mole. Not sure... plenty of canella, possibly some pumpkin in the sauce and sweet spicy goodness.
My Lulu's chicken enchiladas addiction cost me some money over the years. 
Que rico!
Lulu's would get five stars from me if not for the slightly high prices.
