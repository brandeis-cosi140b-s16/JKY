If you think Filiberto's is good food, then you will like this place.
Fish tacos were dry and as tasteless as the lukewarm beans and that fluffy rice thing.  I love Gilbert and want to support the mom and pop's but this is not good.
How has this place been around so long is beyond me.  I've driven by it for years and figured it must be great so finally gave it a try.  Bummer.
