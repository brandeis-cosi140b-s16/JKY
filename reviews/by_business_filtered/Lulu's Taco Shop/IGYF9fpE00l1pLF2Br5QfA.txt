As a Los Angeles native, I know Mexican food. I know tacos.

We came late Sunday night after a long day of moving. An hour before closing, we were worried that we'd be getting the left overs that's been sitting out all day. 

We both ordered 2 tacos each and rice and beans. 

I had carne asada & el pastor tacos. The tacos were the perfect size!!! The rice and beans were fresh, and delicious.  So good, I can eat there everyday!!

The place was so cute, nothing fancy. Just a taco shop, it felt like home.
