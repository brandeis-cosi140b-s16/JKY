So after reading the reviews for Lulu's, and with the fact that it's literally right down the street from me, I decided to head over and take this place for a test drive since I had the day off.  Pretty unassuming from the outside, I walked in and noticed the salsa bar to the side of the counter. Good start, this meant I was definitely gonna have to order the chips and salsa. I talked to the woman behind the counter for a few to get an idea of what to expect with certain dishes, and I settled on three regular tacos so I could try a couple different kinds of meat. I ordered one chicken, one steak, and one shredded beef. Now, when I got them home I was a little bummed that they were on the small side, but each one was delicious in it's own way. The steak was perfect, much better than what you find at most places. The shredded beef had an amazing flavor, despite dripping a combination of spice and grease, and the chicken was fajita style chunks of pure white meat. Delicious! My only complaint was the salsa...I tried all three, but none of them were particularly stellar. The best of the three was the one labeled "Salsa for chips", but it was nothing to write home about. All of them were kind of just bland and average at best. Despite the minor salsa bummer, I will DEFINITELY be back here...now I know to rock the super tacos (a bit more expensive, but surely bigger), and load up on those and bypass the chips and salsa. Maybe give the rice a try for round two...either way, check out Lulu's, good food here!
