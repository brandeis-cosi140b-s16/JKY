I have been here three times now, my kids love the crunchy tacos and I enjoyed them as well.  I decided to try the Pozole and was not disappointed, a little pricey, but very good.

The enchiladas were not my favorite, the enchilada sauce contained cinnamon and I have never been a fan of that.

The street tacos with ground beef and the Carne Asada were a tad pricey but again very good.

The fresh homemade Jamaica and Horchata were fantastic.

Here is my complaint, if your bill isn't at least $15.00 and you pay with plastic they charge you 80 extra cents. Not to sound like a cheapskate, but check out a new processor.
