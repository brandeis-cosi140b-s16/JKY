We stopped by tonight, a quarter to 9pm to get take out. We've never been here before but have been wanting to try it out since we moved nearby. We walked in and said hello to the teenage girl working behind the counter who did not respond. She was counting change and turned to look at the clock on the wall. My fianc√©e asked are you still open to which she gave him the finger to hold on and then said we close in 10 mins. I told him lets go as she had already given us enough bad service. As we walked out she put her purse on and turned the lights off before we even got into our car. We won't be going back with that type or service. Too bad management hasn't taught this teenage girl any customer service. We will just continue to give other local Gilbert restaurants our loyal service.
