Not going to lie, was not super impressed.  

Used a yelp deal for breakfast, the lady who took our order then walked back and made the food.  

Feel like I could have made the food better at my house.  

Probably won't be coming back any time soon.  

Obnoxiously playing spongebob on the tv extremely loud, even though there were no kids there.
