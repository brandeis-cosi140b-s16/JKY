This was good mexican food.  I enjoyed the salsa bar (mostly the hot carrots!!)  It is nice to be able to have a beer also at a counter service restaurant.

I ordered the chili relleno plate.  It was good but I think I will try something different next time.  The tortillas were really good and I think I would go there again just to get tortillas to go.  Yum!

Oh and I am a fan of aqua fresca and they had a delicious cantaloupe one.  mmmmmmm
