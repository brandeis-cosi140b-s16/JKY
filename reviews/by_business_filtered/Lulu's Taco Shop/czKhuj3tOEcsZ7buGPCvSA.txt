A Gilbert staple. I personally love the asada breakfast burrito. Total goodness. 
BUT.....after the last stop here, here's what I noticed.

ONE EMPLOYEE, she took my order and went back herself and made my burrito and this time it was tiny, not my usual plump fat burrito. Hmmmm......hope I caught it on an off day.
