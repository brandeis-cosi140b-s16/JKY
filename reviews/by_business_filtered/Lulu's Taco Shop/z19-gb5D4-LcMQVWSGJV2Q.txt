REAL Mexican food- not your fast food, no choice, no flavor food. Typical menu and everything I wanted and more! Reasonably priced-I was a little put off at first that I had to pay for chips and salsa, but well worth it. My husband and I will def be back for dinner again- friendly staff, simply decorated and delicious food.
