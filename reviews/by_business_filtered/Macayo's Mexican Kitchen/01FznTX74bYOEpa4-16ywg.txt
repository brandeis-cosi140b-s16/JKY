First of all I am a Macayo's lover. My mother and I went to the one in Surprise. We wanted to sit in the bar and do a take out order. The hostess at the front said the take out lady was not answering the phone so we had to walk all the way around to the side (My mother is handicapped) to do our order because it seems she was lazy and did not want to go get the girl. So we walked all the way around. She shows up and not very apologetic about s having to walk all the way around. So we place our order and walk all the way back around so we could sit in the bar and have a drink. Bar tender very nice. The lady brings our food to the bar. Very nice. We take the food home and I got to say it was not very good. The taco had very little meat in it. My mother would not even eat hers. The enchilada was so tiny and not very much. Beans in all the orders were small. My daughter's chimi has enchilada sauce on it, which I never asked for. Made the chimi shaggy. Not very happy with our experience with take out. Probably will not do that again.
