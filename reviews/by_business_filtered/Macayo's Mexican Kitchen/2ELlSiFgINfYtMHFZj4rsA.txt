This place has been popular ever since it opened. We were sorely lacking a decent non-fast food restaurant in this part of the city and Macayo's fits the bill. The salsa, as another reviewer mentioned, is really really good. I usually go with the Chimichanga and it never disappoints. The decor is very colorful and lively. I would say it's a good value for the money. If you're going on a Friday or Saturday night you should make reservations. It can be a long wait otherwise.
