The food here is good, but the service could use some work.  My personal pet peeve is when a single dish of multiple diners does not come out in a timely manner.  The fact it has happened here more than once means that something is up back there that I think they should fix.

Macayos has been around long enough to know what they need to work on...since the food never changes.  In any event, I am sure we will go back some time when dining with people who are indifferent to service quality.
