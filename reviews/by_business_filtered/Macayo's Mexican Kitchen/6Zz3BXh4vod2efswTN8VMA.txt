Food was acceptable but the prices, even for lunch, were a bit much (the total check was $90 for 2 people, and we only had 2 drinks each).
I enjoyed the margaritas, however I learned later (not by my server) that they had a "mug" price of less than $5 each!
If you're going for a casual atmosphere, excellent margaritas and an acceptable meal, this is the place.
