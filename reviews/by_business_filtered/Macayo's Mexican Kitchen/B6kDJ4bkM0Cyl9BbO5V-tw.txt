I was here a few weeks ago and was very disappointed in the cleanliness, staff and ambiance. I mean what bar serves shots in small glasses vs shot glasses. My friend and I were discussing when a young man name Jeff asked how things were, he assured us if we come back in few weeks we would see a difference. Jeff must of been the manager cause the employees were really moving once he arrived. I am happy to report I returned for dinner and what a difference... We were greeted, the bar area was clean and I received my shot in a shot glass... I can't wait to see the other changes that are made, since the change in leadership is already evident.
