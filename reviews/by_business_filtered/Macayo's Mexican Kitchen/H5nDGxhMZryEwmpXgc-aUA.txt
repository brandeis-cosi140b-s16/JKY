My friends and I went to happy hour this weekend. I must say it wAsnt too busy and we had a great time, not to mention the service and drinks were great. We were advised on the margarita specials and they were lovely. The bartender was friendly and courteous. Our server, Lorena was courteous and prompt with our meals. Thx again.
