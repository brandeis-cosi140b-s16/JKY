I'm not one to typically share a negative review as everyone has their own opinion and yelp ratings are so important to restaurant owners... but this one just requires some feedback.  My wife and I came here based on the many five star reviews and found the food quality to be way below average.  She got the shrimp tacos and had to send then back and didn't want anything else.  The waitress told us the fish is frozen and the end result definitely proved it.  Even though she nibbled on my dinner we still didn't finish it between the two of us.  Happy hour drink specials were great but the food was so bad that we will not be back.
