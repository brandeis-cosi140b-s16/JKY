I am telling you I don't think I ever really have a bad experience here. They took the Pollo Espinaca Enchilada off the menu, but there is one girl there, who usually works the drive through, who knows what it is.
The chips are thin and warm, and I love the hotter salsa.
Salmon was awesome and if you wanna go fattie style, the Pollo Fundito (I think I may have spelled that wrong) is AWESOME!
I also have the girl and guy margarita cups, those suckers are HUGE and make my face go numb half way through. Keep in mind, I am a light weight though!!!
