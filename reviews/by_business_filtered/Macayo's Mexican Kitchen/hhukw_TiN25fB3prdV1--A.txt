If I would have written this review a few years ago it would've been 5 stars and 4-5 on every visit. The carnitas are always good , they serve pepsi products , the mexican common dishes are always solid and the restaurant is colorful. What changed,  I don't know. There was a Manager named Conrad who retired , he seemed a little laid back , some workers loved him the others did not . It didn't matter to us , when he was there everything went off without a hitch , no kitchen errors , great service , hot food with cold garnish and not dried out rice. I think the big difference now is the food may sit before coming out , and the servers aren't as seasoned. Some are great , Crystal in Pickup is great , But getting a good server , the correct order and it being fresh is like hitting the lottery. Hands down this used to be my favorite for a consistently solid Mexican meal. Arribas in Goodyear and Rio El Mirage on Bell and Litchfield have jumped ahead.
