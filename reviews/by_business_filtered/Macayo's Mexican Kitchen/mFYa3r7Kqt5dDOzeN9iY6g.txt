This is the most consistent place my parents like in Surprise. While it's no Old Town San Diego Mexican fare, I think it deserves four stars for a good menu, excellent lunch specials, spot-on service, and consistency.

I guess it's a chain; I haven't been to any of the other locations. It has a little bit of the feel of a chain, but not excessively. Their branding and marketing is pretty good and if I were in another town and came upon a Macayo's, I'd probably go.

My favorite dish is probably the chicken chimichanga. The burritos are good and I like the enchiladas a lot, too. The food is never dry and the sauces are all really good.

The portions are generous, mostly. I don't think I have ever been able to finish a meal there. They also load you up with a bunch of chips and salsa (like any good Mexican restaurant should). Mmmm-mmmm.

The one time I ordered a margarita, I wasn't terribly impressed. Maybe that was a fluke, but I know that at restaurants like Macayo's, it's usually just a marg mix. 

We've never had a problem with service. It's always been prompt and they're quick to fill your water glasses and make sure you have enough chips and salsa. Everyone has been nice on every one of the visits I've been there. The service is the biggest reason I give Macayo's four stars.

I have only one small gripe: why is it an up-charge to get beans *and* rice with a dish? That's the nice thing about the lunch specials - often they come with beans and rice - but most dishes, aside from many of the lunch specials, have either rice or beans. C'mon: rice and beans belong together! Like ketchup and mustard. Salt and pepper. Bonnie and Clyde. Harry and Sally. You get my point.
