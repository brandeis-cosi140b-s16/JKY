Jenny at the bar is great. Very friendly, outgoing and prompt. Service was fast. Reggie, was prompt with chips and salsa.     Well when my husband and I got home, we started feeling sick. Throughout the whole night, I was in the bathroom. This hasn't been the first time we've gotten sick from eating here. I just thought it might have been a fluke before. But we won't be eating here again. Not sure what has changed in the past few years. Except for poor management. And pathetic bar appearance. This place has really gone down hill. New servers every time you walk in. Not good.
