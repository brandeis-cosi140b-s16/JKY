I worked here for a total of 3 weeks and quit due to the abusive leadership of the managers. I gladly picked up my last check from them yesterday and filed a complaint with the head of HR at the corporate office. I hope at some point they learn that praise instead of criticism is much more effective in a workplace. Also, purposely overwhelming servers as well as treating them like crap and yelling at them for things out of there control is NOT okay. I was the second server in 3 days to lock them selves in the bathroom to cry their eyes out because of how mistreated they were. I will never step foot in this building again.
