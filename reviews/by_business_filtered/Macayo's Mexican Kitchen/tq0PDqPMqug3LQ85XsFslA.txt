Well-I've lived in Az since 1955 and ate at the original Woody's Macayo and continued to eat at many different locations for years and years.  For the last 2 years we frequented Italian places mainly Carrabas, and not Macayos. Decided to go back for some great Mexican food for lunch, but to our surprise things had changed drastically.  For one thing you deleted the A la Carte menu.  The Mex & Match  deleted the red & green burro-- you have to pay extra!  My sister ordered a house margarita that didn't seem to have any alcohol in it--I tasted it to check-yes very little alcohol for the price of $6.79.  Myself and another sister decided to have water because of the prices of everything--Thank God--the check for 3 people for lunch was $50.00.  Could have gone to PoPo's for $30.00.  It will be PoPo's from now on
