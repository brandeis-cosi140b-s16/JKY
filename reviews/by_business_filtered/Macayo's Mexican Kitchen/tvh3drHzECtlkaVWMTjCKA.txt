I must say that I had a very pleasurable experience here a few weeks ago.  Went in for happy hour and the gal at the bar took great care of me and my friend. I believe her name was Kim.  Long black hair, pretty smile and made the best margarita I've had in a long time. Kudos to to her and the nice atmosphere. Thanks again. J
