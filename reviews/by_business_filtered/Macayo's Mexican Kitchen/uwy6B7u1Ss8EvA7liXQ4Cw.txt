I live really close to this location and have to say that it seems to be getting worse and worse on the service. I understand that the servers are busy and they have full sections most of the time but when you wait five minutes to get a drink order and ten minutes before the chips and salsa arrive it is kinda bothersome. I can see if the place was completely packed but every time i come here it seems to get worse not better. oh and dont try to order anything ala carte cause just one chicken enchillada will run you over five dollars, are you fricken kiding me must be made of gold.
