When my family moved to Surprise 4 years ago I loved Macayo's! It was my favorite place to grab Mexican food in Surprise. Over the past 18 months it has really gone down. On my last visit the server told me she brought me what I ordered and I must have ordered wrong. What?!? Even if I did it would have been nice for the server to attempt to fix the problem. 

I will continue to go to Macayo's with friends and sit in the bar for happy hour. As for a place to regularly go to meals with my family, not so much.
