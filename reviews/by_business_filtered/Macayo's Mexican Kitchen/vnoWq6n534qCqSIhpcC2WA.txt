Went there today ate in and ordered a burrito to go for my son when we got home it was so soggy my my finger went straight threw it and that was 15 minutes after leaving! I called and spoke with the manager she said that is how it is supposed to be and would not give me a refund even tho i didn't take one bite of it!! Horrible service even worse people
