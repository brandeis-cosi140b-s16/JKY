Don't come Macayo's expecting great food or even good food. I have only tried their happy hour which is until 6:30 on weekdays. On the few occasions I have come it has been with regulars and the service is always impeccable. The staff is very sweet and accommodating and they seem to know all the regulars by name. 

The food is lacking in pretty much every ways but if you stick to the happy hour menu and keep your expectations low, you'll have a great time. Margaritas are cheap and tasty and I've always had a good time when I'm there, for what it's worth.
