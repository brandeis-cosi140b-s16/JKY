I have been going to Macayo's since I was a toddler. It is by far my favorite Mexican restaurant in town, and I've tried almost all of them. 

Parking is a pain at this location, and getting in and out of the parking lot is a little dangerous, but totally worth it!

The Sahara location always seems to be loud, they always have parties going on, but it doesn't take away from the atmosphere at all- it adds to it! 

I loooove the Tostada Del Mundo! It's one of the best things on the menu!
