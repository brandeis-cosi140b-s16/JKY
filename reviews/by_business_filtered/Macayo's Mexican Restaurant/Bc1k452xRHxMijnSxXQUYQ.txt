During one of our visits to this location, I ordered a dish, but without chicken, as I was trying out a vegetarian diet at the time. The waitress brings it out with chicken. I politely remind her that I had ordered it without. She argues with me and tells me, "No, you ordered this with chicken!" Shocked that she's arguing with me, I incredulously reply, "I'm on a vegetarian diet, why would I order it with chicken?" She gave more attitude and we talked about not going back.

A few months went by and we decided to give this location one more chance. Our food was terrible (overcooked, etc). We asked to swap out our entries. My wife, on the way back to our table from the bathroom, overheard the waiter making fun of us for being too picky. Who does that? How can such a person even have a job as a waiter? Hopefully, he got a job picking up trash on the side of the road and no longer works there. But we'll never know because we are never ever ever going back to Macayo's.

In summary: poorly prepared food and even worse service. Save yourself a trip. If you want to know what it's like dining here, just stay home, microwave a burrito, and repeatedly smack yourself in the face with it.
