I debated giving this place one star, but I can't say that the food was gross. My boyfriend raved about this place so we decided to come her for dinner tonight. He hasn't lived here for a few years, and clearly things here have changed. Our margaritas were weak, with way too much sour mix. The salsa was the worst I have had in a mexican restaurant and was clearly from a can. If it wasn't from a can, I am fascinated that a human made fresh food taste like that. The queso tasted like cheese wiz with some rotel. Our mean was mediocre. The portion sizes were large, but what is the point if the food sucks? I ate half my burrito and didn't bother to take the rest home. Then we waited what seemed like forever for our check. Save your money and go to Taco Bell. Better yet, spend the same amount and go to Laticias for an enjoyable meal.
