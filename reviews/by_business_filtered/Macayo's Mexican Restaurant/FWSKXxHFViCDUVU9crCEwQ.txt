I've been coming to Macayos all my life and it is one of my favorite restaurants to frequent in the Vegas valley. They do Mexican food and they do it pretty well. I most often order the fajitas to share with someone and they are always delicious! 

Lots of complaints in these reviews about the chips and salsa, but personally I love the chips and especially love the smooth salsa.
