Not sure who's putting up these positive reviews...This place sucked. Service was slow and not at all friendly. I had a chicken chimichanga that was made with dried canned chicken and bland rice on the side.  My girlfriend had tacos that she said made Taco Bell seem like a viable option next time we're seeking Mexican food. I took a bite and agreed.
