I've been eating here since I was a kid. The food is pretty good, but the service is just "ok". I remember wanting to work there after I graduated high school but their ad's said they only took people with a minimum of 2 years experience. Funny because now I've graduated college and I've worked in restaurants for 6 years and the service is nothing "2-years experience" worthy. The server always seems to be abrupt, in a hurry, and not personable. I actually had to get up and go to the water pitchers to refill my drink. I keep coming back for 2 reasons: 1- this is 1 of 2 places my brother can for sure eat at with his allergy, and 2 - the food is good.
