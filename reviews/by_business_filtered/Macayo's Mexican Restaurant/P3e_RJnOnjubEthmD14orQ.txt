We go because we've gone since we were little. We go because of Cha Cha and Bob. We go for the world's most delicious chips and salsa. We go for the TCTs. We go because it's delicious. The new location is bright and clean. Service is quick and friendly. I love my cheese enchiladas! And I love to fill my Cha Cha's huge hat with margaritas. Cheers.
