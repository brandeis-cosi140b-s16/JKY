Great Americanized Mexican food. The food is always yummy and quite tasty. 

This particular location is one of my favorites in town. The area is nice and the restaurant itself is so big and spacious. No cramping in or having to squeeze into the tables/booths. Yeah for no claustrophobia seating like some of their other older locations. 

I really enjoy the food here. No, it's not what my Mexican family makes, but it is good for what it is. I am addicted to their Baja sauce. You could put it on shoe leather and I would eat it up and ask for more! Do yourself a favor and try the Baja enchiladas with extra Baja loveliness. 

As well as the Baja sauce, their smooth salsa is delightful. I have been known to pour it all over whatever I am eating for an extra level of yum. It also goes wonderfully with the Baja sauce. I live me some saucy goodness!!!

If you aren't in the mood for a big meal, check out the mini chimichangas. Add cheese on top and you have a great snack. Throw in a margarita and you have a party in your mouth!

The prices are really quite reasonable too. They have great weekday lunch specials, as well as happy hour specials. Also check your neighborhood newspaper and they put coupons in pretty regularly.
