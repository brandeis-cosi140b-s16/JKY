We came in with a party of 12 for a birthday. The server messed up our meal which was supposed to be a shrimp dish with white cream sauce. The sauce tasted like it came straight from a can and we had to eat it after everybody else in our party was already finished with their meal.

Very disappointed!

We won't come back anytime soon. This restaurant was great for years, but not anymore.
