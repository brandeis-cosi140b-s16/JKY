This place is worse and worse. Last night I came with my family. We didn't receive chips and salsa. The table next to us that sat down after we did was on their second round of  chips and salsa. I had to literally get up and ask someone for it. When it finally did come our food pretty much came right after. :] The server never did any check backs to ask how everything was going, and obviously no checks to make sure we were receiving chips/salsa. Plates were cleared before we were done eating and without asking if the person was done. That's pleasant. We weren't asked if we wanted dessert the check was just dropped off. WHERE is the service? Are the sections that huge that the servers are incapable of providing the standard service necessary to run a restaurant? This is Las Vegas which has a billion restaurants. Applebee's has better service than this place, and consistently I might add. We only come here for the food now. I don't know what we're tipping for when it is this horrible.
