First off, I work sort of late so at 7:45pm I called this location to get closing time & was told 10pm.  We arrived at Macayos at 8:55 pm and was promptly sat.  We were approached few min later by a heavy set Hispanic man (apparently our server) keep in mind not with a welcome but telling us they close in 2 min.  I informed him I did call before arriving & was told they close at 10.  Apparently, I frustrated him so he went and got Sammy to get our order.  Although Sammy was very nice he took our order in some blue gloves & served our food in same gloves (serving our food at same time as our desserts) Now I know for a fact Sammy was a busser & this is definitely NOT his job.  Handling food & disposing of dirty plates is a health code violation & his gloves illustrated Sammy probably didn't wash his hands. And I do commend Sammy for taking us when our server didn't care to serve us, if it wasn't for Sammy had we even got any service???  No one checked on us we were just given the cold shoulder.  Just shameful service.  I work as a server in one of the 5 star casinos on Las Vegas strip, had I provided service in which I received here I would have been in the managers office after shift.  SMH sad service Macayo.
