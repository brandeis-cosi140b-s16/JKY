I HEART MARGARITAS BABYYY

I think I found my drink now that this place introduced itself to me during HAPPY HOUR:
 All week long! 3:30 pm - 6:30 pm (Available in Bar & Patio Only)

Happy Hour Specials: $4.75 16oz. Margarita de Macayo, $2.50 Domestic Bottle Beer, $3 Import Bottle Beer, &  1/2 price appetizers

Also, spreading the word here: $5.99 Lunch Specials 11am-3pm Mon-Fri

Monday_ Chimichanga de Macayo

Tuesday_ Beef taco & cheese enchilada with rice & beans

Wednesday_ Red or green chile burro with rice & beans

Thursday_ Chicken taco & chicken enchilada with rice & beans 

Friday_ Two cheese enchiladas with rice & beans

With that all announced, to my amazement the 1/2 price appetizers are big portions and one dish seems to do the job ;) (satisfaction) By the way, they sell this really cool señorita/señor glass cups & every time you bring it back to the bar you get discounted on your margarita drinks (I think at a minimum of 2 servings) 

Margarita Flavors: Strawberry, Mango, Peach, Melon, Raspberry, & Banana (I've tried all but banana & I'm in love) 

   Not to mention, the addicting chips & salsa served right when you're seated is just a teaser... 

BE PREPARED TO GET YOUR MEXI GRUB ON! & ENJOY!
