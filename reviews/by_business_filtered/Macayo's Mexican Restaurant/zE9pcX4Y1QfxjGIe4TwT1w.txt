Been coming here my whole life, we have brought in birthdays, anniversaries and more. I love the chips and salsa and usually the service is always good. I love the enchiladas, shredded beef and green sauce. I have also had a steak there and it had cheesy goodness on top...bomb.

They have a good happy hour as well:)
