Brought my dad here for dinner, as we were craving Mexican food and am glad we did! Not only did we receive top-notch service (Many thanks to our amazing waiter, Ken), but our food was so good and served in a matter of minutes from when we ordered it. And you thought only Jimmy John's served your food to you lightning fast?! 

Ken made sure our glasses were filled, checked in on us to see how we liked our meals, and was very efficient. He also pronounced my dad's last name correctly when giving him back his credit card after dad paid the bill. That deserves kudos in my eyes right there as my family last name is hard to pronounce and hard to spell for many people, despite it only being 6 letters. 

I had the Baja Chimi and it was so good and filling! I will definitely order that again! 

Great service + great food + great company=An outstanding experience!
