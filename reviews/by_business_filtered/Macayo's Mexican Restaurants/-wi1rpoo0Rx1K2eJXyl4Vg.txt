I hadn't been to Macayo's in years & was craving Mexican food so my dad & I headed over there for lunch today.

The 1st thing I thought when entering one of the dining rooms, wow so tacky! The only up-to-date thing in the place were the flat screen tvs, everything else was from the 80's & 90's. Our server was friendly & checked on us a few times, nice guy.

The chips & salsa were pretty good, chips were nice & hot & the salsa was ok. Dad ordered the lunch burro with chicken, hold the rice, cheese & sour cream. I ordered the shredded beef chimichanga with a side of rice. I opted to not have the red sauce on top & our server suggested I get the baja sauce instead so I did, on the side. Dad enjoyed his burro, ate the whole thing. My chimichanga was tasty & I did like the baja sauce, however the rice was nasty. It had a strange taste to it, almost like plastic-yuck!

Overall, we'd probably come back but we're not in any hurry.
