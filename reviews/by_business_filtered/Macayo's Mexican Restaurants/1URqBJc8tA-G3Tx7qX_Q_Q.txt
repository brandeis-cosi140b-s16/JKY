Well Beloved n I haven't been to a Macayo's in quite a bit. Now I know why.  Friday night thought we done at different restaurant than the usual.   Macayo's had a no wait so we scooted right in. Waiter was ok. I ordered a carne asada chimi Beloved ordered a carnitas plate. The wait for food was reasonable, however the beans were overcooked both rice n beans super dry the chimi has a sauce that seen better days Beloved didn't fare much better same issue with beans n rice The carnitas were large chunks of beef that I could see from across the table that they were very dry. Carnitas could have greatly benefited from a sauce to make them platable.  
 My two cents No Mas
