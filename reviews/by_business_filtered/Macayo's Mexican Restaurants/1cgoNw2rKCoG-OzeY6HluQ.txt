The food is edible, I had the simplest Chicken salad and I didn't even know it was supposed to be minimal. They gave me a chicken salad that consisted of chicken, lettuce and cheese and charged me extra for the pico de gallo, I didn't think that was very cool of them. Honestly, it tasted really good after I put that salsa in there. The absolutely best part of being there was the DJ they had that was playing 90's rock i.e. Nine Inch Nails, Bush, Sublime, 311 etc and some of the new hip music. We were very impressed. 

We weren't impressed with the waitress. She was lousy, not very attentive and took so long to get back to us. The place however was huge I did not know I was sitting in a  patio until my friend lit her cig and I finally looked up hah. It was clean and nicely decorated there was a large bar off to the side of the patio and a large fountain. It has a really good vibe to it. We were there early so I could only imagine how it was going to be later on that night. 

So besides my waitress being inadequate everything was cool there. I wish I knew the DJ playing though, he was awesome.
