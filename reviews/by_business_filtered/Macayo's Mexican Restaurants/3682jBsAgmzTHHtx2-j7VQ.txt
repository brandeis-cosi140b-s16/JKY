The good: Great service, nice decor in the seating area, very colorful n peppy place, okay food. 

The average: I won't call anything bad here but certainly average. I found the food not too flavorful and more saucy than I have had at other mexican places. They serve nice hot chips and salsa complimentary but again the salsa was bit less spicy for my liking. 

The fajita had big thick slices of veggies like squash n zuchinni - too thick to wrap in tortillas, not grilled well n not seasoned enough. 

All in all, good place to catch a few drinks and appetizers but not so much for a tasty hearty meal.
