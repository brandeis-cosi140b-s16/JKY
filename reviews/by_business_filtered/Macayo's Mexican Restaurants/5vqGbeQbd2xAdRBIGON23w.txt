Went to Macayo's on Central last night for dinner. HUGE mistake. We sat in the dining area and our waiter asked us our drinks (pink lemonade and raspberry iced tea) and then we get chips and salsa with watered down salsa  then the waiter comes about 10 mins later brings drinks (sprite/almost clear watered down raspberry iced tea) then he was helping the table next to us so after I call him and he kept on walking (maybe he didn't hear me) until the second time he came back and I got his attention then I order a coke instead and he takes our order. I ordered the mini chimies. 15 mins later I was greeted with dark brown on a plate and looked like they were fried in 10 day old dirty cooking oil or even possibly "refried" (wouldn't surprise me with all the watered down stuff) so because i had other stuff to do I decided not to complain and attempt to eat what they had given me and there are 6 which I ate 3 and I was tapped out on burnt grease...so he gives ME the bill which he watches me pull out my card and pay but when he comes back he hands my card and receipt to my guest.

Well I thought last night was a mistake but it didn't end there. Today I STILL have an after taste of grease. I have tried drinking a bubbly soda and chewing gum, popped an anti-acid and nothing...I literally had to leave work early and now laying here in my bed feeling nautious  as hell and staying close to a toilet as I write this review.
