3 stars because in my past I have always loved this restaurant, I will give them the benefit of the doubt that since we went on Cinco de Mayo it was a little bit overwhelming for them. Normally I love all the food & the service is fine. Unfortunately last night with it being so busy a lot of things were overlooked for our table. I ordered a strawberry margarita, when it came out I didn't realize they hadn't bothered to mix in the fake strawberry syrup, so the entire bottom was just an awful mouthful of strawberry flavored syrup- made me feel sick I didn't want to finish the drink, so I wouldn't suggest paying extra for "flavor" when it was that terrible. We didn't have any place settings, napkins or plates on our table so I had to ask for them after we had been served chips & salsa & still only half were brought to us, took about 10 min just to get napkins. I also had to ask for water & she never brought my friend any water. Then when we got our bill, my friend who had just ordered 2 chicken tacos realized her bill was too expensive for that & when we asked the waitress claimed she charged the taco meal (which should have come with two sides) so even though she was charged for the two sides, the server did not include them. So we asked for them to go since she had already paid for them. Again normally I love this place, but not sure I'd go back on a holiday night. Not really worth a gross drink & bad service. Definitely would suggest it for a regular less busy night, love the food!
