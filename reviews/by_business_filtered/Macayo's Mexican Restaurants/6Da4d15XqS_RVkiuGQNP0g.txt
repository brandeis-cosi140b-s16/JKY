The food is always good, which is why we keep going back. The big issue is the noise and how hard it is to even have a conversation there. It may have been because of all the noise that the waitress got my order wrong, but either way it just shouldn't happen.

I tried the blood red orange margarita, which was nothing special and over priced. I think if you are going to go that route you should just stick with their regular margarita. 

I will say that one other thing you can never go wrong with is their green corn tamale with Baja sauce. It is fantastic!
