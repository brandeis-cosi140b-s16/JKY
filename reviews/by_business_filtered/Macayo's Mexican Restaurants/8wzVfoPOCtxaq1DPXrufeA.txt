Great for a college meat market skin bar. Not where I'd take the fam.

After three or four more trips I've decided to stop going here.  Every time I eat here I spend the rest of the day in the restroom.  Not pleasant.  I suspect they have cleanliness and sanitation issues in the kitchen there.

EAT AT YOUR OWN RISK - I'm not going back.
