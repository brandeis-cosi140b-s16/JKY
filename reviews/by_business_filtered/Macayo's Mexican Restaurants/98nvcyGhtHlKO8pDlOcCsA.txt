I finally ate lunch here after not being able to get decent parking for Quiznos on Mill Ave.  My coworker and I were starving and needed a place to shoot the shit so we decided to give it a try.  I really did enjoy the patio area.  The weather was amazing and I had cabin fever from being stuck in my office all morning attending boring meetings.  They do hand out the free chips and salsa (glad it was free b/c they weren't tasty enough to actually pay for).  I ordered the BBQ Chicken pizza and was pleasantly surprised.  It was a good portion and I didn't get sick so I was happy.  The wait staff seemed so busy yet there weren't that many people in the restaurant but we are talking about a college crew so I can forgive them for their lack of detail and attention.  
Macayos isn't my favorite "Cantina" but I'm sure it will hit the spot on another beautiful day when I need to unwind in the warm sun.  I'm giving it 3 stars based on the open patio, good parking and the fact I didn't have to ride the porcelain bus later that day.
