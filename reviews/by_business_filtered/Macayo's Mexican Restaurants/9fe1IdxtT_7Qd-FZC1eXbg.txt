Two stars feels a little harsh but Macaynot's just didn't quite measure up to the standard for Mexican in the valley.  One of the restaurants I held up as a standard to judge Macaydon't's against is a little hole in the wall Mexican place near my office.  The food there is less diverse but more authentic and better than Macayshouldn't's and for the price much better.

So if I can get better than Macayno's and more authentic than Macaykeepgoingo's and cheaper than Macaymovealongthere'sbetterandcheaperMexicandowntheroadalittleway's than why I am going to eat there?

They do have a nice outdoor seating area on a pond that features large warning signs about not feeding the birds as well as diners feeding the birds and a live demonstration on the mercenary behavior of birds when they get used to people feeding them and practically land on your plate to grab a peck or two.

The food came out very quickly at Macayhuh's and the service was very good.  Everything slowed to a crawl for some reason when we asked for a box and the check.

Don't get the wrong impression, Macaysosofood's is OK, it's not bad by any stretch.  I would eat here if someone else was buying for sure.  I had a fish taco (overdone) and blue corn enchilada which was OK.
