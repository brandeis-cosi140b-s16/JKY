The ONLY Mexican chain I like. It seems like Macayos has been around forever. Sort of a Phoenix area landmark. 

The salsa is okay. A bit mild and tomatoey for my taste. The "hot" salsa is a joke. It is not even close to spicy. To me authentic salsa ALWAYS has a bite.

Most of the food here is mediocre. What stands out to me and allows me to give it 4 stars are the tamales with the baja sauce. This baja sauce is amazing. Creamy and spicy, the perfect match for their slightly sweet corn tamale. 

The margaritas are pretty good too. I like my margaritas strong and was at first disappointed that I couldn't taste the tequila. Halfway through the drink it hit me like a freight train. It must not have been mixed properly. 

Macayos is a good place to take out of towners. They will get a kick out of the kitschy, slightly tacky decor. And the food is suitable for gringo tastes.
