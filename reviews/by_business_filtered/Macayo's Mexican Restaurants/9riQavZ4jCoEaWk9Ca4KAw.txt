I've never been to the restaurant.  Only the bar.
Now, there are A LOT of bars where I live.  Great bars, good bars, dive bars, crappy bars.  The choices are endless.  Since I work full time and go to school full time my time and funds tend to be limited.  When the funds are especially limited the choice is clear: Macayos.
Here's why: Macayos' happy hours makes my last few dollars last.  Drinks are cheap and food is free.  That's right kiddos, free.  Because every college student appreciates an establishment that does not make them choose between booze and food this is very important.  
Now, is the the best food you've ever had?  No.  It's free, stop being so freaking needy.  It's good, even great for what you just paid, which I'd like to again remind is nothing.  
During the week the bartenders are friendly and attentive.
Friday nights this place tries to turn into a club and is overrun with older women freshly released from their cubicles, on the prowl.  It's a little alarming.  So I tend to stay away.
But during the week it's relaxed, cheap, and friendly.  Who can ask for more?
