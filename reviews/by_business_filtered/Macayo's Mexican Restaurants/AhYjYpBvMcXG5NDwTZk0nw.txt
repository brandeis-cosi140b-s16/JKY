So the hubby took off for a sports weekend with the guys and had it absolutely ruined by this restaurant last night. He was the only one who had ordered a fiesta steak salad. Shortly after eating the salad then suddenly felt ill. He couldn't even finish his beer. He threw up violently for the next several hours missing the football game completely. We are convinced it was the lettuce and poor hygiene from the kitchen staff. Just wanted to share this in hopes the restaurant reads and monitors the sanitation activities of this location. Hubby said he'll never have their food again.
