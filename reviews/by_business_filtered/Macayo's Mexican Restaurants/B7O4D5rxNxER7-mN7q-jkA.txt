Had a decent lunch here the other day with my co-workers.  We go here often for happy hour after work.

The food was pretty decent.  The lunch menu is oddly full of mostly non-mexican style food.  That was odd.

Service was ok until it got a little busy.  Then my cup was more half empty than half full.
