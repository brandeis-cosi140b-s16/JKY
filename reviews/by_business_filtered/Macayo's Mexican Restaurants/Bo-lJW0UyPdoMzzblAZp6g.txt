I am a big fan of American Mexican food so I frequent this place often when I am in the Tempe area and since I like Tempe Town Lake I am there often.  This place has an awesome outdoor patio bar and seating area and is convienently located next to a light rail stop. The inside decor is fabulous and the piece de resistance is the chandelier made from Corona bottles.

The menu is comprised of your traditional mexican dishes like tacos, chimichangas, burritos and so much more. I have tried numerous items from the menu but sadly have not found anything that wows me so much that I want to eat it every time I go.  I advise to ask for the spicy salsa when they bring you your chips and salsa. 

The downside to this restaurant is that the service is never consistent. More times than not I get seated in a location that everyone forgets about and so it takes forever to be waited on.  Often times when I request a special order of no tomatoes, since I really don't like them in most of my food, I still get them served with my meal anyway.  Despite these inconveniences I still return.
