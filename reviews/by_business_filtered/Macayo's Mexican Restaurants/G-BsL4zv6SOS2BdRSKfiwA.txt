Went during out to Macayos at about 230pm. Noticed floors (with ugly casino carpet) were VERY dirty. Tables were not bussed for over 45 minutes...some remaining dirty before and after we left. Two parties that came in after us were seated next to dirty tables. We were given the Lunch Menu, even though it didn't apply on weekends. The restaurant is RUN DOWN, shabby, and the upholstery and chairs need to be replaced. My meal was relatively flavorless. The margaritas that were "on sale" were sugary and weak. The Drink Menu presented to us (which we had to ASK twice for) was sticky over all pages. Our table had dried food and cheese clinging to it and silverware was very flimsy and dirty. Wooden chairs were wobbly, like they could give way any moment. It's an insult to Mexicans to call this a "Mexican" restaurant. This Macayo's location is filthy (bathrooms as well), dirty, dark, and outdated. Hopefully tourists don't go here as it would be a bad representation of what Phoenix has to offer in regard to Mexican/Southwest food. There is better Mexican food to be had/eaten in Phoenix. It's sad to see this landmark on Central in decline.
