This place is somewhat inconsistent in its ability to provide good service and in some instances the food was not as good as it was in others.

Overall I still like this place but am not always easily persuaded to visit. The baja california chimi is my favorite thing on the menu.

On Fridays they have an all you can eat free buffet. As a poor college student I have spent a number of Fridays eating their food. They have stuff like spaghetti and mini burritos and rice. All of the free food is doused in hot spices and sauces to keep everyone eating a minimum but that never phased me.
