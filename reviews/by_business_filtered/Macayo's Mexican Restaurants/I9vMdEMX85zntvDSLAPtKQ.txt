Had a very bad start end on a good note.

I took my fiancee and her family here, thinking that a great lunch would be a good way to keep the in-laws-to-be happy on their trip. We sat down around 2pm and were the only people outside what must be an 80-100 person patio. 

The DJ for the night was already set up, blasting music to where we couldn't even speak to each other as if we were in Old Town at 2am. I asked him if he could turn it down so we could eat lunch he told me to go fuck myself. Rather than throw a fit I spoke with the General Manager. The music came down shortly therafter and our server Caitlin (caitlyn? always spell that one wrong) took damn good care of us.

Word of advice: if you have a problem tell the GM. I can't remember his name but we owe you for fixing our lunch sir, thank you.
