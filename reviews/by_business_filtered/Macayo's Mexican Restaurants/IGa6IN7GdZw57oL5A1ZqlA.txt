I come her for the margarita's. It's really the only thing that has kept me faithful to macayo's. The menu has changed and i can taste the difference. I do really like their Baja chicken burro. The patio area is always nice. The bar area upstairs is due for a renovation.   Overall the food is ok the drinks are good the location is great.
