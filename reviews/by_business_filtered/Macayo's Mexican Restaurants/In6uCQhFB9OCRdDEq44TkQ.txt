We come here on an average once a week and always leave feeling wonderful.  The food is great.  I think one of my favorite things here is that along with the salsa they also bring out hot sauce for the chips. Sometimes they forget, but you can ask for it.  It's the tastiest stuff. Cant get enough.  My girlfriend and I usually do the baja chicken burro but have also recently got the mini chicken chimis.  holy deliciousness batman!
