Tucan Sam Can
By The Rue

I didn't have my toes in the water,
I didn't have my ass in the sand,
My baja burrito was almost okay,
The flavor for the most part, bland.

The best thing I can offer up to say,
The waiter, was on top of his game,
He checked up on us frequently,
If I could only remember his name.

I was here for a late, late lunch,
As I was leaving the girls were pouring in,
The patio here is nice and big,
I should have stayed and made them sin.

The grilled fish tacos were just okay,
Served with a side of "baja" sauce,
Stuffed with a little cabage,
After I ate I had to floss.

With my burrito I got rice as a side,
Got my plate, that wasn't the case,
Instead of rice it was black beans,
No I didn't punch him in the face. 

This place goes off on Cinco de Mayo,
However I don't really care,
I'd just end up sitting in the corner,
Girls in mini skirts I would just stare. 

Aribba!!!
