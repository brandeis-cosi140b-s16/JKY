I love this place. I love the food and the atmosphere. Very friendly staff and the manager does come around to talk to you.  I love their tacos, chimichangas and chips!  They always fill the chips up and I have a huge party when I go there. 

 With the Mexican food restaurants out there, this one is the best one.  I love the food and the atmosphere they provide. I have always had a friendly waiter, the manager has come to talk to us and even help serve drinks.  They are always aware of when the chip bowl is empty.  I think the only two things that annoy me from there is their rice is not good and their green corn tamales are too smooshy. Other then that I love this place and until I can find a place that wows me with their mexican food, this is it. 

If anyone orders a burger from here they really shouldn't be posting a review, wtf is up with that? It's a mexican restaurant not McDonalds.
