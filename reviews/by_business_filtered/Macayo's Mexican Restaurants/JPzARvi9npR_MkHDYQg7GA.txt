$2 Dos Equis all day everyday....that's my kind of place!

The food is pretty good.  I'm kinda the simple type so 2 tacos, a chimichanga, or taco salad are my go to's.  Their salsa is addicting and I always have plenty of food to take home.  I recommend sitting inside if you want to be in and out.  Only sit outside if you plan on hanging around for a while because the service & refills on drinks are always slow.
