This was my first meal in Tempe, recommended by our hotel concierge. I should have spent the 5 min researching on Yelp to find a decent Mexican joint, but was hungry and lazy. This is as authentic Mexican as P.F. Chang is to Chinese food. 

However - the staff was great and very friendly. So its not their fault they work for a chain. But I can sum up my experience in one phrase: not worth the calories. 

Pro: location, size, and staff.
