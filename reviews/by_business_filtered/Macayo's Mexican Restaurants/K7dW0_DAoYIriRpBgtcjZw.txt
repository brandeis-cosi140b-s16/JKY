Great service and great food. It's hard to find a good combo of these but this has it! They even have a happy hour at 4:30-6:30 that gives you a discounted for popular appetizers. My husband and I went and we ordered a grande chimichanga, we split it and were both full when we left. The staff is always very friendly as well!
