One of my favorite Mexican restaurants in Tempe and Peoria.
I always get the red corn chicken taquitos and the ground beef enchilada. The chips and salsa are also very tasty. If you're used to authentic homemade Mexican food this may not be as good because it is more of a chain restaurant. However I still feel their food is well seasoned and they give you good portions 
I would pass one the fried ice cream though for dessert, for the price not worth it, just make it at home
