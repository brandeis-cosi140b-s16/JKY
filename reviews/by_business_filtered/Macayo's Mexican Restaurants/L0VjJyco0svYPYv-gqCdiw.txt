All show, no delicious burrito.

This place is a decent spot for a group of people to meet for a quick bit, drinks, and a walk to Mill Ave.  It is not, however, a good Mexican restaurant.

The service was very slow.  We had 5 people and all of us were drinking, yet our server seemed completely uninterested in our party.  Typically, this would not be the case unless the place was slammed and leaking extraneous guests, but on this night there were not a whole lot of folks in-house.

The food was so-so.  Chimichanga was the best dish I sampled, but it was not impressive.  I'd rather have Chipotle any day.

The Sahara Rd. Vegas location is much better and much more accomodating.  Maybe this location could learn a thing or two from its other franchises.
