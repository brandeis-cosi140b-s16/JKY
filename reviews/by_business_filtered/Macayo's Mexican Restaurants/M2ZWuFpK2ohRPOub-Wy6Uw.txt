Call me nuts.. but on a recent 'have to' visit to my corporate office near here.... we decide its just hot...and what a way to shake off the corporate blues of come what may then with a few margs... amongst the collegiates... As I started, call me nuts... Its Tempe.. I dont usually ... I just say, no. Neat patio...but too hot... we opted to get our drink on inside.. the place was hopping even at 2pm.. amongst the 6 or so of us... we had a few margaritas..a few apps, a few taco and enchilada plates... I stuck with a cheese crisp and margarita...lite on the salt, please. Strong..well, strong enough for me. Truly, I liked everything... Its a chain and I was surprised.. The waiter, could have been more attentive and a bit nicer, as the hostesses. And some of our party complained that the food came out a bit on the lukewarm side...Im going with the fact that our party wasnt small... and its Tempe..
