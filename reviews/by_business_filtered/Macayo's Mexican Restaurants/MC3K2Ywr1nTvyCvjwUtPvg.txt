I've been going to Macayo's Depot Cantina since college and its a great place. Friendly people, great food, and some good specials you can't find at other locations. They have some really good margaritas too!

I go there for lunch at least once a week.  The specials change daily for lunch so you can mix it up.  I love the chips and salsa they bring out when you sit down and our orders always come out quickly.  You definitely leave full!

They also have a great happy hour that my friends and I go to on Fridays.
