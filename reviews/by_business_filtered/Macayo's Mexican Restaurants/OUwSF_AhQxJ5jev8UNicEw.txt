I've been coming here for a couple of times every week for a few years now. It's across the street from the gym where I play dodgeball. It's convenient and great food, which I can customize if I like. I personally like the bar staff. Joey totally takes care of myself and my co-dodgeballers! We make it a stop for our pregame get to together. We celebrate and have a few drinks/shots together before we all let it at each other throwing those balls at each other! I've been to a few other Macayo's in the valley, which are also good. But I really feel like family at the Macayo's on Central! When I walk in to the bar every week, and Joey sees me I always get a a hey Dale! How's it going with fist bump! It really makes me feel special! 

If you like the review and like to get in our Macayo's/Dodgeball family come in on a Tuesday around 5:30pm, we're usually there until 7:00-7:30. You can't miss us! Or you can check out the our website at letsplaydodgeball.com
