Great concept and whimsical decor here at Macayo's, however their quality of food and service makes this place look like the forgotten step sister of chain restaurants like Chili's, Rubio's or Rainforest Cafe.

The place looked completely empty, except for two tables of people and some individuals at the bar. We were served some chips and salsa as well as our waters, which is pretty standard. I ordered the Sonoran Enchilada Sampler which came with a Verde Chicken, Cheese and Beef Enchiladas, Spanish Rice, Black Beans with Guac, Cabbage and Sour Cream on the side.

My party and I pretty much filled up with chips and salsa before the food came out, it was about more than 25 minutes before all the food came out. As another server brought out my plate, he mentioned something along the lines of "Do you think you can finish that?". The sampler is indeed large enough for two people to eat and looked unappealing and messy. The enchiladas were good, but not the best I've ever had. The rice tasted old, with hard pieces and was dry. The beans, gritty and you could see how much bean liquid had evaporated on the side of the plate (possibly from sitting under the hot lamp too long). I managed to eat one of the enchiladas before giving in and just boxing it for to-go.

Service was lacking, don't come here if you're in a hurry! Waiters hardly out front, food is mediocre to say the least and not worth the price you pay. The rest of my party didn't enjoy their Fish Tacos, since the grilled fish was incredibly chewy and over-cooked, they didn't finish their plates.
