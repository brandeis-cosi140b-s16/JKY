My cousin just had her wedding catered by Macayo's catering service. The food tasted fresh and was pretty good. She ordered 100% vegetarian entrees and food was served buffet style. I would highly recommend the catered been chimichangas.

The desert was delicious. We had the flan. Super nummy!

They also provided "skinny" margaritas, which were the hit of the party. Absolutely delicious.

The servers were very nice and the wedding party was very satisfied.
