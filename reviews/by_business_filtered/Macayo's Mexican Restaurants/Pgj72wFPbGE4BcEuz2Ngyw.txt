Ho hum.  Service was a bit on the slow side but I can overlook that for good food.  We had the new fundito cheese dip for an appetizer.  It had quite a zip of peppers - more than I expected, but 4/5 stars for the dip.  

We both had entrees that were ok, but nothing spectacular.   Honestly, it tasted like any mexican place but at a higher price.  I appreciated that the majority of servers were not 18 year olds, but older and more mature looking.  I ordered my dish without guac and when it arrived, there was evidence that the kitchen had made a mistake and replated the dish because the was clearly guac on a piece of the quesadilla.  Not a huge deal, but a sign of hastiness.

For the price, I expected more than a battery operated tealight in a cheap glass jar in the middle of the table (see picture).  Most dinner dishes were 10-14 bucks.  I'm by far a restaurant snob, but that seemed very tacky!

A decent place to eat but with room for improvement.
