I've eaten at Macayo's many times on Scottsdale Rd. and Shea and love to take my out of towner friends there.  Lunch or dinner, the food is always good, the host and servers are responsive and friendly..and the food...is very very nummy.  I love the beef burro enchilada style, but am crazy about the new salads they have.  Their taco salad presentation is very good.  When I ask for my order to be tweaked, they get it right.  I highly recommend Macayo's, never a bad meal and my guests are always satisfied and love it.  This place should be packed day and night, but I've never had to wait and always had good service.
