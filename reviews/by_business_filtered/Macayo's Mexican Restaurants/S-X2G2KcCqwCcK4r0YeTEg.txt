DOUBLE-X BLACKLIST. Three years since my last visit (not long enough apparently), and it's time I updated and upgraded Macayo's to DOUBLE-X. See you in 2014 beeyotches.

Where oh where have your owners gone, Macayo's? What happened to the quality of food with which you opened and on which your franchise and brand name are founded?

FIRE your kitchen staff, FIRE your kitchen manager, and FIRE your general manager.

Mediocre, bland, sometimes scary, late, cold, not clean, goopy, old and stale.

--cardboard menu cards are wet and starting to mildew from days and days of moisture;
--salsa 4 to 5 days old. the salt has made it briney, the green chilis are fermenting it into vinegar;
--special "top shelf" fresh-fruit texas margarita is a swirl of gatorade-colored syrup and a complete waste of grand marnier; head to Quick Trip instead;
--rice from weeks ago, reheated, refrigerated, reheated, refrigerated, microwaved and then served from oblivion; dry, cakey gloopy SHIT. Shame on you!;
--refried beans go the same way. ranch style. they keep for weeks out on the ranch. didn't finish them? no problem. just throw in a bit of lard and put 'em back on the fire. Macayo's clearly has the technique mastered.
--chicken "guisado" so old, even cooks from Diamonds wouldn't serve it;
--flour tortillas either not fully cooked, or kept in the same damp room as the menu cards -- they were doughy and starting to ferment;
--sopapillas for shame! looked like fried cowpies. you couldn't force feed me this shit! SEND IT BACK!!!

After dining at the mother restaurant, you can be sure I'll think twice when I see the Macayo bird on something at the grocery. BLECH.
