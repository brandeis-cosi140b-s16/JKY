Super night at the Depot! Walked in and was immediately greeted by the patio bartender Mike. Awesome guy and super nice so we ordered a drink to hang out for a bit. We asked to be seated in the bar and were sat in a great little private booth. Ben the inside bartender is a Rock Star! He treated us as if we were the only people in the bar! So fantastic and my family really enjoyed themselves. Our food came out and looked amazing and tasted even better! James the Manager came by and was extremely nice and was very attentive to everyone's needs. Awesome experience even with it being a late night dinner.
