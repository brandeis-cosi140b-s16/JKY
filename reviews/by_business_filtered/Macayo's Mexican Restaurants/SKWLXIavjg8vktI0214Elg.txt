Macayo's is OK. It's not the best Mexican food I've ever had but certainly not the worst. My sister and her boyfriend are really into this place so I come here from time to time and  it's always just OK. You know how those places are? Like someone says "Hey, let's go to Macayo's!" and you're all "I don't hate it there and I'll go there if you have your heart set on it." It's literally one of those restaurants that if I never went again, I'd probably never even realize. The salsa with the free chips and salsa is pretty bland, I do like the fundido sauce or whatever that deliciousness is on their chicken burrito. The mini chimi's were decent and the meat on the nacho's is pretty good. The service is not that great. It's never been horrible but you get the sense that the server is counting down the hours until they get to go home. Which, I get it, being a server isn't the funnest of jobs but at the same time, it takes very minimal effort to give the impression that you care and are happy. Anyway, that's my two cents!
