Macayos equals Average Food, Generous Margaritas, and consistent service. Went there last night and to our surprise was seated next to my inlaws so I guess that officially makes it a neighborhood center. This place comes to life on major game ngihts which is usually when I avoid it. I remember when the parking spilled over into vacant lots now office condos.  If your just looking for a good value split the fajitas and keep the chips comming. their salsa is on the watery side, but many people like it.
