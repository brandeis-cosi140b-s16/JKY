I have been coming here for a long long time.  We had nicole tonight as a server.  Worst service ever!  Not only did she get my order wrong twice but she tried to come over ask me if my order was better than tried to show me on the menu how I was wrong.  When i showed her she was wrong she stomped off. Then came back to the table to fill water and did not fill mine but others mine was empty.  I'm not sure we will be returning anytime soon.  Sad cause I really love their Baja sauce.
