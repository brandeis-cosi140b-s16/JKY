Let me start off by saying I have ate at this restraint for many years . But different locations . I have moved into the area and was happy to see we had this Mexican food near us. Well I was shockingly disappointed . First off I want to state the service was terrible. It took over 25 minutes for someone to even approach our table for drinks . I had to get up and get a manager to be waited on. Then when we got our food again disappointment as it was not up to par with good food. I decided not to write this place off as maybe this was a one off and the manager replaced our food. 

A few weeks later myself and roommate decided to get take out. We both got the steak  fajitas. Might I say we spent $18.00 and it was just gross . The meat was not cooked the other food was over cooked . At this point I called the manager to advise of these bad expirences. He apologized and that was it ! No offer to remake it and come back in . No offer of a refund for disappointment , nothing . 

I have now decided to share this with everyone to know this location is beyond bad and to not go here . If I could give it no star I would ! I will never return to this location or any other location again . If this place is not boycotted they will continue to make poor food and make money . It will also allow the staff to know its ok to give bad service when waiting on a table . I hope this helps avoid and future bad expirences .
