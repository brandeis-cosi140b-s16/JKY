Mini chicken chimmies with extra guacamole and sour cream plus a  frozen canyon three tequila margarita with salt.  Muy Bueno on the patio in the late afternoon on a relatively cool day without the misters to soak you.

In the morning I felt I had to go back to oatmeal and berries (red, black and blue) to counter the dairy products and alcohol from the day before.  Works for me...
