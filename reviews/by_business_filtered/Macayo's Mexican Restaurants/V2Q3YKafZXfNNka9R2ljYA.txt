One of my friends has been eating at this location for years and highly recommended it - I can see why.  Our waitperson (Esperanza) was the best waitperson I have ever had at any restaurant, ever (and several of us made sure to tell the manager)!  She worked very hard to make sure our large party was 100% satisfied.  And, since I was a first timer, she brought all of our table a free appetizer (3 sets of appetizers) - wow.  And the food, absolutely some of the best I have tasted.  The only thing I didn't care for was the salsas (sorry Macayo's) - for whatever reason, I just didn't like them.  I had the chile relleno and enchiladas - perfection!  The rice and beans are fabulous.  I loved this place and hope to return soon!
