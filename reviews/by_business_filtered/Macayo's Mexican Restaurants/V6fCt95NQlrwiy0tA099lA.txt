I was here the other evening for a meeting (which by the way was set up in the middle of the main dining room, instead of off to one of the side aka quieter areas..making it near impossible to hear anything) and I did not have any of the food, so I will refrain from commenting on what I did see...eh.

I did; however, order a house margarita, and noticed on the menu that it came in two sizes.  I was not asked what size I wanted, just given the larger $2 more size... how clever.  I asked for it with no salt and it came with the most salt I have seen on a margarita EVER!  Ok, fine, whatever.. I wiped it off.. It came with two straws  (so you drink it faster. and order more..HA! I am on to your tricks... no thanks!)  As for the actual taste of the margarita....BLEH... blandest ever.. didn't even really taste like lime or sweet n sour, or the like.. it reminded me of these really gross margarita "pouches"  (think Capri Sun) that I bought once while in Cali on vacation... they were so gross that I ended up freezing the rest as ice packs for my cooler!  I am not sure if this margarita had much tequila in it either... so for my $8 I had a goblet of wasted calories....sad.

The service is another low point.. once our servers realized that only 4 of our party of 10 were eating (always a pisser, I speak from experience..but still people) they were pretty much imaginary for the rest of the night.. It took about 10 minutes after I was ready to leave for me to see one of the  servers, and he promptly told me that he couldn't get my check, but as soon as he saw the other server he would let her know.. 5 minutes later she made an appearance... sigh.

I have heard not really great things about this place, and based on my experience I doubt I would go back to give the food a try.
