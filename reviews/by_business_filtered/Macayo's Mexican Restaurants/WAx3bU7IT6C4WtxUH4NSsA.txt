Had a great time at Macayo's in downtown Phoenix.  By far my favorite location that I've been to.

The service was exceptional.  Our party was in a little bit of a rush to get to the Suns game and after telling our waitress, she was great at getting our meals out as promptly as she could and getting our bill taken care of quickly.  

The food was great as usual.  The cheese enchiladas were great and they had a great beer special as well.  

Another enjoyable experience at Macayo's
