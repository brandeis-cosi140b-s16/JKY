I had been to Macayo's numerous times not because I wanted my colleagues like the place. Every time I go I notice the value of the food and taste is getting worst. Today I went and ordered Chicken Fajitas with side veggies. The fajitas didn't come out sizzling they looked like they must have sat in the window for awhile. The veggies are ice cold with tons of butter and barely cooked. The chicken tasted like they been freezer burned and no seasoning. The dish wasn't appetizing at all.  Also, I service isn't the best  I was with a group and had leftovers and wanted a box and the server didn't even come around. Just drop off the check and walk away. I wouldn't recommend going to this place if you want some good Mexican food.
