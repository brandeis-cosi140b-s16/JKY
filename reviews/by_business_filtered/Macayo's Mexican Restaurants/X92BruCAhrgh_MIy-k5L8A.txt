Salsa is key at a Mex restaurant - we got a soupy tomato mixture with some pieces of canned tomatoes in it.  We ordered skinny margaritas, which are typically less sweet than regular ones.  We got overly sweet margaritas and they were not at all generous with the tequila.  The finale was my stacked enchiladas, which consisted of three tortillas SWIMMING in a gooey mixture.  They were horrible and I sent them back.  They did bring another order with sauce on the side but we'll never return.
