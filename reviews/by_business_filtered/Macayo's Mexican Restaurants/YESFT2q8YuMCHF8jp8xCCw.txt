Another disaster on the start of my evening. I rarely ever have issues with service or bother to complain on Yelp, but this waiter with glasses and a touch of gray hair was ignorant. He muffed one of the orders even after we had told him multiple times what we wanted. The dish came out way wrong as predicted. He also didn't answer my standard white meat chicken question, instead choosing to tell us how even if the meat is mixed, it is usually good at other places. Uhh WTF? The chips were stale and my tamale I ordered was inedible. After a short chat with the waiter, he agree to send manager over, but manager was too lazy to visit table. On the good side, the manager did tell us to leave without paying for our drinks ($16), so we got the best deal out of a bizarre dining experience. Avoid that waiter.
