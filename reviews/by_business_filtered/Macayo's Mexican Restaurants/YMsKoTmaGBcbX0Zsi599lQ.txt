As a self professed "foodie" I have had and know what it takes to prepare authentic and delicious mexican food.  Of all the genre's of cuisine, it is by far the easiest to execute well, so when I go out for mexican I expect a certain level of quality to the food.  Needless to say I wasn't impressed by anything at Macayo's.  The chips and salsa were mediocre at best, and the main courses sadly followed suit.  I am oblivious as to how places like this have more than one location.  If you are truly looking for a great experience check out Gallo Blanco over in phoenix.  Definitely worth the extra drive.
