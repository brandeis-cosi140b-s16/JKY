When Taco Bell's menu beats out a sit-in restaurant for flavor, speed, and seating, there's something that needs to be fixed. Reservations were made for a large party of approximately 25 people days in advanced, so normal expectations were that the seats would be reasonably ready in a reasonable location. Once we walked inside, it was a different story. We waited almost an hour to be seated, and once the tables were ready, most of our group was sat in the blazing hot sun. It was ridiculous. After about 10 minutes we had to complain since as soon as we were seated, a whole area of seats opened up underneath some covered awning. Another 20 minutes or so and we were relocated inside and tables were moved around to accommodate everyone. Ordering the meals went smoothly, food came out in a decent amount of time, and the margarita drink was good flavored, not that strong. The food itself was disappointing - visually appealing, but left a lot to be desired for taste. I ordered the fajita quesadilla which came with guacamole, sour cream, and a shot size of beans and rice. The cheese, chicken, onions, and bell pepper filling was very bland. The few fine points couldn't save the overall review of this place, even though the staff tried their hardest to make everyone happy. Poor planning on the upper management's part.
