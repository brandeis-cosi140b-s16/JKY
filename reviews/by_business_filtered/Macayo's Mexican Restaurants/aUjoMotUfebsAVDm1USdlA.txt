3 minutes to 9pm on a Tuesday night, starving after a movie, what's open? Driving down Scottsdale Rd and needing to have something we have not had yet (needing more to review, of course), what the heck, we can check out Macayo's. Sadly, staving off a low blood sugar headache, we just did not have time to consult Yelp. 

We were seated right away with only 4 other parties in the restaurant and not a soul in the bar. Chips, watery salsa and water came right away. Is this really salsa? Seems more like tomato soup. The chips, very thin  and cold. I like them thin, but warm would be nice. We scoured the menu and went with veggie fajitas and a green enchilada from the light menu. 

The food arrived. The veggie fajitas sizzling away. A good selection of broccoli, squash, peppers, zucchini, mushrooms, and carrots. Fairly fresh seeming sauteed veggies. A separate plate with some guac, refried beans and sour cream. A new approach to the tortillas, 2 large ones. Not what we expected, but the fixins do not fall out that way. The enchilada was tiny. I found the little tortilla. One small corn tortilla with some chicken in it. Some good spiced black beans. And some sauteed veggies. Ok, more shrooms. 

Overall, just nothing to write home about. Just another mexican place. Our waiter was very nice and very attentive to my water (I went through 4 glasses). But, it just seemed like this chain is trying unsuccessfully to be like Chevy's. It did it's job to get us some food.
