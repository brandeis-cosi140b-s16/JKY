the place is huge and has a great outdoor seating area.  macayo's always has some sort of drink special going on- just ask!  i've never ate too much at macayo's but when i do it always hits the spot.  this place was my first stop on a lightrail adventure in day drinking!

come here with a group or for happy hour or for day drinking or for outdoor seating.  lots of reasons to come here, see!?
