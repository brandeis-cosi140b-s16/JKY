This is my favorite macayo's. I really like this place been coming here for many years. I always have the baja chimi and a margarita. I know its run of the mill,  but they have this dish nailed down.  I worked at the one on central when I was a young muchacha and their chimi is good too. But Im always disappointed with the one on warner bummer cause its closer to me
