this is not a bad spot for drinking. A huge place with waterfalls and fire pits and both indoor and outdoor seating with covered patio. We spent several hours this weekend just chilling out at the bar, watching football and throwing back drinks. For the most part, it was quite enjoyable.

I didn't eat any food here. 

Strange thing that happened: one of the "manager"-types tried to serve us two shots but only filled the shotglasses halfway. When we told her we had ordered two shots and not one shot split into two glasses, she tried to tell us that the shotglasses were too big and that we had been "hooked up" by the bartender prior to her helping out. These were small plastic glasses designed specifically to hold one shot only. When we disputed this she got all bitched out and huffed off. So we paid our bill and took our business elsewhere. Had it not been for her, we would have continued to stay there and spend more money. She is not a bartender, she clearly does not know how to pour a drink let alone a single shot into a single shotglass with no mixing nor chilling, and she clearly has never drank before in her life because if she did, she would have known how embarrassing she is to her employer.

I will come here again but I will not be served by this woman.
