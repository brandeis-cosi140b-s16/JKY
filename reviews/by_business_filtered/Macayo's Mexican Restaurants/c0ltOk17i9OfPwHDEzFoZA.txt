This was one of my early favorites when I first started living here two years ago.  I love their chips and hot sauce.  Some of the best in Phoenix.  Last two visits really missed the boat.  This last time the service was so bad that I had to chase my waiter down just to get my order delivered correctly.

Food is pretty good.  Love the Baja Burro.  But, two less than great service experiences--I won't be back.
