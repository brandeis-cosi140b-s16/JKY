Ordered steak fajitas and the steak was very tasty, juicy and tender. Wish these restaurant would serve smaller flour tortillas like they do with corn. Waitress was nice and friendly. Small water drought but still good. Complaints were the table was very dirty, especially the food stains on the sides of table. Salsa was a bit lackluster. Chips were good.
