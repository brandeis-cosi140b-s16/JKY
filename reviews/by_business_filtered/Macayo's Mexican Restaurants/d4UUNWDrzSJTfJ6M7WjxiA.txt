I'm so sad about it.  I've been attending Macayo's like devout Catholics attend mass, for my whole life. First in Phoenix, growing up on the west side, and then the Mesa location staring in 1994.  
Today was my first 100% bad experience... The service (appalling- younger female server was apathetic and rude, we died of thirst) and the food (wrong the first time, angrily and unappetizingly plated the second time, and nothing resembling the way the dish has been prepared for decades) was just so bad this time.  I don't ever, and didn't this time, ask for free food or to talk to managers, but the manager stopped at the table anyway... Apparently to be defensive that they changed the dish (yes, i noticed- I'm not asking for anything, I just won't eat it!) and to snippishly inform me that the salad dressing is the same as always (no, it isn't, but I just want to pay and leave) so I'm not sure what that was about other than maybe he'd been told by the server that we were unhappy and he seemed to have assumptions that we wanted something -which we didn't.  
I felt like a stranger in a strange land... It's so far to drive that we probably won't anymore. Two stars for nostalgia alone.
I'm devastated... macayo's is my One True Love... GUYS, what happened??
