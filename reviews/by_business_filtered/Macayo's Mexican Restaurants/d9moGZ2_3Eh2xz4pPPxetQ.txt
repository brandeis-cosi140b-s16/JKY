We had never been before.  Was highly recommended by the girl working the front desk at our hotel.  Very happy we went.  Food was amazing!!!  I got steak fajitas and they were awesome.  Customer service was good.  Our waitress was being trained but she did a great job.   Highly recommend if you find yourself in town.
