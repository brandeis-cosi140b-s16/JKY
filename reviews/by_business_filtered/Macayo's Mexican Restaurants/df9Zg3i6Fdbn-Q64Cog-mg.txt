I got engaged after eating at Macayo's many, many, many moons ago (hubbie figured a fancy night out would tip his hand).  I used to dine at this location nearly every Friday in the mid 90s when I started at Intel.  Since then, I have been underwhelmed each time I have visited.  Last visit:  toilet had overflowed in the women's bathroom, living one stall availalble for an 'ick' experience.  Couple that with the out-dated, disheleved looking front lobby and I washed my hands of an old stand-by.  Adios Macayo's.
