My last night in AZ I thought it'd be good to attempt to get good Mexican food again. While this was definitely a step up from the last place Los Sombreros or whatever, it was pretty standard (definitely better than many E. Coast options, though). We started off with some chips and salsa - what better way to whet an appetite while filling yourself up before you get your food so you realize you ordered too much after it's too late? (always the case w/Mexican!) The salsa was pretty tasty, so a plus there. 

Dad and I went ala carte; he got a cheese enchilada and I got a tamale with 'lite' white sauce. FYI 'lite' still means 'brick of fat melted on your tamale'. It was good, but I felt like I was eating...a brick of fat. We also got a large order of guac which was a mistake, we were way too full by the time everything came out!

The margaritas were ok. I thought mine was pretty sour, and my dad got this kind with a lot of juice in it so it kind of tasted weird. They were also retardedly huge. Unnecessary to waste that much liquid!! We could only finish half. 

Our bill was fine although it was doubled by the cost of the drinks, booo. 

Would come back to a place like this if I needed a hangover fix, but otherwise....meh.
