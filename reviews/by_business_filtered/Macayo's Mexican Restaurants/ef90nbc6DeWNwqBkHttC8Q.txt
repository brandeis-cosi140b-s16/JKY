We have always been partial to Macayos because the food is very good. The Spinach Con Queso is the best. I ate here today and had the Ahi Tacos for the first time. They were absolutely fabulous. This paticular Macayos location is my favorite. It has a large patio area and is a great place to go for drinks.
