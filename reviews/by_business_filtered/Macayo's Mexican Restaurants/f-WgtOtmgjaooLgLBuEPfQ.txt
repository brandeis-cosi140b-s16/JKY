Ate here on a Friday night about a week ago.  Place was busy but we were seated in just a few minutes.  The good - service was great. The bad -   the Chimichanga de Macayo tasted as if it was a frozen mexican dinner and the salad was a bunch of shredded lettuce with little else.  Will look for a different restaurant if the urge for Mexican food strikes again.
