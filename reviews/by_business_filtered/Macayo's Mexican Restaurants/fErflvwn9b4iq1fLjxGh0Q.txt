where to begin?
how about a capitol T for terrible. I have been going to Macayo's off and on over the years....  Last night I took a friend from out of town there for dinner.  I felt confident that the food and service would be pretty good.  Well, not so.  Besides the presentation of our meals being amateurish and unappealing the food was tired and dried up.  Laughing as I write these words but, it's the truth.  The waitress was sweet and tried to do her best but, we sat there for 1/2 hour before they took our order.  Then to the food.
Honestly,  I had a beef tostada and the flavor was unrecognizable and the beans were like paste.  The bean tostada that my friend was attempting to eat was completely unacceptable.  Now, how hard is it to pull off something as simple as a Bean Tostada... really?  The waitress offered to get us more food, different food etc.  What we really should have recieved was a refund and an apology.
