Just to tell you guys, that I went with my family a couple of weeks ago, and it took 65minutes to bring our orders on the table!! People that came after us, was already gone!! Nobody showed up, neither the waiter or the manger. I left the restaurant without having dinner that night. After my family was done with the food, my wife told me that she didn't have to pay for my own order, and she got a 20% discount on the dinner. I don't want the discount, I want my frigging food! Too bad that there's not the chance of giving zero star. If not I'd really! Alberto.
