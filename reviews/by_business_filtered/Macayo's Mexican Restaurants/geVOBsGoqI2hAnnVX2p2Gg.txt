One of my favorites! But only 4 stars....
The food is great. But...the service. :-/ well.... just make sure you keep the waiters attention. Do as I do.... Make empty slurping sound with your drink straw, as you stair at your waiter, or try waving the empty chip bowl. Just what ever you do DON'T throw it. You'll never get service after that. Talking from experience here. Yeah well sorry Mr. Waiter. 15 minutes to get seated, another 20 minutes for you to ask me if I have ordered, then 15 more minutes for you to bring me a drink and chip/salsa. And yes 30 more minutes to bring the food and 1st refill.
So, after an hour and 20 minute the food! Hallelujah!! It's worth the wait. Everything on the menu is very good. The chicken stuff poblano is my favorite. And try the spinach con queso dip. 
Maybe the waiter was just having a bad day. I will definitely be going back with hopeful intentions.
