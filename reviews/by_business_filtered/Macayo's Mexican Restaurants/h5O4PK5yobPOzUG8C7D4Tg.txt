Hi Macayo's!

Hats off to you to having consistent and delicious Mexican food! I'd say that the price is good for the area, the chips and salsa are great, and the food, even though it is not some fancy shmancy Mexican food, it's great tasting.

I'm so unsure as to why someone wouldn't give this place at least three stars. I typically go at lunch too or after work for a margarita and I'm always quickly taken care of and I'm not sure what else you can ask for.

Also, Jose is the best bartender. They should keep him forever.
