We love this place! So peaceful at night by the lake! Unfortunately we had a horrible server named Danielle #7142. So horrible that I didn't even want to leave 2 or 3 percent tip let alone 15 percent! We needed refills for the kids and never got them before we left. We were halfway done with our meal and she brought us out the tab like we weren't welcome here anymore! We had to flag her down for everything! Not one time did she ask us if we needed anything or if everything was okay. We ended up leaving a 3 dollar tip and she's lucky she got that! Never again will I go to macayos I'd this is the kind of serice I'm gonna get.
