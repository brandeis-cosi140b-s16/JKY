Haha, okay, I am obviously the odd one out here. I was both surprised but not at the same time when I saw how low the average reviews for this restaurant are. Surprised becasue this is my favorite sit down Mexican restaurant. Not surprised since I know usually half of the people I know don't care for the food here as they find it to be more of an American take on traditional Mexican dishes. I really like the food here. It is always consistent and super yummers! The three things very important to me in Mexican cuisine are the beans and rice and of course the chips & salsa. You usually get these as a side with every Mexican dish, so they better be good. Their beans are always piping hot and creamy and their rice is super flavorful and extremely moist! Their chips and salsa are delicioso! Chips are served hot and this salsa is very unique and has a garlicy flavor. May sound weird in writing but it is phenomenal when you're eating it (bring gum for afterwards if you're on a date) ;-)  I have liked every dish I have tried here. There combination plates are great because they actually give you a ton of choices! Sides and entrees. Most places will give you a small list of options, it makes it very limited for vegetarians too. When I used to eat meat, I loved their shredded beef tacos! I would get soft tacos, corn tortillas. Very moist and tender. I really like their burritos, all of their enchiladas, their green chile and corn tamale, and so so so much more! Their baja sauce is this creamy, cheesy, spicy sauce that you can get on your food or for your chips. Wowza! I have not had a bad food experience here...an occasional service experience or two when they were really swamped but I will remain a loyal customer. Thank you for your yummy food!
