I'm not sure what happened tonight; I have been here like 6 or 7 times; I ordered a Carne Asada Chimichanga like I do almost every time.
It had some weird cheese sauce with spinach on it, just not what I had expected or remembered from before. Other times it was not topped with this, the waitress explained what it was, a cheese sauce. I didnt ask for or remember seeing this sauce on the menu.
Sorry but I've had this dish many times and something went wrong.
I had seen somewhere where they offered WiFi there as well. Well they don't, and the building blocks your signals, not that I am on my phone the whole time I was dining alone and like to browse it while waiting for the food.
