My wife and I ate in the bar at 12:47pm Saturday afternoon. We sat at the bar and watch the bartender stick his finger inside a glass of wine he was preparing to serve to scratch a piece of food off the inside. He also stuck a straw into a drink he had just made to take a straw full to taste put it in his mouth then back in the drink. The two servers that were women also joined him. Made my stomach hurt and unable to finish my meal.
