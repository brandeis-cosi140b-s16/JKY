Dining experience started off really bad! Unfriendly staff, long wait times and staff seemed confused on what they were supposed to do. About half way through the meal the staff got more friendly and we had a better dining experience. Atmosphere and decor are great. Food was pretty good. We got nachos with beef, guacamole, and baja sauce. Baja sauce is great! Also got a Mexican pizza which was good. Nachos seemed a little skimpy on toppings but wee pretty good. Overall decent experience but they could use work in service.
