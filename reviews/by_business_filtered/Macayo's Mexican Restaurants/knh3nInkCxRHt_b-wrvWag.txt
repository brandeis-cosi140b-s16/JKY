I came here for my birthday a few weeks ago, for their happy hour. We sat outside and they were very accommodating as we kept adding 2-3 people at a time, ending with about 13 people total. Jackie was our cocktail waitress, and with the amount of happy hour shots, margaritas and appetizers we ordered she kept track if everyone's individual orders and didn't mess up on anything. she was awesome! kind of a long wait for drinks if they are busy but well worth the wait.
