I have been coming to this Macayo's with my family for many years! It was once our family staple for get gatherings.  So it was great to be back after some time. 

The food is always great and dependable.  The actually physic of this establishment is in much need of renovation.  The booth cushions gave no support and sank in, some were torn.  It is apparent that the wear and tear of has taken it toll.

Also, the service took a bit of a dive on our last occasion.  The server wasn't to pleasant and didn't seem to happy to be at work.

Long story short.  Old building, solid food, hit or miss service.
