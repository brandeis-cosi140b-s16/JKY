I came to Macayo for restaurant week, and I was very happy with one of their dishes that had chicken inside a grilled pepper.  It had a fajita tasting type of feeling but the combination of the pepper gave it a nice kick.  The dessert we got was a fried ice cream and it reminded me the taste of Cinnamon Toast crunch.  It gave me childhood memories.
