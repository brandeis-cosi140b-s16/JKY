If you've been here and didn't like it, go again and try anything with their BAJA SAUCE.  It is one thing that is AMAZING.  (Shredded Beef Burro with Baja sauce or Green Corn Tamales with Baja sauce are top pics.) Tried Baja sauce at other places in the valley, and nothing compares.  
The place has Bright Mexican decor.  It's not fine dining, but it's not meant to be.  Comfortable and casual.
Salsa is ok - but ask for the hot and it's even better.
Service may be spotty, but the $3 margaritas (when you bring in your Macayo's glass) are a deal...
Oh and the stuffed animal grabber machine at the front door is a rip off - no grip - just eats your money so avoid it!
