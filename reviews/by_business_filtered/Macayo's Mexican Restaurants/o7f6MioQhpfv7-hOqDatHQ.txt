This review is gonna be a little different. As much as I go here, you would think I love Mexican food. Truth is, I'm not a big fan at all. My wife loves it and with that, I'm bound to make an appearance once a week. 

My two items that I rotate here are the California burrito, and the Cheeseburger. The burrito is the closest thing here I can get to Chipotle which I love, and the burger, well it's pretty good, but nothing special. The hidden gem here is the french fries. Man those are good. Cooked in the same oil as the tortilla chips, it really brings a different flavor to the fries. 

One thing I can say about this restaurant that I love? The excellent customer service. I've never had a bad waiter or waitress and the manager is very involved in the customers experience as he does ask everyone if they've enjoyed themselves and if there is anything he can do to make it better.  That alone makes me want to come back.  And who knows, I might try something else on the menu.
