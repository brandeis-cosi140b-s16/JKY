Saw a post on Facebook that the Depot was serving breakfast and I decided to go mountain biking in the area so I could see this crazy menu. I saw crumbled bacon on ranchero enchiladas and if I wasn't vegan/vegetarian I may have order them. 

I ordered Sopapilla Tacos and they were amazing! The sweet Sopapilla with eggs salsa and it also came with green chili, green onion hash browns. It was so unique and not the simple run of the mill Mexican breakfast. There are also drinks that looked smashing a beautifully decorated bloody art that could be a meal again with bacon, mango mimosa and a refreshing orange margarita! The orange margarita is fantastic!
I also had a red Modelo with the homemade Bloody Mary mix....Wow!

Looks like I found a great place for post ride / race breakfast and a place to fill up on before early ASU games!
