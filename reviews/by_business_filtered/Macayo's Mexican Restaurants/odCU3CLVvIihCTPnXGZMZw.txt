I grew up going to this place and I've always loved it. I purchased the Bob and Cha Cha margarita glasses that allow me to get discounted margaritas every time I go. Their chips and salsa is the main reason I go--I think it's the best in the valley! They also just added these rolled tacos to their menu which I plan on getting every time now-they are so good! Additionally, I have never had trouble getting a parking spot.
