Enjoyed the meal, but happy hour was unfair.  They listed $3 house margaritas of which I got 2.  Served in a large martini style glass.  Then I watched a guy order one after happy hour and the drink was served in a regular large drinking glass.  Not the much smaller glass I got.  So basically I paid $3 for a much smaller drink. A happy hour drink should be a special price on their regular priced drink.
