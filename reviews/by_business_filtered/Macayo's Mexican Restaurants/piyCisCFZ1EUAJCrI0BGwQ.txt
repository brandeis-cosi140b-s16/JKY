I would like to give a shout out to Bryan...he was very courteous and attentive, and his customer service cannot be beat. The food was amazing and I had some great laughs with friends and I have nothing to complain about because he took very good care of us! The server was on point, brought us chips and salsa and our drinks were never to the bottom of the glass. If you have a lunch hour to kill...this is the spot to be because you will be well taken care of, plus the food is really good. Thank you Bryan for keeping up to your word, you are an asset to that company and epitome to how all managers should be.
