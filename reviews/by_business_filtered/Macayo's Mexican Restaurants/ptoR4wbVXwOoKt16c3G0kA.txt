The Macayo's chain is an American version of Mexican food. You won't find anything spicy or authentic on the menu, but the food is still good. Just set the right expectations. They do great lunch specials and a decent happy hour. Two tacos, rice and beans for under 10 bucks. Sure I will. 

The service is great and this particular location has a pleasantly large outdoor patio
