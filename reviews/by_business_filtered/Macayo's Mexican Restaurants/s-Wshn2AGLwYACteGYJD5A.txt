I'm leaving one star because that's the only option.stale chips.worst salsa I have ever had . seriously.waiter had a bad attitude.no personality and stared me down angrily when I asked a question about the food.i ordered the two item combo with an enchilada and a tamale.the side of refried beans was waxy and flavorless.the tamale was hard on the outside and the beef tasted horrible.while we were seated we observed the waiters and waitresses complaining about having to seat a party of 15 with no reservation.which I could understand except the restaurant was empty.all things said,the place seems run down and I won't be making a second visit
