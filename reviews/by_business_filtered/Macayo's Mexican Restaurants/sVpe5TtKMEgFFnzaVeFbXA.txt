Attention, General Manager......you have a problem.

Went to lunch here for the 1st time in a while.  The buddy that I went with said "man, the last time I came here, the service was BAD."  Why I didn't heed his comment and go to any of the other 50 restaurants within a 2 mile radius, I don't know.

We walk in the front door, and there are 10+ people waiting to be seated.  No evidence of a hostess, nothing.  We stand there for maybe 5 minutes, during which time several various employees walked through the room, none of who payed any attention to the fact that there are now about 12 people waiting for any sign of life and ultimately a place to park our rear ends and get a menu.  We decided to go into the bar area, which was pretty full with the same vibe of no employees, lots of patrons, nothing happening.

By some miracle, we were finally seated by a mute hostess, and it then took about 10 minutes to hear from anyone else.  From the time we sat down until the time we left, about 1hr and 10 minutes passed.  Every step of the way was us waiting for someone to take our drink order, waiting for the drinks, (just WATER by the way.....no bartender required) waiting to order, waiting for the food, waiting for water refills, waiting for our check, waiting to wait for something else.

The food - decent, but who cares.

Not going back there anytime soon.
