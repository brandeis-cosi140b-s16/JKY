This is my dad and I's go to spot for Mexican food. You definitely get a good amount of food for what you pay for. We always leave feeling stuffed and with leftovers. We had a new waiter tonight named AJ that I've never seen before, it was crazy busy tonight so I don't blame him for a couple mistakes here and there. Other than that he was great and super cute. I wanted to put my number on the receipt but I was too much of a wimp lol
