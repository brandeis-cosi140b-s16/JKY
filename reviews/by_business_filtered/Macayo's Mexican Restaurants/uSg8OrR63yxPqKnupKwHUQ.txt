we ride our bikes there for happy hour because we slurp the margaritas down on the hot days, and they are sweet and cool and refreshing. the happy hour prices are great, especially with the "bring your own mug" thing they do. the buffet is pretty stale, but decent for happy hour food and the staff is always friendly. good bang for the buck.
