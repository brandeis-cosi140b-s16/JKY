Let's be honest:  This is not true authentic Mexican food.  This is Mexican food as the gringos imagined it.  Having said that, that doesn't mean it's bad Mexican food.  The salsas are good, there is a sauce made of cream cheese, everything has cheese on it, and I'm sure they'd fry your salad if you asked nicely.  They have a pretty good happy hour the back room (the Aztec room I believe) is a good place to start.   The restaurant is huge and despite that, due to the massive amount of wait staff, you should be able to get in and out in a hurry.  Plus the building looks like a pretend Mayan temple.
