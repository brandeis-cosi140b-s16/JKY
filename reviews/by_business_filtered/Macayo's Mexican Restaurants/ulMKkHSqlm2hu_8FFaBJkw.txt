My wife and I really like the Macayo's on Central, and go there about once a month.

I haven't been to Depot Cantina in several years. Woody Macayo should make them take his name off the sign.

We went on a Saturday evening, after a concert at Gammage. The patio was dark and vacant, and we wandered in to the host stand. There was nobody there. We thought they were closed and were turning to leave when a server came up and showed us to a table in the bar. 

Chips, salsa, and water arrived, and I asked for the "hot" sauce, the stuff without all the cilantro in it--the good stuff. Tick tock tick tock. We finished the other stuff waiting for the hot sauce, which finally arrived. Both sauces were awful. Super watery, it just dripped off the chip. Definitely not the same stuff they serve on Central. He took my margarita order and the food order. We asked for more of the watery, chunky salsa for her. It never did come.

When it came, my margarita tasted weird, like they had used an incorrect ingredient in making it. Based on the previous inattentiveness of our waitron, I decided not to wait another 10 minutes to send it back.

I ordered two enchiladas, and all rice, no beans. My wife ordered the chile relleno, all beans, no rice. The enchiladas were okay, but the rice was dismal. When was it cooked, on Thursday? I usually eat about half in the restaurant, and eat the rest at home later. I ate a few forkfuls and left the rest. My wife said her relleno was okay, but she only ate a bit of her beans, too.

The check came. We paid. We left, and vowed never to return.

I give it that second star because I have good memories of coming here many years ago.
