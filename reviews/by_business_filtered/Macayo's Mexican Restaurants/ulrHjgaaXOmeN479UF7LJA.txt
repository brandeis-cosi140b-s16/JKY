You know, not everyone likes ABBA. But if you look at their record sales over the last 35 or so years, it seems like most people do. Still, they just are not and have never been cool. Despite an almost universal appeal that should point up some universally-regarded good qualities, they still get no respect.

I bring this up because in some quarters Macayo makes a mighty fine target. Locally they are like the ABBA of Gringo Mex.

And yet . . . they've been around HOW LONG?? 

So Macayo does far more right than they do wrong.  Check out the Steak Cortez or the Chicken Poblano and tell me it's not tasty. Order the fajitas and hear them come out of the kichen sizzling and sounding like a million bucks, and tasting like . . . well, like $14.95 or whatever. You get your money's worth.

So is Macayo's a destination? No. It will never be cool. Is it a reliable place for a good meal well-served? As they would say in Sweden: SÃ¤kert.
