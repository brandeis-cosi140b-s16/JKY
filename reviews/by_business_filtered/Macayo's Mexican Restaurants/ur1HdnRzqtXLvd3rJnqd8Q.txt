on a hot day after riding the greenbelt several miles with our trusty mugs, macayo's is always a pleasure. the happy hour food was ok, but we were starving so it satisfied. i have to say....our mugs are cheaper for drinks, but you have to tell them to lay off the ice. there's so much in there, it seems like you only get a little margarita and a ton of ice....marketing ploy? hmmm......
