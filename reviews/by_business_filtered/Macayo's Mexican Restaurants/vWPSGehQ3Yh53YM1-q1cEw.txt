Went here on a Thursday night and there was a pretty long wait. When we walked in the lady who appeared to be the hostesses asked how many there were two of us she said it would be just a minute. Well that minute turned into 15 mins. Ok so we sit down and got a waitress who was obviously overwhelmed. She didn't know who was sat first. We told her to take care of the other couple who was sitting next to us. She came back and got our drink order. We were ready to order by then but she didn't ask until after she brought our drinks. Now all if those things aren't necessarily horrible, but that and this made it a bad experience.  She came back to get our food order.  I ordered a cheese enchilada with GREEN saunce no onions. And my boyfriend ordered the sampler platter with NO GUACAMOLE.  Since he is VERY allergic which he told her. So of course we were upset when we received our food. I received a cheese enchilada with RED sauce that tasted old and not good. And my boyfriends food had guacamole.  She dropped iff our food quickly and when she came back and we told her, she said she told them no guacamole and asked if she could take just the item's with it in and remake them.  So she did that but when he got them back they were still cold. When it came to my order she again said I told them green sauce. She said she wrote it down correctly and that I could see her ticket. I don't care if you wrote it down correctly. It obviously wasn't right so why would you bring it? I was starving and we had to pick up our kid so I didn't have mine remade. But the food was just awful. When she came to give us the bill she told us the manger (who we never spoke to nor did they come to apologize) gave us 20% off???  No one apologize for what happened just made excuses. We quickly left and we will be extremely reluctant to return. We have been here multiple times and it's never been bad.  I understand somethings but the way things were handled were horrible
