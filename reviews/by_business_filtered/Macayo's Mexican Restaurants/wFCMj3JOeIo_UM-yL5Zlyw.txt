I have been eating at Macayos for years, and I have always been pretty satisfied with the overall quality of the food.  The indgredients are fresh, and the food has an appealing presentation.  The chips and salsa are some of the best out of various Mexican restaurants that we frequent.

The real issue with this location is that the staff is really inconsistent.  Occasionally, we will get a competent, friendly server, but for the most part, the service leaves much to be desired.  The servers tend to give the impression that they are annoyed to be serving you.  

Other than that, the restaurant is fine - we continue to return even with the spotty service.
