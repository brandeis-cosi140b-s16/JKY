Hadn't been to this Macayo's in years. First off, the salsa. Looks authentic but really thin. A gluten free menu is a nice option tho.

Waiter did a nice up-sell on the Cuervo margarita, which I got. He did fail to ask if I liked them blended or on the rocks tho. My wife ordered a regular margarita and our guest got a soft drink. 

For entrees, I ordered the BBQ Chipotle Tacos, my wife got the Roasted Tomatillo Spinach Fish Tacos and our guest ordered the California Burro. 

My entree was well prepared, with plenty of chipotle sauce and filling. My wife's tacos were equally impressive. Our guest had a fairly neutral reaction to his rather plain looking burro. I think he was expecting more sauce, since it was pretty dry. 

Service was cheerful and adequate for a slow night. 

I recommend Macayo's for those who are uninitiated in Mexican food. They actually serve Tex-Mex but it is a good step into the Mexican cuisine for Easterners like our guest.
