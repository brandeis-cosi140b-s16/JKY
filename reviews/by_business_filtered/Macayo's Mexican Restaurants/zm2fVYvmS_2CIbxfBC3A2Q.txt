Food was pretty good, came out not. Busser  refilled chips and drinks frequently and the overall feel and decorations of the place were great. The service we received though was less than satisfactory. It honestly felt like she simply wasn't listening. She filled our drink order incorrectly, instead of simply apologizing she made an excuse that I wasn't clear on the order... Not sure how much more clear I can say lemonade. My side of sour cream was missing from the order, as well the bus boy ended up correcting it. Overall- not super impressed with the service. Waiting 15 minutes to receive boxes seems a tad excessive.  But the food was good, willing to go again if we got a different server.
