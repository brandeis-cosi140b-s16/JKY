I went there last night and having been to other Macayo's, this one was a let down. The service was horrible (once I got service) and the food and drinks were definitely lacking. After waiting wondering if we even had a server, he finally got us water and complimentary chips. The server left the menu's on our table after we ordered. After they set there and started becoming a burden to the available table space, I got up and took them to the manager standing at the front.  I had the Steak fajitas and my date had shrimp fajitas. We had the margaritas that were on special and they were terrible. I would rather go to La Pinata a few blocks north versus going to this Macayo's again. Nothing is worse than watching everyone else get service and your having to bus empty glasses, return menus and wonder if your server went home or if you even have one.
