I like the craft beer selection here. There are about a dozen and a half craft options on tap from breweries such as Great Lakes and Troegs. The beers are fairly fresh and continually bring rotated.

The atmosphere is nice too. The music is enjoyable and at an appropriate volume such that you can hear it and easily carry on a conversation. The restaurant is dimly light which is easy o. The eyes as the night caries on. The only thing I didn't like it that the decor obstructed the view of the television; however, Mad Mex is more of a place to catch up with friends than catch a game.
