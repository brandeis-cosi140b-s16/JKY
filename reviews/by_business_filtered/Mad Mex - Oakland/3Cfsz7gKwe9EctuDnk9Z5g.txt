So I just finished running the Pittsburgh Marathon and I decided I needed some Mexican Food. Where to go. Found Mad Mex. Thought we were ordering the happy hour drinks but we weren't. Bummer - Big Bill. The waiter asked questions about additions to our meal and every addition increased the price. The food was OK but the bill was way to large. Wouldn't go back.
