I have been here many times and the food is pretty good. I almost always go after 11PM when most of the menu items are half-off. My favorite thing to get is the Los Wingos Wrap with waffle fries as a side. This would normally set me back about $10 but after 11 I can get this yummy and filling meal for just under $5 plus tip. I also enjoy their chips and Kaya Yucatan Black Bean Dip. Be warned that they often seem to run out of basic ingredients very early. My friend ordered the Chopper Salad once only to be told that they were out of chickpeas and 2 other main ingredients. If you drink, you should know that the drinks here can be a bit pricey. The service is slow and the wait staff isn't too attentive. The music is so loud that you won't really be able to have any type of conversation with the people around you. During the half-price promotional period the place is always packed with college students so come early to reserve a seat or be prepared to wait for 15-30 minutes.

All in all a good place for a very cheap late night meal.
