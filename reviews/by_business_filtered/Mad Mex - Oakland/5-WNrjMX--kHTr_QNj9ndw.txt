Late night half off was great! Besides having to wait 20 minutes to get a table, I overall liked my visit. 

The portions are huge for the value. Would not have gone if it wasn't half off though. I shared the nachos with steak between three other people, and that was really good and cheesy. For myself I got the chicken chimi. The accents of lime (in a friend's enchilada) and the seasoning on the chicken chimi were appreciated. I'll definitely want to come back on another night to try other things on their menu. 

Also, on a last note, we'd asked the waitress about the portions, and compared to all the other items, the quesadillas were the smallest portions.
