We were so excited to try the Mad Mex in Pittsburgh because we have so many awesome memories from Philly but unfortunately, this Mad Mex is just not the same. I don't care that this one is smaller but the food is just so below par. We've been twice in hopes that it would have been better the second time but no. Food was okay, beer/drinks were good and staff was nice. i love Mad Mex for their extensive vegetarian and vegan options but there was something missing from the food here. I'm going to give it one more shot.
