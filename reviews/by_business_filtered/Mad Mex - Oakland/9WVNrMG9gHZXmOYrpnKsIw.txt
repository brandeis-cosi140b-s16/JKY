The best thing about this place is the late night half price menu. Otherwise, it's relatively pricey, super dark, very noisy, and TINY. Don't expect to have any real conversation here or to eat a meal without being bumped into a million times by people coming and going. I don't think this place would do well if it weren't for the college kids in the area looking for drunk food after 11pm.
