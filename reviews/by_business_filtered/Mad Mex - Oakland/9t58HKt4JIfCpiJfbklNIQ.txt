See Eric L.'s review for best times to go. Situated right next to CMU and Pitt campuses, Mad Mex mainly caters to college students with HUGE and quite strong margaritas and extremely dark ambiance. The waiters even have small flashlights if you can't see the menu!

So far I've tried a burrito and an enchilada here. The burrito was folded square and is a fork-and-knife kinda burrito. It wasn't exceptionally tasty. The enchilada was better and spicy but again, not mouth-watering. The margaritas and chips and salsa combo are the winners so far.

I do love the art in here. I don't know if it's a chain thing and it's simply outsourced but I like to believe it's painted by local mural artists.
