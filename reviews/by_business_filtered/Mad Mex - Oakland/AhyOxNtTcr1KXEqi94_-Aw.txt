This is probably the best Tex Mex place in the city. I have to say that I came for the happy hour and was pleasantly surprised by the quality and versatility of the menu. I've eaten here a number of times (and had drinks here even more times), and I always enjoy the chips and salsa and any vegetarian food that I have had. The taco salad is freakin excellent. And of course, the margaritas are arguably the best in the city (on the same tier as the Cantina in L'ville). Go in and try a Big-Azz Margarita ASAP! 
I definitely enjoyed the place in Oakland more than the one in Shadyside (I wrote another review for the Shadyside branch)- the place is less crowded, more intimate, and the wait staff is cooler- however, it takes a while to get your food so plan to have a couple of drinks with good company as you wait.
