Love the beer selection for happy hours here.  The service is always great, and the vegan selection is great! Their menu lays out what is vegan, and they also have many substitutes like vegan cheese and sour cream. My only complaint is how dark and loud it is. Being in the heart of a college town, I wouldn't expect anything else, but still always a great experience.
