My favorite place to go for Tex-Mex food!  I can go on and on about this place but let me talk about some of my favorite things.
The wing-o-rito is awesome.  It is a burrito with chicken and you get to have your favorite wing sauce in it.  The los wingos wrap is also good and the waffle fries that come with it are amazing especially wen dipped in the spicy blue cheese dressing that they come with.

Always always make sure to get chips and salsa as a starter.  They have a number of different kinds of salsa and I like every one I've tried.

When you are not so hungry there is el no bono.  They are boneless wings.  We are not talking chicken fingers dipped into wing sauce...this is the real thing only without the bone.  Yum!

Then there are the "big ass" margaritas.  They are really good.  They have a lot of different flavors and you can get them either frozen or on the rocks.  I like the original on the rocks with salt and the strawberry frozen.  They also have rotating margarita flavors based on the season.

This is the original Mad Mex location and although it is quite small, I consider it the best.  The atmosphere, the music, the workers, the crowd, all make Mad Mex is great.  It does not have the family feel like the suburban locations which I think is good.
