This place gets four stars because it is vegan friendly.  A bit pricey, I admit, but try and go for the half-price menu, after 11 pm and if you are a student, sometime during the early afternoon (can't remember the times).  Happy hour is always crazy, with half off Margaritas and wings.  (Get the San Fran - yum!)  Take note - it's dark and NOISY, so don't go here for some intimate talk!
