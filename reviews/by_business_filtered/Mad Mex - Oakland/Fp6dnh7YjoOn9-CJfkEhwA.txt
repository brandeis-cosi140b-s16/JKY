I love you, Mad Mex, for your over-sized margaritas, outstanding bleu cheese dressing, and painfully good dip trio appetizer.  And you know what else?  Hats off to your Southwestern wing sauce.  It's REALLY FREAKING GOOD.  I mean, really.  I'm in awe.  I'm quite a wing person, and it's rare that I get my socks knocked off anymore.

Yes, you're a little loud and always crowded, but now that I've found the best things on your menu, the atmosphere will never stop me again.
