This place has been reviewed to death, so I'll just make a few points. 

1) Decent quirky vegetarian food - vegetarian-friendly. I've never had anything bad nor anything blow-your-socks-off good.
2) They are not "authentic" anything, and they have no desire to be. They have a Thai Curry Burrito and the Gobblerito on the menu. Enough said. 
3) It is too dark. But your eyes will adjust. 
4) Good draft list and happy hour. 
5) You can get drunk on margaritas without realizing it. Be careful.  

Don't go out of your way here for a romantic dinner. But if you want some good eats and drinks and atmosphere and you happen to be in Oakland, by all means stop on by and enjoy.
