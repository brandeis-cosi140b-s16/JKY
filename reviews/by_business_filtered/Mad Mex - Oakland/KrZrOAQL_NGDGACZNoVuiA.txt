Maybe I was just really hungry, but the grilled chicken torta and casa salad that I got was spot on! It was tasty and fresh. I really enjoyed a mix of the cilantro lime dressing that came with the salad and the chipotle aioli sauce that came with the torta. My friend got a burrito and cleaned his plate. Plus, we ordered past 10pm, so we ended up getting half off our food order!

I also got a margarita on the rocks, which was pretty good. A solid margarita. I liked that they had a variety of drink choices. (Lots of choices for people, like me, who aren't beer fans.) Thinking of trying their sangria margarita next time...

The service was standard. The ambiance was ok. I couldn't hear the people across from me that well because of the noise/music level, but we just had to talk a little louder than usual. I'm basically giving this place five stars because the food was excellent (and everything on the menu looked pretty good); plus, the drinks were good (with lots of drink options). Oh, and it's open for food till later in the night! (There don't seem to be that many other places to go to past 10pm.) I would definitely go back, especially if it's a late night dinner.
