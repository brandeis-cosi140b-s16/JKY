First.... would love to see the filth on this place with the lights on.... seriously... I think the dim lit ambiance is mask the bacteria in this place.  

Food - its a sad day when all i can say is that the wings are the best thing at a Mexican place.  The Carnitas was actually decent 
but ruined by too much spice.  I know this is not meant to be authentic Mexican food but  a Tex-mex  classification doesn't give you the green light to overpower everything on your menu with Chili powder, Cumin and jalapenos.  

I'm 1/4 Mexican - grew up with Mexican food - love spicy food - put hot-sauce/salsa on everything - eat jalapenos regularly.... 

Mad Mex - barley edible.    Gives tex-mex a bad name as I know there is great pride and a lot of heart and soul that goes into true Tex-mex.  

I think people go there - get drunk - then think they are eating good food.  Only conceivable way anyone could give this place anything over 2 starts.
