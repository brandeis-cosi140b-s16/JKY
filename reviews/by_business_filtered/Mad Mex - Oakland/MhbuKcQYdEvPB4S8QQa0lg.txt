The FOOD = awesome.  But the aptmosphere sucks...  

We used to come here for 1/2 price after 10 or 11 or whatever it was, in college.  I fell in love with their chick pea chili burritos.  

Con - they wouldn't or couldn't make them without onions for me and it's too fucking dark to see to pick the onions out.

Pro - since it's too fucking dark to see to pick the onions out I just gave in and ate them and learned to like something I otherwise might not have tried/liked.  

I really hate how dark and loud it is here.  It's kind of pointless to go in a big group because you're only going to be able to talk to the people immediately next to and across from you and it's a pain in the ass to get seated.  I much prefer the McKnight Rd location - is it still there??  Every time I am back in Pgh I mean to try the Robinson Town Centre location but I always forget until we are driving to the airport and I see it.  Maybe next time...

Love their chips and salsa.  Love their black bean garlic dip.  As I said already love their chick pea chili (have learned to make a knock-off to satisfy me out here in CA but it's just not the same...)

But avoid this location unless you're hurting for cash and/or have no transportation.  It's worth a little extra money to be able to see your food and hear your dinner companions.
