I love mad mex!  Despite hanging out in Oakland since middle school, I only recently made it out to eat at the mad mex in oakland.  This is the original flag ship restaurant for the entire big burrito franchise, and their food did not disappoint.  Their innovative twist on mexican was creative and delicious.  I've heard it can get crowded and loud in the evening but when I went for lunch on a sunday it was quiet and the service was fast.  Also if you're vegetarian there's a ton of great options catering to you.  I can't wait to go back!
