I've been here a few times and really enjoyed the restaurant, so when my parents came into town for the first time I thought Mad Mex was a great choice to show them what Pittsburgh had to offer. I couldn't take them to the restaurant because it's too loud there, so I ordered carryout.

The food took half an hour longer than they said it would be, and when we made it home, the entree I had ordered (and been charged for) was missing from our overall order. They refused to send the order via their delivery company (which in fairness was open another 15 minutes), but they offered me a free entree card that they are supposedly going to send me in the mail. Hopefully it won't disappear on the way here.

The entree card is all well and good, but my family was less than impressed with the restaurant I took as a representation of Pittsburgh - Mad Mex.

It's a fine restaurant, but avoid it for takeout orders.
