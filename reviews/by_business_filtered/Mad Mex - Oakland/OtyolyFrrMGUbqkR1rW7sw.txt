Boy oh Boy. I was pretty fuckin bummed when I moved out here to to only have more bad news on top of no good Chinese food but NO FUCKIN MEXICAN FOOD! For anyone that knows me ... DAS MY SHIT! Sooooooo bummed. But ... I went in to this spot around the corner form my spot in S. Oakland and gave it a shot ... all I gotta say is thank god I found some place! The Thai Burrito is my jam over there. Hold the extra supa doopa burn yer asshole off spicy pineapple salsa. Unless you wanna feel like somebodies droppin' matches out of your ass I highly suggest don't fuck with the spicy pineapple salsa. No Joke. Aside from that, big ass Margaritas and .... every night .... NAKED GIRLS!  Just jokin ... every night after 11 pm ... EVERYTHING IS 1/2 OFF! Couldn't beat that with a woofle Ball bat.

I fux wid it!
