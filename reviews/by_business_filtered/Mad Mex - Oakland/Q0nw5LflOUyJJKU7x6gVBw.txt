I had a delicious apple cider margarita. My friends told me that their margaritas have 5 shots in them, which I didn't believe because it tasted like applesauce... until I was stumbling around about half an hour later.

We shared some nachos, which were good (but that may just have been the drunk munchies) but the portion was too small to be worth $6. They were stingy with the chips, and it was depressing to have so much cheese sauce left and no (socially acceptable) way to eat it. 

The service could have been better. The inside of the restaurant is pretty small and the waitresses were really strict about who could sit down. You could only sit at a table if you personally were eating food. You couldn't even sit with your friend who ordered something unless you were eating it too. Our waitress seemed like she wanted to get us out of there (or at least away from the table) as quickly as possible. I understand that the place is small and tables are precious, but they could have been more gracious about it. That night, there wasn't a line to come inside and most people there weren't eating anyway, so we were standing around blocking the aisles with empty tables everywhere.
