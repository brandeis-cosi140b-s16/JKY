Pretty good Tex-Mex. Mad Mex is part of a chain of semi-themed restaurants by the Big Burrito Restaurant Group. Sometimes the theme-ish-ness can be a little overdone, but I think it's fun.

At night the place gets really loud and filled with college students there for drinks. During the day they have some great lunch specials. It's always really dark.

There's much better Tex-Mex in other parts of the country, but this is some of the best you'll find in Pittsburgh. I enjoy some of their experiments (if you're bored of a particular dish try the shrimp version).

If you're not one for loud, crowded restaurants, I do recommend trying it during lunchtime. You might want to bring a flashlight to read the menu though.
