We had a large delivery order for dinner.  Others liked this place. I thought it was horrible. I ordered a Shrimp Burrito and it had very little shrimp and a lot of rice (little taste for almost $10.  Nothing else was included.  The wings weren't bad (I tried someone else's).  Everyone refers to big portions,so I'm guessing you have to eat in to get it.
