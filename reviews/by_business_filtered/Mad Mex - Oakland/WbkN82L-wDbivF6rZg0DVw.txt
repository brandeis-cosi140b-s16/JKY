This Mad Mex is small, but mighty!  I don't understand the bad reviews--yes, it's a chain, but the food here is really good and the same as all the other locations I've been to.  I work in Oakland and if I can take a long lunch, I like to come here.  It's not usually that busy around lunchtime and you can definitely get in and out in less than an hour.  Staff is friendly and they have an awesome beer selection in case you're not coming here during the workday like me!
