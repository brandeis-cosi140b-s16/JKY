I used to play in a band and was taken to Mad Mex after a show in Pittsburgh.  Maybe my opinion is swayed by finally getting to eat around 1am, or the half priced burritos, or the cheap beer.  Whatever the reason I dug the place.  

As a side note, the guy who took us there was crazy.  He squatted in an abandoned apartment (I opted to sleep in the van).  I asked him how old he was and he said he didn't know... then he started to cry.  That crazy bastard knew where to get a good burrito though.
