Went there to celebrate with some friends and I was excited to try some Mexican food - something I'd been missing since I moved from San Diego to Pittsburgh.  Since there was a long wait we got margaritas and waited for the tables.  I got a strawberry margarita, but the flavor was unnecessary as all I could taste was cheap, nasty tequila.  Gross.  To mitigate the taste and try not to be sloshed before dinner we asked for some chips and salsa while we waited.  When we finally got some (15 minutes later) I was buzzed and disappointed.  The chips and salsa were worse than even the store brand from the supermarket.  My opinion, if a "Mexican food" restaurant can't do the good chips and salsa and margaritas, I don't even want to try anything else.  We paid our tab and left before our table was even ready.  No thank you.
