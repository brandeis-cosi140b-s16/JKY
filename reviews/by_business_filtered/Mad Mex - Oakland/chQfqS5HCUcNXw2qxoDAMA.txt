We have ventured here a few times since our first visit.. both for regular menu and half priced. Just an fyi it's always busy during the half.priced food. I honestly have never had to wait but they sure know how to cram people in the smallest possible space. 

What I normally order is the Los wingos wrap. I get the boneless wings with the honey bbq sauce. There is also (Mexican?) rice inside so it's very filling. I normally order it with waffle fries since you get to choose a side.

The big azz Margarita is also a fav. I normally order strawberry, but in August the flavor of the month was peach. That was also tasty and their list of Margaritas is lengthy.. Still need to try the sangria Margarita. 

The mad Mex burrito is also good. I always get it with chicken. I've also had the curry burrito (with chicken). It honestly wasn't my fav. I barely tasted the curry. It was more of a marinated or seasoned chicken than that curry taste. However, the peanuts and pineapple were a nice touch. The bean spouts were not a good touch and the Mexican slaw also wasn't appealing to my taste buds.. Maybe some but not mine.

The chimi is probably my favorite. It's really delicious!!!! This is not offered as half priced. It comes with beans and Mexican rice as a side but of course the chimi is the star of the show!!

Bobby and I have split the nacho grande and then once our food was delivered, we were too full to eat.. Piled highhhh but very good though. Honestly two people ordering drinks and nachos is plenty to catch up or as a snack.

Mad Mex is still satisfying in my book.
