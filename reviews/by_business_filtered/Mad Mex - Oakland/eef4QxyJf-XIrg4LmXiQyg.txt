I enjoy Mad Mex so this location works for me out of convenience. I have always been pleased with my meals here and I like the fact that you can choose your protein including tofu which is not always the case at most restaurants. My one complaint about Mad Mex is that chips and salsa aren't free but it often is at other Mexican restaurants. 

The atmosphere at Mad Mex is always fun in terms of the decor but this location is excessively loud in my opinion and I found that I was screaming just so my friend could hear me. This location is also very small and cramped. They make seating tight in other locations too in my experience, but the overall space is much smaller here making it worse. Parking is also bad at this location as it is street parking but much of the surrounding streets are for permits only.
