Ten years ago, this place was inventive and delicious.  It is still a very consistently decent place to eat, but other establishments, including the fast food places have closed a lot of ground.  Mad Mex still has great chickpea chile, and nachos etc., and the burritos are still a bit different from the standard chicken, beef, pork fare at Chipotle or Qdoba.  But these other establishments are no longer miles away.  Mad Mex could probably do with updating their menu.  At least they still have the thriving bar scene that differentiates.  I think in general, that too many of the reviews revel in the 50% off value as opposed to the intrinsic value of the place.  This is -- to me -- an indication that something needs to give.
