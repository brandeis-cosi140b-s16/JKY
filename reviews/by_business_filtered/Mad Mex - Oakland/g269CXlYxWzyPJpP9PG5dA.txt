I enjoy mad mex and their food very much. I always have a good time when I go there. My only problem with Mad Mex is their servers. My friend and I always seem to get not necessarily a rude server but they just never seem happy to be there. I understand they have to serve drunk pitt kids who come for the margaritas, but when they bring you your food they look like they want to kill you. Besides the service the food is as always very fantastic. My personal favorite is the beef chimi and I absolutely love the bean dip. Mad Mex gets 3 stars
