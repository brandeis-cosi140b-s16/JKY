Parking and seating was fine - winter break at Pitt. Food was great - especially the tofu tacos. My only complaint and its a big one - the music was WAY too loud. My party of 8 was seated at a large round table and I could only hear about half of them. What a waste considering the whole gathering was to catch up with old friends.
