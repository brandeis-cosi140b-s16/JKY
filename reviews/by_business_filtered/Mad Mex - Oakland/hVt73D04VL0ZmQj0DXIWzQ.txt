This is one of my favorite restaurants. I have been consistently getting half price late nite food here for 10 years. The quality has waxed and waned over the decade and I would say recently it has been excellent. Favorites are the spicy M.M. Burrito and vegan nachos grande. This place is meat and vegan friendly. A continual staple in my life.  

The music can be loud, the college students can be annoying, and the margaritas and monthly beer specials may make it difficult to get up.
