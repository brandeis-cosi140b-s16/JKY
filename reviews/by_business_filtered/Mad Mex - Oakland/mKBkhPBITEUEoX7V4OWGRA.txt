I love Mad Mex, despite the fact this location is tiny and crowded. Any Mad Mex is going to be great in my opinion, but this one is close to my heart since I spent my 21st birthday there.

We come pretty often for happy hour (4:30 - 6:30) where you'll find half-off drafts and wings. They don't advertise it, but I think you may get a discount on all margaritas, not just the big azz ones ($7 opposed to $10). The margaritas are THE reason to go, in my opinion (avoid the hibiscus peach one - it's pretty hard to drink and $12). Until the end of November they have cranberry and pumpkin margaritas as well. The pumpkin is surprisingly delicious. I'm not sure if it's only during happy hour, but you get free (and refilled) chips and spicy salsa at the bar.

But wait, there's more: they serve damn tasty food! And with half price starting at 11 (luckily one of the "select items" are the burritos), you can't pass it up.
