i came here late at night for the half price burritos and cheap huge ass margaritas. i had the angry hippy with portabella mushrooms. the food is tasty and the margaritas are delicious. it was a friday and it was packed. the atmosphere was lively and fun. the waitress/bartender was really nice, fast, and very attentive.
