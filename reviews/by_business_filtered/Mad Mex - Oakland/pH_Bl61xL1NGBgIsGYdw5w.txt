Definitely one of the to-go places if you're a college student on Pitt/CMU campus. Half off after 11 will make it easy on your wallet. Lots of good noms and  the half-off special is quite extensive ... can use on most of the top picks. I'm personally a fan of their enchiladas, especially the carnitas (steak meat) enchilada. Pickadippa is also a good appetizer to start if you're into the salsa and dip for chip kinda thing.
