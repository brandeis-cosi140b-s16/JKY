My boyfriend and I came with two of our friends for a late night meal on Friday night. We arrived around 10:30pm and was starting to get crowded by the bar, since it was so late for normal dinner there were tables and we were promptly seated.  We started off with a Big Azz Strawberry Margarita on the rocks with salt and our friends ordered a Raspberry to split. They were on special 22oz for $7. They came out fast and were strong and had good flavor.  

The waitress reminded us that at 11pm the food would be half off, so she said if we wanted to wait a few more minutes with our drinks, she would be happy to bring out the chips and salsa and come back for our orders.  I thought this was really nice of her to make sure we got their late night (11pm-1am) special that features their menu at half price.

I was kinda bummed they didn't have fajitas because I had been craving them, but my boyfriend and I happily settled for the Mad Mex Fajita Burrita with chicken. Also included inside was grilled peppers, onions, black beans and Monterey Jack cheese. We also got the California Grilled Salad with carnitas thanks to the suggestion of our waitress.  It did not disappoint,and was easily large enough for the two of us to split. The lime-cilantro vinaigrette dressing was the perfect addition to the carnitas and avocado in the salad. We were easily stuffed by the end and our bill came to under $20. 

The atmosphere at Mad Mex is chill. Very fun and inviting place to hang with friends. I would gladly come back and try Mad Mex for round two!
