If you're not at Pitt for undergrad, then don't waste your time here. If you want to get f'ing wasted and live in south Oakland, the only redeemable qualities are their "Big Azz" margaritas, and that is a long as you can put up with the over crowded restaurant, their asshole employees, and the wait times. By the way, you can rarely sit or sit at a table if you're only drinking.
