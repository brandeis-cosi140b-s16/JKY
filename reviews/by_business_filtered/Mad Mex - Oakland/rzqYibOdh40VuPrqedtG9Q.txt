Mad Mex was one of the first restaurants I visited when I moved to Pittsburgh.  I've been a fan ever since.  This location (they have several around the state) was the first and helped the Big Burrito Restaurant Group get off the ground.  

The space is cozy, and can be somewhat cavernous during the daylight hours.  The decor is wild.  Staff is nice and consistently busy.  The college crowd can take over this place in a hurry, so get to happy hours early and try to get a table just before the late night specials start.  

I recommend the Kristy's Big Sister Red Velvet Quesadilla.  It's chicken, cheese, zucchini, and spinach combination is great with the salsa, guacamole and just a dab of sour cream.  Wing fan?  Try the San Francisco glaze with either the "mild, wild, or insane" hotness factor.  (I can't eat the insane wings...just too darn hot).  Also, try the variety of Monday through Friday lunch combinations.
