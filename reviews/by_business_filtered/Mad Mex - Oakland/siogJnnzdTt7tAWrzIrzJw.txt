Received terrible service here. They refused to seat us because we just wanted to get their specialty margarita, yet there was no room at the bar for our party to sit.  There were PLENTY of empty tables for us to sit and enjoy a drink.  They only seated us when we talked to a manager and explained how one of us had a broken arm.  At that point, the employees proceeded to glare at us and we could hear them talking about us.  We just left because you shouldn't have to beg for service.  Really unfortunate because I had heard good things...I do not reccommend this place.
