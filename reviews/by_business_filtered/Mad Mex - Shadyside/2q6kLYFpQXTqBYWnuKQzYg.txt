This place is hip and fun.

Definitely sit at the bar as your chips and salsa are free as opposed to sitting at a table where you have to pay for it. 

Also their bar staff have been there a while and know the menu and are very attentive to the customers.

However the host was unpleasant when we had asked for a seat near the bar to view the tv. The food runner told the dropped out food off and was too busy to answer the wifi password or to grab ketchup for the fries we had ordered.

All and all this is a great restaurant with great beer and food. The management should have a chat with their crew regarding customer service though.
