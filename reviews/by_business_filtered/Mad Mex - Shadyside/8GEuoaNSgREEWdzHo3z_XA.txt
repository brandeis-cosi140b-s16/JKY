If I lived locally I would definitely return here, for one reason alone.

Most "Tex Mex" restaurants recipes involve three items: meat, cheese, and tortilla. This place is no different. Their menu is mostly some variation of those three basic ingredients, which isn't a problem unless you have a hard time processing dairy.

I had a much difference experience the other night. All i did was order my burrito without the cheese. No other special requests or requirements.

Of all places, the kitchen decided it was best to separate their blue corn bread (which contains dairy) on another plate.

I was blown away. I've never received that level of care and forethought before in the five years I've had a difficulty processing dairy.

Absolutely fantastic performance from their kitchen staff. I've told everyone I've seen since about their quality decision making.

I know lactose intolerance isn't the end of the world if you have no problem digesting dairy. If you do have a hard time, you surely feel like I do: everything in America is covered with cheese.

That night I felt like someone I don't know cared.
