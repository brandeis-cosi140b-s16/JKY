This is one of our go-to spots. Love the beer selection here! The wings are delicious and the pick a dippa is awesome- the guacamole and habanero pineapple salsa are two of our favorites. The carnitas burrito, black bean quesadilla, chicken torta, and California salad are some of my favorites. Wait can sometimes be long on weekends. Speaking of weekends we like the Sunday brunch too. The chorizo tacos are yummy and I always get the heuvos rancheros. The breakfast potatoes are good. I always get a screwdriver to drink and it's so tasty.
