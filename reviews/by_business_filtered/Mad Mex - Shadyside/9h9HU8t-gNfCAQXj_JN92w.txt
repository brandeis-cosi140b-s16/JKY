Location, Location, Location.  Any other Mad Mex would get 4 stars, but this one gets 5 because it has two levels, a large bar and is so much more spacious than any other one I've been to.  It gets a great, fun crowd too. 

My favorite menu item is the Black Beanie quesadilla.  Something about the blend of spicy goodness and the sweet from the pineapple is absolutely perfect.  I also recommend the nachos.  The chicken nachos are fully loaded with chicken, guac, sour cream, jalapenos, cheese, beans and salsa.  It's a huge serving and could be a meal in itself.  Hands down, best nachos I've ever had and great to share with a group.  I also recommend doing the three salsa/dip deal as an appetizer.  The queso, guac, regular salsa and the pineapple habanero are quite tasty.  The pineapple one is really hot though so don't say I didn't warn you.

Now, I know everyone goes here for the margaritas which are a steal during happy hour but I've recently tried the red sangria and was delighted.  It's the perfect mix of sweet and dry and while I don't know the caloric intake, it has to be less calories than the big azz margaritas which are rumored to be over 800 calories.
