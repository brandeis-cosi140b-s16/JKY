The atmosphere of the restaurant was very nice. They played good music, however, it was extremely loud and was hard to have a conversation at the table with the music blaring. They had a very good menu with alot of options. When the food came out it looked very good. I ordered the enchiladas and may girlfriend got the fajitas burritos. The dishes were not served warm and were very bland. The enchiladas had chunks of chicken that were hard to eat. it would have been better of the meat was shredded. The fajitas burrito had large pieces of meat and the steak was very chewy. The burrito was not well mixed, the one side had cheese and rice and the other side had the meat. Overall the restaurant had a good atmosphere and presentation, but the food needs work.
