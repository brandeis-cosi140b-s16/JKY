Must say that we only went here for drinks one afternoon and were pleasantly surprised by the beer selection, the service and most of all their jalepeno margarita - oh so delicious! We ordered the guac and chips which were standard, good and satisfying. Hoping to return for a meal and many more margaritas someday.
