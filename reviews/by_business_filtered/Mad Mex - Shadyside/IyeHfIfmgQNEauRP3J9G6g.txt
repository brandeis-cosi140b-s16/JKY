This is good 'ol Americanized Mexican food with big portions, decent prices (in general), and awesome allergen information! Two of the friends I was dining with are vegan and there were a ton of options for them, which was a huge plus! They even have Daiya dairy/soy/gluten free cheese! 

Anywho, I'll start with the drink I ordered. I got a 12 dollar Don Julio VIP margarita that has an inside out lime floating on top (a floater) and a shot of tequila in it. I got it on the rocks, which I regretted, because the thing was EXTREMELY watered down, almost tasteless. I won't be spending 12 dollars on that again. You can add the floater to any drink, so I think I'd get the 5 dollar margarita and add it on instead in the future!

As for the meal, they have a lot of options for people who are gluten free! All of the allergen information is listed clearly on their website for dairy, gluten, soy and peanut. You must inquire about any other allergies. They have a lot of gluten free options, such as their plain meats (carnitas, steak, chicken, shrimp) and you can sub in a corn tortilla for a lot of the menu items. They also have a "bare-ito" that allows you to make any burrito into a bowl! Good stuff. 

Soy allergy info: There are not a lot of soy-free options or substitutes here. Almost everything is marinated, fried, or cooked in soybean oil. 

For this reason, I got a plain salad with tomatoes on it with oil and vinegar. They charged me 9 dollars for it. I wasn't too happy about that, but whatever. The rest of my friends' portions were huge and delicious for a good price. Our waitress was super friendly and all of my friends enjoyed their meals. 

I really bumped up the stars from 3 because of the vast options and information they have for those with dietary restrictions, as well as the good service.
