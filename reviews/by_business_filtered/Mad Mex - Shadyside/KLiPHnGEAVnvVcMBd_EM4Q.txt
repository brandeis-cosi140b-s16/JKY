We went on a wednesday and there was a 45 minute wait at 6PM, pretty impressive even when you consider the new restaurant smell. We had a few beers each from the very impressive draft menu with chips and queso for starters. After starters we both ordered the chicken chickpea burritos, which were big and boring. All and all it wasn't my kind of place.  It was full of dudes on the prowl and blasting loud music, which made it hard to communicate with anyone. The food wasn't amazing, but it was good enough for the price, especially when you consider the portion sizes. Service was on point. The best part was definitely the beer selection, but seeing as there's a 45 minute wait on a wednesday and it's full of dude-bros, I probably won't be back anytime soon. Oh, and there's a free valet, just in case you're into that sort of thing.
