I really like this place. Out of all the locations, I do like this one the best. Large bar area, some outdoor and partial outdoor seating. Upstairs tier as well. 
Great beer selection. Multiple crafts of tap and bottle selection. Margaritas: this is probably the only place I get a margarita. Ever since college when Tequila and I broke up, I have steered clear from even the margarita. Mad Mex makes a great one. Seasonal ones are pricey. Stick to the classic. 
Food. I love their chips and salsa.  That the best part of the meal as far as I'm concerned. You can also get this to go which is typically a hit for the on the go party appetizer. The trio dip app is worth it. Definitely get the guac. It's great. 
Every burrito I've had has been awesome. I'm partial to the fajita one. As of late I've been on to the mahi tacos. Fresh, and a little lighter than the burritos. Last time I asked for no rice and they LOADED me up with black beans to sub. Great to not skimp on that. The black beans are lovely, too. You can also get the burritos in a bowl. 
The Pennsyltucky tofu app is pretty damn delicious. 
Now...the must is the Gobbblerito at Thanksgiving (and occasionally in the summer or craft beer week by surprise.) Why does Thanksgiving dinner taste so good in a burrito? Because it does. 
They also have awesome mail coupons and free entree for your birthday if you sign up. Happy Birthday!
