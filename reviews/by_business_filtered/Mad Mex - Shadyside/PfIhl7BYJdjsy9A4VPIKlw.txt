On a Friday night around 6 the wait was 15 minutes but we were called after about 5 minutes after ordering a round of drinks at the bar. I had a Dark Horse Tres Blueberry Stout and was content. Who doesn't like blewbz? After sitting down at our table I noticed the 22 oz Dogfish Head 60 Minute IPA special for...wait...$5. Face sufficiently melted, I ordered that next and continued to do so.

My steak Mad Mex burrito was stupendous and a master sculptor managed to somehow wrap it into a cube instead of the standard cylinder, thus requiring me to get all dexterous with my fork y knife. 

Others had the San Fransisco wings (reported to be good but sugary) and grilled steak tacos (two opposable thumbs up), white sangria, and blackberry margaritas with a floater. What's a floater, you ask? I'll leave this one up to your imagination. 

Due to the nice weather the large garage door style windows were opened up and by chance we happened to be sitting next to one. After signing our checks, I definitely departed through said opening.
