A much as I don't enjoy the Shadyside crowd, this place was a nice addition to the South Highland string of places along the Shadyside/East Liberty wing of the East Side. The food (particularly the guacamole) and margaritas are great, particularly for the happy hour with a group of amigos. Fridays and Saturdays get crazy here, as the place quickly fills with snotty Shadyside goers, so make your plans accordingly. Bottom line: this is a vegetarian mecca with great food and booze!
