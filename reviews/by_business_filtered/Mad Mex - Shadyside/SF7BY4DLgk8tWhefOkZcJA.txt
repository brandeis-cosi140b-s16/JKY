LOVE the food. LOVE the margarittas. LOVE the half off deals. LOVE everything abou it. I've been to the Mad Mex in Philly, State College, and two in Pittsburgh. All of them serve great food and service and has never failed me. My favorite location is the new one in Pittsburgh because it's spacious inside and turn on good house/techno music (it is kind of too loud). I think Mad Mex has the best wings and nachos and I always have to get one of these. I cannot resist not getting them!
