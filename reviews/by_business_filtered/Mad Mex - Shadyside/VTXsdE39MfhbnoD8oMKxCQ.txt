I am from Ann Arbor and was visiting Pittsburgh. We visited this place in the evening.. It was bustling with activity but found a nice corner table facing the street. Food was excellent! Nachos were delicious. The best dish was the tacos with tofu. It was the best taco we ever had.. Very vegetarian friendly place with a lot of options... Will visit it the next time I go to Pittsburgh.
