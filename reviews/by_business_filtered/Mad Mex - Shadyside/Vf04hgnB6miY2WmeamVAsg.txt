This is the 4th Mad Mex I've been to in PA. This one was definitely the nicest I've seen. It's big and open and very nicely decorated. The bartender, Matthew, was absolutely wonderful. He was friendly, funny and really on the ball with our order. 

The booze is expensive, $6 or more for most beers. The food is good but also pretty expensive, though you do get large portions. The Southwestern wings are one of the best things I've ever eaten!
