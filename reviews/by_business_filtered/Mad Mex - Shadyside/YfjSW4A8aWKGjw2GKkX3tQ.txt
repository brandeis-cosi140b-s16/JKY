As far as actual food goes, Mad Mex is Mad Mex and I have nothing really negative or positive to say about it.  You get what you expect when you come here.  It's typical Mad Mex food.  Burritos, tacos, chicken wings, all decent.
The service on the other hand.  Wow...just...unbelievably bad.  I still talk about it to people.  I gave them multiple chances.  I thought, one bad server does not completely ruin a place for me.  However, the top three worst experiences of my life server wise have all been at THIS Mad Mex.
Condescending, rude, and inattentive are the first three words that come to mind when I think of the service I experienced here.  I won't go back.  I will still go to other Mad Mex's but I will never go back to this one.
