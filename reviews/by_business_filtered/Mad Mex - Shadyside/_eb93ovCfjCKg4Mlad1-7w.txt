The people that work at this location are awesome! They are always having such a fun time at work and that truly shows! I'm from Texas and extremely critical of Mexican food (they're food is okay not great but hey we are in Pittsburgh) but I like going to the bar grabbing a drink watching the Buckos and chatting with the staff!
