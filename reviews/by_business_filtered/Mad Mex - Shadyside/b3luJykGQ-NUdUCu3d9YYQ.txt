I like this location and I am a huge fan of margaritas and tacos. I always order the tofu tacos here. Trust me, they are amazing. Even Bobby, who does not care for tofu, thought they were good! 

Overall, it's a decent restaurant and it's nice that they offer valet service. Wait times are very unpredictable, though, so if you don't go on a more quiet night, you could be waiting for awhile (and probably outside because the foyer is so very small!)

Last time we were here we were seated upstairs. I thought this would be cool but it actually just seemed to result in slower service. I would request seating downstairs if the wait time isn't crazy.

The food is consistently good so we keep coming back!
