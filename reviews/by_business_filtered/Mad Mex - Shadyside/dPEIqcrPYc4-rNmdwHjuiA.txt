Listen, I am not the most picky when it comes to Mexican food, but when I get to sit in good lighting with a large drink and a cool breeze blowing through my hair, anything tastes amazing. I am sure this isn't the top of the line when it comes to food, but I LOVE that it's open late and has a large menu--albeit of the same items in different combinations--but that's American Mexican food right? I liked going to this place at night and pretending I was on a tropical vacation. It was magical.
