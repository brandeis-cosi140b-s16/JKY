Would give more stars if the service was better. Waited 15 minutes for a drink refill. Waited 20 minutes just to pay the bill. 

Had the chicken chimi and that was great although the sauce on top threw me off since it tasted like Italian pasta sauce. Still good though. The potato taquitos were great too. Service wasn't bad enough to keep me away, just hoping for a different server next time. 

Was a slow lunch service by the way.
