This place is one of the better Tex-Mex places in Pittsburgh, not to say it is the best, but I am hoping someday Pittsburgh gets some good Tex-Mex and barbecue places. 

I recently came here for Sunday brunch and I was not disappointed. They have a special that includes a brunch meal and a drink (alcoholic or not) for only $12. I ordered the chicken and waffles. I have to say the meal as a whole was more sweet than salty was a little bit of a let down. I really enjoyed the crispiness of the chicken and was hoping for a more crispy waffle. My friend ordered the breakfast burrito and it was my favorite burrito that I have had so far at Mad Mex. It was stuffed with eggs, potatoes, peppers, bacon, cheese etc. 

I would recommend getting any of the appetizers especially the black bean dip because it is delicious. I would not recommend the burritos (other than the breakfast one) since they are basically just completely filled with rice and they are bland.
