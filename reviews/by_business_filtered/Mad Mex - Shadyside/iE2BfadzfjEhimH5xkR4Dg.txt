OMG this place is awful!  I am shocked that so many people in the Pittsburgh area have such bad taste in "Mexican" food, as this place is typically packed.  To start, the salsa had zero flavor, and tasted like it was poured from a tin can of tomato mix.  The food resulted in a similar review; tasteless and a complete waste of money!
