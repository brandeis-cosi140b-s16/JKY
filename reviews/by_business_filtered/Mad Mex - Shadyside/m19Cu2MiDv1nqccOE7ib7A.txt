Umm... NO, Mad Mex, you're not mad and you're not Mexican. You're happy. And you're Mexi-Americano ( pronounced Meh - HE - Americano  [ Rrrrroll the "R" - for those at Mad Mex Corporate who don't speak/read Spanish]).... It's kinda like Chi Chi's, Taco Bell, and you're favorite modern & loud (not hip) club rolled up into one ~ Like, um, in a Burrito?

I mean, I had a good time there 'cause I could have fun in a box. And the food was totally better than Chi Chi's or Taco Bell (And I'm a huge 'run for the border' dude, seriously), but shit, my beloved Mexican friends in Chicago woulda' got a good chuckle outta the place. I can hear 'em now... Ohhh, muy authentico! Muy caliente'! HA! Then again, been here six weeks and still haven't run into a Mexican ( wish I did so I could get a tip 'cause I know somebody's cookin' up some legit Carnita's somewhere in town. 

Sorry to be so harsh... Its really not bad. I enjoyed the taste of my Cali-American taco. I would have had another but they thought just 2 tiny tacos was enough for me. Server was really friendly and was obviously busting her ass ~ running like a chicken with head cut off 'cause the MAD manager's think that servers should handle 20 some tables with grace ~ Somehow she actually did get us stuff in a fairly timely manner but I could tell others around me were rubbernecking for drinks/food and she was just a bit flippant when I asked for my Margarita on the ROCKS to not be frozen.

I promise not to be a dick on my next review.
