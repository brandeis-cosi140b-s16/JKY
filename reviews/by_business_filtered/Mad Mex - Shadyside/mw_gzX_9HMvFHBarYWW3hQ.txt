I am not sure what has happened, but the quality of the food has completely deteriorated in the last 3 months. My partner ordered the tortilla soup and got the chick pea chilli which was cold to boot. The tortilla soup which followed was also cold. The fried fish tacos which I ordered last night were completely inedible- the fish was soggy and did not taste like fish, but rather some kind of tofu. The black beans were dried out. We really enjoyed going to Mad Mex for the vibe, the drinks and the delicious food, but will not return any time soon. What is going on?
