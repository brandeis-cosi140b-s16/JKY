I love the Shadyside location, especially when the weather is nice and the garage doors/windows are open and there is a fun, open air feel. 

They have a lot of beers on tap, and they have a lot of local selections as well. The margaritas are good as well, and I love the happy hour specials where you can get $7 big azz margaritas. Yum.

Some of my favorite things on the menu include the black bean dip which is creamy, spicy, and completely vegetarian, as well as the shrimp and spinach quesadilla. You have the option to get a whole wheat tortilla, which is nice. I also love the California salad which is loaded with alfalfa sprouts. 

The vegan ranch is interesting, but I prefer the regular ranch dressing. Yum! It's great that there are so many vegan and vegetarian options, though. My brother is vegan, and when he comes to visit from Nashville (where there aren't a ton of vegan options), he always wants to go to Mad Mex.
