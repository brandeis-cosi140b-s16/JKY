Let's just say when people ask me (Miss Yelp! Elite) what my favorite Pittsburgh restaurant is I don't hesitate to say Mad Mex.  In fact, Mad Mex has been my favorite for a good twenty years when the Atwood Street location in Oakland was the only one.  Now you can find a Mad Mex in several locations, and the one I'm reviewing is for the Shady Avenue, Shadyside, spot.
I can't rave enough on the layout and design of this space.  Large bar in the middle with high tops surrounding it, huge garage door wall that is open as soon as the weather beats 60 degrees, sidewalk seating, inside booths, and a loft area with addition seating so you can peer down at all the cool kids hanging at the bar.  Phenomenal Mexican artwork largely displayed on the wall, awesome mason jars with green lights hung by rope decorating the bar and awesome wooden beams and floors.  You want to feel like you've gone somewhere cool?  Then come inside and enjoy.
I've ordered several different options from the menu - favorites being the fried tofu appetizer, the "pick-a-dilla" dips and tortilla (pick three dips - and always make guacamole one of those choices!), the Mad Mex Burrito, and the shrimp quesadillas.  All a ten on the yum-o scale.
Don't even get me started on their margaritas.  They're all delicious and the flavors change often with the seasons. For example, come in the fall and order an apple cider margarita, or stop by in the summer for a blackberry margarita...you get the drift.  
Excellent selection of craft brews on tap including killer IPA options.  And, when the clock strikes fall, you can get Pumking on tap.  Hail Mad Mex!
