I love TexMex. I love Mad Mex. I pay for it the next day, but I always have to get the picka dippa with pineapple habanero salsa. It's amazing--sweet with a big bite. 

Also, the Pennsytucky fried tofu is fantastic, but this time of year it's all about the Gobblerito. 

It's an entire Thanskgiving dinner wrapped  into a burrito!
