I love, love, love Mad Mex and I've been to this location as well as the Oakland, Greentree, McKnight, and Monroeville locations. They always consistently deliver me delicious food. Albeit, I ALWAYS get the same thing. I'm a big fan of the wingo-rrito or the wing (boneless) wrap. And I always get the Southwestern sauce, if you don't like cilantro, then don't get this sauce. Yummy! 

As an appetizer, I enjoy the picka-dippa especially with a group of people. I'm a big fan of the black bean dip, the XX cheese dip and then not really picky about the 3rd choice for the dip. 

Of course you can't go to MadMex without indulging in a margarita. This time around I tried the Apple Cider margarita which I thought was tasty, but not as tasty as my usual choice Mango. The Apple Cider margarita did taste sorta like apple sauce, but cinnamony apple sauce with a bit of a kick aka tequila. 

The Shades Mad Mex is always busy no matter when I go, but at least it's more spacious then the Oakland and McKnight locations.
