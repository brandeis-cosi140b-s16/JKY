It's Mad Mex. If you've been living in Pittsburgh for at least a month or so, you probably know what you're getting into already. Although this location can't quite rival the spacious Mad Mex Happy Valley that I grew accustomed to in college, it's still pretty impressive with a large bar and lots of tables, and the open garage door makes up for the lack of patio and provides for awesome people watching. The absolute best part though is that it's virtually across the street from my apartment! So I mean, I'd probably come here even if it was sub-par...(please don't stalk me, yelpers...haha)

For anyone who's not familiar with Mad Mex...the food is nothing to rave about. Typical Tex Mex that tends to taste better after a few drinks (especially the hugeeee plate of nachos). Their wings, surprisingly, are excellent and in my opinion the standout of the menu (get bleu cheese, not ranch. their bleu cheese is addictive). Mostly though, I come here for the margarita special. Doesn't everyone? I get really excited about the monthly flavors. My favorite is honeydew...June can't come soon enough! And if you're not in the mood for tequila, the beer list is pretty solid.

It wouldn't be on my list of considerations for dinner, but I'd definitely recommend it for a place to chill, talk, and drink a little (or a lot) more than you planned to.
