This place is perfect in every way.  I love Mad Mex more than any other eating and drinking establishment in Pittsburgh.  Great food, amazing beer selection, delicious cocktails and a cool and funky atmosphere.  Service is always on-point.  This place gets busy so you may have to wait for a table during primetime dining hours.  If you have to wait - grab a drink at the bar and enjoy the craziness.
