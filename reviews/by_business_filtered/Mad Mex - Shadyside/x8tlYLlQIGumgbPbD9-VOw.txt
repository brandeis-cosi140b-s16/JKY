Relatively cheap and convenient.  Certainly not a bad place to have in your neighborhood.  I like hanging out at Mad Mex, but it certainly wouldn't be my first choice for a solid Mexican meal.  The service is solid, but the actual food quality is merely good.  I've been here on two different occasions and have tried both the Hippie Burrito and the Veggie Enchiladas.  Both dishes are decent, but are really nothing memorable.  The bar on the other hand, is really cool.  A great place to catch a game if you're in the neighborhood.
