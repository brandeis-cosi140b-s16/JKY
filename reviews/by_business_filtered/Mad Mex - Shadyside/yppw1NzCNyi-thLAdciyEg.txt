This comment is on the service alone. I've eaten at the Mad Mex in South Oakland before and never had any issue- good food, good service given its South O location- but my experience in Shadyside was terrible. 

I arrived with some friends for drinks and we joined a booth of friends who were just finishing their dinner, about to order drinks. We sat down, the server came by, and we mentioned that we'd like to see a drink menu. She looked at us, rolled her eyes, and said "Of course you would" and walked away. She came back a minute later asking us if we could all move from the booth (which was on the top tier of the restaurant) to another one in the center of the main floor. My friends still had some food they were finishing up, and she offered to carry their plates down to the floor. After we moved down, she still hadn't brought down all the food, which we had to remind her to get.

She said that she was heading out for the night, but in most situations- and in restaurants I've worked in- if you're leaving an one of your parties looks like they're going to be a while, you ask someone else to cover. You don't move the customers- especially while they're still eating.

We moved downstairs and she introduced us to another server who would be taking over for us. He got drink orders for us, but she kept running by- I thought the point was that she had to leave? The second server brought us our drinks then virtually disappeared. My friend chased him around the restaurant after waiting 15 minutes for him to stop by so we could get our check. 

I generally like Mad Mex and I usually hear good things. I'd give this place another go just because I like the food, but this experience was prettyyy bad.
