If Yelp had a 1/2 star this would get an extra half to a 4.5

While driving through Illinois i had a taste for Mexican food, Jumped on yelp and found this gem. Once i arrived i found the parking to be small, maybe 6  spots? going inside the restaurant is equally is small. with two dinner style bar tops. They have paper menus as you walk in.

I ordered the Steak Burrito while my Fiance ordered the Chicken burrito, we got a bottle of water and a bottle of Coke, before we were fully seated the waitress had chips and salsa waiting for us. a few seconds later the burritos showed up, SUPER FAST! the chips were very good. the Salsa's were good too! The Burrito's were just the right size, and tasted great, they also serve the bottle of Cokes with real Sugar which is awesome. the workers are nice and everything was clean, i'd love to come back if i find myself in this part of Illinois.
