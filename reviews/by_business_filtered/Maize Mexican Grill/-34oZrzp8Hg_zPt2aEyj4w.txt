This place is amazing. Best Mexican on campus, forget El Charro, even on wednesdays. The homemade salsas are amazing. I always have the same order, 3 tacos: chorizo, pastor, carne asada.

My only drawback is a decrease in quality with the high volume. Food amounts can be variable, but their dining room is tiny, and the line always out the door.

I'll be back many times next year in champaign.
