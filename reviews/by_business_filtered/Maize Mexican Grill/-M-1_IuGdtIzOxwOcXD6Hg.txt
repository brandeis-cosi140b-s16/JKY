THE GOOD: It's a cut above your standard mexican food. They serve limes with their dishes and they come hot and fresh. Some different menu items than your typical champaign el toro/terero/etc.

THE BAD:I truly believe this place chose such a small venue to give the illusion of a busy restaurant to generate buzz about their business. 

STAY OR GO?: I would not go back to this place. Mexican tastes ALMOST the same everywhere you go in town. Other places in town you get to sit, be served, and relax (and the price is about the same).
