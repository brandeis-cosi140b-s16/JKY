Only once in my life have I ever craved a resturants food all the time. Maize would be the resturant I am talking about. I absolutely love the food!! Every food item I've had has been amazing! So fresh and real! Haha. I come here all the time! The service is great as well.  The servers are always friendly and kind. This place is small and the line is always out the door but it's so worth it!!!!!
