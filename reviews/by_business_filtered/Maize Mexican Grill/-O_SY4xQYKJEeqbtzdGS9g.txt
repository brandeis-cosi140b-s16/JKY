I love this place!  I frequently get takeout here for lunch, and sometimes i've even had it twice in one day when my family wanted to have it for dinner on the same day I had it for lunch! 

It's best if you call first, because it's a tiny space and in bad weather you might have to stand outside a bit.  My favorite items are the tacos (usually chorizo or pastor), and fried or grilled quesadillas.  I've had the chicken, asada, and fish as well and all are good, but my favorite is the chorizo!   Taco mexica is a taco with browned cheese on the inside, and those are very good as well.   We've had the nachos as a dinner item, but I didn't care for those as much.   Fresh chips and salsa come with your order.  I don't care for the watery tomato salsa at all, but the darker (maybe tamarind?) salsa is great and pretty spicy.  They also have horchata, which is probably from a mix, but the fact that they have it is a plus.

Definitely recommend getting it to go when school is in session and weather is nice, because it's quite crowded at lunch.  Parking is limited, so good luck!
