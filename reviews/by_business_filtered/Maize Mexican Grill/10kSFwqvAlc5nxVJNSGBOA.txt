Food is tasty, service is great but the seating capacity and parking need to be addressed. 

I'm surprised this place hasn't expanded b/c they do have great food. But the dining feels like i'm eating in a packed standing elevator. If you choose to dine in, try to go before peak hours or after.

The price is a bit expensive but worth the money.
