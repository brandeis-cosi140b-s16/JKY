This place is terrible. Coming from southern CA, this does not make the cut for good mexican food. They also make most of their food with lard and don't have any opt out option for vegetarians. Even their chips are smothered in it. Their burrito tasted like a bland hamburger. AND there was a line out the door, I just couldn't believe all these people thought this was good.
