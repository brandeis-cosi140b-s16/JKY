Carne Asada tacos - possibly the best I have ever had.  The homemade tortillas are amazing with the queso fundido as well as with the tacos!  The other yelpers are right that it is a tiny place with just counter seating - but it's worth it!  The staff was extremely friendly as well!  Probably not the best place for kids though as it's a more adult taste.
