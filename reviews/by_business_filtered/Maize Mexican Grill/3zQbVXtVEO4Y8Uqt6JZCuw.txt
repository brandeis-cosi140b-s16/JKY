We were on a cross-country roadtrip and needed lunch so we did some on-the-fly Yelping and saw this place. THANK YOU, YELP! This place was fantastic. The small space was packed and there was a line but it moved super fast and we got our food in record time. Everything was fresh and authentic, prices were very fair, and the service was exceptional. Even the gal running the register was sweet and helpful when plenty of other people in her frenzied position in a very popular spot would be surly and condescending. We loved everything about it and were so glad we stopped!
