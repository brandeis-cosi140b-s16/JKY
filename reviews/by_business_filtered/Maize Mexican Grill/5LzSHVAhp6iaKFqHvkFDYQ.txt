I am new to area and was craving Mexican food. I was pleasantly surprised with the food ! It's a small hole-in-the-wall restaurant that is sure to satisfy your Mexican food craving ! Prices are great as wel. I had a carne asada burrito and it was loaded with meat, lettuce, green cabbage, tomato, sour cream and guacamole. Flour tortilla was perfect consistency. We actually found a seat inside !
