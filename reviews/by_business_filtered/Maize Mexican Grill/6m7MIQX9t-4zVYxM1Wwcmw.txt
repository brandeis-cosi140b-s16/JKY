My boyfriend and I stopped here for a quick lunch on our way out of town after a short two day trip and man were we impressed. I ordered a pastor taco that was delicious and we shared an order of nachos also delicious! The homemade chips stayed crunchy and held up to the very last bite. He ordered a grilled mushroom quesadilla and loved it as well. We are new to town and will certainly make it a habit of coming here often!
