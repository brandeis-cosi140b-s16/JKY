I've been to Maize twice now and dined in both times. Once I came before the dinner rush so it was easy to get seats, and the second time was during the lunch rush so we had to wait around for people to leave. Love the chips and salsa they give you when you dine in, and the guacamole is bomb. From my two visits, I've decided the tacos are the most authentic I've ever had. So simple, corn tortilla topped with meat, onions, and cilantro, but so, so delicious. The first time, I had a ribeye, fish, and chicken taco. I still remember my first bite of a Maize taco and thinking holy mother this is good! The chicken was blackened and crispy and rich and oh so delicious. I was surprised how much I enjoyed the chicken taco, thinking it'd be the simplest of the three, but it ended up being so flavorful. The ribeye taco was also excellent. I love fish tacos in general, but my gripe with Maize's was that the texture was a tad on the mushy side and it was a little boring compared to the others. Probably will stick the meaty tacos from here on out. The second time, I ordered a ribeye and carne asada taco and a chicken tostada. Both tacos were excellent as expected, and I thoroughly enjoyed the carne asada. Tender and flavorful. I decided to give the tostada a try, and I'm glad I did. Crispy tortilla topped with beans, chicken, salsa, lettuce, and cheese. The chicken was different the second time, not as more like a pulled chicken, which was still delicious, but not the crispy blackened chicken I remember. The tostada was good, however, there was a little too much going on so I plan to stick to tacos in the future. Overall, I am so glad to have Maize on campus. It is cheap, authentic, and delicious. I'll be a loyal customer as long as I'm in the Champaign area!
