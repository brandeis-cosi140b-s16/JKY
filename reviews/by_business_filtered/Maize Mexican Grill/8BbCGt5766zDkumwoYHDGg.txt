Hands down best Mexican food in the Champaign/Urbana area. Everything is very authentic and the recipes are straight from a little town in Mexico. The quality of the meat is superb and they cook everything just right. I highly recommend the Volcanes because they are very unique and flavorful. The best meat is the pastor. You cannot find pastor this good anywhere around here. They marinate it just right. The staff is very kind and provide great service.
