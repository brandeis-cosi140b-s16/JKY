My review is not necessary here. You've read the other 300 reviews which rave about this place, and rightfully so. It's surprising to be able to get such great, quality and authentic Mexican tacos and sopes in my beloved hometown in the corn belt, but here it is, in all its glory. The homemade corn tortillas are wonderful. At the end of the day, all I ever really want is a mouthful of masa and salsa. This place delivers. The only thing wrong with Maize is they haven't opened a second location yet.
