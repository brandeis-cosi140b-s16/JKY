This place reminds me of taco joints in Mexico. They have a small space, but is always crowded because the food speaks for itself! I had the taco pastor which is pork cooked a certain way that it makes your mouth water just thinking about it. Anyway! The food came out super quick for it being such a busy little taco place. I found a seat, one of the workers gave me chips and salsa, and then my meal came. The tortilla was a nice a warm corn tortilla that blanketed tender al pastor along with cilantro and onions. Every bite was amazing as the last. If you're ever in champaign, bring yourself here, it's fantastic! The only bad thing about this place is parking because it is located at the corner of an intersection and the parking lot is tiny!
