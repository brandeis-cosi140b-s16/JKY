In the few years I've been on campus, I've been consistently disappointed with what passes for Mexican cuisine around here. That being said, Maize is rocking my world! The food is super-authentic, perfectly fresh and wonderfully inexpensive -- I've eaten there twice in a week! They even have legitimate vegetarian options.

I also love the decor. Most of the Mexican places on campus are gross inside, but this place is clean and has a nice vibe. Plus, the folks that own it are incredibly nice.

A+++, would/will eat again.
