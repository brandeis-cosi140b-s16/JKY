I have been in Champaign for two years. Having been raised in Los Angeles and lived in West Texas I've had a taste of many types of Mexican foods. 

Maize is the real deal. Authentic, flavorful, and addictive. I love this place. It's not for those on a diet or looking for light substitutes--the plates are meaty, and sometimes greasy. 

I have tried almost everything on their menu and everything is good. My favorite are the tacos Mexica--it's like a quesadilla taco. Amazing!
