This place is probably the only place I would go for Mexican food. It's always good and I never had a bad experience here. Even though they're always packed, you can always order pick up or do carryout! I've eaten there a couple times, but most of the time I would just do carry out because it's faster and I like to enjoy my food at home. I love love love LOVE their horchata! I've never had a horchata better than theirs ever since I tried it. CHEAP AND GOOD FOOD!
