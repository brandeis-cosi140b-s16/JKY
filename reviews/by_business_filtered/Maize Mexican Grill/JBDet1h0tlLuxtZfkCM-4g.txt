It's small and quaint, but it's so good! I get the veggie burrito and it's quite large but doesn't over fill me. They also give you tortillas and salsa with every purchase, pretty nice addition. The salsa is definitely on the spicy side but it's great. 

It doesn't take long to get your food either, very quick.
