Maize Mexican Grill is one of those places that has potential to become big but they seem to enjoy themselves in the size they are. This place is located on an intersection and parking is very tricky. It is almost always full of students for two reasons, one is their food quality and two is the prices. I don't think the quantity of food is too much so there is nothing left to take home at the end. Nice and clean location with limited sitting. 

They have different menu choices but basically the same food arranged in different way. That doesn't make is less tasty. Actually food is delicious in all forms and I highly recommend you try all of the different forms of your favorite meat or vegetarian dish. They keep this place tidy despite being very busy and having rapid turn over of customers.
