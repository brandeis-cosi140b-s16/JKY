This place is amazeballs!! Sure it's tiny but it's so worth it.  I stayed to wait for a seat and saw many people come in and out with take out. I was so impressed with the organization and quick and clean service. I ordered tacos to try carne asada, fish, chorizo and pastor. I also tried a torta, quesadilla and gordita. I was so happy that tortillas are freshly made and they also have horchata. I will definitely travel to this place again.
