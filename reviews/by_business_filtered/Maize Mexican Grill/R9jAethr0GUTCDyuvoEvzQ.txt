In fairness, I have not yet been to Maize, and I am headed over there this evening to "check it out".  Curiously, "Check it out" is the sign off phrase in two different reviews which Yelp filtered and hid from view.  I suggest you look at the filtered reviews.  I smell a rat... ...or two.
It might be great, but I would not rely on the star ratings just yet
