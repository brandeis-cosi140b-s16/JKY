Maize Mexican Grill is by far the best Mexican food in Champaign-Urbana. It is the only Mexican place that does not taste as if the food just got re-heated in the microwave. While they are not as cheap the other Mexican places in town, the quality by far trumps the cost and quantity you would receive at other places.

 I have tried a variety of their items. I really like their fish tacos and veggie burritos. The sopes are very delicious as well. Also, the hot and mild sauces that come with the tortilla chips are very good. As stated in all the other reviews, this place is very small and have limited (3) parking spots, making it very hard to obtain food when you have a craving for it. You can always call in your order for pick-up but there is still the issue of finding parking to go pick you food up. What I would suggest is they get a FOOD TRUCK that is goes around campus town, where they make some real bank. Despite this big negative of space and parking, the food makes for a worthwhile trip.
