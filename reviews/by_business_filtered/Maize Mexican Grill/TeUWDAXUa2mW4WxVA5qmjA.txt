A tiny spot on Green St just before the main part of Campus Town.  All counter space seats, and just a handful at that.  So you either are lucky to get a seat, or take it to go.  Service is friendly and knowledgeable with recommendations.  Food comes out piping hot before you know it.  

Huge burritos, tortas, tostadas, flautas, etc, with some tacos and other various Mex offerings.  A torta is more of a pressed sandwich.  The chorizo is great, and the spicy torta is amazeballs.  Swimming in spicy pan drippings.  

An excellent spot for anybody, but especially as a lunch spot for students during the school year.  So while the U of I is in session, this place is always packed.  Luckily I am usually up this way during the Christmas break and it is really chill.  One of the better spots in Chambana for a great lunch.
