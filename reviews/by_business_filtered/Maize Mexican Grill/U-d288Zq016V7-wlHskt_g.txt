This place is fantastic.  The staff is extremely friendly, the food tastes authentic, and the prices are extremely good for what you get.  4.50 for a burrito with chips/salsa included...can't get much better than that.  I'd recommend trying the quesadilla's there. They make their own tortillas and it really is a one of a kind meal.
