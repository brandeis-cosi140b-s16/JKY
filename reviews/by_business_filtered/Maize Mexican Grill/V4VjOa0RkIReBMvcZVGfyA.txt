Easy to sum up with a "meh" - I was going to give this place two stars, but there are solid redeeming qualities. Sorry previous reviewer, this food is not anywhere near the level of Rick Bayless, and it's barely up to par with most solid taquerias in Chicago (and it's more expensive).

Have you had the burrito? It's 75% lettuce, 20% sour creme, and a tiny sprinkling of salsa and meat. It's also fairly small, so you only end up with two or three bites of meat in the end. Such a letdown given how good their pastor and asada are - so get a taco where you can enjoy the flavor of the meat a bit more. The chorizo is greasy as all get out, which I know is somewhat a function of chorizo, but its not even all that delicious. The chicken is shredded and usually pretty good, but I've had it a few times where it's completely bland and over cooked. The chips are amazing and the guac is good - but again they cut it with lettuce! You get a decent portion, but it's scooped onto a giant pile of green lies that gives you bites of crispy watery blandness.

I don't mind the small space, but I'm looking forward to their bigger restaurant next year. Yes, I'll keep coming here, but please stop watering down your food with lettuce.
