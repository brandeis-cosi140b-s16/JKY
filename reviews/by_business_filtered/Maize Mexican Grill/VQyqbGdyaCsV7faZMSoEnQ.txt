This place has excellent food and service. The people working there are responsive and the service is quick. It is definitely one of the best places to get Mexican food in the area. The food is top-tier, nicely prepared, and authentic. Definitely try the chalupa...fried!

However, the dining area is small so I would suggest going on off hours.
