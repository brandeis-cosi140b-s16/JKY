Anything you get here is great. Really. I always tend towards the pastor because I am a pork fan, but the chicken or steak are all great too. Whenever someone visits me from out of town, the two places I take them to eat are here and Black Dog. 
 
The only person I have ever known who doesn't like Maize was one of my old roommates... but he also used to put ketchup and cheese on bread and call it a meal, so take that with a grain (or heaping mound) of salt.
