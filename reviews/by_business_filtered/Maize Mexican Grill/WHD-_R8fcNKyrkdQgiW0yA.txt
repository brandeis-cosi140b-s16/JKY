This is a little hidden gem with the best Mexican food in town.  The place is very small and cramped, and there is often a line out the door.  However, the tacos de carne asada (steak tacos) are to die for - made with corn tortillas, cilantro and onions, just the way they are supposed to be.  The burritos are passable, but stick with the tacos if you want rather authentic Mexican food.  The price is not the cheapest compared to say, Dos Reales (another decent Mexican place in town), you do not get any sides and the drinks do not come with refills.  However, it is definitely more authentic.  

Dining in at this place might feel rushed since it is so small - best get your food to go.
