Sometimes when something is overhyped, you set yourself up for disappointment.  I wish I had visited Maize before I had heard anything about it, I think my expectations were too high. After reading reviews, it sounds like the prices have gone up since opening and it is not necessarily a bargain.

The parking lot is very small and awkward since it is on the corner of a fairly busy intersection. The staff is super friendly and helpful and will answer any questions you have. If you are short on time, this is a great place to go since the food comes out FAST, unless you have to wait in a huge line to place your order.

I tried a fish taco and a pastor tlacoyo, both are items I have not seen on menus at Mexican restaurants around town. They were both very tasty and authentic. The sauce on the pastor tlacoyo was delicious and I was delighted by the authentic cheese and crema topping.  Chips and salsa were good, but they're not my favorite in town.

I would go back and try their torta and any entree that has squash blossom or huitlacoche.
