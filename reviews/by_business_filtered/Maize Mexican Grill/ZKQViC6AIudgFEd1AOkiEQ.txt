Hard to find for out-of-towners. It's across the street from Dominos on Green St.  Decently fast service - took just under 10 minutes to get 2 tacos and a deep fried quesadilla (say it like Napoleon Dynamite's grandma). The tacos are somewhat authentic w/ cilantro / lime / onion.  They put mayonnaise (interesting) on under the meat on the tortilla, but it was hardly tasted. My big complaint is the tacos and quesadilla were extremely dry.  They have two salsas - an orange and yellow colored salsa.  The salsa tasted good on the chips, but not good enough or complimentary for the entree.  The girl who took everyone's order was very nice so customer service was good.  Lastly, the restaurant only seats 12-14 people (elbow to elbow) so eat out if you wish.   Ultimately I would not eat here again, but if you read other reviews and decide I'm off my rocker, take it to go and buy an extra bottle of water because your mouth will be dry after eating.
