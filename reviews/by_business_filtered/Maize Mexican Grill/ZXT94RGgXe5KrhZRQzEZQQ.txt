I don't understand why everyone is ranting and raving about this place. I went solely because of all the fantastic reviews, but I was incredibly disappointed! Is it absolutely terrible? No. Is it the best Mexican food out there? Not even close.

My first time here I ordered 2 carne asada tacos and 1 chicken taco. When I unwrapped my food, I was disappointed to see 3 puney little tacos. They look like tacos you'd order off of some sort of kids meal. Not only were these tacos small but they were dripping in grease! I love my greasy, unhealthy foods as much as the next guy, but these tacos made me feel absolutely disgusting and sick afterwards just from all the grease. It wasn't even worth it because these were the most bland tacos I've ever had. Probably one of the most bland things I've ever tasted period!  I don't understand how meat can be that bland. Even unseasoned meat isn't that flavorless..

I've given this place another try because of all the good reviews. Although the food I ordered on the 2nd and 3rd time had more flavor and were a more acceptable portion size, it had even more grease. My boyfriend couldn't stomach them either. We ended up just throwing the food out..
