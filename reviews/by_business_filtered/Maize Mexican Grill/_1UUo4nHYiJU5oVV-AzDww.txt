Maize, what can I say about you? It was love at first bite.

This is authentic Mexican food in Champaign. The chicken, fish, and ground beef burritos are amazing. The ground beef, chicken, and chorizo tacos are great. The volcano taco is fantastic. Catch my drift? And free chips with any order...what more could you ask for?

Well if you want to get specific, my only complaint would be that the place is small and so is the parking lot (5 spots maybe?). It's always crowded, but always worth the wait. Call and place your order in advance so you can skip the line.
