I decided to give this place a try since it seemed to be [over]hyped by many students and classmates.
Everything here tasted of salt. It was all I could taste. I had the tacos and tlacoyo; the meat did not seem fresh and the cheese tasted processed.

It's your standard run of the mill mexican restaurant, but I've definitely experienced better.
