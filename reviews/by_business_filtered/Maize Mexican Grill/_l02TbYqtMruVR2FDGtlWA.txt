Seriously the best mexican food I've ever had. And I've had a TON of authentic mexican, in America and beyond. All you need to know is that this place is legitimately the best mexican food you will ever eat. Personal favorite is steak tacos. UNREAL people. I can't say enough about how much I love Maize!!!!
