This place is fabulous. The food is fresh and deliciously seasoned. The prices are very reasonable, especially in comparison to all the other Mexican places in town, and the decor is cheerful and clean. 

I would highly recommend the Sope al pastor cooked on el comal (not fried). And the tlacoyo was also delicious. Husband had a burrito al pastor, which he loved. They give you free chips and homemade salsa. We both left feeling full and happy.

The owners are very kind and personable. I will definitely go back again.
