Maize is some of the best Mexican food I've had. It definitely lives up to the hype. The menu has so many options that provide a lot of food for good prices. It is always so tough choosing but the workers usually have great recommendations! Ordering ahead is an option especially when it is busy hours but I always seem to forget to do that. The wait is worth it is a small place so do not be surprised. While it is no longer on my walk home from class, I will go out of my way to get Maize.
