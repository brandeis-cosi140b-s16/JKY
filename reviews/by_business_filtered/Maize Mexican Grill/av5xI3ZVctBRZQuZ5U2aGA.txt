My absolute favorite Mexican restaurant in the Champaign-Urbana area (and perhaps of all-time). The ingredients of every entree are fantastically fresh, the food is very quickly served, and the service is fantastic. The menu is extremely simple to navigate, and the ladies who work the register are very kind and helpful. On most days, I eat the veggie burrito here, and I'm always elated to eat it. It's cheaper than Chipotle, and that much tastier!

Do note that the restaurant is extremely small, so seating may be tough to find at peak hours, but it is 100% always worth the wait.

I made it a point to go to this restaurant weekly instead of attending one of my lectures. That was one of the best decisions of my life.
