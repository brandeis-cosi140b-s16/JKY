Serious little hole-in-the-wall spot.  They may have seating for a dozen or it may be a little less.  Glad I found them because I had a killer lunch there and it only took about 15 minutes from start to finish.

I walked in for a late lunch but the place was still swamped.  I didn't see a menu board but I did see a sign that instructed me to order at the register before finding a seat.  I asked the guy what was popular and he pointed me towards the Tacos Mexica.  I ordered those and he pointed me towards a nearby seat.  I noticed that the next few people in line behind me ordered in Spanish and took that as a good sign.

Canned soda which translates to no refills but the chips and salsa assortment made up for that.  Their salsas are served in small ramekins, each with a little spoon.  They range from medium to hot and pack a lot of flavor. 

The Tacos Mexica are small "street taco" style tacos with a twist: they melt cheese on the corn tortillas before adding your choice of meat.  I went for carne asada, chorizo and al pastor.  I knew that I wouldn't make it through all three and the chorizo was the one that I decided to leave after a bite or two as a little chorizo goes a long way.  Of the three, the al pastor was the one that really stood out.  The pork was succulent and just a little bit spicy while the pineapple brought a delicious sweetness to each bite.  The onions added crunch while the fresh cilantro brought everything together.
