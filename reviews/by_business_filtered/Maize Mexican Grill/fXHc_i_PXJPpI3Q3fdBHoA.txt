Yittty bitty!  I celebrated my 37th birthday, here, with my husband, and baby sister!  It was asses-to-elbows at the countertop, but the food was fantastic.  Service was a little slow, but the chips and salsa kept coming, and the company was great, so it didn't much matter.

The long and short of it is this, however-- five years later, and I still haven't been back.  The food was _fine_, but I didn't quite see the reason for all the hype.  I mean, Dos or Escobars... plenty of other fish in the sea.  Still, a fine spot for a quick bite.
