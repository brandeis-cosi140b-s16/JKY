Arguably some of the best, well made and most authentic Mexican food you will get in Champaign and maybe even the state.

I'd like to recommend something but with how awesome everything on the menu is, you can't go wrong.  The chalupas are delicious meat pockets, the tostadas expansive and the burritos are a deal at what they charge.  My favorite 1-2 punch is getting a burrito and quesadilla and eating the quesadilla late at night.

Dining in can be kind of a chore as the place seriously fits about twelve people (not comfortably) but their takeout is fast and if you are a lazy repeat customer (like me), phone ordering takes less than a minute.  Add in the politeness of the staff and now you know why I eat here at least once a week...
