I was really happy when mas amigos opened because im from california and i like tacos  this is The best Mexican food in town by a long shot.  If you're against dairy you're going to have some problems cause pretty much everything is covered in nice fresh cotija crumbly cheese and slightly sour and delicious crema which I love but could be bad for the lactose intolerant.
