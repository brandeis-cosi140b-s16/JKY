Maize has become something of an obsession for me and many of my friends. We love the tacos there and the consensus is that Maize will be the food of Champaign-Urbana that we miss the most when we move away. (This says a lot because it won out over campus bars with sentimental value, downtown bars with good food/alcohol, Papa Dell's and many other venues.) 

The place is small, so we tend to call in our order and show up to pick it up. When we've ordered on site, there was usually a line, but the wait was never too long and the food was always worth it. 

Our favorite item there is the fish tacos, but we also enjoy the chips and salsa. This is definitely the top Mexican place in my opinion and it is super affordable and tasty.
