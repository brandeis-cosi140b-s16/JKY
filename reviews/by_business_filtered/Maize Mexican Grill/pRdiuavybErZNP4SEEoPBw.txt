I'm on the fence about this place. The complimentary chips were really good but the "salsa" if you'd even call it that was about a spoonful and nothing exciting. The food was fresh, crispy, and not heavy or greasy at all. I had a fish taco and a veggie fried huaraches. Both were well prepared but in all honesty very bland. The veggie huaraches has cheese, avocado, beans, lettuce, sour cream and yet was still somehow not very flavorful. A squeeze of lime wedge did help some. Same with the fish taco, bland and heavily reliant on the lime wedge. The horchata was less flavorful than I've had before as well. My dining partner had a pastor burrito with just beans and cheese and he said the same: good, fresh, kinda bland. Overall nothing was "bad", but nothing was crave inducing. And considering the price leaned to the "tad over-priced for what you're getting" side I'm not sure it'll be on the list of go-to Champaign restaurants. But because everything was so fresh we'll definitely give it another chance before we totally rule it out.
