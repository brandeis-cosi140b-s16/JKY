My bf ordered the giant burrito which is already good enough for the both of us! Only if i had known, i wouldnt order what i ordered which is the carnitas burrito enchilada style! Both of us only ate half of our burritos and took the rest for to go lol! But its a very good portion for the price! Taste is ok. Nothing special. Service is friendly as to why im giving 3 stars.. My bf will be ordering his burrito from here from now on because of the portion! Lol!! He liked it!!
