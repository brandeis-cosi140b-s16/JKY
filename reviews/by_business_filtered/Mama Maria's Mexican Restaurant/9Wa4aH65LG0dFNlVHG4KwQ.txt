We enjoy eating at this Mexican Restaurant a couple of times a month.  You are served Hot Giant Tortilla Chips with Fresh Tasty Salsa before every meal.  I've tried several dishes but one of my favorites is the Chile Verde.  My husband usually gets whatever the special is for that day and it's always delicious.  The Restaurant is open to the Bakery so it's hard to pass up on a dessert.  The service is always personal and friendly.  This Restaurant is located on 6055 E Lake Mead Blvd and I would say give it a try.
