The food was AMAZING!!!  If you are looking for great food with the hole in the wall ambiance this is the place. Would have never gone in here if it weren't for yelp reviews. Looks run down from outside. From the tortillas and salsa being fresh to the awesome food. The waitress was very friendly and attentive. This one is definitely worth a shot.
