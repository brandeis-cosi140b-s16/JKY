This has been our favorite neighborhood place for almost 8 years. It is well priced, always good Mexican food.  The staff is friendly, it's not very big or fancy but we've never had a problem with seating and the service is fast so they turn over tables quickly.  Definitely recommend.  We go every few months and have always liked whatever we have... recommend going next door to La Flor De Michoacan for dessert after or stopping by the connected bakery for a sweet treat.  We often go there for donuts on the weekend.
