Hubby and I were out a week ago searching for a Traditional Mexican Restaurant in our area. We met a woman on Nellis that told us about Mama Maria's Mexican Restaurant. She told us the food was delicious and the chips were not the usual that you find other places. The chips and salsa was delicious.  The first time we went was on July 31, 2013. We decided to go back on our Anniversary August 7, 2013. We had the Giant Burrito and you can order one and they will give  you two plates, or each order one and take the other half home to have for diner the next night. We also took the chips and salsa for our diner the next evening. It was like eating there but at home. We will definitely be going back there again and highly recommend eating there for those looking for authentic Mexican food. They are located East of Nellis at 6055 E. Lake Mead Blvd in an strip mall on the south side of Lake Mead Blvd. Eat and enjoy the food, we're sure you'll come back.
