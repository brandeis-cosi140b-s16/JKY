I'm Mexican born and raised in Sonora, Mexico. So for me to say this place is awesome is because it is! I know about the best beef there is, Sonora has the best cattle and flour tortillas you can find in Mexico. Ok enough about how great Sonora's food is, what I'm trying to say is that because I appreciate real and authentic Mexican food that's why I'm giving this restaurant 5 stars. Awesome!
I had the Tampique√±a and it was amazing 
Also the Camarones a la Diabla were perfect! 
So get your hungry asses to Mama Maria's ASAP
Maribel was a good host and server
I'm coming back tomorrow again
