I tried Maria's with a group from work after hearing a recommendation from a friend.  I definitely enjoyed it.

We started with tortilla chips, salsa and guacamole, and I followed that with the Green Enchiladas.  Everything was served hot and fresh and I was very content after the meal.  My colleagues had the Cameron's a la Diabla and the Taco Plate.  Everything looked great and there weren't any complaints.  The restaurant has an at-home feel, amplified by having a connected and associated bakery right next door.

The restaurant is located in a store front, so parking might get tight now and then.  We went at lunchtime and the lot was fairly full.

I'm not on the northeast side of town much these days, but when I am I'll definitely grab lunch here again.
