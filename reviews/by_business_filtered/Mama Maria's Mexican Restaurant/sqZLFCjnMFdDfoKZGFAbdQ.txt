I went here on 4/11/2015 after reading a bunch of decent reviews on Yelp! There was only one server working this small joint, it wasn't very busy, but she couldn't seem to be bothered to tend to the few patrons. Not only was the service well below average but my girlfriend found a HUGE piece of plastic in here chimichanga verdes. When I finally got the attention of the waitress to tell her she acted like it was no big deal and wasn't even going to comp the food. I would not recommend this place to anyone!!
