I sometimes substitute teach in a school near Mama Maria's and I've heard my students rave about the food.  Today, I finally got bored enough to make the drive and try it for myself.

First of all, the place is in a somewhat dingy plaza.  Don't be fooled, though.  Inside, Mama Maria's is a cute, clean little mom 'n pop type of place.  The server greeted us right away and brought us tortillas and salsa.  I say tortillas because they really are tortillas, not chips.  The salsa is, quite frankly, the best I've ever had.  Having lived in west Texas for a couple of years, I have tried a LOOOOOOT of salsas.  I can say that this is the best I have personally experienced.

The beans and rice here are fab.  I got the tampiquena.  The steak was tender and well-seasoned.  I was impressed with the cheese enchilada - I normally find enchiladas (especially cheese ones) really boring, but this one wasn't.  It was flavorful and gooey.  

I am looking forward to coming back and trying a few new things on the menu.  This strikes me as the kind of place you can try new things and just trust that they will be good.
