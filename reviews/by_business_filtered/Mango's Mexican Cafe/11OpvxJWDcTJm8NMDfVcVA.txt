This place is Okay. Not delicious, and not disgusting. Its whatever. My quesadilla  was good for the first couple bites.. then it started tasting like Chinese food. Weird? Whatev, I killed it cuz I had a long drive home. My friend had a "Killer Burrito" and she enjoyed it! I guess it depends on what you get.

Oh also it seemed a little over priced (minus another star for that).. I got a quesadilla with guacamole and sour cream, and a Jarrito for 14 dollars! wtf.. are there taco trucks in Arizona?
