I was going to the bank and happened on this cool little spot on Main Street in downtown Mesa. I have lived in mesa since 93 and have to tell you there has been nothing down there worth mentioning since the Nile Theater. Mango's is a Mexican restaurant with a little flair. The chips and salsa are awesome. I had the hard shell tacos and the tamales and they were great. The wait staff was always there when you needed them.  They have outside seating which is nice during the cooler months. Try it out
