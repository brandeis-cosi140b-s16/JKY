Went here a few weeks ago while visiting the Mesa area for business.  I was really hopeful that it would be the best, but it was just OK.  I got a Chicken Chimichanga with rice/beans and like I said, it was just OK.  The limeade was great, but the food left me looking for more.  We did get to sit outside in the 65 degree weather which was a nice change for me from 25 degree Utah at the time.  That was the best part for me.
