This place is really not good.  I'm really not sure why it is so highly praised.  I had the tilapia tacos, a Senorial Sangria, and the flan.  The tacos, at a somewhat steep $10 or so, were the most bland fish tacos I've had in awhile.  Toppings?  Nothing.  Just some cilantro or something; not even any cabbage or sauce.  Tia Rosa's Tacqueria has far superior fish tacos for a smaller price.

The rice that came on the plate was bland, but that's OK, because it's rice, and you don't expect much from that.  The refried beans were lousy and had no flavor.

The flan was terribly disappointing.  It did not have that creamy flan texture, and was actually as firm as cheesecake.  The taste was very dull.  Maybe Mexican flan is supposed to be that way... if it is, pretty much every other country makes better flan.

I did enjoy the Senorial, but pretty much every Mexican joint these days serves that.

One thing they do deserve props for is the service.  Considering how crowded the place was, they did an excellent job making sure there was water on the table, not messing up orders, etc.
