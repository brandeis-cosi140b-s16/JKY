Delicious food and friendly staff. They serve complementary chips and salsa and they're salsa is about as good as it gets. Today I had a shrimp burrito which included avocado in what seemed to be a home made tortilla. The indoor seating is colorful and the outdoor seating is along a south facing walkway - perfect for that winter sun.
