This place is great. When we are cravin' Mexican, this is our first choice. My hubby loves the carne asada burrito and I am a fan of the basic tacos. Good basic Mexican food, you can go wrong here. 

And the chips and salsa... yes it's true, they are the best. I can make just a meal of them, and I sort of did when I had the nachos.
