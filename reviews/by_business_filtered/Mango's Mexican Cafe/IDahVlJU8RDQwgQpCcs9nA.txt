I have had lunch here twice. The staff was courteous and food arrived in good time. First time there I had the steak fajitas. The fajita platter portion was good but the steak was a little tough but tasty. The second time I was there, I was so hungry, I would have gladly eaten the anus out of a dead platypus. This time I ordered the beef chimichanga. The shredded beef was tender but somewhat bland. All in all a pretty decent place to eat but I thought the prices a bit on the high side.
