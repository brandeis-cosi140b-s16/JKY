There is not much in downtown mesa that is not closed, closing, or newly opened. Most shops in dowtown mesa last a few months at best then fold up. Mango's is an exception to the rule. They have been there a while, the food is excellent, the price is inexpensive, service fast and freindly, and the outside seating is nice. Check this place out, its pretty much your only choice in downtown mesa, but it's still pretty good!
