It was just a-ok. It didn't make me want to come back and eat there again. I had a chicken chimichanga and felt that Rosa's was better. When I am in the studio at the Mesa Arts Center, I'd run to here if Sweet Cakes was closed.

Mango's isn't my first choice. It usually ranks towards the bottom...mostly because I find the food a bit on the blah side.

Sorry, Mango's lovers...this one's a bit of a bust for me. Three stars because it could be much much worse.
