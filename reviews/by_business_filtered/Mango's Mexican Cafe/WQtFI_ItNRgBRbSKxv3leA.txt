Now THIS is real Mexican food! 

The food is simple, DELICIOUS & very reasonably priced. 

You have to place your order at the counter & then they normally bring it to your table for you. I always get an Horchata to sip on while I wait :) 

One of my favorite entrees there is the Carne Asada Torta,,,,,, yum! But I have yet to try anything there that I wasn't happy with.
And don't skip desert, forget the never ending diet & indulge in some fresh home made flan :) You won't be sorry! 

The staff are friendly & make you feel at home :) 
The location is small (tables inside & a few outside), bright, lively & inviting. They are located near a gallery that you can saunter through until you're able to button your pants back again, lol 

It gets full at midday, so it's best if you go before or after the lunch rush. Parking is a bit difficult to find, but it's worth it.
