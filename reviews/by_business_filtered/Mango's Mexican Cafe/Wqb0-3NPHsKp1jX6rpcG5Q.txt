It's been years since I've tried this place, only been a couple of times.  But what I have tasted in the past has been great!  Their refried beans are pretty good, they taste homemade and the flavor is pretty good.  Salsa is GREAT!  Chips seem light and fluffy.  

And they used to have a .99 cent Taco day for a few hours on a Monday or Tuesday that was an amazing deal.  Don't know if they still have that but their Taco's are pretty good in taste.  Only downfall I find is that they are pretty skimpy in filling them with ingredients and low on the meat.

Would like to try their Chile Relleno.  Don't know if it's good or not.
