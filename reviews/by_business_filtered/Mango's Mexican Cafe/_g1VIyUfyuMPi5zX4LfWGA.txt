Oh Mango's --- how I love you and staff, especially David. Even when missed a few years in a row of visiting, David remembered us, our son, and always asks about the missing one in our family if we come with out someone. Staff is awesome- always ready to help. Yes you order then they bring you drinks, chips and salsa, but they are so on top of things, sometimes they are waiting on you to pick a table and follow you to your table. Outside seating is nice, although not during "rush hour' - ok it doesn't get that busy on Main, but I don't like smelling traffic when it's heavier than normal. But a few spring evenings we have not wanted to leave the nice breeze and occasion music that someone has stopped to make a few tips. FOOD -- I'm one that if I find something I like at a restaurant that I get the same thing everytime. BUT not at Mango's - every dish I've tried I have loved. I get all kinds of things. Their chicken tacos have a bit to them, but I'm  a slight wimp. The shrimp burrito is amazing - again warmer than normal. SHredded beef is awesome. They use white cheese in their quesidillas. Their chips are AMAZING and i love their salsa. They have the frescas, but when we go at night they don't have them. Sat mornings is the best chance at the watermelon- which is TO die for! LOVE everything I have had! See you soon David!
