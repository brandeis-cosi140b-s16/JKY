Mango's is a fixture in downtown Mesa. Everyone in the area knows and loves this place. It has a casual cafe feel, and the food is tremendous.

I am not a vegetarian, but the veterinarian burrito (enchilada style) almost converted me. The chips and salsa are wonderful. The service is excellent. They also carry specialty Mexican juices and sodas.

I would strongly suggest you try this place for Lunch the next time you're in the downtown Mesa area.
