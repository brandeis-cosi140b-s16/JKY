I used to have this sort "ugh, mexican food for snowbird tourists" attitude towards Mango's. I live and work right in downtown Mesa, and have eaten there maybe twice over the last 9 years... it wasn't until recently that suddenly the joy and amazingness of Mango's really showed itself to me. The environment is almost tropical, and very pleasant.. lots of color, and vibe. Great music. The food is pretty great. Their pollo asado is just killer, and they certainly serve one of the most hearty, tasty quesadillas I've ever experienced. Their chimichangas, and just about everything else are also fantastic. I'm looking at lovely Mango's outside of my office window as I type this, and I'm tempted to run over and stuff my face with like.. 20 dollars worth of food, but I don't want to rupture my gut on Christmas Eve. It's a true institution in Mesa, an area that truly deserves more love than the rest of the valley gives it. Come on down, and check it out!
