Good salsa and super crispy thick chips, with that alone Mangos (along with the other De La Cruz restaurants) is worth it for breakfast, lunch or dinner. 

Their Comida Norteno is typical with cheese, refried beans and tacos. The portions are a good size, the food is flavorful, but not too greasy, cheesy or saucy. I think it's all quite delicious. 

Expect them to be busy at lunch. So if you can swing an 11:30 or 12:45 lunch slot you'll have less crowds to deal with.
