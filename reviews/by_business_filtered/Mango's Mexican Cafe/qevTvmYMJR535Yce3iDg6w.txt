Love this place.

Seriously, the best carne asada burrito I've ever had....

Their chips and salsa are good too, but you WILL have dragon breath for the rest of the day - just a warning.

I need to try something else on the menu, but I can't help but be lured by the siren song of carne asada!

When I brought a friend he got the carne asada tacos and a watermelon agua fresca.  He says that he's dreamt about that drink ever since.
