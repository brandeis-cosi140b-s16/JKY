Mangooooooooo! - a line I remember from SNL. 

I have been trying to go to Mango's for about 10 years. What took me so long, well I don't get to Mesa much. I was happy I finally did. The interior is a old school mexican food shop. It is counter service but they bring you chips and salsa, food and refill your drinks. 

We ordered the fish taco's (wow what a kick, these bad boys were spicy) and the carne asada burrito. The fish was really good and nice presentation with chunks of avocado and mandarin orange salsa on top. The burrito was plain looking but the flavors locked inside were awesome.  The chips were thick and crunchy and the salsa was rated at 3 bowls before the food arrived.

I will definitely return to this "gem" in downtown Mesa.
