I enjoyed in immensely with only a few slight draw backs. The location is wonderful. I am not a desert fan, but there is something nice about eating outside on a warm day when it's January 4th. I had the chimichanga which was delicious. I chose the chicken which had a wonderful fresh flavor and a nice spice. My girlfriend had a burrito, which neither of us enjoyed as much because the flour tortilla tasted a little flat and she didn't enjoy the spice of the chicken. The chips where great, with a flour/corn mix flavor. I thought the salsa was good but bland. It tasted fresh, but lacked bite. I spiced it up and it was much better. The rice was some of the best I have had, and the beans were very good. I have had refried beans on a couple of different occasions in Phoenix and often there is a real smokey flavor. I love it, but it takes some getting used to. All and all I would recommend this place for a reasonable and good meal.
