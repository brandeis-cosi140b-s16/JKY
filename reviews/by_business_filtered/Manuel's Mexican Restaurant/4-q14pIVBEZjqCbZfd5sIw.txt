Great customer service and EXCELLENT real authentic Mexican food! I had the cheese enchilada with rice and beans and my husband loved his pollo especial dish, both were very delicious. Our waitress was sweet and very attentive to our table. The owner even came over and introduced himself to us, realizing this was our first time at his restaurant. He gave us a $10 coupon to come back and use on our next visit. This is something I really value and appreciate because you just don't find good quality customer service these days. My husband and I are new to the area and we will definitely be coming back to this place. Prices we're more than reasonable and they even sent us home with extra chips and salsa at NO charge!
