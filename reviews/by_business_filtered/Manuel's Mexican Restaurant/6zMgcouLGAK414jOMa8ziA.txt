This place is great. We've only gone twice and done two orders for take out. Service is always friendly and quick. HH is the time to go. Margaritas are my go to. Steak tacos were tasty, fishy tacos yummy and my hubby always goes for the polo special, which is basically pollo magnifico if you remember Julios in Scottsdale. Like the chesse crisps as well. Nice large outside patio off the bar area. Plenty of seating with every sports game imaginable in the inside bar portion. If you live in the area highly recommend.
