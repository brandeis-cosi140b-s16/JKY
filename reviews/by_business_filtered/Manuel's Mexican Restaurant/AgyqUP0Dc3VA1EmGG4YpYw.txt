A family-owned restaurant that has managed  to expand throughout the Valley over the last 46 years is impressive, but what's more impressive is the fact that what they serve and how the serve it is what has made Manuel's last this long.  

My family has been eating at Manuel's for many years, and we've never had a bad experience.  The staff is always very friendly -- like family, almost -- and the food is dependably good. You can't go wrong with their menu, and the prices are just right.  They've also got a great lunch menu, with even better prices, and some great drink deals.  

So, if you're looking for a family-friendly, good meal at a good price, definitely give Manuel's a try.
