I must admit I LOVE Manuel's! The food is always excellent and the service is just as good. I really like the Happy Hour here, I promise, you can't go wrong with the House Margarita or the Sangria and those cheap Taquitos! Yummerz!!! The beef enchiladas are moist and delicious. Last time I was here my sister even ordered the Sopaipillas and I almost went to fat heaven! For those of you who don't know; Sopaipillas are these little soft pillow donuts sprinkled with powdered sugar and can be dipped in or drizzled with a honey syrup. To die for and if you eat enough you most certainly will die of diabetes or some other fat related disease. Don't fill up on the warm chips and salsas because you'll still want to stuff yourself even when the food comes out. I'm here at least once a month to meet up with my cousin and I look forward to a good experience every time!
