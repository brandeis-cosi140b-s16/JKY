This was our first time here.  We have come by several times but it's always been packed, and we went elsewhere.  This time we picked a Sunday at 5:00PM, and just beat the rush.

We were greeted quickly and seated, and our server was excellent!  The chips and salsa were very good, the mild had some bite to it.  I had the Pollo Especial, which was one of the best chicken dishes I have ever eaten.  My wife had a chimi, which was also excellent.

I rated them 4 stars because it was our first visit...we will be back and am anticipating another excellent meal and an upgrade to 5.

After eating here many, many more times, I have yet to be disappointed and am working my way through the menu.  Everything is outstanding, and I have upped Manuel's to 5 stars!
