A-OK, but on the expensive side.  I did get the 8.99 nachos with shredded beef and they were awesome!  Huge.  Should not have polished off the entire plate, but couldn't help mystelf!  Better as an appetizer for 2 or more.
Was talking to a fellow customer next to me and he agreed that they are expensive and other Mexican restaurants are just as good and cheaper.
