I came here on my lunch hour weary of whether I would be able to get in and out in time to get back to work. I let the server know of my intentions and he promised he could make it happen. Tortilla chips were hot and fresh. I kept it simple with a bean and cheese burrito but it definitely hit the spot. The staff was friendly and quick. As I was leaving, I noticed the patio area was neatly decorated and looked like a nice place to come one weekend night to enjoy a margarita. I would definitely recommend for a casual dinner location!
