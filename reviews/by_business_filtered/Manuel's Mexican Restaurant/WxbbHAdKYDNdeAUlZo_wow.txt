4 adults going out on a Saturday evening with the intent of having margaritas & dinner (around 6pm). We sat at a table in the bar area & were rudely scolded by the manager telling us we cannot sit there because those seats were on the waiting list. We put our name on the waiting list & after 20 mins we were seated in the bar area at the same table we previously had been told to leave. We ordered tea & water at this point & waited about 15 mins more before our food order was taken. After 45 minutes our waitress came back to re-take our order because it was never put in. Another 20 minutes went by and our order came out. Half of it was wrong. We sent back what was wrong to get it corrected, the dishes this time came back quickly. We ate our meal and when the check finally came we had been over-charged for the incorrect meals that were ordered. By the time we finally got the bill corrected & paid it was past 9pm and we were more than ready to just call it a night. We will not be going back.
