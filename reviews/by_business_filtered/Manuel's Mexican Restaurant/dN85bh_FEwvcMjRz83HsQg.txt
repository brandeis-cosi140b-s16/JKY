I was won over by a few previous reviews that praised salsa and flavor.  I'm wondering if they ate at one place and reviewed for another.  

Ever the optimist, I'll start off with the good.  Chips and salsa arrived quickly, and the chips were hot, light and crispy.  Drink orders were taken quickly after we sat down.  Service was friendly.  The menu wasn't overwhelming and had good descriptions and pictures of the offerings.  Overall, the server was attentive and friendly throughout the evening.

Now for the not-so-good... Please don't get me started on the salsa.  It's just... no.  Let's talk about things canned tomatoes are OK to be in:  Spaghetti sauce.  Cans.  Velveeta queso.  Things that canned tomatoes should not be in:  Oreos.  Iced tea.  Salsa.  

The green corn tamale made me sad inside.  The masa was gritty and dry.  Maybe that's why it was smothered in some bizarre grey/green gravy.  The masa-to-filling ratio was also not great with very thick masa and the tiniest of smears of filling.  The flavor of the outside of the tamale - at least the one small part that wasn't smothered in weird grey/green gravy - was actually not bad (delicately sweet), but it definitely was not worth the near $6 ala carte price.

I had really high hopes for this place, but it just fell flat.
