Very good Mexican food. The chips were way better years ago when they were flour.  But they are still not bad today. We went through 4-5 bowls of chips for 4 people. Prices are a little high for Mexican food, thus -1 star.  Service is better than average here. I got a make my own combo so I could get a taco and an enchilada.

Albondigas soup is superb!
