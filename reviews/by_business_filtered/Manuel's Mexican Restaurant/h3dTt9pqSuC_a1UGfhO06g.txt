Manuel's is by far my favorite Mexican restaurant in Phoenix!  I am part Hispanic so I know good Mexican food.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE the hard-shell shredded beef tacos and refried beans!  YUM.  We always request Wallace to serve us because he is so nice, thorough and never messes up.  He also checks on us to see how we are doing throughout our meal.  The chips here are so thin, hit and good!  The salsa is great.  I wish they'd add tres leches cake to their dessert menu though!
