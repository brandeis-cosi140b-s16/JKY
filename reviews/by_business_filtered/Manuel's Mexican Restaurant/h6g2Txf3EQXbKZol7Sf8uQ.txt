My absolute FAVORITE place for Mexican food!!!  We eat here so much I feel like family =)  My daughter always orders the Beef Taquitos and usually can't finish them.  My favorite is the #6-Chilequiles, a Mexican cassarole made with layers of tortilla chips, pulled chicken, green chiles, onions, green sauce and sour cream......making you drool yet???  It SO DANG GOOD!!!  Its inexpensive and filling...my daughter and I share and barely can finish.  Chips and salsa are fresh and yummy.
