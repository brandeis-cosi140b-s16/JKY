This place really isn't worth one star but since that's the lowest option I have...

I have been here twice and really didn't enjoy the first trip.  I enjoyed tonight's visit even less.  We only came here to eat because our favorite restaurant was so packed we couldn't even find a parking spot.  I ordered a cheese crisp with chicken on it.  It took over a half hour to get our food.  We sat there and waited and waited.  Our waitress at one point said our food should be up soon and then we didn't see her for another 15 minutes.  When my food arrived it was cold.  Not wanting to wait another half hour for a replacement meal I scraped all the cold chicken (half of which looked disgusting, btw) off the cheese crisp and just ate the cold cheese/tortilla.  My mom's cheese enchilada wasn't cooked either.  The cheese wasn't even remotely melted.

Our waitress took another 15 minutes to bring our bill and asked if we needed boxes.  We said no.  Another 5 minutes went by and she came back to get the card.  By this time I was irritated.  She obviously had too many tables and couldn't keep up with her workload.  When she finally came back with our card she asked again if we wanted boxes.  I finally told her that she should tell the people in the kitchen our food had come out cold.  She apologized but after the excessive delays and the cold food, it's just not enough to make me want to eat here again.  The only good thing I can say is the chips were good.
