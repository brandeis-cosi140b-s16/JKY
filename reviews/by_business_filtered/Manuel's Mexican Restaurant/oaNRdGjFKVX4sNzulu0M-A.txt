I have eaten here several times when I am down in Phoenix. I usually order a child relleno, cheese enchilada and rice. Also their chicken and beef dishes are great and not too dry. Great chips and salsa. The overall quality of the food is excellent. Very good customer service. One of the best Mexican food restaurants in the area. Give them a try.
