I chose this restaurant based on fellow yelp reviewers. My friend missed Mexican food he used to eat in San Diego, so I looked around and trying to find the closest I can find to what he is used to in San Diego.

I liked the decoration inside the restaurant and patio looked very inviting.  Waiter was friendly and took our order right away.  

Salsa was very tasty.  We ended up eating two bowls of them with chips.  We ordered shrimp picante, seafood enchilada, fish tacos. All were good, cannot decided which was my favorite.  For desert, we had fried ice cream (free for a birthday boy), flan, and apple pie on hot skillet.  Everything was so tasty, price was reasonable, great atmosphere, good service.  I will definitely come back again when I want to eat good Mexican food.
