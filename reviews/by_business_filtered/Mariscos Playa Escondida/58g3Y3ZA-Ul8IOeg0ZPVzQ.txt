Ok I took off a start ONLY because of the location (people wandering in looking for water, etc...) But the food here was AMAZING... every single item we had was unique and absolutely amazing. Even seafood we typically don't like was prepared so well that we were reconsidering our positions on them. We have the pineapple full of spicy seafood--weird sounding, I know, but it was absolutely delightful. I can't wait to go back and try more stuff!
