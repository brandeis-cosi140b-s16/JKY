HOLY MOLY. Talk about diamond in the rough. Do you know how difficult it is to find a good Mexican food joint? Found this little spot in a tiny corner behind Tacos Mexico. It's hella small inside, with maybe 5 to 6 tables, prob won't fit more than 25 people. We were met with friendly smiling servers who were attentive and accommodating through out our meal. For starters, I must say the have probably THE BEST CHIPS AND SALSA I've ever had, true authentic flavors with a Spicy slap in the face- so beware if you can't handle the heat too well. We thought it best to get a bunch of side items instead of the combo plates which was a great idea. 

Must have: Shrimp Empanadas. 

The seafood molcajete was unbelievable! Comes served in a hot stone bowl, shrimp, clam, nopales(cactus), green peppers, onions, cheese. This is enough for two people to share. I recommend ordering a side of rice to pour the food on, rather than eating w tortillas.. Be sure to order an extra set of plates. 

Also tried a ceviche tostada, which is also enough to be shared by two people. The rice and beans are delicious too! Tasty alcoholic drinks are available, such as Micheladas. 

The menu is varied so Definitely coming back again!
