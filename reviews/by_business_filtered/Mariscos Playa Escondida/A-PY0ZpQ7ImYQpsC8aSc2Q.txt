Place is bomb if u like small joints that gets down to business, which is good food! This is not a fancy, classy seafood place, its a mexican seafood place that sells awsome food for people that aren't all fancy and shit. We got aguachiles, campechanas, tacos de marlen and some micheladas. Everything was great and fresh!
