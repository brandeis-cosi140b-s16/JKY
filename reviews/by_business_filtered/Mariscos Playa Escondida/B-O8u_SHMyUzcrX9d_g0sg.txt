Second time coming to this restaurant and it is just as good as the reviews. Placed two To Go orders and can't get enough of the homemade guacamole. This visit I ordered the camarones aguachile spice level 1. OMG WOW WOW WOW!!! I've never tried anything other than a "typical" ceviche so I'm not the best person to judge but it was amazing and will remember that I'll need to have at least one more person with me to finish it.

So excited that it's a one minute walk from my friends place. Can't wait to try some of the other amazing plates!!!
