Their mole is the best I have had in town.  I think there is a name for this style of Mexican food where they use creative sauces and authentic recipes: Sonoran?  Baha?  But since I can't think of the proper name I will just say it is really good.  If you are nervous about seafood the chicken dishes are also great.  I voted them the Best of Vegas, especially since they didn't try to hamstring my vote like some restaurants are doing by buying votes with free alcohol.  I will be back to try the full menu.
