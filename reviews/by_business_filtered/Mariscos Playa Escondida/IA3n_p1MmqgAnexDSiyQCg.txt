My husband and I loved this restaurant! The service was excellent and the food was fresh and delicious. Our waiter spoke perfect English and was excited to inform us that their English menu will be coming out very soon.

We got the shrimp empanadas as an appetizer and they were my favorite thing we tasted. For our meals, we ordered Kahlua shrimp and Pina Rellena. The Pina Rellena is a seafood combination with a sweet and sour sauce served inside a cored out pineapple. It was beautiful and tasty!! And the other meal was pretty fantastic as well. We also saved a lot of money getting off the strip for the evening!

Well done, Playa Escondida! We will definitely be back.
