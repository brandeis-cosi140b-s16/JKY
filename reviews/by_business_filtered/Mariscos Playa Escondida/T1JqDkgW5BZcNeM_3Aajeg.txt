Oh damn this place is so good i found it on yelp thanks yelps this place at first it look kind of weird because of the area and kind of small but it will not disappoint the mariscos are so good. Me and my wife are from Los Angeles and want it something different from your regular all you can eat buffets at the strip and found this great place and I also got a free orchata that was also good. Shout out to the owners.
