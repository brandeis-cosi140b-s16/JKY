Mariscos Playa Escondida had nearly perfect reviews on yelp when I first found out about it, which made it a perfect candidate for a date night. We got here around 8:30 on a Friday night. The restaurant is in a ghetto area and you can easily miss it if you aren't paying attention to your GPS. When we walked in, it was full of customers, and the interior looked like something you'll find in truck stop restaurants of third world country, same with the smell. I ordered the horchata drink that was free with the yelp check in (extra small glass half full of ice, but hey its free). 

We ended up getting molecajete, which contained skirt steak, shrimp, cheese, grilled cactus and grilled green onions in a stone bowl. It was an unique appetizer, the steak and shrimp were pretty good. The steak was tender, but little greasy. However the cactus was pretty sour and didn't jive with the whole dish. May be it's best as a decoration. 

Our main meal orders contained shrimp in spicy sauce and fillted fish in spicy sauce with rice and beans. The sauce was perfect, however the seafood was even better. The fish and the shrimp were very fresh and tender the sauce complimented both of the dished perfectly. 

This restaurant could have been a perfect 4 star restaurant in my book, but it needs to look cleaner and the service has to be better. They are charging more money than Lindo Michoacan , so I would except the quality in terms of hospitality to be there. But don't get me wrong the food was very good.
