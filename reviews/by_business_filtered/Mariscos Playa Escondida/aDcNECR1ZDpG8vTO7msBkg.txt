This place is a textbook example of the power of yelp. Yelpers helping Yelpers find those hidden gems. 

This restaurant is in a rougher part of town and is squished into a tiny space in a pretty run down and dark corner of a shopping Park. 

The person that was working there was great. There were 5 of us, we ordered several of the meat and seafood family platters. We ate like kings. It was amazing. 

The yelp rating for this place is well deserved.
