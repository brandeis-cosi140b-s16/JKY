Don't let the run-down strip-mall exterior fool you, there's some surprisingly sophisticated Mexican food here! When I saw all of these five-star reviews for a new place I'd never heard of, I made a beeline to check them out that very day. 

SHRIMP EMPANADAS: Got an order of 3, just as good as everyone else says. Empanadas are perfectly cooked without being oily, and the filling is just the right amount with a slight kick of spice and they don't skimp on the shrimp.

MARLIN TACO: Be still my heart! I fell in love with marlin tacos on a recent trip to San Diego and can't get enough of them since. A small taco, for $3.50, with cheese, several avocado slices, and perfectly roasted marlin. So good I almost ordered a few more to-go.

AGUACATE RELLENO: Special of the day, a ceviche-stuffed avocado. Each 'cado half was overflowing, and there was a pile more on the plate. I don't think I've ever had more ceviche for $12, and the avocado was huge. Plating was beautiful, with a rim of cucumber slices serving a functional and decorative purpose.

Personable service, plentiful portions, and good prices for high-quality Mexican seafood. This isn't your average taco shack, this place is SO much more!
