This is the best kept hidden secret for Mexican seafood dishes.  EVERYTHING is freshly prepared and the seafood is fresh and excellent.  The owner Roberto is extremely nice, very thorough when explaining the menu and is very accomodating.  
Make sure to try the aguachiles and shrimp empanadas...but everything is fantastic!
