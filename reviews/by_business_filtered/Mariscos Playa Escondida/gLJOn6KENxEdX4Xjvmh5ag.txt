Okay, we went here a few weeks ago and some of the dishes we ordered were divine, others not so much. With all the 5 stars reviews I expected more. I would actually give them 3 1/2 stars....

The ceviche tostada was heavenly and generously portioned with ceviche cascading onto the plate. I could have eaten 5 of them, lol. They had a ceviche appetizer plate but it was almost $20 and I'm kind of a cheapskate. I ordered the seafood molcajate and I guess I didn't realize that it was nothing like the pollo/carne/shrimp version because mine was served like a seafood stew. It was decent but certainly not what I thought I was ordering. My hubs got a shrimp dish that was good but a little small in my opinion. 

Now the shrimp cocktail that everyone has raved about was a huge disappointed. There were plenty of shrimp but the "cocktail" was nothing more than tomato juice with no seasoning and no flavor. I emptied almost half the bottle of Tapatio into it just to give it some flavor. Oh well.... 

The salsa was amazing and the perfect amount of spice for me. I think most people would think it was too spicy.
