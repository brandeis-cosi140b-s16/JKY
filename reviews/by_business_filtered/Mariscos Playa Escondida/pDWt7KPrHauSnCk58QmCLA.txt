This is my new favorite Mexican restaurant. A sweet family runs it, with the son in the front of the house and mom in the kitchen. 

To start, the chips and salsa are top notch. Something so simple can vary greatly, but the complexity of flavor in the salsa and the fresh crispy chips make these stand out as one of the better versions I've had. 

The shrimp here are especially fresh, and the restaurant takes a lot of care in cleaning and preparing them. They may be small but they are plump and tasty. I recommend trying them in the Aguacaliente ceviche style (either chopped on a tostada or whole in the full appetizer version) or the Chipotle entree style. 

Fajitas are hit or miss (once the veggies were overcooked with far too much oil), but they do come with a nice added touch of a little quesadilla on top. House specialties are done well, but I find myself coming back for the shrimp. All entrees are served with deliciously authentic beans. 

For the value, you'd be hard-pressed to find a better Mexican seafood restaurant in town. I highly recommend Mariscos Playa Escondida!
