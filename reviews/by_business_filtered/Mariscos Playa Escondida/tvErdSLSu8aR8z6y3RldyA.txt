I can see why this place gets good reviews.  I went on a Saturday night and it was busy.  It is a tiny restaurant - tiny.  I have no problem with that, but on Saturday night they had a band in there and it was so loud we actually had to stop talking to each other.  It was on the level of a club!  I have no idea why a restaurant would take out a table on your busiest night and put a band in there.  I love live music, but this place is way to small for a band - way too small.  It actually made the dining experience unpleasant.

I had the combo ceviche - and that was awesome.  The ceviche was fresh and we devoured it!  Also had steak fajitas.  They were okay, the steak didn't seem to have much flavor, but it was still good.

Overall, the food was worthy of 4 stars but the music was just too much.  I mean people would like to talk to each other when they eat.  I would go back for lunch or something like that.
