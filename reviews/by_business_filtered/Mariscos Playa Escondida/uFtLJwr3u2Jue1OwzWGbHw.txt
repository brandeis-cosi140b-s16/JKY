Loved their Aguachiles--so good!! Pretty spicy but with such a signature taste. We also got some prepared oysters but we weren't fans of them. We felt the topping really switched up the oyster flavor in a bad way. My brother had a shrimp cocktail which was really good too. Surround area is not so nice though, like the rest of Vegas.
