What a find!! About 4 miles of the Strip in a little strip mall. Clean restaurant with super friendly service. We tracked this place down after reading the reviews on Yelp and finding that they have aguacates rellenos. The only place we can usually find those is in Chula Vista. The salsa is awesome!!! We definitely will be back.
