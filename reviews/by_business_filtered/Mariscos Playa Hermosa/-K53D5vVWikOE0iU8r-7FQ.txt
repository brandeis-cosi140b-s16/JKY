I took the kids (20, 22 and 23) to Mariscos Playa Hermosa as a means of celebrating one of their birthdays.  OK, it's in a sketchy neighborhood, which for me translates into "It's not some corporate craphole, reaking of generica". 
Fortunately I saved the receipt just for this review.

The first order was for the drunken shrimp, Camarones Ahogados, which is basically raw shrimp soaked in lime juice.  The idea was off-putting, but the execution is Awesome!  Delicious.  We next ordered the Camarones Culichi (shrimp in some sort of spicy cream sauce, I think), Filete de Pescado al Mojo (which looked good, but junior couldn't finish it.  There was too much for his stomach, already pre-filled with chips and some sort of green sauce, also awesome).  The last 2 orders were a Chile Relleno and Tacos de Pescado.  Anycase, the food was great and I'll be back.
