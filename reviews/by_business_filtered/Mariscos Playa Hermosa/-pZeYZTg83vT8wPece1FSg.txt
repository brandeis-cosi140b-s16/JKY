Magnifico!  Great little place tucked away in a semi-residential area of town.  Felt like I was part of the family after being seated.  Bright cheerful atmosphere like a fiesta!  Food was very flavoful even the white rice.  Crab enchiladas full of white crab meat and smothered in your choice of red or green sauce.  Salsa you get red (Spicy) and green (mild) with chips and I got a complimentary Cerviche.  The red salsa had a nice smoky flavor and just the right kick of heat.  Can't wait to try other dishes when I return to Phoenix in a couple of weeks!
