The moment I entered this place it's like I'm in a giant playroom. The place is very bright and colorful. I wouldn't be surprised if Dora or the whole Sesame Street Gang suddenly showed up.

We ordered the Molcajete and fish ceviche. The Molcajete ($22) is the bomb! It's this delicious dish that has beef, chicken, shrimp, and fish lined up around on what seems like the Wicked Witch's cauldron filled with tomatillo sauce. It's enough for two people. You'd know its one of their popular dishes because all the other tables have it. One group of people even ordered three! It's like we were part of a Mexican witch convention. It was pretty amusing.

My husband got the $4 draft beer which he later regretted because there's this promo girl who gave out some freebies including a bottle of Budweiser beer for each of us. I'm not sure if they do that all the time. I guess we're just lucky. We went on a Friday night so we got a live background music from their Mariachi band.

Overall, we loved it! Can't go wrong with Mexican seafood. We'll definitely be back.

Trivia: Apparently, the Molcajete is the traditional Mexican version of mortar and pestle. Thanks Wikipedia!
