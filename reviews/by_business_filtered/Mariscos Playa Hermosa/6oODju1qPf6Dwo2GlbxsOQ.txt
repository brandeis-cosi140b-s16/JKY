Im only giving 1 star because I can't give 0 stars. We come here often and have never been treated the way we were treated tonight. We got there at 8:30pm, waited for 20 minutes, we were never acknowledged, then at 8:50pm the gentleman with the glasses walks over to give another waiting customer their to go order and on his way back to the kitchen stops and tells us that he doesn't think there's room for us and they close at 9...basically telling us to leave. We are extremely disappointed because we really enjoyed this place. Please coach your staff on the proper way to treat paying customers.
