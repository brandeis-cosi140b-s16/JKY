Hands down the best mariscos(seafood) EVER! I love the shrimp ceviche and when I am in the mood for a hot plate the Shrimp Culichi is the best choice, shrimp soaked in some delicious green salsa and smothered with oaxaca cheese, YUMMY! The Micheladas and the margaritas are excellent and well priced.  They have Mariachis every friday night from 7p to 9p, if you want the trip to Mexico feel, this is your place!!
