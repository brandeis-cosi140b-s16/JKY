Love this place!  Took my in-laws yesterday because they were willing to be adventurous, they were very impressed.  The place is always packed, it's noisy but so welcoming.  As soon as you sit down, a waiter comes to take your drinks order and then come the green and red salsa with chips.  The green salsa is delicious.  A few minutes later, your server brings you a ceviche tostada which is complimentary, what a great way to make a customer feel welcomed and wanting to come back for more.  We have tried several dishes and none have disappointed so far.  My husband usually has the "mojarra frita" it is absolutely delicious.  Their "seven seas" soups is excellent.  Wonderful staff, very friendly and they continuously check on us without being annoying.  Even though some feel it's not located in a nice area, we have always felt safe.  It seems that they will be expanding their restaurant, I'm sure that is due to the fact that their service and food is amazing.  Good luck, Mariscos Playa Hermosa!
