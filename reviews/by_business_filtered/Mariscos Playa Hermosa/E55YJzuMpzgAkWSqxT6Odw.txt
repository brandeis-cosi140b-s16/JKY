So my husband and I were looking for someplace to celebrate our anniversary. We both love seafood and found this place. It reminded us of the first time we went to Mexico together so many years ago. The chips and salsa, especially the green salsa (in my opinion) were very good. We shared the molcajete and it was so very delicious. The green salsa in the middle is extremely tasty. I have no idea what is in it, but I would eat it again. The hubby had the $5 mug of Tecate and I had a Corona margarita. We definitely plan to come back!! The service was attentive and helpful, since it was our first visit I asked a lot of questions and our waitress was patient! Can't wait to go back!
