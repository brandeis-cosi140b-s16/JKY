Located in not the nicest neighborhood of Phoenix, Mariscos Playa Hermosa seems a bit shady on the outside. Once you get pasted the secretive tinted windows, however, it's an entirely different world. Vibrant colors hit your eyes and vivacious music pleases your eardrums. It really makes you feel like you're near a playa hermosa. 

To start off, we were given a complimentary hard tortilla with ceviche on it. You can taste how fresh and delectable the combination of ingredients is. I've had plenty of ceviche in Latin American countries and theirs is on par. 

The selection here is ridiculous, but in a good way. I ended up going simple and ordering some shrimp tacos. You get 3 tacos with rice, beans, and salad. The tacos don't include any filler ingredients like Americans prefer. Just straight up shrimp smothered in oozing melted cheese. Can't get much more legit than that. The rice, beans, and salad were all pretty typical and were a good compliment to the meal. 

Thank you Marisocs Playa Hermosa for fulfilling my friend's craving for amazing legit Mexican food after being stuck in the Romney infested part of Colorado for a year. The service is warm and friendly, decor is unexpected but awesome, and the food is as close as you can get without crossing the border.
