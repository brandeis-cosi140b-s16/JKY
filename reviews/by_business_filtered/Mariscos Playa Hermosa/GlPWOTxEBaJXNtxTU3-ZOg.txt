I am really crazy about this place, we are from Pasadena CA but find ourselves in Phoenix about twice a year. Each visit we must go to MPH to enjoy what is the best Mexican seafood in the southwest. 

Where to start? Nearly the whole menu is good. Start with shrimp or mixed seafood cocktail and then move onto the seafood platters. Fried Fish, shrimp, abalone, it's very tasty and well done. 

If you're not in a seafood mood they're pretty good about that too. We recently tried the "volcano" (sorry the Spanish names fail me) with various meet and seafood cooked in a lava pit of red or green sauce and cheese, and that was delicious. 

Wash it all down with Margaritas combined with Beer: literally they serve a Margarita + Beer combo that I order every time and it's the greatest way to accompany the meal.

Service is excellent: the waitresses are skilled, knowledgeable about the menu, and happy to serve you promptly.  The decor, made up of hand-carved and hand-painted Mexican-style wooden furniture, is exquisite and really brightens up the dining area.

Overall it's a wonderful dining experience and well recommended.
