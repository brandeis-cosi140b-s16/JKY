Went here instead of our usual San Carlos Mariscos on 18th st and McDowell because of the reviews. This place is more dressed up (despite outward appearances) but it's also more expensive for the same quality food.  We got the shrimp culichi and the shrimp veracruzano and both were solid but at almost $15/meal we definitely expected more than 6 shrimp. We wouldn't deter people from going here but I would suggest San Carlos instead if asked.
