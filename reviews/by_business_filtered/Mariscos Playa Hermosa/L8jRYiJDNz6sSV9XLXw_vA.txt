My wife and I stopped here on our way through Phoenix on a road trip.  The food was really good and the margarita was tasty.  We really enjoyed the shrimp ceviche as well.  On our way back to the airport we stopped again for some food for the plane. The best part, the food was good and inexpensive! This will definitely be our go to spot anytime when we fly into Phoenix! Oh yes, the staff was very friendly also :-)!
