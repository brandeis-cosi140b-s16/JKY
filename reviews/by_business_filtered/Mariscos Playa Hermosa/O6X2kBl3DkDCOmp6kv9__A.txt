Growing up in Phoenix I've tried a wide variety of Mexican restaurants. Finally a friend introduced me to Mariscos Hermosa and I fell in LOVE. Be forewarned, the location doesn't look very appealing from the outside. It isn't in the best of neighborhoods but don't let that fool you, this place is amazing! Inside it's very charming, Mexican sea life decor, the tables are very colorful and all look different. Soccer games are usually played on the televisions, it would be a good spot to come to watch your favorite team over some margaritas or delicious horchatas! 

Their ceviche de pescado and camaron is my favorite dish. I'm a big seafood lover and this place knows how to do it right. If you're into oysters I also suggest ordering that to start. So good! Chips and salsa are given upon seating and their salsa verde is a bit spicy but so delicious. I wish I had a jar of it at home. Great horchata and cheap Negra Modelos! The staff has always been great and very friendly. 

This place is a hidden gem.
