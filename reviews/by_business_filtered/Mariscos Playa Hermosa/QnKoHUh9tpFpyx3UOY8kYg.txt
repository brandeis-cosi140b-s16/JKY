2nd visit.

1st visit had seafood soup.  A bit heavy on cilantro for me, not a cilantro fan.

2nd visit had fish and shrimp with poblano sauce.  
Would have been 5 stars but the only 4 shrimp came with it and they looked a bit lost on the large plate.
Draft beer at $3 is a real bargain.

Service was helpful and quick.  HOW do they get the food out so quickly?

Place was nearly empty both nights.
If this place was in a suburban strip mall, the line would be out the door.

Do yourself a favor and go.

I certainly plan on returning often.
