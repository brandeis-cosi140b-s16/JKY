Going to Mariscos Playa Hermosa is like taking a quick vacation to Rocky Point. The seafood was fresh, the service friendly and the atmosphere authentic. I went with the advice of a previous yelper and ordered the molcajete. And she was right, it truly was a volcano of food. Chicken, steak, fish and shrimp all surrounding a bubbling green sauce that's so good you want to drink it. Beans, rice, salads and fresh tortillas were served on the side, perfect for making your own little burritos. The complimentary ceviche tostadas were a nice touch and the green salsa was BUENO. The margaritas were really good too, although they were pretty small. All in all, it was well worth the drive and I can't wait to go back. 

Note to late diners: they close at 8:00 :(
