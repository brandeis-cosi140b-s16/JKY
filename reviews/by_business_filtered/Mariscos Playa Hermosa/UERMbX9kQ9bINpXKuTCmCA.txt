First time tonight...and was extremely pleased. Excellent service, fun decor and outstanding food. I had the mix grilled fish/chicken/meat that had a wonderful creamy tomatillo sauce in the middle filled with octopus..this was like a mexican pupu platter!! Enough for 2, have leftovers. I love the complimentary cerviche taco they bring after ordering our margaritas...definitely a will go again soon...
