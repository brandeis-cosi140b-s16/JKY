The exterior of the building might be unappealing but once you step in it's whimsical and cheerful. This is a Family Owned Sinaloan Style Seafood Restaurant that is open every day for lunch and dinner.

Right away they gave us house made chips , the daily made green guacamole style salsa and the spicier red salsa. They are delicious and differ from other salsas I've tried elsewhere and I only tried a few and then they presented Mini Complementary Tostada Ceviches and gosh they were excellent and were better in taste (not quality of fish)  than some I've tried at high end dinning destinations paying maybe the same as my whole meal here and these were FREE here. 

I always enjoy the fish veracruzana with vegetables but this time tried the fish with poblano peppers , onions and tomatoes. Both these dishes I can tell you are as tasty as can be. The fish filet is mild and fresh with a feather light batter that is not oily being the lightest batter I have ever seen on a delicate fresh fish. For me what makes these dishes so great is the delicious well made light sauces they are in. Also included are very soft fresh tasting tortillas and on the platter was salad , refried beans and a white rice with mixed vegetables that is yummy from the sauce of your dish. All this food I got was only $13.00 It was not good but very good.

While we were dining I noticed most people were ordering what looked like a steaming large cauldron of mixed grilled meats and fish , I found out this dish is called Malcajete and it looked great to try.

They offer many variations of fish , steamed , grilled , battered, and breaded with a variety of sauces. Very little in the way of chicken or beef but they do have some.

It's a small family run business so when they get busy sometimes they go down a bit I noticed on a visit after I wrote this Yelp.

3.5-5 stars
