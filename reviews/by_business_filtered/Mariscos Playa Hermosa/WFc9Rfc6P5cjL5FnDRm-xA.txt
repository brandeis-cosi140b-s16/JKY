I'll start by saying that the people who I dealt with here were very polite and hospitable. But, they seated us and forgot about us. We sat for about 10-12 min before we asked someone if we could order (after looking the menus over and deciding on a plate), so we ordered our drinks and food at the same time. The wait for the food was long as well.

Our plates were expensive for what we got in return. I ordered Pescado a la Diabla, which is a fish filet in spicy sauce. The sauce was not at all spicy, not to my standards anyway, and it was salty. It came with beans, rice & salad, but a very small portion of each. There were four of us who dined here and everyone said their food was just okay. The chips were stale and the salsa tasted too much like tomato, there was no spice to it. Our table had no napkins and we had to ask for our silverware after we were given our food.

The location is not very big and feels crowded inside. It was so loud it was hard to hear the waitress or the people at my table.

There are no baby changing stations in the restroom. Definitely will not be returning.
