This is my second visit to this location. The first time I did not bother with a review however, I must speak up. This place is delicious. My girlfriend and I stopped in for a quick, light bite in between programs. I had the shrimp cocktail with avocado and she enjoyed a fish tostada. Both were delicious and quite filling. The service was timely and our server was friendly and attentive. Great food, great service you can't beat that.
