This is the most fantastically delicious Mexican food I have ever had.
We started out with a fish ceviche followed by a shrimp ceviche. My daughter had a sea bass grilled and my son ordered a chille relleno. My wife ordered a carne asada fajita. Then we ordered a Molcajete Caliente for 2. This comes in a stone bowl with green sauce and cheese. It has shrimps, fish, carne asada and chicken. All hung on the hot stone bowl like a shrimp coctail!! Needless to say we all were eating each others food!!
It hits your taste buds from every direction!! Yum!!
We thought we would finish the meal with a flaan. How wrong we were! We just had to order another one. It was so delicious.
The quantity is right up there with the quality. We had to pack up the left overs to go. There is no way I was going to let one ounce of this feast go waste.
The service was exceptional. Our hostess/server was there like a genie. Water glasses were filled before they got empty, hot tortias appeared by magic, lime when requested materialised. Even when we awkwardly spilled a glass of water, it was soaked dry with a smile.
I wish I could have this meal more often.
I know that every time I come to Phoenix, they will have to deal with me!!  :-) :-).
