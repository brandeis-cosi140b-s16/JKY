So to start off, be careful coming from the south and turning right into the street cause we got a flat turning into the parking lot. You will hit the curb, we saw the person after us hit the curb also and then the guy from our insurance that came to change our tire also said he hit it too. 

The place is very small feels very crowded especially with the band. WAY too loud, could barely hear the waitress or my boyfriend so didn't even bother talking much. 

Food was good(had the shrimp ceviche )even though mine came out wrong at first, and I'm sure she forgot about one of my orders cause I had to ask about it. 

Definitely not a place for babies/kids. They don't have changing tables!! Had to go to my car and change my baby in the hot car!! Big big negative!!

Waitress was nice, but they have them all over the place so I had to ask another worker twice to get our waitress cause she never passes by us to even be able to wave her down.

I would recommend it for couples/grownups only
