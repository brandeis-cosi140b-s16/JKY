I very rarely give a restaurant 5 stars, much less a Mexican restaurant since I do not like Mexican food.  This place really does deserve all 5 stars.  I ordered the al pastor tacos with rice and beans.  I asked for them to hold the beans.  I loved the rice!  Very different than expected.  The order came with 3 al pastor tacos.  The place was only $8.99!  Perfect!  They also gave us a ceviche tostada before our meal.  Yum!
