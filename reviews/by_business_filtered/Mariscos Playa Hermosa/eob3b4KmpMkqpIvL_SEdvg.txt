I selected this place based on all the great Yelp reviews, and all I can say is that I was very disappointed.  I'm fine with it being kind of a dive...my issue was with the food.  We both got ceviche apps, which were pretty good.  I had a fish filet & my BF had the dish with chicken, shrimp and beef (forget what it's called).  I found the food to be pretty salty, which I can't stand.  My fish was swimming in some kind of liquid, which totally turned me off & the salad it came with was drowned in some kind of yellow Italian dressing (Wish Bone out of the bottle?  not sure).  My BF's dish was ok at best...the beef was chewy & the shrimp & chicken were salty.  I hate to be so harsh, but I gotta call 'em as I see 'em.  Would def. not return.
