Good food but terrible waitresses. I had to get up two times to ask for more drinks and tortillas. I know it was a busy Sunday but that doesn't excuse the terrible customer service. 
It ruined my entire meal with the family.
 I don't think I'll be back.

Buena comida, pero muy mal meseras. Me tuve que levantar dos veces para pedir m√°s bebidas y tortillas.Tengo en cuenta que era un domingo ocupado pero eso no es una excusa para un servicio al cliente tan terrible.
No vuelvo a regresar a este lugar.

Owners of this place please hire more competent waitresses. I think you need it.
