Let me start by saying I am Mexican so I don't eat at 'Mexican restaurants' often but Im glad I stopped here. This is true Mexican seafood with great taste and very nice ambience. The waitresses were very nice and attentive but not to an annoying level. I would definitely go back with family and friends and 0lan on doing so.
