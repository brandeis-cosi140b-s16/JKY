Went to this restaurant because of the high reviews but didn't have the same experience. Service wasn't the greatest ( ordered sour cream and guacamole as sides and had to remind waitress when my food came without them then when the sour cream finally came from a different waitress , no guacamole again, I finally gave up. The food was only okay. Loved the salsa. The mariachi band was so loud it actually hurt my ears. I'm assuming they never turned the amplifiers down from the Saturday nite before.
