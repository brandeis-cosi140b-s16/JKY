Disclaimer: My margarita was perfect and I can't say for sure if that influenced my review of the food :)

Saw this place on "Check Please, Arizona" on channel 8 and was so excited to try it.  And wow, we were not disappointed at all!  In fact, the food far exceeded our expectations!  

We had the molcajete with green sauce.  It's basically a giant hot lava bowl full of deliciousness and even though 3 of us couldn't finish all of it, I was still sad when I couldn't cram any more of it in my face.

We also shared a fish fillet with octopus and shrimp in a mushroom cream sauce.  It was also very good, but the star of the show was definitely the green sauce in that molcajete.

We are going back next weekend and looking forward to it!
