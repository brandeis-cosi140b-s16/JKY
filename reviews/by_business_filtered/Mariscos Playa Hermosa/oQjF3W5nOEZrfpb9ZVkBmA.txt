Seafood Mexican???? Really???? REALLY!!!!! This is the bomb! The best Mexican I have ever had in my life!  Funky, but good!  Go with the big seafood sampler, but share it with a friend, as it will feed you both,

Tis place is truly a hole in the wall, and I saw some people walk away from the menu looking for the traditional taco, but boy did they miss the boat!!!  If you love great food and want to be adventurous, go for it, you will never regret it.

Next time I'm in Phoenix, I will be stopping by.
