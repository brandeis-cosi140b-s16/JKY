Have been coming her for years. Went back about 4 months ago after a long break away and it was still as good and fresh as ever. The little marisco joint is colorful, clean, and the staff is friendly. The chips and green salsa are phenomenal and the little ceviche tostada they bring to each customer before there main dish is served, is a lovely touch.
Go!....go now!.....you will be be disappointed ;)
