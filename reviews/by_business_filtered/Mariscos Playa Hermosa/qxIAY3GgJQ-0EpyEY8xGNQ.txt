What a fantastic meal I had.  I've been desiring amazing Mexican restaurants in Arizona.  Since I moved here, I've been to several places that were underwhelming, at best, and generally just not good to me.  So, I'd given up on Mexican Food in AZ and I just didn't eat any.  Well, a conversation in Yelp Talk about Mexican Food inspired me to check out some different places and this one turned up in my searches on Yelp and other websites.

I'm happy to say that I was so thrilled and enjoyed my meal very much at Mariscos Playa Hermosa.  Again, another hole-in-the-wall, but still quite the find.  Mariscos is located in a pretty seedy part of town, so don't get nervous going there.  They close early, so you'd better arrive early.  You will find that there is a full bar inside this colorfully decorated resto.  Don't eat at the bar.  That things not suitable for anything except decoration as the bar itself doesn't extend out far enough to make it comfortable to sit there.  (this is a tip from a person who opted to sit at the bar)

I tasted a few items off the menu.  The shrimp in diablo sauce was my favorite.  I ordered extra diablo sauce on the side.   The sauce has a smokey taste with the heat of the peppers.  Perfect for my heat seeking taste buds.  They prepare the sauce "fresh to order".So there is a charge for $3 for the extra sauce on the side to go.  I used that sauce to make more shrimp diablo at home later that week.  

I also enjoyed the camarones culichi... shrimp in green sauce.  Culichi is a tomatillio sauce made with some dairy product and cilantro and of course the poblano or tomatillio peppers.  The sauce is simply to die for.  I left there satisfied and happy!  

I will return and take a friend for the Molcajete Caliente with verde sauce.  Can't wait.  I'm sure it will please.

They have a check-in offer too, so be sure to check-in.

Oh, that parking lot is TINY.  Be aware of that when you go.
