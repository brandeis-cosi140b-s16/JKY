Delicious!  We had margaritas, fish ceviche, fish tacos and crab enchiladas. I would prefer the shrimp, but my grandpa was having shrimp so wanted fish. The verde sauce with the chips is really flavorful. 

Fish tacos were great, packed with fish and so were the enchiladas (but with crab meat). The red sauce was a little on the sweet side. Paired with some of their many hot sauces, it was perfect. Large potions and good prices. 

We made reservations for 6 on a Saturday and it was picked when we arrived but cleared up shortly after. I love the bright colors and there's a patio. 

The service was excellent, staff working together and very friendly. I used the Yelp free cake offer and had the chocolate cake. Really good, giant piece. 

If I've ever in town again, I'll come back. May have made a regular of my grandpa!
