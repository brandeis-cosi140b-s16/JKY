This relatively small 12-table restaurant packs a nice mexican punch. The decor is a mexican coastal theme with a small bar and impressive wine selection. They have around 5 draft beers of standard mexican brews (Tecate, Dos, Corona, etc.).

To start the meal I ordered a $4.00 24 oz draft and the waitress brought out complementary (homemade) chips with two types of tasty salsa. A gratis talapia ceviche tostata (also pictured) followed, which was impressive.  I had an excellent shredded beef taco and carne asada enchaladas with red sauce (photo posted). The carne had a great grilled flavor that came through the bold taste of the red sauce. The salad was fresh and the rice contained lima beans, carrots, peas and corn - not your uninspired rice you typically get. 

My waitress was helpful and attentive, the remaining staff was busy cleaning and organizing - a sign of a well run business. The deserts looked great (coconut cake, a chocolate cake and a stawberry merange pie looking thing) but was too full to partake. 

It's close to the airport so I hit this after my business trip. Same experience! I'll return here when in Phonix again.
