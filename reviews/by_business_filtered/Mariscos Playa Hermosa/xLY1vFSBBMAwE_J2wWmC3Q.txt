So my coworker and I had a business trip to Chandler, AZ and I had told him about my last two experiences eating seafood in the desert. Fish tacos that looked and tasted like nasty dried chunks of leather. You figure AZ shares a border with Mexico so they must share some learnings but it was nothing like the awesome fish tacos you get in San Diego. Need to avoid seafood in AZ.

We randomly drove by this place and decided, ok that looks interesting. Surprised me when I found it was another seafood joint. MMmm ok we're here and too hungry to look for another place.

So I ordered the crab enchilada plate and it was actually pretty good. Real crab meat stuffed enchiladas with rice and beans on the side. The shrimp ceviche tostada appetizer was also pretty good as well.

The exterior looks a bit sketchy but the interior decor was cute with a fishy motif straight out of the Bahamas. All in all a nice place for lunch.
