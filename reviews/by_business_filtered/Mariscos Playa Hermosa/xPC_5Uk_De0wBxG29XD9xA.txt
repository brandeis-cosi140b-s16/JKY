Excellent food and service. Most of the menu specializes in seafood and it's great. I highly recommend this restaurant!! I frequent this place every time I'm in Phoenix at least once. Last visit I made it back a second time in one week. The staff is very friendly and attentive. Don't let the location turn you off. Just go in and enjoy. Oh yeah - 22 oz. beers on tap.
