Oh my goodness, this place was absolutely delish! The fish came succulent yet fried crisp on the outside... A very hard task indeed! And the poblano sauce was phenomenal over the top. The shrimp was great. It's on the lighter side if you have a smaller appetite compared to the dishes ur still generous. The seasoning is on the saltier end of the spectrum but it tasted perfect to me for this kind of cuisine. Mmmmmm! My only regret is not having a place like this in NYC.
