An expensive 'meh' accompanied by a loud sigh pretty much sums up my visit to the new Matta's.

The bill ended up super expensive and I'm not really sure why. I ordered two burritos and a quesadilla and it was over $40!! Stick to the other location if you must have Matta's, but honestly there are so many better Mexican restaurants in the valley.

The carne asada was bland, hardly seasoned, room temp and not marinated enough for my liking. I could have sworn the red enchilada sauce was better at the other location too. Maybe it's all just meh.
