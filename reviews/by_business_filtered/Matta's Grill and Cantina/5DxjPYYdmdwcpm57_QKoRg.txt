Let me start by saying we almost walked out of here. We could not understand anything on the menu. It was in English, that was not the problem. It's that everything was mish-mashed together. No rhyme or reason. Very difficult to figure out if what you were reading was a burrito, taco or what. If it wasn't for the waitress explaining it then we would have given up. 

Husband ordered steak fajita burrito and I ordered chicken fajita burrito. Both were very good. Rice, beans  or any sides were extra which is different. 

We would go back but probably just order the same thing cause we still can't figure out the menu. We're not the only ones. Waitress says she gets this all the time. You could see the frustration on her face. She profusely apologized several times. 

Good food, just know what you are ordering.
