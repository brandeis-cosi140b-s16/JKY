Matta's has a very pleasing atmosphere, nice furniture and friendly staff.

I goto restaurants to eat though. The food was so boring and bland. It made me sick that they overcharged for Taco Bell shells, picante canned salsa, and slop style presentation. 

I recommend Serrano's. Never eat at Matta's. horrible food, horrible.
