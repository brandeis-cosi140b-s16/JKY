The girlfriend and I came in and it has awesome decor. The staff was very friendly. The chips were fresh but the salsa and bean dip was pretty bland.
The food came out real quick and was steaming hot. My girlfriend had a burrito and I had the fajitas. We both felt the food was pretty bland. The food is definefly not the best to go if you want mexican but the ambiance made up for.it. the price was a bit steep but all in all it was a pleasant expierence.
