Not real authentic Mexican food. The microwave use is obvious. The place has the venue but the customer service needs improvement, I arrived on a day where it was pretty empty but it took 15 minutes waiting at the front desk to be greeted. The food is wheeled out on medical carts. In the words of chef Ramsey: WHERE'S THE STANDARD!?
