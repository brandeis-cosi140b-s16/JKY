I'm upset that there is only a low option for one star this place does not even deserve one star.
 This is not just the worst Mexican food I've ever had this is the worst restaurant in management establishment I've ever been in. 

Any good reviews on this place must be from staff or friends. There was one review left by gentleman that Missed his movie because of long wait times and had an altercation with the management that acted like a thug not a restaurant manager 

This review is about the only act for review on here I have experience the same awful food if you complain like you should have the right to any establishment your bullied by a head to toe tattoo guy looks like he belongs in a biker bar instead of a restaurant
What is Calais too bad attitude he bullies you into paying a check for food that shouldn't be called Mexican 

mark my words punk daddy's money a run out soon in the way you treat customers in your quality of food will come back to bite you soon or later

I come to find out after I posted this review that there is another Matas located in the area

And has been there for years so I'm assuming the father had started this restaurant or one of family 

So I have no idea if I'm redoing the right one I'm speaking of the one it's in the plaza right off the 202 in Mesa

And if by chance the father uncle whoever started the first restaurant years ago is reading this now

I say this as a small business owner for 23 years 
Your son nephew whatever relationship to your family he is is destroying your business let me say this again is destroying your business obviously if you have multiple locations your first location did very well but let me say this again the guy with tattoos all over him should not be running your business
