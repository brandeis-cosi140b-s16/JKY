Haven't eaten here since they moved their location from Main Ave in Mesa location.  No one at the front to greet us when we arrived and when the gentleman seated us,  he lacked a personality.  Should have left at that point.  We ordered chimis and the amount of food was great,  it was hot and exactly as we ordered.  However being the picky eater I am I asked for no condiments,  However instead I'd like cheese with my chimi.  When the bill came we were charged $2 more for cheese. Or waitress coyly answer why it was more.  Very poor. ...I would have appreciated the heads up for the extra change.  There are plenty of other restaurants to patronize.  I won't be back.
