The food here at Mattas is average at best. However way over priced. I ordered a chile relleno taco combo, and added an additional taco at a cost of 6.99 for the added taco. To add to my surprise of the cost of the ala carte taco is how the food was plated, both tacos were resting in the beans and relleno sauces making them soggy and unable to be picked up. I was surprised a restaurant that's been in business this long does not know or show their cooks how to properly plate food. All this being said my family and I have been three times and will not be going back.
