This place is located in the Riverview shopping center in Mesa.  Before we went there we had no idea this place existed!! Neither did anyone else cause this place looked like a ghost town with all the rentable spaces.  We didnt even know where to enter the restaurant.  When we got inside it was very simple for a mexican restaurant, your basic mexican decor.  We sat outside on the patio, which was nothing special.  They start everybody out with chips and salsa, some of the best i have had!!! I couldn't stop eating them!!! Nom, nom! I ordered the 2 item combo plate with a cheese enchilada and a chorizo taco. I was impressed with the taste of the beans and the rice.  The big thing for me when i go to a mexican restaurant is they never get the rice right, but here they did.  The chorizo taco is poorly presented with half sliced unmelted kraft single cheese sitting in the taco.  It looked unappetizing.  Shredded is the way to go!! I only ate one of the two they gave me.  I wont be back again.  The only time i will ever get close to this place is if I go to Toby Keith Bar.  They pretty much get the three stars cause of the chips and salsa, rice, and beans.  Other then that, its no bueno.
