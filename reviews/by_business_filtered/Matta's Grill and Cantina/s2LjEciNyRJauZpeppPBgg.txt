The queso dip is made like "white trailer trash folks" make on Super Bowl Sunday, yellow like Velvetta. I was hoping for a true Mexican white queso dip made with Oaxaca/Monterey Jack blend. No such luck. Also, small portion for the amount paid. It is served in a small tortilla bowl that has perhaps only a ladle full inside it. Not even half full.

Our waiter was quick, efficient, and pleasant. He promptly took our order, served our meals, refilled our drinks, cleared the table, and delivered the check without any waiting time or having to ask. 

The food was served hot and quick. There were no combo plate numbers like 1 through 40. We were not offered a lunch menu at 12:30pm on Friday. Therefore, I do not believe they offer lunch prices. The pricing on the menu I feel is a little more expensive than most other Mexican restaurants. The salsa was delicious. I like the one with fresh green onions and chunky tomatoes the most. I like salsas that have a thick consistency over the watered down ones. The two that are served are of perfect consistency. I had the chili relleno and enchilada. Nice cheesy & the enchilada sauce was delicious. My friend had some sort of meatball soup. He seemed to enjoy it. He didn't make any comments about it.
