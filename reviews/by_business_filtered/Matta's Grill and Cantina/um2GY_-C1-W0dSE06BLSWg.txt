My first visit here, and it did not disappoint. Food was good and had fair portions. Staff was friendly and informed us about Happy Hour specials- $3 cheese crisps (amazing!) and $4 Matta's Margaritas. 

Interior is beautiful and clean. Displayed at the front door is their March 2014 county health inspection grade: A. Dining area is spacious and inviting. Cantina is a fun area with sports on the TVs. 

My party ordered a diverse selection off the menu, and each item was great! Will definitely be coming back. 

Since Top Shelf on Southern closed, this is the next best thing- maybe better.
