Visited late afternoon on Friday and was greeted promptly by the bartender.   I ordered the Baquero Cowboy platter.  The rice and beans side was excellent as were the three tacos (I liked the carnitas taco the best and the skirt steak taco the least).  My wife ordered the Korean taco (yummy) and the Roasted Beets taco (just ok).

We had great service, loved the music,  the food was presented well and was plentiful; however,  we both thought the food could be amped up a notch in flavor.   Maybe I was expecting more heat.   We also thought the $8 for house chardonnay was a little steep since the pours were small.  Overall,  a solid 4 stars drifting towards a 5.

FYI:  Maverick Rock Taco is part of the Xenia Hospitality Group with other Charlotte restaurants, such as Nolen Kitchen, Big View, and Ilios Noche.
