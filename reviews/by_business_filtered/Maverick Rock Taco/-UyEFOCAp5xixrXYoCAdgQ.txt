Man oh man, do I have a weakness for Mexican food. 

Stopped here to grab some grub with a friend the other day. I've been here several times, but this was my first lunch visit. Wanna cheap, tasty lunch during the week? This is the place to go.

We both opted for the lunch menu. My buddy was intrigued by the Chili-Lime-Tequila wings and felt he had no choice but to order them. They were good... although it was odd to have wings and fries at a Mexican restaurant. I went with the two taco plate... one chicken, one pork. The chicken was okay. The pork was better. I liked the combination of the pineapple and fried onions on it. Both meals came with a drink. The damage: less than $16. Steal. 

One thing I don't like about this place: I'm a huge chips and salsa person. Keep bringing them out... I want to be stuffed before my food arrives. This isn't one of those places. First round is free. (And it goes quickly because of the portion size) After that, you pay for refills. Hmmpphhh (that is my pouting sound)

As with every spot on Montford, parking here can be tricky. Lunchtime isn't a problem, but have some patience if you venture here on the weekends.
