Came in on a Wednesday night with 2 girlfriends and loved it. Quick service, dank food and good value.

$1 Tecate -yesss
I had the Tequila Shrimp Taco and Mexican Street corn as a side (was too full of beer and chips to eat the chicken tinga)... 

Definitely a casual spot I would frequent to get my street taco fix. Want to try the pineapple guac next time :p
