What makes this place cooler than the other bars in town? The outdoor seating area! And I don't mean just ANY outdoor space, this is a fenced in area, with colorful christmas lights adorning the top of the patio, with brand new wooden high picnic table and benches. 3 Large flat screen TVs are on the outside patio, so you will not miss a second of the game you came here to watch. It is a magnificent experience after the sun cools off and enjoy yourself on the patio with good company. Great for conversations as it is much quieter outside. The sound of the TVs are muted so you can enjoy your company at the same time.

Try any of their chips and dip and you will not be disappointed. The avocado dip is awesome, the avocado is very fresh. The Queso dip is also banging, not too salty or hot. 
I wouldn't come back here for tacos, if I wanted taco I will probably go to Cabo Fish Taco in Noda. Their Tacos were OK. 

The drinks were quite fantastic, we ordered red sangrias to share. There were chunks of strawberries in the sangria. It was just the right flavor, sweet but not to sweet, you can taste the alcohol, and the drink was refreshing. 

The turn-around for our orders was really fast. We also really appreciated that all of our items were served in a nice presentation, which you can not expect at most bars.
