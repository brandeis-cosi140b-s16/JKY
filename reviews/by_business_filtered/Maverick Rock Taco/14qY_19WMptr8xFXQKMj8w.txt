I thought the menu here gave you a pretty good selection. My wife and I both got the tacos. 2 tacos + 1 side for $9.50 ... that's a pretty good deal to me. I love that they let you pick between flour, corn or lettuce wraps as a "shell". 

I got the Jamaican chicken & the mojo pork carnitas ... both of which I'd highly recommend. The tacos both had great flavors to them thanks to the eccentric toppings, although I think the Jamaican chicken might have been a tad better thanks to the Caribbean salsa and plantains it was packing. The spicy cilantro lime fries were awesome as well. I would also definitely recommend the mexican grilled veggies if you're looking for a "healthy alternative" side. It was mostly zucchini and yellow squash, but it was sauteed perfectly and had a great flavor. 

We'll definitely be back to this place! We had pretty good service here given that we came around 9pm on a packed Friday night. Food was out very quickly, although they did mix up one of my tacos with one of my wifes.
