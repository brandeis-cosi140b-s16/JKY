The food here was fabulous! I ordered a pineapple mojito, gringo beef tacos, and sweet potato waffle fries. All of it was incredible! Only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is because we were told it'd be a 10 minute wait, but waited for 45. I don't mind waiting at any place, but be a little more open if it's gonna take longer.
