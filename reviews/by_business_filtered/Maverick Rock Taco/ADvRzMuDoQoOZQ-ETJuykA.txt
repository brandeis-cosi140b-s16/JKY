I would say this is more of a taco place than a full authentic mexican restaurant. We went for dinner and service was ok, it seemed we had 4 different people so sometimes was hard to get someone...maybe because the table was in the bar area. I liked they had so many unique tacos to choose from. I got one with shredded beef and it was amazing! I also got the pork belly and wAsnt a fan...I like pork belly and it was rubbery and even though normally fatty there was pretty much no meat. Cheese dip was good and the Mexican corn was awesome, that is a must if you are eating here. Their sangria they made was pretty good too. Will return to try more.
