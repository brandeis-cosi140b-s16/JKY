Have eaten here three times since discovering two months ago. The two dine ins were great. My take out lacked but what can you expect having left it in the fridge over night. Loved the corn on the cob. Off the cob not so much ( but see "fridge") to understand why.
Tacos were excellent and loved the creativity in their variety.
Wait staff were knowledgable and at tentative w/o hovering. Decor was fun Tex/Mex but could use some sprucing. 
Great fun and value for the money.
Will definitely come back.
