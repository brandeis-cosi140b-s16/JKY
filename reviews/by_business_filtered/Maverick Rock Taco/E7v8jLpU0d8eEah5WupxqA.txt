I was pleasantly surprised here when I came to lunch with my husband over the weekend. He had a chicken burrito and I had the 2 tacos with a side. The chips and salsa satisfied my dipping needs, the tacos and burrito were well seasoned, and the wait staff was informative for my 20 questions game I like to play and they played along well. If someone was in the mood for a little Mexican, this is a stop we would recommend.
