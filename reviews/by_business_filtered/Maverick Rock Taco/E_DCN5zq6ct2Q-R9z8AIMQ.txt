The best red wine sangria I have ever had. I dream about their sangria which by the way they have half price on Thursays! 

The menu is a slight modern twist and their use of herbs is spot on from the french fries to the rice. This summers menu was extremely limited but it looks like they just updated their menu with more variety.
