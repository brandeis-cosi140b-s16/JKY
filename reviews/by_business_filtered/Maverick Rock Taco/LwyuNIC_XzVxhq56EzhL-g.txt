Now I eat a lot of Mexican food, pretty much everyday I have something in tortilla form, so my standards are a little skewed. First off the decor is very nice, tex mex cantina vibe, and they also have garage doors that they can open in warmer weather which is a plus. The dining areas are divided in two, which is  kind of a  bummer but hey thats just the way the building is laid out. When I was there the service was good, nothing over the top but hey we got our food. Chips and salsa were good, but it is a bummer that after the first round you have to pay. My guessing is since Montford is a happening bar area on the weekends they don't want a bunch of drunks coming in and ordering one beer and cleaning them out on their chips and salsa, again only my guess, but they should make some clause like unlimited chips with entree purchase or something. I got the chicken burrito, which was good, nothing to write home about but good. The cilantro fries though were really good, highly recommended. They have quite a few specials thorough out the week that are a good deal as well. Overall I would come back, but I'll take my time getting there.
