Mixed bag.

Habanero poppers were excellent if you don't mind a bit of heat.  My  mixed fish tacos were really tasty.   Mrs. S's "Mexican Caesar Salad" was absolute crap.  Just kind of barely there.

Stopped in the gent's room.... mistake.  I noted upon entry that another male occupied the restroom.  I vaguely made out is shadow and I called out a cheery "hello in there".   Message the Rock Taco management if you are checking reviews:  It is never under any circumstances appropriate to light your gent's rooms with 70s era blacklights.  No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No.   

Not cool dudes,  not cool.
