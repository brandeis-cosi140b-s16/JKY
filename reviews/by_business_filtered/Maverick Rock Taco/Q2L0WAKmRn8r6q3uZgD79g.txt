I decided to check out this new spot and will definitely add it to my list of favorites! I love the decor it has a very much retro rock feel. The service was great and the food was fantastic. I ordered the fried avocado taco with the infamous corn as a side and boy was I in for a treat!!! The prices are reasonable and it's a laid back type of restaurant. Check it out if you haven't!!!!
