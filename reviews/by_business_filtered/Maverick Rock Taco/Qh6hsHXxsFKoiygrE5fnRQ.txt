I recently made a lunchtime expedition to Maverick Rock Taco with some coworkers after it was enthusiastically endorsed by another set of colleagues. Our visit got off to a bit of a rocky start in that I didn't realize that the parking on one side of the building is reserved for another business, despite the fact that the spaces are immediately adjacent to MRT. Fortunately, that was quickly resolved by moving to the other side of the lot, and in we went.

The first thing I noticed upon entering is that they had quite a large space. The lunch crowd was fairly thin when we went, but I'd expect the volume serves them well on the weekends. For our purposes, though, the emptiness and size made it hard to hear the people just across the table. Don't go wanting to have a profound conversation unless you want to shout. This isn't a dealbreaker, but it is worth noting.

On to service and food: Our waitress was... well, bless her heart. If you are from the South, you know what that means. If you aren't, I'll explain: she was as sweet as could be, but she was all over the place and wasn't at her mental peak. Sides were forgotten, drinks were misplaced, one of our party didn't get his entree with the rest of us because she forgot to bring it out. I can't be too cruel because she was indeed a sweetheart, so I'll repeat: bless her heart.

The food was tasty. The menu is fairly extensive with lots of options, but I figured for my first visit, I'd stick to the basics. Thus I ordered chicken tacos, and while I found them perfectly edible, they did lack a bit of oomph. My coworkers who ordered more exotic fare, such as fried avocados or mahi mahi, seemed more excited about their meals. As others have mentioned, the salsa is good.

I'll go back to Maverick Rock Taco for sure. Maybe they'll earn another star on a subsequent visit. For right now, the verdict is "Three stars: solid lunch spot."
