One of the best taco places in Charlotte, with great food, outstanding margaritas, and a really cool atmosphere. Only downside is the parking. We usually come early (we have small kids), but plan to park someone else on Montford Dr. and walk if you're coming after 8 p.m. Another small complaint is having to pay (!) for chips and salsa, but the tab is still pretty reasonable compared to other taquerias. All in all, a great place for tacos and tequila!
