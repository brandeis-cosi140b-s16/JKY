Pleasantly surprised. The service* is good and friendly. The *ambience is what it is. The food was good enough to get me to go back. I tried the tacos, and why not? 

I order four from the menu and the special. One pork, one steak, one calamari, one tune, and the special of fried tilapia. The fried calamari was terrific. I'd go back just for that. My second favorite was the Tuna- which the bartender said they were taking off the menu. Too bad because its awesome. Served in a similar way to authentic Mexican tacos- queso fresco, radish, cilantro and a hint of wasabi I believe. 

The fried tilapia was good. It's hard to mess it up, but they didn't. They pork taco was ok. It came with a pineapple or mango(maybe both) pico which overpowered the pork. I picked some off to taste the pork. 

The steak was the lackluster of my order. The steak itself had very little flavor and the chimichurri was meh. 

I went to give the place a try, and will go back. I don't expect every dish on a menu to suit my taste so I can live with four of five being good. Three were very good. All around I enjoyed it. 

*My note about service and ambience. I don't care to be entertained or bothered. While I wouldn't call the service at Maverick's over the top, it was slightly annoying. I'm just there for the food. If its good I'll be back, and it was. Of course I don't expect a server or bartender to know my expectations so I won't make a big deal out of it. It is better to have a server who is too friendly and attentive than slack.
