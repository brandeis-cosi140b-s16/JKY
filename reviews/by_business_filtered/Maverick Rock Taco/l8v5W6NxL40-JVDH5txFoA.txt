I wanted to like this place. Service was good, I had the jalape√±o margarita and it was good, but the food was just awful. I had the surf and turf. The mahi mahi  in the one taco definitely was not fresh, tasted really off, I took one bite and left it. The shrimp in the other taco was overly sweet. And the short rib enchiladas, which sounded so awesome, were cold and underwhelming. I don't think I will be back, unless it is only for drinks.
