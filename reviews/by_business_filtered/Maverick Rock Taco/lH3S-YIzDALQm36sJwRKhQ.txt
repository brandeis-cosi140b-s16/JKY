The other reviews are spot on. Sunday evening (about 6PM) Dawn and myself discovered Maverick Rock Taco by accident: we just happened to spot it while looking for something new.
We were seated in the bar area and promptly attended to by the bartender/ server for the table. He was very knowledgeable about the menu and made some excellent suggestions.

We had the salsa trio app (tomatillo/ avacado, Roja and mango/ habenero). The tomatilo/ avacado was exceptional. The Roja was a bit more bland than I like, but a dash of hot sauce opened up the flavor. There was no 'heat' to the sweet/heat of the mango/ habenaro ... perhaps the spice was left out of this batch?
For our entree we ordered six different proteins with a variety of toppings as tacos (chicken, steak, calamari, shrimp, vegetarian) IMPOSSIBLE to pick a favorite because they were all great: fresh, tasty and HUGE portions for the money.

The only drawback (and it's a pretty big one) was the atmosphere on this particular evening. We were seated in the bar area (We weren't told there was another dining area, just seated in the bar.) and had just received our food when a young woman decided to pay the jukebox. The music blasted out a hip hop song full of profanity and explicit sexual content. The music was loud enough to restrict conversation. There was a table of young twenty somethings seated behind us and they were singing along at the top of their lungs. Yike. Remember, this is about 6PM on a Sunday night. A server told us later that they had been there since opening and drinking all day. That experience really threw a wet towel over the evening. 

We'll be back, but only during lunch next time.
