I used to love this place! The vibe was cool and the bartenders were all so nice. Greeted you by name, made you feel welcome. Not anymore. I guess it is because they've had so much turnover here. Faces change regularly here! Anyways.....I'm in here right now and here has been my experience: I walked through the front door to the hostess with her head down on her cellphone. The bartender (guy) had been checking his phone regularly! Waitresses have come behind the bar to check their phones! I realize it isn't super busy but there is nothing worse than a disinterested staff! Cellphones mean disinterested! If I ever ran a restaurant, my staff would NEVER be allowed to be checking their phones in front of customers! Ever! What a terrible impression. Lastly, I have eaten here regularly. Food is pretty good! I started with some queso first! I feel like it was cheese from a can warmed up and served! Very bland and nothing special! They should take a lead from Bakersfield! They have the best queso in Charlotte! The tacos are very good and innovative/creative! I haven't been here in a while and tonites cellphone staff just make me believe I should go elsewhere!
