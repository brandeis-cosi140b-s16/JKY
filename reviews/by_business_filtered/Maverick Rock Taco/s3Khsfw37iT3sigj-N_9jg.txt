The chips and salsa are awesome, but it ALL went down hill after that. It's easier to list what was wrong then right. As I sit here still waiting for my check, here is a list of my experiences at this place.
I orders shrimp tacos, when they arrived there where only 2 small shrimps on each taco. I asked for sour cream on them and there was nothing more then a dot of it on each taco. No lettuce or cheese.
We were never given any silverware or extra napkins 
When asked.
Fries were raw, yes raw with seasoning on them, gross! 
Wait staff where miserable like they didn't even want to be here. Other patrons were complaining as well about the attitudes.
