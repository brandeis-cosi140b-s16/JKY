I would love to be able to tell you all about the food, but I can't because after walking in on a very non-busy Sunday evening during a football game and sitting for over 10 minutes, no one even came by to take our order or even give us a glass of water. I am so disappointed that such a cute place from the outside would be such a disaster on the inside. Let me also add that the atmosphere was horrible - I've got a mouth of a sailor, but the people sitting at the bar were dropping more f-bombs than I could ever try to get out during the Panters losing season. Don't think we'll be headed back to even give it a second try.
