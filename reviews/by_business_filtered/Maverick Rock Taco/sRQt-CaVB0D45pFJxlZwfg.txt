We decided to check out rock taco for a friend's birthday.  She'd been dying to give it a try.  

We started with the chips & salsa trio.  the tomatillo was my favorite.  the roja was bland & the mango one was way too sweet for chips & salsa.  

I ordered two street tacos, the tinga chicken & steak chimichurri.  The steak taco was quite delicious, I'd definitely order it again.  the tinga was completely devoid of flavor, maybe for people who don't really like Mexican food?!  I'm a "the spicier the better" kind of person & it left a lot to be desired.  

I think this place caters to the under 26 crowd, with the tool boxes of beer, loud music & even louder decor.  Not exactly my scene.  

I would go back to taste other menu items but it's definitely not a place I'd frequent.
