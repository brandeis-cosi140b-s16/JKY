I've been a few times now. Great variety in the menu. Even my veggie and paleo friends were happy. Guacamole was made in house, not just dressed up like a prev post said. If they bought it. I want to know where for my restaurant! Anyway, atmosphere was rustic and hip. Fits any occasion.  I Like the music quiet enough to have a conversation, but loud enough not to hear nearby tables. They hit it right. 
I wasn't a fan on the ceviche. I get what they were shooting for, but missed the mark on a tomato base ceviche. Also disappointed in the rubbery calamari rings in it. We had several apps. Server had no problem replacing the ceviche with another choice. Wing sauce was creative and different - kind of a cilantro buffalo. Really tasty. 
Tacos were great and large portioned, so def worth the extra $1 vs avg taco prices. Pork could use some work. It was a little dry for me. Surprisingly the veg  and the chicken were my favs. 
They lost me on the beer cocktails. Again, I get the idea. But it got to complex for me to try more that 2. Not as sessionable as the base brew had intended. 
Server was great, and excited about the restaurant. I hope they all reflect that. The managers were around, but just roaming. No real contact was noticed. Ive said it a million times, know your customers. Talk to them. The drive by table touches don't cut it these days! 
Keep up the good work. Wishing y'all much success!
