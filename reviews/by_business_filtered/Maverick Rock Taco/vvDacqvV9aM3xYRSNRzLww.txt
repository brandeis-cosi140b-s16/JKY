Great atmosphere and interesting salsa come immediately to mind remembering my first visit to this great spot!  The menu is not your run of the mill, either.  They offer some interesting items such as tortas (mexican sandwiches), street-style corn (OMG! YUM!!), and cilanto-lime fries.  Menu items are generous (read: over-sized) and they have some local craft beers on tap.  

I've seen other people mention that you don't get free chips and salsa here, which is true.  But, let me tell you what you DO get.  If you order chips and salsa, your chips are bottomless.  These chips are fresh, and perfect!  If you order the trio salsa, you get the traditional tomato-based salsa, then you get a tomatillo and avacado salsa, and a sweet-heat mango and habenero. We ordered this and it was a really enjoyable appetizer.

The restaurant is laid out in two distinct areas with tables in both areas and we were told they are adding a patio in the back.  I'm told if they do have live music, the layout allows you to enjoy the music, or escape to the other area where you can still have a normal conversation with friends.  This is a huge draw for me, as I usually find live music in restaurants to inhibit conversation due to the volume level.

Overall I really enjoyed our visit here.  The one draw back was that the hostess seemed to be ready for us to leave.  It may have just been a misunderstanding on her part, but she came and took our chips and salsa (that we were still snacking on) as soon as we paid our bill.  It was just one of those moments where we were so surprised we didn't even think to stop her until she was gone, lol.  It wasn't a big enough deal to keep us away, however, and I only mention it here as a caution in case this is her habit.  Suggestion:  ask the table before taking food away.

On to the next time... I'm dying to go back just for the corn!
