It really was a pretty nice place, and I would give it an extra half star if that were available. I think the beer is a little pricey, as are single tacos, but they had a pretty good selection of tap beers. Food seems okay, some of it quite tasty, but nothing special that I would rave about. When we were there (Sunday early evening) they weren't crowded at all; service was great.
