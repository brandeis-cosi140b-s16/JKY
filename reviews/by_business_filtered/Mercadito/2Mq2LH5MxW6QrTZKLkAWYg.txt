The food was good. The service sucked. We got seated and nobody came to take our drink order. When the lady finally came to take our food order I pointed out that we hadn't been asked for drinks, She just said "ya ya I'll take them now". We ordered an appetizer too. My husbands food came out first. They put it in the middle of the table. About 3 minutes later my friends food came out, again placed in the middle of the table. A few minutes minutes later my food came out, they actually wised up and placed it in front of me. Then the nachos came out followed by my daughters food. Our water glasses were empty most of the night. For the price, the service should have been much better. Doesn't help that they had a lot of staff standing around talking and texting on their cell phones.
