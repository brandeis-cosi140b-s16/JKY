Amazing experience. Decided to get the shareable dinner option, which ended up being a lot more food than we realized for a reasonable price. And when we weren't the most pleased with the flavor of one of the options, our server bent over backwards to accomodate us. Great food and great service, I'd eat here again in a heartbeat.
