The only reason I am giving this place 2 stars is because our server was amazing (William) and the food was delicious. 

We made a reservation for 6:15 and check into the restaurant at 6. The hostess tells us it will just be a couple minutes until we are seated... Well 6:30 rolls around and we still weren't seated. Then a hostess tells us that it will just be a couple more minutes as they are waiting on a wheel chair for a guest at the table we will be sitting at. We see the wheel chair come in and go to a table... But not the table we got sat at. Nooooooo they gave our table away and proceeded to sit us at a table that was made for 3 at most (we had a party of 4). 

We are crammed in this table and pissed off considering we waited about 40 minutes. When we complained about the table the manager LIES to us and says that the table is made for 4 people. Clearly it's not, in the rest of the restaurant they have 2 people sitting at identical tables not even ten feet away. 

I will give this place another try just because of the food. But the managers need to learn how to deal with upset customers. Apologizing and fixing it would've come off a lot better than lying.
