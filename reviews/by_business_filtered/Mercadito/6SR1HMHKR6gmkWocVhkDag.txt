I have been twice now and was impressed on both visits. 

The prices are reasonable and the food is delicious! The carne asada tacos were so tender, we questioned whether or not they were lengua. The queso fundido, and guacamole are delightful. 

Margarita was fresh and creative. 

The tables are very very close together. It is vibrant and noisy, not intimate. The first visit we were over served and constantly approached by highly attentive friendly staff. The second visit was the complete opposite. We saw our server 2 times and had to flag down others for our needs. 

Regardless, it is delicious, fun, upscale Mexican at a perfectly reasonable price point. We will indeed go again.
