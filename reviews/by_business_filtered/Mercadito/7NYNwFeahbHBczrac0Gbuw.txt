AMAZING! We went during happy hour so the margaritas, tacos and guac were on discount. The margaritas were fantastic and the tacos were full of flavor! I tried several of the options and loved them all. The guac was great too. We tried all the types of guac, original was still my favorite. Our waiter was awesome as well. We were a large group of 10 and he remembered what everyone ordered, was attentive and friendly. I will be back here again. Loved the experience!
