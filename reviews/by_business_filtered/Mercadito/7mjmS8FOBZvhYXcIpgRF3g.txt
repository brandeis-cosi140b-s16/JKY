I had such a wonderful experience here, I cannot imagine giving this place anything less. We were greeted by Adrian, she served us and recommended some Guava Margaritas. To die for, probably the BEST margarita I've ever had. We had tacos, steak nachos, and some other stuff I can't remember. We finished it with their chocolate cake. I am satisfied. Thank you chef Hector and Juan for cooking us a great meal.  see you on Thursdays for ladies night!and thank you Adrian for serving us, you were right about all the recommendations.
