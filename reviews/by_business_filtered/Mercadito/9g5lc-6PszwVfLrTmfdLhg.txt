I've never been to a Mexican restaurant that doesn't overload you with chips. 
  The food was very good . Full of flavor. Service was good also ... but you definitely leave there hungry. Thank God it was happy hour (late night) when we went. Over priced for what you get. But also good ambience. So .... until next time. I guess we'll go for dessert 
  I love chips & salsa. To bad they don't serve bigger portions. It was tasty
