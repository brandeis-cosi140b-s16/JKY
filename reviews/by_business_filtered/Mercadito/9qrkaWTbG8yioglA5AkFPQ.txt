This place is good! As an industry person I must say I was impressed:) Food, drinks, and service were 5 star. We sat at the bar..... Thanks Anthony for taking care of us;) However the manager kept coming in and out of the patio opening the door to talk on his phone. It was quite cold so here's a hint Mr. Manager... That's rude. Don't do that!
