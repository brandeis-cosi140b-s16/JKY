All my coworkers have been raving about this spot for a while now and I finally decided to make a special trip to Summerlin to check it out. Conveniently located in the Red Rock casino, Mercadito is not your typical obnoxiously painted, stereotypical Mexican restaurant. 

Graffiti paintings on the wall with contemporary decor, I was relieved that there wasn't sombreros and cut paper mâché on the walls. As suggested by my server, I started off with the guava margarita and opted out of the fire (they add something that makes it spicy). It was delicious, clean and fresh flavors. 

We ordered guacamole as an appetizer, the red salsa was good and the guacamole was chunky accompanied by homemade chips. After I was done sipping on my marg and munching on the chips I decided to order the shrimp tacos, which wouldn't have been my first choice (more of a carne asada gal) but my friend highly recommended them. Four little tacos came out (authentic Mexican) drenched in some orange sauce that had a hint of Chipotle ... Not exactly sure what kind of sauce it was though. 

Mercadito is a cute little high end Mexican eatery. Overall I liked it but I must go back for the carne asada, most likely during happy hour because it isn't cheap!
