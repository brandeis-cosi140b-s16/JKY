Mercadito is a fence sitter

Located inside Red Rock Casino, just about 50 yards from Yard house. Mercadito is a Mexican themed tapas restaurant that has come to Las Vegas from New York and Chicago. 

This is a fence sitter review, why you ask? Well when restaurants open there bounds to be a few hiccups along the way. When we walked in we were sat to a table promptly. Unfortunately the table we sat at was really made for people from the Hobbit. The layout of the business is quite nice and has an array of seating options, but to seat 2 guys who well over 6 foot at kiddie tables was a little strange. We were told though that the small tables will be changed in a few days.

As for the menu, it has nice range of items to choose from. We went for the Guac and chips, Carne tacos and Pastor Tacos. All were pretty dam amazing! Absolutely something I can recommend. A few kinks here and there but for sure a place well worth visiting. I will also say for Mexican food it is a little pricey but kinda worth it.

Overall 
Food: 4-5
Drink: 4-5
Service: 3-5
Coming back: yes
