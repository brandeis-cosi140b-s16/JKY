Love love love Mercadito! I used to frequent the Miami location and was thrilled when they opened in summerlin. The food was amazing. Great guacamole and chips. I loved the carne asada tacos and the desert. Can't remember the name of the desert but it was amazing. The service was great. My husband left a good tip because he was do pleased with the constant attention. We'll be coming back over and over again.
