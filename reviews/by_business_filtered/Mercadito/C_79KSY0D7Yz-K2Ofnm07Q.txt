Brunch is what's up! Came here with some coworkers for their all you can drink brunch and it did not disappoint. Our server, Chris was an expert when it came to food and drink knowledge and even brought us cocktails that weren't listed on the menu. Did I mention it's all you can drink for 2 hours? You only need an hour to feel like you're on cloud 9. The manager, Louis, stopped by, refilled our drinks and gave us some insight on the business.  Best manager ever, dare I say, cutest?! The drinks are delicious and boozy and the food is amazing but the top notch service is what will keep bringing me back. Thank you Mercadito! See you soon
