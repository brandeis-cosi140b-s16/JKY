With so many amazing restaurants in Vegas, the truth is that one would be hard pressed to find a place one actually returns to over and over again.  Mercadito to me is that place.  The food is excellent and the passion that Chef Juan shows in his innovation is made all the more clear when you attend one of their cooking demonstration dinners (an excellent value I might add).  It's not Mexican street food although it incorporates elements of it.  And it's not fancy high falutin' food.  It's delicious food and ridiculously yummy drinks and amazingly fun and kind staff.
