We love tacos. We love guacamole. We love margaritas. So, naturally we were drawn to this new Mexican place inside Red Rock Resort. And the food was delicious. Very spicy but so good...like even though your mouth is on fire, you just can't stop shoving it in your mouth. It's that kind of good. 
I can't imagine anything tasting bad, but the beef in our beef tacos was kinda fatty. The pork & fish tacos were excellent. 
My only real complaint and the reason I deducted one star is the price (and the spice factor. If you have someone in your party that has a weak mouth...skip this place). Dinner for two; Guac sampler, 3 different taco plates and one margarita...over $65 not counting tip. It's just tacos. They're delicious but they are just tacos. I heard they have an all you can eat deal on Sunday's. That would be totally worth it.
