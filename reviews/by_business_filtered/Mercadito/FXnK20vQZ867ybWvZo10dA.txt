We dined here for lunch/brunch on a Saturday. I liked the vibe of the restaurant and I like the idea of upscale Mexican food.

I had the enchiladas with shrimp and green sauce. It came with three enchiladas and was relatively filling. I really liked the creamy green enchilada sauce and that avocado slices came on top. My husband went brunch and had huevos rancheros which was a very light dish. I sampled the red enchilada sauce and enjoyed that as well. We split chips with a trio of salsas. All of the salsas had great flavor and the hot salsa definitely packed some heat which I loved. 

I really wanted to try the tacos, but you are limited to one type of taco with the taco entree which was surprising since I've never seen this done before. I would have loved to be able to split between two types. We were told the dishes are meant to share so I'm guessing they do this to make you order more.
