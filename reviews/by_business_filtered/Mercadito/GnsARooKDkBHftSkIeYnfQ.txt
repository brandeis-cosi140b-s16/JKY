We went here early on New Year's Eve since we had been meaning to try this place. Collectively we had house Margaritas, traditional guacamole, red table salsa, ceviche mixto, lobster tacos and pastor tacos. We loved all of them! The ceviche had passion fruit juice in the citrus marinade which gave it an amazing  flavor. The lobster tacos had nice big chunks of lobster. The meat in the pastor tacos was lean and they added the traditional pineapple. The Margaritas were good. Overall the take on Mexican food here is light, fresh and modern. Traditional stuff with a little tweaking. There was nothing heavy or overly spicy. We will return!
