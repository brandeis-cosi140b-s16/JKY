I guess it was okay. 


I like to use Enchiladas to be my common standard of measure when it comes to Mexican food. Still, the evening started with Queso Flameado and the usual chips and salsa. The Queso Flameado was amazing, definitely the best part of the meal. 

Shrimp tacos followed the queso, they were definitely the lowest point of the meal. They were just okay, perhaps it was my fault because I requested no avocado on it (food allergies, don't judge me). 

And for the grand finale, I had the enchiladas, which come with tomatillo salsa, and added chicken to them. Unfortunately, the chicken was cooked in I don't know what but made no sense to the dish. I was glad I had black beans that came with the enchiladas. 

Service-wise, the server seemed to be anxious to get us out of there, pretty uncomfortable. The manager made his round, which I would imagine is the norm. I'd go back if I was around, wouldn't be a "Mercadito Craving".
