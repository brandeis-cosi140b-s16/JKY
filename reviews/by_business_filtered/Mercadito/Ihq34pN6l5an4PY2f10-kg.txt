Very disappointed You pay for chips & salsa, select from five choices ( you get couple tsp of each, not much). Very limited Menu selection & they were out of entree we wanted! Only corn shells avail no flour. We didn't eat have the Bracheto entree not very good! We did enjoy the Nacho's & service was good! We won't be back
