MOJITOS!!!!  The best Mojitos I have had. It's new on their menu and I highly recommend them. The guacamole was great as well. We were there on a Saturday for a late lunch. They still had their brunch menu in play so we had to wait until 3 for the other menu. No problem there. The Mojitos and guacamole kept us busy. The service was good as well.
