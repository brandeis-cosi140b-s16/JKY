We were so excited to try Mercadito.  The menu sounded great and it's hard to find good fresh Mexican food. We walked in and asked for a sugar free tea.  The have no sugar free drinks except Diet Pepsi. The waitress suggested water. Next we ordered the shrimp ceviche.  When it arrived we asked for pepper. We were told they don't have salt or pepper.  Took one bite of the overpriced ceviche and spit it out.  It was tiny, overpriced, and doused in some sweet red sauce that tasted like sugar water.  We told our waitress we couldn't eat there and walked out.  Huge disappointment, horrible food, and the service was pretty bad too.  Go to the Yardhouse and you will never be disappointed.
