SO LOUD-Our table of 4 couldn't hear each other at all.  The tacos were just okay, nothing special and nothing I would ever order again.  We had the steak w/ slaw and the pork w/ pineapple.  We also ordered all 3 guacamole options with 3 different salsas.  The salsa isn't a chunky consistency..it's meant to drizzle on the chips with a spoon.  The chips were cold and very thick.  Not the kind of salsa you can dig into with your chips. They are trying to make the tacos fancy instead of concentrating on the flavors.  The iced tea is terrible-it's like a sangria.  Instead of having 3 mediocre guacamoles...start with 1 and nail it.  Once you master that you can move on and create more.  Get better chips and go back to the drawing board w/ your salsa selections and tacos.  Service was great.  Never ever returning! YUCK!

WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY.  Also, a waste of space...once again another restaurant to FAIL in this space at Red Rock.  

If you are looking for tasty guacamole...head to Cantina Laredo. They make table side guacamole right in front of you and you can tell them exactly what you want in it.

If you are dying to try this place like we were or someone has twisted your arm into going......I suggest you sit outside and just order alcohol and nothing else.  I can't stress enough that the outdoor area is the only good thing about Mercadito.
