Borderline 4.5 as flavors are great in the tacos but I'm apprehensive to order anything but. When a menu item sounds as appetizing as it tastes, I'm usually drawn to it and as such never venture away. This is the case with Mercadito. Their tacos are very unique in the fact that they have elaborate ingredients on each dish. Example: Camaron - shrimp, roasted garlic, avocado , chipotle mojo. Carne asada-epazote & oregano marinated skirt steak, watercress jicama slaw, Serrano roasted garlic aioli, crispy shallots. Overall, I am a big fan of their food and their drinks. Service seems to go in either direction as I've had exceptional service(at the bar) and poor service ( dining room).  This is a very good local spot to wind down from the daily grind and prices are very affordable ($4 per taco-$11 for craft cocktail). I enjoy the ambience and the crowd is generally very friendly. Can't wait to come back.
