I agree with Tegan--not sure about the poor reviews.  We went last Sunday for lunch and the atmosphere, food and service were all top notch.  This is what I would describe as a social restaurant.  The tables are indeed close together, which encouraged conversation between guests, which everyone seemed to enjoy.  Can't wait to return for happy hour, where our served said margaritas are half off and tacos are 2 for $5.50.  The patio was gorgeous!
