Went back last night for industry night (30% off).  Same hostess as before but we scored a table on the patio. So nice! 

I ordered margaritas with heat (yummy again) and shrimp tacos. The girlfriend I went with is doing the Raw fitness challenge so I didn't want to eat a bunch of bad stuff in front of her, so I did what she did and ordered them in butter lettuce cups (it says right on the menu that you can sub out the tortillas for lettuce, which I appreciate in case I'm ever actually on a diet...makes you feel comfortable and normal). The sauce the shrimp comes in is super tasty!  They could've put a couple more pieces of shrimp in there but it was really yummy so I didn't mind. 

We got the salsa trio (chipotle, tomatillo, and habanero). The chipotle had the best flavor to me, but I liked the heat of the habanero. I ate all the tortilla chips...they're the kind I like, really thick with larger salt crystals. 


We will be back!
