Tuesday night is Industry Night! So half off your entire bill! Their cocktails are all very good. Only a few had the vodka option versus tequila. The Mac n Cheese is amazing, available only at dinner time tho. Good for big or small groups, easy to share items. Especially when ordering tacos, since you can't mix n match.
