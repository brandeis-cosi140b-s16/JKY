My wife and I finally found an opportunity to try Mercadito in Red Rock Casino.  It was well worth the wait.  The hosts and hostesses were very friendly and our waitress was wonderful.  Our glasses were never lower than half full, the food came out hot and empty plates were taken away quickly.

The entire meal was great and everything we tried was full of flavor.  To begin the evening we ordered salsa and chips.  There are five salsas on the menu (as well as four varieties of guacamole) and we decided to share the tomatillo salsa before dinner.  Fresh and delicious.  The portion was relatively small when compared to many Mexican restaurants, but not too small.  We still had some left over to enjoy with our main courses.  The best part of this was we weren't tempted to eat too many chips.  They seem interested in ensuring you leave enough room to enjoy everything else you order, and there's no reason not to select a variety of choices from across the menu to share with your party.

The tacos came in fours and we shared two different styles: Pastor and Carne.  The Carne were perfectly prepared and the pieces of skirt steak were just the right size so that you could enjoy steak with every bite and topped with a variety of greens.  The pastor was just as good, slightly spicy and topped with grilled, diced pineapple and a chili salsa.  Both were fantastic.  We each also ordered a side of Elite Mexicano.  This side comes with two ears of corn.  Next time we'll order one to share and another side for additional variety.

For desert we shared Torrejas de Bolillo--essentially a Mexican bread pudding with a scoop of vanilla ice cream in the middle.  Just like everything else we tasted, this dish was full of flavor and perfectly prepared.  A great end to a great meal!

We'll definitely go back.  Probably soon!
