Pretty disappointed in our experience here. Service was awful, server was unprepared and shouldn't have been on the floor in my opinion. Food was okay but desperately under seasoned (bring your own salt and pepper shakers). Best things we had were the plantains and the small mixed salad. Note to restaurant: I'm sure it's your spiel, but please remind staff it's not a good idea to offer "shots" to a guest who is 8 months pregnant.
