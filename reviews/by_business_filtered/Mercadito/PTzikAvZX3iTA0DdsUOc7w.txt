After reading some reviews I decided ro go check this place out. Me an my wife waited about 8 minutes before the server came to the table. The menu was very limited so I ordered beef torta and the wife had the carne tacos. The waiter was kinda spacy, may have been gay, not sure but definitely seemed new at being a server. Anyways, food came and was not impressed with portion size or presentation.  All the food had no flavor and there was no salt, pepper, surgar ect at the table either. Fries was old and everything was very bland. The manager came to table  to see how everything was so I told him everything was band and he was eager to try to resolve but I did not want anything as I dont expect to be back. Was at the red rock casino location..
