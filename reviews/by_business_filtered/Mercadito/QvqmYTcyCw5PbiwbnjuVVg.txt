Ok,in fairness I returned not once , but twice. Both visits resulted in satisfactory experiences. Was so afraid that this place was losing their edge. Of course,as is par for the course, the manager asked me to come back and look him up. In order to keep things neutral I did not. Noticed that he was working very hard to keep things humming and the effort is paying off!
