Food fantastic, not that TEX MEX just amazing Mexican, the service was very attentive and seemed to really go out of their way to make sure we had FUN!!  Cant wait to return.   Our server was Tyler, and even without mentioning it he could tell something was a little off with one of my friends cocktails, he inquired and my friend said it was fine, then the manager came over he let us know fine is not good enough LOL he insisted on correcting the problem and made my friend feel incredibly special ( She keeps talking about it)  The way you recover form an issue even when there wasn't an issue can really set you apart!! We will be coming here at least once a week if not more!! Since I have recently relocated to Las Vegas area..

Thank you Mercadito
