How do people not line up at the door for this brunch? Vegas loves all-you-can drink brunches and this is the best. 
We came in at 11 (first people there-ha!) and had Bryan as our server. He explained the different menu choices and we decided on the 3 dishes with unlimited drinks. I should be embarrassed by this but we had a babysitter and a DD so...I'm not. 
It was a really great time, we had huevos rancheros, swordfish tacos, and the chorizo omelette. I loved everything besides the swordfish but I think that was my fault for ordering them as I'd never had swordfish before. It left a lingering fishy taste in my mouth. My husband liked them a lot and Bryan was more than happy to get us something else, but I didn't think they warranted that. Nice of him to offer though. The Bloody Mary was awesome as were the speciality mixed drinks. Bryan started getting slammed with tables about half-way through (Super Bowl Sunday) but he never disappeared, ignored us, or rushed us out which is unusual in my past Vegas brunch experiences. 
Come here for brunch! You'll love it.
