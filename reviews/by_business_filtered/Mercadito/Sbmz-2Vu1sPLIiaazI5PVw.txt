Modern Mexican for sure. We started with salsa trio and chips. We also ordered mango guacamole. Guacamole was mediocre and very small portion for $13. We tried all 5 salsas, not one disappointed. They were so tasty, however they lacked the heat. Understandingly, bcuz restaurant clients want the flavor without the heat. Regardless, they were bombtastic! 

My husband order the pancita and short rib tacos. Granted they were tiny street style tacos, but he couldn't stop raving about how soft and tender, not at all over-seasoned. 

I ordered the chile relleno minus the meat. It wasn't breaded like a traditional chile relleno. It was filled with Oaxacan & chihuahuan cheeses, both creamy and salty, great combo. Plate also came with a side or black beans, yum, and white rice (nothing special).

We both ordered margaritas, small, but jam packed with flavor plus they were strong! 

Service was exceptional. Our waiter was so attentive and friendly. Make a reservation just in case, it tends to get busy.
