5 stars to Mercadito - great value! 
Our group went on  Tuesday - looks like us service industry folks get 50% off!

Drinks:
We all tried various cocktails and margaritas in their menu. All drinks were well balanced and had great flavor! The "Little Market" cocktail with chile guajillo, pineapple and tequila was my personal favorite. 

Chips / Salsa / Guac:
We tried a little of everything. Good flavor overall - the pineapple guacamole was my absolute favorite! and the tomatillo salsa was amazing as well.

Entres: 
We all only got tacos - so I can't speak for the rest of the menu but it the overall food quality is on par with our meal - I'm sure it's amazing!
I had the langosta (lobster). Extremely fresh and flavorful! Between the rest of our party we basically had everything there is to offer taco-wise. Everyone was pleased with the overall food quality.

Overall - I would say Mercadito is great! And it's an amazing added bonus, the phenomenal specials they run Tuesday nights.
