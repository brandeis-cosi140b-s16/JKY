I went here recently with a group of 7 and were seated pretty quickly. There's a big selection of different Mexican foods. I ordered elote and chicken nachos. Both were really delicious. Some of my friends ordered tacos and everyone seemed to enjoy everything. Only bad thing that was ordered was one drink called the tourista that my friend got, it tasted nasty but the waitress claimed it was her favorite.  *shrugs* Service was good overall. They serve food family style, but one plate really is enough for one person.
