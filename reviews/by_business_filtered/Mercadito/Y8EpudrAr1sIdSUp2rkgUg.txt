I am blown away by some of the unnecessarily harsh reviews of Mercadito. It seems like people either love it or hate it. I live close by and have eaten there about 5 times. They have great food and I have never had an issue with the service. Honestly, the complaints seem silly. "It's too spicy, too saucy, small portions".....just stick to Del Taco, people!! Also, they do have a kids' menu and the complaints about the prices seem ridiculous considering you are dining inside a casino. I have no affiliation with this restaurant, by the way.
