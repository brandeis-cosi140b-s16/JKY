Mescal margarita was great but it really pisses me off when restaurants or bars "round off" the check amount at your expense and the bartenders don't bother to tell you about it. We noticed that just now after being short changed and when we brought it up to the bartender she made it seem like it's a totally normal thing to do and was actually very unprofessional about it. She made US feel like idiots and like we are cheap for asking. "Oh I can give you your small change if you Really want it" 
"Oh really?! You will?! Even after you just told us that you don't carry coins in your register?" 

I get that some places do this, I myself have bartended in many shady Eastern European and Middle Eastern bars that do this: but I am pretty sure that this is against FTC ethical practices. You do this do 5,000 people in a week or month, short change them by .40-.50 cents and you've made an extra 2.5 grand. I'm not okay with that at all. The principal and ethics are in question. I've been in this business for a long time and I would never do something like that, even if the company demands to (which, I can't imagine any ethical business doing so).
