Let me make it clear that this is not a Roberto's or tacos el Gordo or a previously closed, painted, conditioned old building turned into taqueria, so don't expect to find two dollar tacos at this place. What you will find are some of the best, tastiest and juicyest soft tacos you've ever tried this side of la linea. (Border)
   This is an upscale modern Mexican restaurant, nice hip marble top bar and some very nice original art pieces throughout the restaurant. A nice patio area with rattan furniture and giant parasols for a nice outdoor dining experience.

  Sat at the bar and service was decent. This time I got the espada (swordfish) tacos and the ceviche mixto, both items were on the miniature size but the flavors were grande! not enough to fill me up but just enough to be satisfied. Can't wait to try so many other options on the menu that sounded very promising. 

  Back to value..It is kind of odd sitting at the bar at a Mexican restaurant order some drinks and not being offered chips and salsa, and even though cheap food shouldn't be expected here, with prices being a little bit over the comfort zone for tacos throwing in some complimentary chips and salsa shouldn't kill you, but skimping might, besides no restaurant ever in the history of Mexican restaurants ever charged extra for salsa! That's like the taco law, free salsa for all tacos.

 The good and the reason for 4 stars... Happy hour is between 4 to 6 pm on weekdays and also late happy hour from 10 to 12am, also on Tuesdays they offer 50% off for all industry employees, automatically turning Tuesdays into my most anticipated day of the week surpassing Game of Thrones Sundays.
 They advertise as being the best thing that came out of Mexico after Salma Hayek. I could think of many other things, but is 4 20 am and I have to get to bed.

 See you on Tuesdays or on happy hours... I'll bring my own DelScorcho salsa.
