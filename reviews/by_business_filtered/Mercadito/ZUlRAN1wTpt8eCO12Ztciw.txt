Very reminiscent of these "Modern Mexican" places that continue to pop up and end up shutting down in less than a year. First off, the seating is horrendous. All the tables for 2 are half booth, except the booth is connected to everyones table, and the tables are literally 1.5 feet away from each other. I had to scoot my table to the side to get out, and with that I almost knocked over 2 drinks. Point is, if you're looking to have any type of privacy/conversation don't go here.

For the food, very expensive for the quality of food. I was almost immediately irritated when I went to order the cheapest thing I could find (Tacos for 16$) and then I hear someone a couple tables down ordering off the "Happy Hour" menu. Seriously? We were never offered happy hour nor did we get that menu on our table. Once we asked for it, I saw the same tacos I was going to buy for half the price. I have a feeling if I didn't ask for the Happy Hour menu that they would have ended up charging me full price. Also, the chips and salsa are not free. Seriously?

I wouldn't consider myself cheap but I don't think I have ever been a "Mexican" restaurant (I've been to many) that I had to pay for chips & salsa.

I also ordered elote. You know that Mexican corn with mayo, cheese, and chili? I'd like to think it's pretty difficult to mess that up, but they did. They chard the corn first, so half of it was black, and tasted burnt. The nasty burnt parts completely covered up the taste of the other ingredients (although there were barely any mayo/cheese/chili to begin with). 

In the end, for (8) miniature tacos, guac, chips and salsa, and water, it was $40.00. I wouldn't be irritated at this number if I was satisfied but I left far from satisfied.
