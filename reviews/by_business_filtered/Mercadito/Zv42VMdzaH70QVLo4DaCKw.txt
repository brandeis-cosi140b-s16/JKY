Wow, they opened with a huge buzz and it has gotten bigger! Buuzzzzzz........
First, it's mucho exciting to have a Mexican joint at Red Rock! And one with a patio, to boot.
Agave and Dos Caminos, who both were located across the street recently, have been put to shame by Mercadito! 
Their signature fish tacos were very tasty, and the trio of guac and salsa made a great accompaniment! Tried the bacon guac, which is so good!
 Tacos are served 4 per order, and they encourage family style dining, but I'm not a fan of that. At happy hour, you can try 2 tacos for $5.50 or so and also partake in drink specials too!!!!!!
The carne asada tacos were very good too, and we also had the Mexican corn appetizer, which I really enjoyed and used as a taco topper. You heard it here first. 
The lobster tostada was good, but the lobster flavor was a little lost in the seasoning. It's served cold, and a great treat on a hot evening! 
Now, drinks..........really impressed with the Guave margarita!!!
Was one of the best margs ever! Fresh, flavorful and I got mine with the spicy salt garnish that elevates the presentation exponentially! 
We had the coconut and the chocolate flan for dessert, and that was a great ending to one of the best Mexican meals I've had in Vegas!
Ole.
