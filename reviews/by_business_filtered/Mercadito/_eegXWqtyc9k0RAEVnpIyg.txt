Popped in to check out the happy hour specials.  The drink was pretty good, pineapple and tequila.  The guacamole and fresh chips were great too but the bartender sucked.  Super unfriendly, uninterested and a total dud.  The HH specials are nothing special, not cheap.  Very limited menu items.  Super disappointing.  Too bad because location is prime and it's a pretty space.
