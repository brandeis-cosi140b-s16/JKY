First time here, but I definitely don't think I'll be back.  The service was very slow.  Which wasn't a deal breaker, but with four people in the restaurant I expected a little more.

We came in for brunch, and we all work in the restaurant industry so we NEVER send food back.  That said, 3 of the four in our group were really surprised with the food quality and sent our food back.  

The people I was with said it's usually very good.  According to the server there was a new chef.  Maybe if we make it back again hopefully it will be better.

On the upside...the mimosas were great!  And the people were very nice!!
