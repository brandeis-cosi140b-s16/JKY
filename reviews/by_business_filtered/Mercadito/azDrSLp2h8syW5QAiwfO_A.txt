I read some of the reviews & was hoping for the best, with that said I feel like this place has tremendous potential. 
The atmosphere is a lot of fun, colorful artwork all over which I always appreciate, natural & warm furniture, loud & lively & a beautiful outdoor space. It was busy when we arrived so I was happy to see it was popular! The hostesses looked a little overwhelmed & luckily the manager or sup on duty assisted us, waited about 10 mins. 
The seating was terrible, by far the worse part of the experience. We were sat in a section that was on top of each other & couldn't even slide our asses into the seat in between the tiny tables (I have no ass). To the left was a family of 3 somewhere from the South & possibly the loudest bunch in the entire restaurant & to the right was a mother with her daughter arguing. It felt like we were dining with all of them. Awful & annoying. Fix that terrible seating area!!!
The server was very friendly & everyone who delivered plates to our table were also very nice. The food is expensive & if I'm paying $4.50 for street corn I expect better seating. Our Mahi Mahi tacos lacked flavor & the traditional guacamole was bland. The chef needs to kick up the Mexican flavors my mouth was craving. Now the good stuff, my pineapple margarita was very refreshing & we enjoyed the queso with short ribs & I enjoyed all the different salsas & chips were fresh. Our dessert was almost perfect, crispy on top & very creamy but cold on the bottom :( just needed to be heated a little longer. 
The food presentations were nice & I always appreciate a creative & clean plate. Work on some of the food & fix the bad seating area we were in & I believe this place will be amazing.
