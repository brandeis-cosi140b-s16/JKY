Phenomenal! Red rock has tried a Mexican restaurant in the past, and it failed. However, this time they've outdone them-self. Mercadito is an amazing establishment with outstanding food. The pollo a las brasas was executed perfectly. The chicken was tender and packed with flavor. Next, the chicken flauntas. The chicken was flavorful and well cooked and they were the ideal level of crispiness. We went on a Friday night and it was packed. That didn't stop our friendly server, Tyler, from providing prompt and courteous service. The food arrived quickly and tasted amazing! To top it all off, their torrejas de bolillo (the best desert you will ever eat in your entire life) was incredible. Well done Mercadito, well done!
