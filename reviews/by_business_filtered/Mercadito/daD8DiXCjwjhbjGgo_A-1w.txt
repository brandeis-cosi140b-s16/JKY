Was excited to see Mexican food back at Red Rock. Went early evening and sat at the bar. The decor is nice as is the patio. Sat in the bar but the music was deafening. Ordered a  a regular margarita. It came in the smallest glass, was ok but way too sweet. When I asked our server she agreed but said they were all too sweet. No chips and salsa unless you pay for it. Ordered some guacamole, it was the best part of the meal but small portion with a tiny side of chips. The plates were 5" x 5" barely big enough to put anything on. Shared the shrimp enchiladas which came on a regular sized plate, but when asked for another larger plate was told by our server she wasn't supposed to give out any larger plates but would since they weren't too busy. Those tiny plates couldn't hold anything but a couple of chips. Way pricey with tiny portions and plates. Gave it a try but won't be back.
