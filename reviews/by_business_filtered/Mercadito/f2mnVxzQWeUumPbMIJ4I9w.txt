I had dinner with my buddy after the gym.  lol.  We were under dressed for the occasion.  I like this place.  It's a cozy, semi dimly lit atmosphere that plays EDM music in the background.  

Great place to take a girl on the first date.  It was a Monday night at the place was decent busy.  The plates are small and meant to share.  Pretty decent quality and the prices were kinda high for what we got...but i'm not complaining.  

I would definitely go here again and maybe do some gambling afterwards.
