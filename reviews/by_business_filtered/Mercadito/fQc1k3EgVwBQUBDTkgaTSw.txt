Great tacos & margs combined with a decent Happy Hour make this place a top pick at Red Rock! 
Awesome patio too.
I really enjoyed doing the All You Can Eat Tacos twice. Not sure if they still do that as their specials and happy hour change often. Most of the taocs I tried were very good and a few such as the pork belly and the shrimp stood out. The guava margarita was awesome and the red sangria is so tasty too! 
Brunch is relatively new and last I saw they included all you can drink mimosas.
