Went there for a going away party...service was... wait what service... Went to the bar to get drinks because our server was no where to be found... three people from our party walk up to an empty bar... 4 bar tenders are in a huddle... not paying any attention to anything... 10 minutes go by... one of the girls walks over takes the order n.. then walks away.. didn't make one drink... sad... we are the only people at the bar...odd.. 5 minutes more hours by... then a second bar  tender arrives takes the order... then starts making drinks... 2 shots one Jameson on the rocks and a house margarita poured from there wall of house margaritas... another 5 minutes... and this continued throughout the night... bad service.... what food never seen or server to order so... I'll not be back... Good luck... with that poor service...
