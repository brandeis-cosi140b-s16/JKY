Drinks are amazing here! Food is good though sometimes I lose my appetite during meals here b/c most of the dishes are sweet as opposed to savory. So I normally won't eat a lot when I go here, I get sick of the sweet flavors before I can finish my plate. Great place for appetizers and drinks. Also very cute ambience and interior design. Customer service is good as well.
