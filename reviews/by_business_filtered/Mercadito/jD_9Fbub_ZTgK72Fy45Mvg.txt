It took several months, but I finally popped in for HH  as suggested by the management response to my original review. The Red Rock parking lot was packed but here we were only one of two tables, which should have been enough of a clue. Frankly, I should have just stuck with the original visit. Went in with a few coworkers and no one was impressed. 

Food was just lackluster. HH tacos are $3, with a few additional options for $4. They're small and for the most part, bland. The much-hyped carnitas were missing any sort of wow factor, while the swordfish contained a decent portion but no discernible seasonings. The nachos ($7, + $3.5 to add shrimp) were covered in various sauces but had no spice whatsoever, and the shrimp were small and cold. Plantains were just fine, but heads up that gluten-free folks should steer clear of the dipping sauce.

Service was embarrassingly slow. I don't know if our server was new (didn't seem to be) or just generally scatterbrained, but she seemed to frequently forget that she had a table. We had to ask a busser to let her know we were ready to order, then when we had a question about whether a dish contained gluten, she disappeared for 15 minutes. We actually got an answer from another employee before she came back (and still didn't have an answer). I don't mind how the dishes come out as they're ready, but when three people order several tacos that aren't separated into individual plates or orders, it gets unnecessarily complicated for both the food runners (who are clueless as to who ordered what) and the diners (who then have to touch one another's finger-food).
