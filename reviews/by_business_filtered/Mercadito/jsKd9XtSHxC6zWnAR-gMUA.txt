I came here on a Friday night at 6:30; the first thing I notice was how busy it was and the small space. Our reservation was at 6:45, but we got seated at 7:00.  About a 15-minute wait but you could tell everyone was working very hard diligently and I wasn't in a rush. Once seated, someone gave us water but we didn't see our waitress until about 10 minutes later. Again it was busy so I understood, once we ordered the drinks they came pretty quick. I ordered the cucumber-lime agua fresca and it seriously made me feel like I was back in Mexico relaxing. Next we ordered mango guac, super fresh and yummy and came out quickly. The guac does come with a side of salsa. My date and I both ordered tacos, him pollo and I ordered carne. However his came out at least 10 minutes before mine, so that was awkward. BUT the tacos are fresh and amazing and great. I didn't feel guilty after eating them because they have this nice light feeling it might be the jicama? Being Mexican I am constantly judging and comparing tacos, but these were great. The staff was attentive while being busy. I don't understand why the reviews are so low. Yes the music is loud, but you're yelling everyone's yelling, it's a good time. I will be coming back!
