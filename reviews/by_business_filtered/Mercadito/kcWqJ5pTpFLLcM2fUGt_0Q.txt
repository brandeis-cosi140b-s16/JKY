Love this place. The tasting menu (which you have to specifically request) is a lot of bang for your buck and gives you the chance to try a lot of different items for a reasonable price. Great guacamole, salsas, the Habanero Mac and cheese and Mahi Mahi tacos are my favorite. Only complaint is that the shrimp taco is drowning in sauce and kind of skimpy on the shrimp itself and the chicken tacos were a bit bland. Service has always been pretty great with the exception of an occasional server who's a little too pushy with their own recommendations. We had one server that wanted to surprise us and order for us but when he gave a preview of what he would choose, it wasn't anything we wanted to try and he seemed annoyed when we politely passed on his offer. Overall, definitely worth a date night.
