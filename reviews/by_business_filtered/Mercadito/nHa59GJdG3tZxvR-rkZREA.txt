The food deserves 5 star.  Service maybe a 3 at most.  We dined here yesterday after my friend highly recommended this restauraunt.  I had a guava margarita which was GREAT and the shrimp tacos and the sweet potato guacamole which were both outstanding.  

Now to the service..

Our server was Nicole.  It was Cinco De Mayo so i'm sure they were busier than normal, however, upon taking our order she randomy walked away.  She came back and after we had already told her our orders we had to repeat them.  Upon bringing the drinks she couldnt remember who ordered what.  Our receipts were mixed up and to top it off upon leaving the restaurant she approached us asking if this credit card she had in her hand was ours.  Luckily for whoever the CC holder is we are good people and wouldn't take a card that wasn't ours but overall it was a very strange interaction. I will say though that I do drink a LOT of water and the men who fill up the water were on top of it which was fantastic.

I will definitely be back as the food was outstanding however I would hope the service would be better.
