Well this was a bit surprising.....  better than we expected.   The reviews are oddly low which makes us think they are trying to fix some of the issues. 

Tonight we rolled in for happy hour, and the staff was very attentive, the food excellent,  and promptly delivered.  We ended up trying most of the tacos and the flauta, and loved them all.  The Carne Asada was really a standout.  The cocktails were solid, and the Misty Sleeve cocktail was great.  

I think for a relaxed atmosphere with great food, this place really has things going in the right direction.  The manager worked the room like a professional,  not only greeting guests but also making sure the customers have what they need. 

Something else, the staff does not hide in the back.  They make constant rounds, filling drinks, chips, and taking care of the  details.  I'm a sucker for service, and this place has it.

Finally a special thanks to Lanie; she was great.! When you stop by, ask to be in her section.  

We will be back for sure.
