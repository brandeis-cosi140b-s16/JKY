Love this place! I've been to the Chicago location, now the Vegas location, and am anxiously awaiting the Philly location. I had the hongo tacos which as a vegetarian I loved. My boyfriend had the swordfish and mahi mahi tacos and said both were good. The margaritas were strong and hit the spot. I recommend the hongo tacos and margaritas! Now hurry up and open up the Philly location please!
