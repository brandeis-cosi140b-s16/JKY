I didn't get to go to the Elite Event at Mercadito, boo-hoo, so this was my virgin visit.  We came for Happy Hour straight from the wine tasting one restaurant over.  We weren't that hungry, and I was tipsy from the alcohol overload of the little bit of wine I'd just had, so I didn't order a drink.  But hubby ordered a Big Nose, and it was really tasty. 

We both had the HH tacos - he had the chicken, and it was sooo good with all the crunchy stuff on top, which was probably the brussel sprouts slaw.  I got the shrimp tacos, and I loved, loved, loved them!  The downside is that I think two little street taco-sized bites for $7.50 is a little overpriced.  Really loved the chips here, which are thicker than most.  That made them extra crunchy, and crunch is one of my basic food groups.  I try to stay away from them at other places, usually taking one or two and breaking them into tiny pieces to make them last.  But at this place I just couldn't stop eating them.  The old advertising line "Bet you can't eat just one" takes on new meaning here.

What made our visit so much fun was our waiter, Xavier.  Mercadito wasn't crowded, so he spent a lot of time at our table, and we bantered back and forth endlessly, having a great time.  Oh, and he was a terrific server, too.  I hope he sticks around for a long time, because he will be my waiter of choice whenever I go, like probably a week from now!
