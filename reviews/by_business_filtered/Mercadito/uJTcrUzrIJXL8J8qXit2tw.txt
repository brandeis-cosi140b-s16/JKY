Been to Mercadito's a number of times and had an enjoyable meal. Not so yesterday. Ordered the mahi mahi tacos and the mac and cheese (a must have).

A few hours later I got sooooo sick. Puked three times and then a 4th with dry heaves. The next morning, incredibly, I puked AGAIN. This one came on suddenly and much of it went on the floor. Never had such a miserable experience.

Called there today, spoke with Manager, Louis, who showed genuine concern. Told me to ask for him next time I came in. It will be a long long time before I ever go back. Probably never. 

Other visits have been fine, good food and service, but one experience like this will likely ruin things forever as far as I'm concerned.
