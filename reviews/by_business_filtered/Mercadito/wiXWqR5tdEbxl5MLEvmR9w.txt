It's not "traditional Mexican food" in the sense that the portions are small and the prices aren't cheap, but the flavors in Mercadito are absolutely outstanding. It's well worth the trip and the little extra money for the savory tacos, delicious salsas (the unlimited 3 salsa and chips are a must), and delectable cocktails. Definitely recommend the blackened swordfish tacos, and the hibiscus cocktail. Brought my boyfriend here once, and it's a monthly tradition now. Decide for yourself, but you won't be sorry to try this place out! Industry nights are popping but they have happy our everyday. Think I'll go today in fact ;-).
