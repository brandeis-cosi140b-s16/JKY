It's pretty much perfect for takeout. I don't see a whole lot of consistency. My boyfriend called one night to place a take out order with no issue. I called a few nights later and they wouldn't do a food order. I had to walk into the bar area and place my order then wait like some damned dirty ape. Just kidding, not a huge deal because we were already there but I don't understand why they can't get on the same page. I'm just glad I didn't have to deal with the doucheface manager again like my previous post.
