Been here with my chef friend.
The server is very energetic, and I can tell this restaurant is under good management! 
We ordered two order of tacos and some appetizer( hard to remember their Mexican name). The fish taco is crispy, and the pork belly taco is tender, but I don't really enjoy their shrimp salad in a sour base ( feel not so fresh).

We have been offered complimentary desert, it tastes like egg pudding with coconut!

I enjoy their ambience, and I think I will try them again in the future.
