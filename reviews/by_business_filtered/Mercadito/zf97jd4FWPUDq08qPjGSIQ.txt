Typical casino restaurant: high priced and low quality. In a nutshell: both food and decor are tasteless. I ordered three things and was unhappy/disappointed with all of them for the same reason: NOTHING IS MADE HOW YOU EXPECT IT TO BE, BUT THEIR VERSION SUCKS. The ceviche was overcooked boiled shrimp (instead of cooked in lemon juice and spices) tossed in tomatoes. NO SALT. NO LEMON JUICE. NO FLAVOR. I had them take it back. I orders 4 tacos carne asada. NO PICO DE GALLO, NO SALT, NO LEMON. FLAVORLESS. It was smoked meat with bland Mexican cream, bland hicama, bland greens. The third was my drink, which I know a Cadillac Margarita is supposed to have an expensive liquor floating on top called Grand Marnier. No such thing. It came they said "in the margarita premixed."  Bullshit, you're paying for something you aren't even getting. Oh and the decor IS NOT COLORFUL AND FUN. The main colors of the restaurant were browns and tans, gives the place a very upscale feel...but then they seemed confused about what to hang on the walls because some artwork matched the interior nicely, and some was super bright tasteless paintings of flowers and graffiti.
