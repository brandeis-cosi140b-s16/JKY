Having recently moved from Chicago, my husband and I were so excited to see Mercadito move into a new space at Red Rock (which is conveniently near our home). And they haven't disappointed. Mercadito has quickly become our go to mexican restaurant spot, especially on 50% industry night :)  I will say, they got off to a rocky start between new servers, the patio construction, and some apparent reservation hiccups, but they seemed to have worked it out. So I'm a bit surprised by all the mediocre reviews. 

Food wise: the chicken tacos and shrimp tacos are both AMAZING. The quesadillas are delish but I would stay away from the ceviche - it's not so much a traditional ceviche as a chunky weird non-cerviche version of ceviche. But hands down, the tastiest thing to order on the menu is the bread pudding (called torrejas de bolillo). It is a must order!!!!
