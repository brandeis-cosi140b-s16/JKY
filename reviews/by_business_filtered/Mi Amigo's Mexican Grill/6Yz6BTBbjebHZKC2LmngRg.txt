(Let me preface this review by saying that, being from Houston, I'm accustomed to eating authentic salsa, tacos, tamales, etc. My taste for Mexican food is most likely biased to a certain method or seasoning used around here.) 

My waitress was quick to take my drink order once I was seated, and was attentive and sweet. I drank a "Blue Amigo", their house marg that is $2.50 all day every day. It was a bit sweet for my taste, but still okay. 

Chips were great, but their "salsa" is what I know as pico de gallo. Luckily, I love pico, so it was all good. 

On to the food - I ordered the NÃºmero Tres, which is 2 beef or chicken tacos (I chose beef), rice, beans, and a cheese enchilada. First impression...this place makes a mean cheese enchilada. Like, GOOOOD. Their red gravy was probably the best I've ever had. Rice, delicious. Refried beans, amazing. Beef tacos...yuck. I can't help but think that the beef in these tacos tasted like dog food smells. It was more of a shredded beef...bland...and just had an overall odd taste. I only ate about 3/4 of a taco and called it a night. I'm used to well-seasoned ground beef tacos, and these were just bizarre, in my opinion. 

Overall, great place! I would visit again next time I'm in Phoenix, bull I'll probably stay away from the beef.
