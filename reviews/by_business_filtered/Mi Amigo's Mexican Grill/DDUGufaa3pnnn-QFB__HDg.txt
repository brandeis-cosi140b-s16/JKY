After a long day volunteering for a nerd convention, was looking for a meal to fill me up.  This place was right across the street from hotel. Great choice. I had red chile chimichanga and my wife had the ribs. Only CON was that CON had just closed for the evening and nerds flooded the place causing a shortage of Mr. Pibb and delayed our meal since they were so busy.  I overheard staff talking to manager about running out of other items on menu.  Staff was pretty happy about closing early because of it.  I don't blame them!  We'll be back when the next nerd herd comes along!
