The chips and salsa were pretty good.  The salsa a little on the spicy side, which I like.  The chips were too big though.

I ordered the "numero tres", which had 2 beef tacos and a cheese enchilada.  Both were tasty.  The beef could have used more seasoning or smoething for more flavor.

The service was great, although when I went in around 6pm on a Tuesday it was slow.
