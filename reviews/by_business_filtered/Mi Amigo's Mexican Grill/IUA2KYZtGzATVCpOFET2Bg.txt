I've had their food before and it was very good and last night wasn't exactly an exception.  My issue is that my 8 year old had their chicken fingers, which I tried and were quite tasty.  After our meal my son stated he felt ill, and this morning woke up with a mild case of food poisoning.  I will be avoiding this place for the foreeable future.  This is unfortunate, as their enchiladas are delicious but I simply will not risk my son getting sick again.  Sorry Mi Amigos, your apparent lack of food preparation cleanliness has lost you customer.
