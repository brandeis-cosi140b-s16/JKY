Once again, I ordered carne asada expecting the meat to be flavorful, well seasoned and cooked to perfection.  Once again, it was a chewy, mediocre seasoned piece of meat. I hedged my bet and order a couple of enchiladas ala carte.  At least those were tasty.

Service was kind of roller coastery.  The server took my drink order immediately and gave me a few minutes to peruse the menu.  Food came relatively promptly.

When she brought the bill, well she decided it was time to do a deep cleaning of the bar area while I sat and played solitaire on my phone.  Finally she came by only because she was dropping an order off at the table behind me.

The place was 3/4 empty, but I can attribute this to being 8pm on a Sunday night in downtown Phoenix.  In fact most of the mall was deserted and restaurants closed.

I end with one suggestion.  Lower the freekin light that is hanging over the table.  Nothing worse that having to catch the glint of a halogen bulb burning your eyes while you eat.
