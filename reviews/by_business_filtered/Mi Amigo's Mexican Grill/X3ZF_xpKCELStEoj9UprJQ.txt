Went for lunch on a Thursday with some co-workers.
One was from Florida the other Canada. 
They both really liked it. 
It was the third visit by one of them. My first.

I ordered the Chili Rellano. A large Pablano pepper stuffed with chunks of chicken and typical fillings. It was dipped and fried in a panko bread crumb -like batter which I really liked compared to the "traditional" egg batter. It was thin and light. Great tasting to. 
Service was excellent. I was never left wanting for a refill of my tasty beverage and they kept the salsa and hot sauces full as well as the tortilla chips. The chips were good too. They were light and tasted fresh. Not the out-of-a-bag corn chips.
I will be back.
