After paying to park at the weak excuse of a mall that this place is located in we figured we might as well at least try to get our parking moneys worth so we stopped in and ordered up a couple margaritas to ease the pain of being bamboozled. I've definitely had better drinks and I've definitely had worse. Can't speak for the food here but I definitely wouldn't be running back for happy hour or any other hour for that matter to throw one back.
