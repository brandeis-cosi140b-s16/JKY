All mexican restaurants need to be evaluated on two levels - how's the food and how's the margaritas.  And if the second one rates anything above 'fantastic', the rating on the former matters not. I should really end the review here and now by telling you that the margaritas at Mi Amigos were exsquisite.  We would have asked for to go cups and grabbed one for the road were such things permissable.

Everything else about the place was good as well.  Not overly expensive, service was fine, the outdoor patio was nice - even if we were subjected to the oldies radio blaring from the Uno's patio next door. My shredded beef burro was a little dry and not spicy enough for my taste, but it was still more than servicable.  And let's be honest, no spice and stale tortillas couldn't keep me away from this place's tasty concoctions.  Viva la margarita!
