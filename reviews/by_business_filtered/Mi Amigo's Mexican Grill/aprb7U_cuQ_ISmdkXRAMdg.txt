Hours listed on Yelp last night shows Mi Amigos closed at 11pm. A group of us ,driving 4 separate cars parked and paid for parking at the Arizona Center. We arrived around 10:25pm and were all told they were closed. When we told them about the hours, they said it was for a different location.  The food here is just gringo Mexican anyways and service is sub standard but they listed they were opened and others showed closed. I won't  be going back.
