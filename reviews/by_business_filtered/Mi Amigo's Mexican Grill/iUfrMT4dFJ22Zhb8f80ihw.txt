Interesting place. Wanted a quick bite to eat before heading to the movies. Was seated pretty quickly. No muss no fuss I presume.

I had the tortilla soup and the grilled chicken tacos. Everything was just meh. Not truly flavorful, nothing truly distinct. I had hoped for more, but I came up kind of short. The waiter was super sweet and attentive, so I did appreciate that!

Would I be back.. probably not.
