Don't eat here when it's busy. We are in town for a convention and the line was out the door so we were expecting a short wait. Instead they seated us immediately so we were happy with that! Except we sat down and no one even fretted us and we didn't get a glass of water. Finally after about 30 minutes we just got up and left. If you sit people you must have the ability to serve them! If we would have been told when checking in that there was a 30-45 minutes wait we could have made an informed decision to either wait or go to one of the other restaurants in the area! Thanks for the dehydration and sunburn!
