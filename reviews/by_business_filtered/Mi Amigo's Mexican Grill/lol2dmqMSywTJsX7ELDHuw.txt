Don't eat the fish tacos, my wife was up all night with intestinal distress. We told the waitress they tasted fishey. She assured us it was the highest quality Mahi Mahi. Rice and beans are average. I had the carnie asaida, it was good. It was a piece of beef 9"by 6" and 1/4" thick, rice and beans. Nothing special.
