I went a few weeks ago during Phoenix Comic Con.  It was far enough away to not be swarmed with people.  We were really hungry so the free chips and salsa brought out was nice.  I got the chicken chimichanga plate.  It was okay.  It was fulfilling and plenty of food.   The price is similar to what you get other places downtown.   The server bumped this rating from 3 stars to 4 stars.  She was pleasant and efficient.  I appreciated that she brought out the checks quickly because we want to get back to our event.
