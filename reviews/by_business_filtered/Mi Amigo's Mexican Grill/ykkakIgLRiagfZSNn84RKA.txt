Staying as airline crew at the Sheraton hotel across the street, I asked the front desk person to recommend me a good Mexican restaurant.  He recommended the "Canyon Café" which is in the same exact mall/movie complex as this place, "Mi Amigo's " .  I reviewed the Canyon Café's menu and didn't care for it since it's more of a Fusion restaurant, not real Mexican food.  I told the hostess that I wanted more authentic food and she told me to try "Mi Amigo's" . I walked 100 feet to this place.  I have to say the server was a sweetheart...very friendly, welcoming - THAT's the ONLY thing I liked about this place, aside from the Cadillac Margarita for $5.75.  I ordered the tortilla soup.  OKish; free chips and salsa - the chips were awesome, the salsa mediocre.  The worst disappointment was my main course - I ordered the Red Beef Tamales.  These are the worst tamales that I remember eating.  I can make them better myself at home!! And I am an awful cook!  I was joined by one of our flight attendants and he joined me at my table.  He pretty much reached the same concensus as I.  Sorry, but I really, really was looking forward to a nice, hot tasty Mexican meal.  I was in Arizona for crying out loud, not in North Dakota or Maine, where Mexican food may not be as widespread.   PLEASE get your menu and most importantly your ingredients in order!  My colleagues at my airline stay across the street at the Sheraton and would appreciate a nice Mexican meal on our work trips.   Thanks !!
