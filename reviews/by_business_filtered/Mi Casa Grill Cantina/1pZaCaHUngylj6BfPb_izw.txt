After jumping around experiencing other casino based mexican joints, Mi Casa wins the Sombrero for BEST IN CLASS MEXICAN!  

You can't beat the value of $2 street tacos, and happy hour prices on food all the time at the bar.  This is our go-to mexican food place.

Service is what it is, not great, not terrible.  Equal to what you would find an any other casual dining establishment.  

Food is fairly consistent and a great value.  We haven't had anything we disliked.  

While not the most authentic place in Las Vegas, its definitely very solid mexican food.  Will continue to go back on a regular basis.
