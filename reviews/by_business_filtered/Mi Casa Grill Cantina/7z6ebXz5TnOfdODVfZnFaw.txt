We've been here several times over the years. The food is always solid. I don't think I would call any of it exceptional or over the top awesome, but we've never had a bad meal there. We will continue to go back when in the mood for good burritos, or fajitas, or whatever looks good on the menu to us that day. 
I'm also a fan of their hot sauce that comes with the chips, and if you're there early enough a few half price margaritas for happy hour always hits the spot!
