I keep coming back to Mi Casa time and time again, and I always walk away conflicted. This place has so many bad aspects, but yet so many great ones as well.

Service in the bar area is downright terrible. It's as if Mi Casa only hires bartenders and cocktail servers with below average time management skills. This is especially obvious during happy hour when you can almost see the shock on the bartenders' faces when the foot traffic starts to pick up. Mi Casa has amazing margaritas and great prices on those margaritas. The trick is simply getting one in your hands. It's going to take a while. Especially during happy hour. This applies to the servers in the bar area as well. Once you actually get one to wait on you I would recommend ordering multiple drinks. I have no doubt you'll be pleased with the quality of your beverage, but you never know when you'll be getting another. The servers always seem more overwhelmed than the bartenders do. 

Being sat in the dining room always confuses me as well. You could walk up to the hostess and you can literally count maybe 4 or 5 tables of patrons, however the hostless always says the wait will be between 20-45 minutes. I don't understand how this can be on a Monday evening when it's obvious they're not busy. Is there only one line cook working? Is there only one waitress on staff?

I've been coming to Mi Casa for years, and the examples above aren't based on one time experiences. That being said you might wonder why I keep coming back. The answer is simple: the food is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. The burritos are a can't miss, the enchiladas are wonderful, and the trio of salsas they give you with their chips are unbelievable.

I wasn't surprised at all when I saw the average review is 3-stars, which is a shame because this place has 5-star potential if they would only up their service a bit.
