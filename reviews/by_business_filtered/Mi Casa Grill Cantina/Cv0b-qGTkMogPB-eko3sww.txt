I have been to eat here several times and each time I think, "Man this place wasn't that great last time, why are we here again?" I think its the fact that it is usually not busy compared to buffet, where-if you are patient, you can score a great deal.

 Like other reviewers have said, the chips and salsa are very good, but most other items are average. The fajitas are a good deal if you split them, but they will only bring you about 2-3 corn tortillas per order. The service has been slow most times and I think it is a bit pricey but prices are on par with most casino restaurants.

A couple of high points; the decor is awesome-it really reminded me of Pueblo Bonito resorts in Mexico (trust me, it's cool), and the mole. Mole is hit and miss, and Mi Casa's is a hit for sure. 

So, go for lunch and order the mole.
