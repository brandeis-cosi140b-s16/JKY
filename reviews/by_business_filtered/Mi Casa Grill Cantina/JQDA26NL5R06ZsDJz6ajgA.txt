I dine at Mi Casa a few times a year because it's convenient and they run great specials that are constantly changing. The current deal is $10 for 3 tacos and a house margarita. Having said that, it's just not that great of a restaurant. 

First off, the space is huge. The decor is beautiful and the atmosphere is fantastic, but the cavernous space is so big that most of it goes to waste (I've never ONCE seen any activity in the open tortilla kitchen; the place just gave up on making fresh tortillas. Sad). They always clam to have a 'wait' even if only a few tables are full. I think this is a casino ploy / policy so you'll drop some money in the slots while you wait. 

Don't plan to have a quick meal here because the service is notoriously atrociously slow. I'm talking waiting 15 minutes to be acknowledged, not getting refills on your drinks, and sitting around for 20 minutes after repeatedly asking for the check. This is, sadly, the norm at Mi Casa. I don't know if they don't have enough servers or what, but I've never had good service at this restaurant (and I've been dining here since they first opened)! 

The food can be hit or miss. As with most casino restaurants, the food is really overpriced. Expect to pay $15 - $18 for mediocre fajitas with tiny portion sizes. I've had good meals here and I've had awful meals here. The kitchen does appetizers well so you can't really go wrong with the queso, avocado fries (one of my favorite menu items), chips with salsa, or simple fare like cheese quesadillas. 

I'll continue to dine at Mi Casa because I know how slow and poor the service can be and I can plan for it. Go for the specials because they are a great value. Just be prepared to sit and wait...and wait some more.
