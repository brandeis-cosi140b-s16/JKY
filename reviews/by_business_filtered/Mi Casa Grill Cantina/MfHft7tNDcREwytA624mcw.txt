Speedy service, nice decor.  Wwnt on a wed night with the gf.  Server was there right away.  Sje got a strawberry margarita and I got a coke.  Saw a table in the eau in with street corn but didn't see it on the menu.  Ordered two for an app.  Came out right away.  Amazing.  I ordered the seafood enchiladas and the gf ordered the mushroom enchiladas.  The mushroom enchiladas were amazing.  The seafood ones just good.
