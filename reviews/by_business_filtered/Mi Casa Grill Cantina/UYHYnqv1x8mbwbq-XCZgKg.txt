I noticed the mixed reviews for this restaurant, I don't understand it. I met some friends there last night. The food and service was fantastic! We started with Margaritas by the pitcher (of course), and the four of us managed to drain two of them :-) 

Our waiter Ruben was attentive and friendly, he made sure we needed for nothing. 

We were fortunate to have Earl the room chef stop by the table. We asked for his recommendation, when he suggested the red snapper I was hesitant (I'm a bit of a fish snob, I usually only order in areas where it's caught). This dish was off the Hook! I can't express how completely satisfied I was. The fish was fresh and cooked to perfection, it was served on a bed of peppers and onions with grilled tomatoes and a dipping sauce on the side. The combination of flavors was unique and complimentary. I'm writing this review and just thinking about the experience I'm getting hungry, guess I gotta go back!
