This place gets 5 stars for the service and their tequila selection, however I've rated a 3-Star because I couldn't taste the food.  I am not the typical person to pour left-over salsa (from the chips and salsa) onto what I would expect to be spicy mexican food.  But I did, all of it.  I ordered the chicken empanadas and to be honest - I can't remember the other item, because it was really not worth remembering.  Everything just seemed so bland, even for me.  We also ordered the $35 Cadillac Margarita pitcher and got about 6 drinks out of it, which was a good deal, except, we weren't offered our tequila of choice,  As a result I think it was a cheap tequila, resulting in a gross 6 drinks.  Between 2 people, a little much for us. I would have rather ordered 2 premium tequila drinks a piece and done without the pitcher of gross tequila.  The only thing I really enjoyed about our meal was the dessert.  I ordered the mi casa banana (with ice cream) and that was yummy!
