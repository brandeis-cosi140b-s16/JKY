This is like a more expensive, less tasty version of Macayos. 

I went here with a group of about nine people, and even though six of the nine people were present, they didn't seat us until everyone was present.  Hmm, ok.  This was on a quiet Monday evening.

We're seated and I will give credit to the server as she was very pleasant and attentive.  There was rarely a time a beverage glass was empty. 

The food leaves a lot to be desired.  I had the carne asada taco plate with a side of guacamole.  It was as if nothing had any seasoning.  I understand Americanized Mexican food, I really do, and I did not go in here with the expectation of getting super-flavorful food, but I did expect some seasoning.  

I definitely won't choose to come back here.
