This place was very pleasant. Great atmosphere. Very family friendly for being in a casino. There is was at least 3 other families with strollers. The food was good. I highly recommend the avocado fries! Yummy! I ordered a bloody Maria and it was very good. The only down fall is that the hostess was so incredibly rude, when she sat us she threw down the menus and turned her nose up and walked away. But the rest of the staff we encountered were very nice
