Bad...just really bad.  
The place was empty and the service was bad.
The food was cold and bad.
The drinks were watery and bad.

Mexican food and margaritas are a very simple thing to do well.
To do anything this bad, takes time and lack of preparation.

I would go into much greater detail as to the comedy of errors that was my wife's birthday luncheon...but I won't bore you with the details.  
Except for this one detail that brings it all together...it was Sunday, Week 6 of the NFL, they forgot to change the channels for the 1 PM game and we listened to 15 minutes of infomercial rhetoric over their speaker system as we dined on cold, tasteless food.

5 X Cost of Roberto's / 1/3 as good as Roberto's = Really bad!!!
Scale...Roberto's = 3 Stars when reviewed intoxicated
