Ordered two of the same meals and my taco was not what I ordered. My friends taco was so spicy it burnt her mouth. Mine was so spicy I ordered milk. My carnitas taco was full of grittle. Wait staff tried to fix the issues but they can only fix so much. 

If you like super caliente food, then this place is for you.
