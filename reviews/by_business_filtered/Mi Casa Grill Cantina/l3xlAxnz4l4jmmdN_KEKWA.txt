I enjoyed this place 2 days ago because I met up with friends who noticed as of October 2011, they started a 25 cent taco and Corona special from 5-9pm on Mondays. The Coronas are small 7oz ones but ordering 2 of them is just 50 cents and 2oz more than your typical $2-3 12oz can/bottle of beer around town. The tacos also include pretty tasty chicken, beef or grilled fish, given the price. Catch this promo while it lasts as well as show up earlier because they did run out of the Coronas around 40 minutes prior to the end of the hour.

I didn't get to try the fajitas but they did smell good as usual when they came out (what doesn't smell bad when a  grilled sauteed garlic, onions and bell peppers come sizzling out!)

Good note: Silverton has decent free Wi-Fi internet. The phone reception kind of sucked that far in but the internet was good.

I also am not sure if Mi Casa still is part of that $1 all well drinks on Thursday evenings during that bar crawl at Silverton. Hope this helps.
