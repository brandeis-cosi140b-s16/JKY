DO NOT GO IN ON A SATURDAY NIGHT.
Bar seating was full so we chose to wait 20 minutes for a table in the restaurant. 40 minutes later the hostess sat us in the back of the restaurant ( even though open tables were available towards the front where the tvs were. It took our waitress a heavy set Mexican woman 15 minutes to approach the table.
We attempted to make happy hour which is from 4-7 everyday. I ordered the house margarita at 6:53, the waitress than informed me happy hour was over. I was upset due to the fact I waited 40 minutes for a dirty table now bad service?
we argued about the time and she then stated that if I wasn't willing to pay the full price for the margarita she would bring out waters instead? WATERS?
I asked if there  was a manager I could speak to, and she told me Gina. Which I then inquired about speaking with her. She scurried away I assume to locate the manager. When the waitress came back 10 minutes later she exclaimed she was unable to locate a manager. WHAT IS THAT ABOUT? 
My husband and grand baby decided to get up and leave at this point. No service from a "manager" no drinks, and no food. Extremely dispointed we love gambling at silverton and hope the place isn't going under due to unequipped so called managers.

CUSTOMER SERVICE PEOPLE.
Sticking to the coffee shop from now on!
