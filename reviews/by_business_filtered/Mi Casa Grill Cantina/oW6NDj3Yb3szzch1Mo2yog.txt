OMG this place was such a freaking rip. Everything was horrible !!!!!!!!!!  We paid to watch the Super Bowl at a Mexican Restaurant but they served everyone cold Oscar Mayer hot dogs, bland chicken wings, disgusting sliders, stale tortilla chips which aren't even the thin chips offered by the restaurant. They didn't even have enough TVs around the restaurant  so that people have a good view to watch the game. I actually had to subscribe to NFL mobile to watch the game on my smartphone so i can see the game clearly. this place collected and ran with your money and gave u Garbage !!!!! I seriously want a freaking refund. They ruined my Super Bowl and I hope now one else makes a mistake and comes here for an event!!!!!!!!
