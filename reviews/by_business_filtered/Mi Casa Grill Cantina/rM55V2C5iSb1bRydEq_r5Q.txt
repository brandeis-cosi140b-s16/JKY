Wow, I rated this restaurant previously as 5 stars as it was every time we went.......until this past Sat.  I had my beef enchiladas which I always get here, and they were incredibly skimpy on meat!  There was one little piece of meat in the middle of each tortilla.  I would have added a picture, but didn't want to embarrass them too badly as hoping this was on off day for them.  My husband tried the steak fajitas and that was a complete joke!  NO seasoning at all, bland steak with large cut up veggies with cold tortillas.  Sorry, if this is the new way they are cooking at Mi Casa, we will not go back and certainly will not rate them more than 2 stars.  Let's hope if they have new cooks that they get them trained QUICKLY before this place really sinks!
