My associate and I come to Vegas every year for a trade show. Being creatures of habit we headed to our favorite Mexican restaurant and much to our dismay they were out of business. So we looked on Yelp and found Mi Casa. I had the the Chicken and rice with black beans and cilantro citrus rice. It was the bomb!  My associate had the chili relleno and cheese enchilada. Excellent! All in all, it was a very pleasant experience enhanced by our wonderful and very attentive waiter, Cameron. Our new favorite restaurant when we come to Vegas!
