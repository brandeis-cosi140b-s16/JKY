It's been a while since we've eaten at Mi Casa and this past Friday was just as I had remembered it... First off, this restaurant is beautiful. I couldn't help commenting on the decor while dining. As we know, however, decor is nothing without the other two components. FOOD : I ordered the combination beef enchilada and tamale. Very good ! My husband chose the fish taco and ground beef enchilada ( not too many places offer a choice between shredded and ground beef) . Also very good ! SERVICE : Outstanding !  Our server was very attentive .  Ex. Keeping an eye on our iced tea glasses and bringing refills without having to ask. I love that ! (I wish I would have noted his name to credit him in this review.) .... All in all a 5 star experience.
