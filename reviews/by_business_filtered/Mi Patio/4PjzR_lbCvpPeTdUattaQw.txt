I adore Mi Patio.  I've enjoyed every entree I've gotten, the chips and salsa are yum, the margaritas are killer, and CHEAP.  I almost always have the same waiter, but they are all as friendly as can be.  

Now that the weather is warming up, even though they don't really HAVE a patio, Mi Patio is still one of my favorite places to sit around on a lazy weekend afternoon.  If you like Mexican food even a little, GO!!
