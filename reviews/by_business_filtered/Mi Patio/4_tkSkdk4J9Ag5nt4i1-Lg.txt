I trusted Yelp and this time I got burned. I should have known that a Mexican restaurant full of gringos was a BAD omen. But I stubbornly thought that a four-star average on Yelp CANNOT possibly be wrong, so I went ahead and got seated. I think everybody is just way too excited about the cheap drinks at this place. I didn't drink - maybe if I had a few $1.99 margaritas in me, I'd be more willing to go up to three of four stars...

The service was slow but very friendly. So +1 star for that. But that's about it. The food, although a nice large portion, seemed like it came out of a microwave. And there was so much yellow (only partially melted) shredded cheese on top, it was way too much. The horchata was grainy and...foamy? The chips seemed stale and the salsa was mediocre at best.

My wife is Mexican. I know how good authentic Mexican food can be. This place seemed closer to Taco Bell than a real Mexican meal. I'd actually rather have a Taco Bell chalupa than go back to this place anyway.
