So I drive by this place all the time but never stopped in until yesterday. My co-workers, who are regulars here, made me go and now I know why they are regulars.  The staff was a blast and put up with our big, loud party and excessive use of our table....what started as lunch turned into a ten hour event.  They took care of us like how you would care for your family (thanks Freddie)!  What an awesome locally owned, customer friendly restaurant with a laid back atmosphere and great food & drinks!
