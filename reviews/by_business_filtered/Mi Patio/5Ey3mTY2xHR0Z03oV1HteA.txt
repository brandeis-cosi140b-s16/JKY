I've been going here since I was a little girl after church. My crazy mom would celebrate post-Saturday mass with their CHEAP margaritas. I never noticed until I was old enough to come back and enjoy their margaritas, but they offer shots on the house when you receive your check. 

The food is great quality and absolutely delicious! Their chimis rock and their red beef quesadilla is a hit! 

Service is awesome and I've seen the same faces since I was a kid- very personable people working the place and on top of drink refills. Food comes out pretty quickly too, making it a great lunch-time spot. I recommend going there a little early, a little late, or reserving a table for lunchtime however, as the place gets pretty packed!
