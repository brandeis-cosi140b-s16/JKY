Enough comments on here for you to get the idea, but I just want to comment on how efficient it is here. We were nervous about a wait when we saw how packed It was, but they had Us seated in three minutes. I've never had faster service, from taking our order, delivering our drinks, and magically swapping out our chips as the last one hit our lips. Crazy.
