Family owned, great staff, quick service, endless/delicious chips and salsa, cheap margaritas all makes for a favorite local Phoenix joint. 

Love this place a ton and always make a stop when I am home from NYC. Fairly priced, a ton of food, and good ambiance. There are randomly a ton of fake birds all over the place and they put far too much cheese on everything, but this place is great.
