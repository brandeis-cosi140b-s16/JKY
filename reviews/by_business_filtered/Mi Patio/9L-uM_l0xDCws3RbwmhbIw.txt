Yeah!  Real, good Mexican food :)  My dad and I went there for dinner this evening, spurred on by the reviews right here on yelp.  Great atmosphere, authentic Mexican toucans everywhere.  The margarita was pretty good, especially considering it was $1.25!!!  Had the Texas Burro special for $5.55, beef and bean burrito covered with cheese and enchilada sauce with plenty of rice and lettuce.  My dad had his covered in green chili.  He said it is the only Mexican resaturant he has been to in Phoenix with green chili.  My dad loved it, and that is saying everything.  He always complains about Mexican restaurants in Phoenix not being good enough, but with Mi Patio, he was in love!  I'll be going back soon :)
