Food was excellent.  (Try the Chicken Baja Burro).  Portions were huge.  Service was very attentive.  Created a great dining atmosphere.  I made a mixup on coupons, but the owner/manager wanted us to have a great dining experience and wasn't going to sweat the small stuff.   I am sure he wants to bring business back, and I am sure he will.
