I came here with my mom and sister to satisfy a Mexican food craving (and as a consolation prize after a failed attempt to go to Matt's Big Breakfast). I had my doubts about a kind of hole-in-the-wall Mexican-Greek place, but  I was pleasantly surprised. 

I had the Taco Patio with chicken. Dish was tasty and portion was big, but unreasonably so. Also, I was a fan of the $1.50 margaritas (which I'm sure are made with plastic jug tequila, but it's hard to argue with the price). Chips and salsa were plentiful. I'll be back.
