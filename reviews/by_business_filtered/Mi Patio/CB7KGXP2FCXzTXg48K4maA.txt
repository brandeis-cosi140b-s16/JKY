We've lived right down the street from this restaurant for 2 years before we checked it out on Yelp and realized that we were definitely missing out on some great Mexican food!!
As soon as you walk in, you are seated quickly and they bring you some of the best chips and salsa that I've ever had in my life. And then they bring you refills of chips and salsa until you finally think that maybe you should stop and save some room for your actual meal.
So then when your food does get there, the first thing you'll think is "Holy crap that is a lot of food!" But it is AMAZING. I have only ever had the carne asada burro, but I don't think I'll ever get anything else from here. It is a pillow-sized burro stuffed with chunks of steak, cheese and roasted bell peppers, onions and tomatoes. SO GOOD!! My husband has had a few of the other things and he swears that it is some of the best Mexican food that he's ever had, too. 
The $1.75 margaritas are not bad, and they compliment the food really well. My whole meal was about $10, and I still had half of it leftover to take home!
Besides the food, the service here is impeccable. The waiters are all very attentive to what you need and they are very polite and FAST!
