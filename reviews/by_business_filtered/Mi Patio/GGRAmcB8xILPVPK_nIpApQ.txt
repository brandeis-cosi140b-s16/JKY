While this style of food may appeal to some, it's just not for me. At the recommendation of a friend, we were told to try the tacos. The chicken tacos arrived in what appeared to be homemade taco shells. The shells are thicker and seemed to be deep fried and a little greasy. The chicken (as another reviewer stated) is deep fried. Honestly, this tasted like Kentucky Fried Tacos to me, and since I'm not a fan of fried chicken, this wasn't an enjoyable meal. 

My wife got the Caribbean Martini and while she said it was delicious, the martini glass wasn't filled close to the top. 

I'm giving it 2 stars (rather than 1) because the service was good and the menu is priced well.
