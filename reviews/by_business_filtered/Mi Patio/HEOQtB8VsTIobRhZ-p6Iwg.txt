Please don't be alarmed at my four stars there is nothing wrong with this place. But you have to be damn good to get a five from me.

This place is a hidden gem, I say this because either you know of it or you don't. I brung some friends here and they were sold. I love this place even though I am not really a fan of Mexican food. I'm sure it was said before: the chips and salsa are NEVER ENDING!!!!!!!!!!! They keep your glass filled. The food doesn't take long to come out but by the the time DOES come out your pretty much full of chips and sody. (LOL) The food size of a HUGE portion I never finish my whole meal here. Not hing I have ever had here was nasty. This place is pretty cozy, so if your not a fan of small spots this place isn't for you. The servers? Are INCREDIBLE. OMG I can rave about this place all day but if your reading this review and you haven't been? TAKE THAT TRIP. You will be happy you did.
