I wish I loved Mi Patio.

I could walk here from my house. It's cheap and has a big menu. The margaritas are yummy and cost the same as pop. It's cute, inside and out.

But the food...? It's just.... so.... blah. And there's so much amazing Mexican food in the area, why in God's name would you settle for blah?

Every time my SO and I go by it, we look at each other, shrug, and say, "I wish we liked that place!"

Maybe we'll give it another try sometime soon....
