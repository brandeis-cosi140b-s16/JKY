I have been going to Mi Patio for years now and it is always a great place to go! The salsa is the best in town, just be careful if you get the hot stuff because it will burn your mouth, but boy does it hurt so good! 

I always get the combination plate number 101 with the taco, tostado, and cheese enchilada with rice. It is always a good choice if you want a little bit of everything and it is so delicious, be careful if you do not like a lot of cheese because they put an excessive amount of shredded cheese on the entire plate. 

My dinner mates got the chicken fajitas and the combination plate with the taco and cheese enchilada. The fajitas were seasoned wonderfully and the guacamole they bring with it is fresh. They skimp a little on the peppers and onions so just be weary of that. My boyfriends mom got the combination plate with the taco and cheese enchilada and she thoroughly enjoyed it! We also got an order to-go and it came out very fast and they even added chips and salsa to the bag. 

Mi Patio's food is always delicious and the staff is always very friendly!
