Love this place. We are regulars. Everything is fresh, hot, huge portions and very reasonably priced. Food comes out fast and piping hot, even when it's crowded. We've eaten here probably 100 times in the last 18 months never not once, have we been disappointed. Highly recommend the patio chimi. The green sauce is amazing. Baja chimi is another "go-to" dish. The bean and cheese burro, Mexican pizza also favorites. The wait staff is friendly and efficient. Drinks are refilled promptly, endless  hot and fresh chips. Salsa excellent. Sometimes a bit too spicy for my taste but still very good, fresh and homemade.
