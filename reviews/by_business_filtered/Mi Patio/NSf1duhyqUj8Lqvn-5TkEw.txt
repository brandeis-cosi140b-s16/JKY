While in phoenix, I felt that I had to try mexican food.  I found myself downtown without a car, so was entirely yelp dependent.  

I walked into mi patio and although the ambience had me worried as it seemed like a cheesy american mexican place.

They quickly brought me fresh chips and a nice spicy salsa--definitely a good start.  I had trouble deciding on what to order, so I ordered the veggie combo which combined a # of things off the menu.  Although it was on the greasy side, the food was fresh and all very tasty.  I added some hot sauce to some of the dishes as they were a bit on the mild side.  

Not the best mexican I have had, but would definitely go back if in the mood for some greasy mexican food.
