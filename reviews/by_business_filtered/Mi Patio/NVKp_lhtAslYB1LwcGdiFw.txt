I was expecting better... I did a mexican restaurant tour and this was the 3rd in one day... Just looking for a nice mexican food and delicious margarita... well not in this place... The servers WOW they don't even wanted to be there... they looked bored and rushed to take the order... the girl that brought  the tortillas and salsa was very nice... that's all I have to write about this place...
