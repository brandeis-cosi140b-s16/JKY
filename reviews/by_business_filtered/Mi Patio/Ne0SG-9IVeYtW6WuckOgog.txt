So disappointed! We used to live not far and remembered it fondly, but returned w our family recently (daughter and two well-behaved teens) and could hardly get out quick enough. In a town with plenty of quality Mexican restaurants, this was our sad experience: stale chips, sooo sweet margaritas from a commercial mix, "char-broiled taquito" consisted of soggy tortilla and steamy meat that had not recently experienced any charbroiling, shared fajitas churned out with no caramelizing or evidence of time on a plancha, essentially hot meat and vegetables w two tiny tortillas.  What happened to the old Mi Patio? Maybe it doesn't exist at 6 on Friday nights.

While I can't exactly fault the restaurant for our being trapped next to a raucous group of nine people at a table sized for six (they kept pulling up another chair "Sure, we can make room"), I do think well-run restaurants are attentive to the realities of maneuvering around with hot plates when tables are overfilled. That's on the end of server experience; as for diner experience, at one point, two of us had hand over an ear to soften the donkey-loud laugh of the woman next to us. Maybe it was amplified by the tunnel-like area near the back door, which we used to escape as soon as we popped cash (and a tip-it's hardly fair to punish the server) in the folder. 

Our server was pleasant and efficient, I'll give them that, but do lament $80 and 80 minutes of my life wasted.
