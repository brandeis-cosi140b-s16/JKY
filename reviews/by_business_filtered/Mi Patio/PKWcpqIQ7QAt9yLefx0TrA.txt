Dinner there last night. We were a party of 12 and I think the customer service was excellent. Took such good care of us and so friendly. And food...OH so good and plate huge for a wonderful price. Best happy hour too.  With all that said, I am highly recommending Mi Patio, even for big parties like ours.
