We stopped in at this place because it's super close to our new home here in Phoenix. I was slightly wary, as my fiance and I have had plenty of Mexican food all around Phoenix (and, since I'm from Tucson, right along the Mexican border), and are pretty versed in it. It's always difficult trying new Mexican places, because once you know what's good, you keep coming back. Let me say I'm extremely happy we gave this place a shot. 

First of all, the service is absolutely incredible. I work as a hostess in a 5-star restaurant in Paradise Valley, and I swear the servers there pale in comparison to the people working at Mi Patio. Our server was super-attentive, gave us the time we needed to look over everything, and made sure we knew all the deals before ordering (for example, if you do go, get the $3.50 large margarita instead of the $1.99 regular-size. It's more than double the drink for not even twice the price). He checked up on us as soon as we'd taken two bites of our food, and always made sure our drinks were full. The girl bussing was also incredible; she always made sure we had plenty of chips and salsa, as well as full water glasses, and cleared everything the moment we were through. Keep in mind, all of this was during the dinner rush, so it wasn't as though they were attentive because the restaurant was empty; this little place stays consistently crowded. 

The food was pretty good, too; I loved the salsa, and my tacos were delicious. My fiance had chili relleno, which wasn't quite as good, but still pretty tasty. Not to mention the fact that everything is super-cheap (as Mexican food often is). 

All in all, we had a great time. We felt welcome and taken care of, and the food was definitely worth going back. Definitely give this place a try!
