My wife and I had dinner at Mi Patio tonight.  All I can say is WOW.  The chips were perfectly crispy and light with ample good medium salsa.  I ordered a large margarita on the rocks with salt and an 'enchilada-style' chicken burrito with fajita chicken and rice.  My wife ordered the small margarita, two enchiladas, one chicken and one beef with rice and beans.  They were rated as having the best pitcher margaritas in town and I can see why.  Most notable, though, was the service, which was very attentive.  Both of the ladies serving us were really really nice and made sure everything was right.  The restaurant is a family-owned style place on a busy corner in north central Phoenix.  When you pull up, it looks small, but it really has quite a bit of capacity and they know how to serve up the food and drink.  All at a reasonable cost, especially the margaritas!  I was very impressed.  I sure wish we had a great place like this at home.  When I am in Phoenix, I'll be back.
