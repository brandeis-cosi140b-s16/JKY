$1.75 margaritas, all day, every day.

 

What else is there to say?

 

OK, I have a few more things to say. I started coming here about a year and a half ago because it's a hop, skip and jump from my office and was the go-to Mexi restaurant for special lunches and happy hours.

For its decent food and SUPER-fast and friendly service, you can't beat it. It will satisfy that Mexican food craving but 'tis true it is nothing to write home about. (I imagine if I were from the East Coast or like Idaho or something, I really would write my friends and family regularly to brag about the amazing Mexican food in AZ, just sayin'.)

Cases in point of "super-fast-and-friendly-service": 1)Came here for drinks and apps with a friend and were about to settle our tab and head out the door anyway when our server kindly asked if we would mind moving tables to accommodate a large party - and we would be given margaritas on the house for the "trouble." 2) Myself and two other friends dropped in for a quick bite and were brought chips and salsa before even ordering - I love that - and our margarita orders were taken immediately and were out within the minute. When our food orders were placed, the plates were out within three minutes - I'm not kidding! And our waters and margaritas were never below the one-third line before being asked if we'd like more. Also, the server gave not one, but TWO freebies: shots of sweet red liquid he simply called "Mexican Kool-Aid" (he even smiled when I hissed "I think we're being roofied, go with it!") and rice pudding. He apparently thought we might like it, and I sure did.

Anywho, it's consistently fast and friendly and pretty cheap too. Throw in those cheap drinks and what's not to love about that?
