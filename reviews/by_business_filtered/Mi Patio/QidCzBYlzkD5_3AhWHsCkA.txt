I have been to this place a handful of times. The first time I was super impressed and would have given it a five.... We got free shots, delicious salsa, warm chips and the entree was decent. However, as I continued to go there the service seemed to get worse. The last time was most upsetting and made me decide to never return.  We actually had to hunt down our waiter to take our order because he was taking so long to come back. He was busy watching the ball game and socializing with 2 other people up at the bar. We were pretty convinced that our waiter was high. He had absolutely no perception of time, he was sweating, loud and his pupils were ginormous. The chips seemed to be burned from the heat lamps and the chips that were not burned tasted a bit stale.  When we got our entree the ends of my enchilada were hot but the middle was cold. That leads me to believe that it was previously frozen and it actually tasted like frozen food. My boyfriend's food tasted like Franks Red Hot. Don't get me wrong, we love franks but I don't expect it to be the sauce they use to flavor their food.  The margaritas are good but cheap for a reason! They are hoping that you drink enough to cover up the taste of the food. If you decide to go just hope that it's a good day. For me, I can't bare to chance it.
