I'm so dissatisfied with this place! The wait staff is pretty rude, you never feel warm and friendly. Worst of all, the 2nd and last time we visited our food was cold and the chips were stale! Come on "Mi Patio" take some pride and offer good service, fresh chips and train your staff on good manners! Also, don't be so cheap with your napkins , we need those to wipe off the excess cheese and grease from our hands and face! Won't go there again and feel like I wasted my money and be treated like I'm an inconvenience.
