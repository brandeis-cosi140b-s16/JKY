ISO: Great Mexican food that's quick, a hop skip & jump away and is inexpensive, but not in the "I ate 'Berto's drunk last night, and it's not the booze that left me feeling like crap"  way.

This place is pretty dive-y and at first glance, you'd think "Meh..nothing to write home about". Don't judge a book by it's cover! Mi Patio serves up classic Mexican fare with a Greek twist. The first time I got the complimentary chips and salsa, I was sold-AND might I mention that it's bottomless? We'd be halfway finished with a bowl of chips and someone would be making rounds to give us more! The margaritas are pretty standard-I'm not a huge margarita drinker but I always order one when I come here-why not? It's only $1.75. I know what you're thinking. Hold the phone! 1.75? Was it Happy Hour? NOPE..It's all the time! 

Usually when I go, I've ordered the veggie burro. On my most recent visit, the special was fish tacos.. This girl is a huge fan of those! The portions here are huge-especially with the burros. I usually power halfway through because it's so good I can't stop eating and then am stuffed.  They seem to make the food at record pace and all of the ingredients taste fresh. The fish tacos I ordered were SO tasty-I had never had them with fresh taco shells..mmm mm good!! Plus the beans and rice which is always delicious. I'd probably eat here every day if I could..or if it were particularly healthy.
