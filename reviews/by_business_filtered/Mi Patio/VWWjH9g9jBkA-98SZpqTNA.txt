This is not the worst Mexican food I've ever had. 

It isn't the best either, and ultimately I'd say it is about average, or slightly better. The service here is pretty friendly, or rather, over the top friendly. They just give you the run of the place to pick where you want to sit and what you want to do. They are extremely nice. 

It's inexpensive food, and the chips and salsa are great. The place does get very very loud on the weekends and has a lot of screaming kids.
