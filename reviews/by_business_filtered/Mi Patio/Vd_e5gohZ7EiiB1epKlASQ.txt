Probably need to go back and try something else. My experience was a good one, and the service was perfect, but I normally rate on food, and it just wasn't all there for me. 

We were greeted as soon as we walked through the door, placed at a table where we decided we'd take the bar seats that were open. They had no problems with this, not even a dirty look, that sometimes comes with it. You can definitely tell the staff has some bonds, not sure if it's family or just real good employer employee relationships. Needless to say, I love being lead to believe the workers actually like what their doing. The guy sitting at the bar next to me was obviously a regular, and while we didn't talk much, he was very friendly, and stated that everything was good. 

The salsa was fresh, mild, but Can we say salt? Still had a good hint of lime that I enjoyed. The bright side of this was the chips needed no extra salt, it came in the salsa. The chips were deelish! Freshly made and perfect. For my meal, which came out so fast,  I chose the Carne Asada.  It was a plate of Carne Asada steaks, rice, beans, lettuce, and some pico.  Everything was real good, but the meat was too salty.  On that note, let me just tell you that I LOVE SALT, like I'm guilty of sprinkling it on my pizza (i know thats so bad), so maybe it was just my taste buds that day!  I washed this all down with an ice cold Tecate Light in a can, yup that's right!  I like cans, I'm just weird like that.  The bartender asked if I wanted a mug, so if you don't like cans, don't worry!

My BF had the frybread tostada thingy, I can't remember the name, but it was like an gigantic tostada on top of a fry bread with green chilli beef, lettuce, tons of cheese.  I tasted it and was very happy with it, it was like striped cubed beef, not shreeded.  It was good, we probably should have split it, it was huge.  

I'll be back to check some other things out, I'll be sure an update accordingly.
