I really like Mi Patio. I wish it were closer to my house!

They have a good and unique vegetarian selection. You aren't limited to bean and cheese burritos, chili rellenos, and cheese enchiladas. They have a feta spinach chimichanga I have been dying to try.

Both times I went their I had this enormous combo with a cheese enchilada, chili relleno, and bean tostada. A LOT of food! But really, really good.

My husband had their fish tacos which he loved.

Fresh hot chips and zippy salsa.

Great drink specials too. Really cheap margaritas and beer. Their margaritas aren't the greatest or strongest but you can't complain for the price.
