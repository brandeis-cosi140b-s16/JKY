The food was delicious.  Definitely a "down-home" restaurant and you're treated like family.  The complimentary salsa was delicious although our chips were slightly stale.  The cheese enchiladas were stellar and my companion thoroughly enjoyed his fish tacos.  

The thing about "you can't beat the $2 margaritas"... well, you can.  I think our margaritas may have spent time near tequila at some point but I'm not convinced there was actually any in there.  Skip the drinks and order the food.
