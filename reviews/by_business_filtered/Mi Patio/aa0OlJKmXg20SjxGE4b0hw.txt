It's always been around and I always see it but never go there. So I show up and there not much of a waiting area but it's also not much waiting. We got there server was very nice. Chips and salsa to begin with they were good. Typical. We got our food in a timely manner and the waiter forgot our drinks but he was very nice and apologetic about it and have is the drinks at no charge. The food was amazing!!! Soo good and filling and a good amount I had to take it home! I got a margarita it was okay. I didn't hate it but I'll make a diff choice next time. Over all the experience was pleasant and food was delicious. I will be coming here again!!!!
