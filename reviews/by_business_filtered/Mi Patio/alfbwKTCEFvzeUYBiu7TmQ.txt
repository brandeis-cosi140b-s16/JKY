Well, that was fun! The husband and I couldn't pass up the chance to check out a $1.99 margarita. We should have. It was reminiscent of lemon-lime Gatorade and theraflu. So what was so fun, you ask? The super sweet greeting by every person we walked in to, the great service from a guy wearing awesome pleather pants and a Gucci belt, the good food (Baja burro, yeah! Fish tacos, nahh!), the birds hanging basically every 1.5 feet throughout the joint & how could I leave out the complimentary Mexican kamikaze! It was probably the nastiness shot of my life but there was no way I was leaving it on the table when no one else in the place received one. We will be back, likely with hidden mini-shots for our margs, but we'll be back.
