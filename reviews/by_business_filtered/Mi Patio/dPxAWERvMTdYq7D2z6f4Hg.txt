I am going to have to say, I just do not know what all the fuss is about with this place.
I have been here a few times or more over many years.
The service is good however, The food is just not that fabulous!
I think that they think if they get people to drink a lot,with their cheap Margaritas they will not notice the bland tatse. 
I have given it many trys but, I just cannot do better than a 3 star for them. 
They are a good location right on the corner, and they always seem to be busy. 
They have been there for as long as I can remember as well.
Just not loving the food here.
