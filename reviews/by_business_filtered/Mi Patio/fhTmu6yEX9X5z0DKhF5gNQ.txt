Just happened to be in the area looking for some great Mexican food and so I searched on the Yelp! app and found this place. As you enter the restaurant, you instantly realize its really a chill, cool, and casual kind of joint. Service was great and very quick! Complimentary chips and salsa were fresh and they would come by and refill both throughout the meal which was great. We sat down, got our waters, got chips and salsa, ordered, and got our food all within 10 minutes so these people are on their game. And the food was really good as well. I had the vegetarian burrito and added ground beef to it. All for about $7 which made it even better. Great casual little mexican joint with great service. Can't go wrong.
