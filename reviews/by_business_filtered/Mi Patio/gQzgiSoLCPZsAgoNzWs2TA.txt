What more can you say about a menu that is Mexican and Greek?  I love this restaurant, everything I've had (Mexican or Greek) has been superb.  The service is awesome and even though the joint is tiny, they move the folks in and out quickly.  If you're ever in the area and hungry for Mexican (or Greek) - don't hesitate to stop here!
