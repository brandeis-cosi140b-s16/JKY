Me gusta Mi Patio! I had the chicken chimichanga and it was fantastic. I didn't know what to expect because I never had a chimi before but as soon as the delectable delight landed on the table I knew that I was in for a treat!

One suggestion I have for the owners is that they should make a contest for guests to try to guess how many bird placards and statues that they have in their restaurant. Seriously, if you visit take a look around...they're everywhere lol.
