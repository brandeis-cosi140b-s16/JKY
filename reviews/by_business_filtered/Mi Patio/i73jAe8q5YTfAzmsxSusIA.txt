Thanks to my swim team that likes to eat here once in a while after swim practice, I was introduced to this cozy little spot to which I have returned time and again, leaving very full and satisfied each time. Fast and friendly service, tasty food, cheap drinks ... and mariachi music once in a while. I especially love their burros and tamales, and the complimentary freshly-cooked tortilla chips that keep comin'. And I like the fact that they stay open a bit later than a lot of the other dining places in the vicinity.
