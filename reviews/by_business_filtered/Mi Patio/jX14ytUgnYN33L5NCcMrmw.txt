Sure, I'll pretend that the main reason I come here is the food and not the super cheap margaritas. It was the... uhh... food that is really good even if I don't remember what I ate. I think there were some fish tacos that were pretty tasty. Okay fine, I go for the margaritas- they are big, cheap and tasty.
