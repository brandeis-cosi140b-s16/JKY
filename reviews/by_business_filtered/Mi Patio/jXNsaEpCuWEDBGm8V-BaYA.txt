I always enjoy myself when I come here! ! mean come one cheap food! $1.75 margaritas! How could you go wrong?
Sure they're not top shelf margaritas and maybe a tad watered down but they are better than what I initially expected from a $1.75 margarita. Seriously people. You're complaining about a $1.75 margarita? Are you never happy??
Now for the food.
I love their food. That baja sauce!!!! I could eat that off anything! I would put it on my pancakes if I could! I have tried numerous menu options and always enjoyed what I had.
The Nachos
Baja Chicken Burrito
Patio Taco (a deep fried FLOUR tortilla, not corn)
Those are my favorites.
(I'm not going to name beers because those are the same whether you get em at Mi Patio or a grocery store)
It's a fun place to come with a few friends, drink a few cheap margaritas, good cheap food in big portions...
You definitely get more than your money's worth here.
