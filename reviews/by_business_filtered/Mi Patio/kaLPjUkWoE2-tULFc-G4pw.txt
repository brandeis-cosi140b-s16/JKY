Everybody Knows Your Name!

I used to go to Mi Patio when I worked nearby in the 90s and LOVED it then. When I returned to work in the area again five years ago, imagine my surprise when I walked in and they REMEMBERED ME BY NAME! It was like coming home to family! The food is every bit as good as it ever was, they service super friendly, the salsa is the bomb, and they are extremely accommodating with changes to items if you need alterations or with making suggestions if you just can't decide. And be sure to always check the chalkboard menu when you walk in - it's always go interesting things you won't find on the menu! Elio and Tammy have been there forever & have great suggestions. The owner, Johnny, is great with kids... if you go in with the kids on Friday, he'll make balloon animals and bring free rice pudding! It's great for happy hour, date night or family dining. My go-to place in the area!!!
