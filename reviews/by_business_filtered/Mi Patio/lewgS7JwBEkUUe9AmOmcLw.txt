I'm certainly in the minority with my critique ... it was my first time in ... not impressed with dated decor  or the cuisine.  Chips tasted stale and salsa was just so-so.  Chicken burro was edible but too cheesy as was the spinach dip making both greasy.  Although portions were large, could have used more care in the presentation of each dish.  Prices comparable with other Mexican restaurants, but didn't feel this was a very good value for the money.  Staff was proficient but not very friendly ... I would not recommend nor will I be back.
