Mi Patio is a friendly, welcoming sort of place that you can get a decent meal for little dinero. The margaritas aren't top shelf, but for the price they can't be beat (and who really cares after the fourth or fifth one?!!). I've had better chips, but the salsa is killer and the wait staff is  good at making sure you always have some of each. Service is generally super fast and the food is consistently good.

IMHO the Baja Chicken Burro is the best thing on the menu and it's huge - I easily get two meals out of it. The chicken is nicely seasoned and moist, but the best part is the baja sauce that can only be described as bubbly goodness (or as mom would say - lick it off your body good).

Go on a Thursday (or early Friday) night and they will offer up some of their unbelievably yummy rice pudding. This isn't your mother's rice pudding either... it's the slow cooked; OMG my arm is going to fall off because I've been stirring this damn pot for 2 hours, pudding kind. And bless their hearts they will even pack it up for you to take home and enjoy later if you have reached your gastral limit.

Top everything off with a piece of bazooka on your way out and you definitely won't be disappointed.
