Like most Phoenicians, I love Mexican food! That being said, there are many places to choose from when you want to get a quick fix of chips, salsa and a margarita... But if you want delicious, quality food for a reasonable price, look no further than Mi Patio!

Located, literally, on the corner of 7th Avenue & Osborn this Mexican restaurant has great salsa, which I believe is very important to any chips & salsa lover. Whether you want a mild Pico de Gallo or a more spicy salsa, they have both!

My boyfriend & I dine here frequently. We both get two shredded beef tacos- They consistently have generous portions of beef, lettuce and cheese that will fill you right up. I always order mine with a side of guacamole and it is a perfect addition to my order.

Although some may argue that the decor is somewhat cheesy, I like it. The restaurant appears fun & that is exactly what I am looking for in a Mexican restaurant. Also, every staff member I have interacted with is extremely friendly & helpful! They are always attentive when it comes to refilling our chip bowl, salsa & drinks.

Overall, if you are looking for both, quality AND quantity Mexican food- Give Mi Patio a try! You will be glad you did!!
