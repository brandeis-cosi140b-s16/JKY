Mi Patio is THE place for wallet-friendly Mexican food.  The first time I went, I was pleasantly surprised by the gay-friendly vibe.  The BF and I have been several times and the food is good enough for what it is:  tasty, basic Mexican fare.  The portions are also HUGE.  I can honestly say there is no need to order an appetizer here because the entrees are so large it's almost like dining at The Claim Jumper of Mexican food in terms of portions.
