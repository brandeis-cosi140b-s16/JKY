I finally made it to Mi Patio last Friday after working up an appetite checking out First Friday. The service was impeccable- chips and salsa brought out right away and replenished as often as needed. I am a salsa fanatic so I loved the fact that they refilled my salsa without it even being totally empty- thats amazing!!

We started with a cheese quesadilla, because whats better than melted cheese on a tortilla? And I tried a margarita on the rocks and really liked the taste of it.  Maybe not the strongest thing, but at least it wasn't loaded with sweet n sour mix. Blech!

We had all but decided what to order when we found out the menu had another side to it- so many choices! I went with a combo plate with a chile relleno, cheese enchilada, beef taco and rice n beans. It was a feast! Everything was wonderful, even the rice. I liked that the chile relleno wasn't battered and fried but simply wrapped in a corn tortilla and stuffed with gooey white cheese. JD had the chicken burro because of the reputation it had earned from other Yelpers and he was very happy with his choice. The burrito had moist, flavorful chunks of chicken that tasted incredible.

We were also totally impressed with the prices! This place is cheap and doesn't skimp at all on food, salsa or service! I can't wait to come back!
