I saw they had 4 stars on yelp?.  NOt even,  the food was like youd expect a white person who'd never eaten authentic mexican food would make. I had a regular chicken taco, just plain and dry.and for some reason the sour cream was thick and chunky more like cream cheese, i dont understand how you even get that consistency. I will say if i was rating the service alone it would be a 5 star unfortunately this is a restaurant. They should just stick to salsa it was the only good part of the actual food.
