HUGE fan of the chicken enchiladas! This is my "go to" Mexican place when I have out-of-town guests. Service is super fast, they kicked me down some rice pudding dessert thing last time I was there, and everyone is very friendly...what's not to like? Plus, it just has that kind of Mexican food taste that makes whatever you ordered taste good if you reheat it the next morning...can't explain it exactly, I just know it when I have it...:)
