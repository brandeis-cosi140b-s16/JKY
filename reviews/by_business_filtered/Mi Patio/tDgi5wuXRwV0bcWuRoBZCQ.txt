Well it is a Mexican place that is close to downtown that actually has waiters so that is a big plus right there.  The chips and salsa that seem obligatory with Mexican places were pretty good.  I ordered a spinach and feta burrito or something.  I couldn't really see it because it was burried under a ton of this cream sauce stuff - not that I minded, that stuff was good!  My burrito thing was really tasty and I'd probably order it again.  Their menu was a bit overwhelming and I wish it had some pictures cuz I had no idea what most of it was.  In the end, it was good, and I'm sure I'd go back.
