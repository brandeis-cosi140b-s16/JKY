I have been coming here for as long as I can remember. First of all, I do NOT come here for the service. Sometimes the service is OK, but not usually stellar. I just come here for the food. And oh LORD the food. I'm a big refried bean person-- if the place has bad beans its a deal breaker. They have the best beans. Great chimi's too. The chimi's are the perfect texture of crisp- almost as though they were not deep fried but torched with a blow torch or something. The chips and salsa are the best I have ever had, I mainly come for them. Great Sonora Mex food. One of my favorite places in the valley. Have some low expectations for service unless the owner is there, in which case, he'll make you want to come back every day (if the chips and salsa don't do it for him).
