This place is not going to win any Michelin stars or James Beard awards, however if you're looking for fast, cheap, and good sized portions Mi Patio hit's the spot. The service is always excellent too.

I like the free chips and the salsa is always fresh and excellent.

Shredded beef tacos are HUGE and tasty.

During the day every beer is $3 but they ALWAYS have $3 Tecate beers 24/7 and they always give you a free shot of some tequila concoction. 

BOTTOM LINE: I'm a regular but don't tell anyone ;)
