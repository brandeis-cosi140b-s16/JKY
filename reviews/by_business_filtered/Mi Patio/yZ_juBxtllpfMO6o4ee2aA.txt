What can I say that hasn't already been said?  This place has tremendous food and will not drain your bank account. I tend to not be a big salsa fan, mainly because of the overly chunky salsa, but their salsa is just the consistency for me, and tastes great. Their enchiladas are amongst the best I've had.

The thing that gives this place even more of an edge is the service, it has to be seen to believed. Chips and salsa seldom get low before they bring out another bowl of chips, or refill your salsa. The same can be said for their drink refills. There is not a slacker to be found at this place, and even if it is packed, you can be rest assured you'll be treated with efficiency and speed with an energetic team effort.

I don't give out 5 stars easily, but this place deserves it. Not sure how "authentic" the food is, but I like to think I know what GOOD food is and this place has that!

P.S. Their margaritas may not have top quality ingredients but they are cheap, and tasty!
