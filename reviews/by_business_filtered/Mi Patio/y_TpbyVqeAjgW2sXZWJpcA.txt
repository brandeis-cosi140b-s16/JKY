Fresh tacos on a fall day in Phoenix. 
Setting up a wedding at The Fetch House in the historic district, everyone was getting hungry, where to go for good food and not drive across town.
Take out tacos from Mi Patio. I  arrived at the restaurant Sat 12:30, ordered 20 beef tacos and 1 veggie taco to go. 
The tacos come with homemade crispy chips and tasty salsa. Each taco was filled with lots of beef, no skimping on the cheese either. The veggie taco had pinto beans, slices of avocado, lettuce topped with plenty of freshly grated cheese. They did not skimp on the avocado. Delicious! I was feeding 6 very hungry staff members and myself, they would not be disappointed.
My order was completed within 12 minutes! The tacos were packaged in a large aluminum container to keep them upright, hot and easy to transport. The veggie taco was in a separate container. Thank you!
The huge bag of fresh, hot and crisp chips was included, I could not stop eating them on the drive back to the event. The salsa was mild, perfect when serving to a variety of people. 
Everyone was happy when I arrived with the large container filled with freshly made tacos, crispy chips and lots of salsa from Mi Patio. 
I will be back, again and again.
