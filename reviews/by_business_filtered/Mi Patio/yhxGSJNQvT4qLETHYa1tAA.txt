We were craving chips and salsa so we decided to try this place. The inside is very cute, yet I find it strange that a place named Mi Patio doesn't have a patio? However, right when you walk in you know Mi Patio has to be good by all the regulars hanging out at the bar. 

We ordered 2 of the $1.75 margarita specials. What a great deal- they are this price every day at every hour. They aren't top shelf but go oh so nicely with chips n salsa. The chips were my favorite thing from the whole meal. They're super fresh and irresistible plus our server kept refilling our bowl so it was hard to say no. 

I ordered a chicken burro enchilada style with rice and my fiance had a red chili beef chimichanga with beans. Everything was delicious and the staff was very attentive. The portions were huge and the prices are very reasonable (our total was under $22!!)

We'll definitely be back! The menu has so many tasty things to try and the chips n salsa combined with the margarita can be addictive!!
