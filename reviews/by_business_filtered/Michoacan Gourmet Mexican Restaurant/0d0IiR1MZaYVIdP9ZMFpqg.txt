This is one of our favorite places.  We have been coming for years.  The food is good. Maybe not the most earth shattering Mexican food I've ever had,  but good.  We have been coming so long we all have our favorite dishes. My daughters both go crazy for the sopa de fideo.  I love the grilled fish tacos or the ensalada marinera.  My husband loves the carnitas, flautas, and sopitos. 

We have recently discovered their brunch buffet and I'm now amiss that we hadn't been going for years prior. Most of their best menu options are available but the best thing is the pan dulce. I don't know if they make it in house or have it brought in but the conchas are to die for. 
The biggest reason we have been regular patrons so long and will continue to be is the staff. Some of the servers have literally watched our kids grow up. They're always so kind and effecient.
