I love eating here! They customize my order with no problem.

I like the "Shredded Chicken Burrito" with beans inside the burrito and it has so much flavor! The salsa is tasty and if you request it they will bake and not fry your chips. I usually call ahead if I know I am going to be there and they get them started for me. This last visit the place was packed. They have live music that is cool. It is clean inside. I think if you are in the area you should give it a try! There us currently a weekend lunch buffet that is a great deal.

I like that it is near the super wal-mart because since most of my paycheck goes to wally world I can at least stop by Lindo on the way and have lunch or dinner :)
