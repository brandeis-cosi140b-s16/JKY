Another place found by luck. The food is more varied and the flavors more textured than the standard franchise restaurant. Nothing was dry or overcooked, the meats were tender. It can feel crowded at peak dinner hour, so I recommend going early or later. Friday nights can get noisy since the bar is jammed up to the dining area; you can ask to be seated in the rear area.
