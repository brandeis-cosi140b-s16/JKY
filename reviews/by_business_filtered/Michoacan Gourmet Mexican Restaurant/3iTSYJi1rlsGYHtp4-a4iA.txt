I've this place many times since 2012.
Food:Decent. Nothing spectacular. 
Happy Hours:Great price and large selection.
A little pricey for regular meals.
Drinks: Seem diluted. 
Server: Its a hit or miss. There are times, my guest and I waited 20 minutes before a server was available to take our order. No biggie.

Overall...food is decent.
Service can be 10/10 sometimes or a 2/10.
Hit or miss..

Would I return: Sure.
