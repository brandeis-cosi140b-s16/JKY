I've been here twice now and can't say I'm blown away.  It's expensive and not up to expectations.  I will say the service is outstanding, I mean they are seriously on it.  I use to live in LA so I know some good mexican and this place doesn't quite cut it.  I probably won't be going back.  Very AVERAGE in my opinion.
