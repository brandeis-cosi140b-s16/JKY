Lindo Michoacan is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants to eat at just because the food is O-so-Delicious. The tortillas is the best tortillas I have ever tried just because it's made fresh. 

This time I ordered the chipotle lengua (cow tongue), I know it sounds nasty but hey it taste good. The lengua came with rice and bean's, guacamole. The rice was good, bean's not a bean fan so didn't get it, guacamole was good. For dessert I ordered churros, came with 4 small churros and whipped cream. When I first came here I ordered the steak rancheros, I would recommend trying it. 

I would totally recommend this place to my friends and family and fellow yelpers. The service is great, food is great, and the place itself is nice and clean.
