My husband and I come here at least once a week and tonight they completely messed everything up. We got here at 7pm, waited to be seated and we got seated at 7:30pm. We ordered food and we waited till 8:45 and no food came. All we got was our drinks and chips. I had to ask for the soup because they didn't even bring it to us. So I ask the waiter about where our food was.. He said their thermal printer ran out of paper so they put a new roll in and our food will be out in 5 mins. We couldn't wait any longer because our friend had to go to work. My question is that if the printer was out of paper then why did everyone around us that got there after Us got their food? 
If the waiter would've just kept up and realized we haven't gotten our food in 20-30 mins he should've known something was wrong. The problem is, they messed up.. And now they will lose a good customer. Like I said, my husband and I eat there at least once a week. Looks like we will be taking our business elsewhere . We got up and left, after waiting for over an hour for our food. I told the manager and he acted like he didn't even know anything and didn't care. The waiter should've told the manager what happened and the manager could've at least came to our table and apologize. We got nothing.

If I could give this place negative 100 stars right now I could. Not only we left with empty starving stomachs but we also left feeling like this place didn't give two sh*ts about customer service.
