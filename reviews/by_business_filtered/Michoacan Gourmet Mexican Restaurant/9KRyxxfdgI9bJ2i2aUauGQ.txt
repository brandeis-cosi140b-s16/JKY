Great Service. Great place for families.  This is our go to place for Mexican. We have also hosted a get together with friends in the little room. You can't go wrong with the Fajitas. Margs are great.  This is such a neighborhood family place to go. I don't know where else we'd go at our end of town if this wasn't here. Wheniever I have had a question or we had a bill issue they have always "dont the  right thing".  The customer is king here.  We've been going for 3 years now. Have only good things to say about this place!!!
