This is my 1st time to Vegas and I was getting married. I asked the guy who works at the Men's Warehouse for a good place to eat and he suggested Lindo Michoacan.

All I have to say is, AWESOME. The spicy salsa, the great lunch portions, VERY friendly staff. I would definitely come back to eat when I go to Vegas again.
