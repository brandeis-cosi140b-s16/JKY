Give me a break this place sucks big time it's over price. I don't mind paying top dollars for good quality food. I order their steak plate it wasn't even close to a real steak it was DIESMILLO which is one of the cheapest meat cuts of the the beef for that price I was expecting at least a beef skirt steak.
