Always a great experience here.  My wife and I come here pretty regularly.  As another reviewer stated Mark the owner does his best to greet guests and is often seen helping in the bar or talking with the customers.  We truly feel like family here.  They always greet us with a smile and continue to exceed our expectations. I would highly recommend this restaurant. Excellent food, excellent service, excellent atmosphere!  We also love it when they have live music, truly adds to the experience. The best Mexican restaurant in Vegas.
