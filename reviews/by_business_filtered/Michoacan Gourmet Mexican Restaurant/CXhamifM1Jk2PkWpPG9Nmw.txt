Been many times and the service is usually good.  Food is always excellent.   Typically I don't eat the fideo because it's salty but tonight it was better so I adked for chopped chili's.   I received fresh chopped jalapeno that were spicy, I dropped them in and YUM.  Food was timely, drink was perfect,  family was happy.   Luis and his team were on it tonight.
