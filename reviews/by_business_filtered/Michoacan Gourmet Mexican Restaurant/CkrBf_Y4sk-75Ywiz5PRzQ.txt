Not a huge fan. I probably won't be back since it's so far North, but the price makes it worth a visit for unlimited margaritas and mimosas. The food was ok, but it was so cramped and hard to get food it became annoying and I didn't bother getting up for another plate. Service was ok, but started slow. We needed more direction to know where buffet was etc. Try to avoid the booths at all costs and you'll have a more comfortable meal.
