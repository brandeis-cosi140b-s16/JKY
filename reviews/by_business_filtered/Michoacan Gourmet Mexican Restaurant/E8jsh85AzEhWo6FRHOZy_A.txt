The place was decorated with photos of Hispanic men and women, potteries and Hispanic arts. Very cozy. Customer service was great. I ordered the Chile releno and my daughter ordered the  bacon and shrimp meal.  The portions are huge. We ended up taking it home. Our server, Luis, was very attentive, clearing our table on time for the next dish.
