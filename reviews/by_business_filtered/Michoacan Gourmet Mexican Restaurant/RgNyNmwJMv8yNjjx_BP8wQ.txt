Recently I ate out at Michoacan Gourmet Mexican Restaurant. Oh my goodness this place is great!!! I ordered the steak sopitos to start and out came heaven on a plate. The flavor absolutely incredible. My favorite part of the whole experience was the presentation of the guacamole. They prepare it right in front of you. I loved my experience and my margarita. =D =D
