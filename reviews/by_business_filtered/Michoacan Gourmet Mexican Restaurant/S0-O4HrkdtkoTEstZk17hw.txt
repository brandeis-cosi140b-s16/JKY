I've been here about 5-10 times. The service here is amazing every single time. The food is above average. 

On my first visit i had fresh guac made at my table and one of the servers was singing to guests.

On my last visit i took my family there while they were in town (My mom loves the cognac chicken). There were about 7of us including 2toddlers. Everyone was so sweet and patient. The owner or manger even came out and asked how everything was. 

Almost every meal has come with a soup. My kids love it. 
I love enchiladas, theirs aren't the best. I think it's the sauce.. idk..
My husband gets the burrito bionico. It's huge, he loves it. And I'd say He's a burrito expert. 

The complimentary chips are always fresh, they give you yummy Salsa, not too spicy, very tasty. They also give you a bean dip. I'm not a fan of beans but i love their bean dip. 

Fresh tortillas

They give you a free warm churro if you can pronounce one of the Mexican countries. That was fun. 

Every hostess, server, has been very attentive. 
Decor is old school Mexican, very cute.
