I had the opportunity to go to this amazing restaurant. My friend ordered me this platter with shrimp that was so delicious I can't wait to go back just to savor the flavor. It has special herbs in oil the flavor was unforgettable. The tortillas are hand made in a window in front of us. To top it off I had a deep fried ice-cream; a ball of white ice cream covered with crushed flakes cereal, flavored syrup on the bottom with liquor and bananas on FIRE!!! It was soooooo good. Clean and unforgettable. Why isn't their one around here?
