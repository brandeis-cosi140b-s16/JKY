Brunch UYE with the gang could almost guarantee any event a five star rating. What made Michoacan a successful venture was the endless margaritas or mimosas, good quality food, and all for $13.95. 

The guacamole with cilantro, onions, jalapenos, and limes on the side allows the guest to doctor up the creamy green dip to their specification. All of those sides could also be added into the tripe menudo as well. Those two items would be the highlight of my meal. Other notable items would be the shrimp ceviche, fresh tortillas, and roasted jalapenos. Two plates was my limit, but it was well worth it.  

Kyle, our server, was on it. Our table was flooded with margaritas at different points in our meal. There was never a point where we had an empty glass in front of us.
