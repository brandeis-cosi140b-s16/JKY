Awesome place. Food is always good. The servers are pretty good too. In the last 2 years I've only had one not-so-good experience with takeout. When I went to pick up there were two hostesses that didn't look so thrilled to be there and were a little on the rude side. Which was pretty surprising since I never had any issues before, other than that i recommend this place for anyone wanting some tasty food! :)
