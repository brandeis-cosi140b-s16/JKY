The best thing there was the guacamole and home made tortillas. Otherwise, NO flavor. Terrible salsa. Bean dip flat. Chips with no salt, no flavor. Three of us had shimp fajitas, chicken burrito and three shredded beef tacos. Where's the flavor?! We went her because the reviews were pretty good over all but blah! 

Would NOT recommend to anyone.
