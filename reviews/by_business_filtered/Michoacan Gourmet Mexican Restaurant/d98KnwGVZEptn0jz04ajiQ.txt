The food is fantastic, feels very upscale.  I was recently at this location for the Paws on the Patio event.  The service was great.  One of my favorite things that I had was the guacamole. They actually make it fresh right at your table. It's amazing.  They also have a great list of delicious margaritas.  Definitely a must to try.
