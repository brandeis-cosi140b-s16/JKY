I remember this place being awesome a few years back. The one in Henderson was always delicious! We went a week or so ago and it was nothing special. The soup was tasteless, I had to throw our salsa in it to add flavor (salsa was delicious!) The chicken taco doesn't stand a chance next to Juan's Flaming Fajitas (Trop and Ft Apache) or Casa Don Juan (Main St). It was pretty mediocre and had yellow cheese on it (yuck!) Our server seemed nice but very dry and not friendly at all. He especially got a little annoyed with me when I told him they added chicken in my soup that I had asked for with no chicken. Our food also took about 30-35 min to come out, with only about 5 tables in the entire restaurant. We'll stick to one of the Juans I previously mentioned to get our Mexican on from now on. This location ruined it for me.
