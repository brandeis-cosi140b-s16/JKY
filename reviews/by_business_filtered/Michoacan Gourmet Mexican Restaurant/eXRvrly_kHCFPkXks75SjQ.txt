For a Mexican chain this place is above average. but barely. The chips and salsa are flavorful and there are lots of menu options. Entrees are generous but lack some of the spice that I expect from Mexican food. I found many of the items bland, like the enchiladas and the rice. I may visit again, but probably for appetizers and drinks.
