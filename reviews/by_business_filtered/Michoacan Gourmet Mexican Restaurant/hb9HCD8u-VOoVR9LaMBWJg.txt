At $13.95, their AYCE Sunday Brunch is a solid deal. Although the buffet looks small, there are ample offerings and they are mostly good. My favorites today included the Menudo, the Gallo Al Cognac, Shrimp Ceviche, the Huevos dish, and the fantastic Guacamole. The Chile Verde had a tasty sauce to it, but the beef was just too tough.

What puts their Sunday Brunch over the top are the drink-till-you-drop margaritas and mimosas. I didn't try a mimosa, but I had a mango and a strawberry frozen margarita. I also tried the Midori frozen margarita and others in our gathering seemed to enjoy all of the available flavors. You can get a frozen or a classic margarita on the rocks.

I don't venture up these parts often, but I'll keep it in mind the next time I'm looking for a solid Sunday Brunch.
