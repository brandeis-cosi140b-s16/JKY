Quite honestly, this review receives one star only because the food was very good. That concludes the good. Now with the rest:  After being seated, we did receive our chips and salsa (which the salsa and bean dip were very sparse). After approximately 20 minutes and no server was in sight, we asked the busser if she could locate the server. No water, no drinks, no more chips and salsa. Nada. After 10 more minutes the server finally came and took our order. Fajitas for two and kids chicken fingers for our son, and drink orders finally placed as well. 10 minutes later, the dinner salad came out, but still no drinks. We finally received our drinks several minutes later. Service at this location was awful to say the least. 

The server NEVER returned to check on us, refill drinks or anything else. It was as poor service as I have ever experienced. We waited nearly 20 more minutes after we were done with the meal in order to get the check. We asked the busser for to-go boxes, in which she brought one back and literally threw it on the table into the leftovers. That was the final straw. We asked for the manager. When all was explained to him, the manager seemed much less than interested in the issues. He offered no apologies, only dessert.  We asked for the check, and still we waited. Another 5-6 minutes and we had enough. We approached the reception desk and demanded the check at this point. 
I can honestly say this will be the last and only visit to this location.
