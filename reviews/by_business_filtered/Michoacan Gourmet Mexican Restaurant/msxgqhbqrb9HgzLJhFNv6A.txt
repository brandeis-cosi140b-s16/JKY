Good food. Average Mexican food. There were Latinos eating here on a Thur night. More than a few, always a good sign. Live one man band as we entered. Margaritas made with sweet and sour instead of real lime juice, points deducted. 

I had the skirt steak, my wife had the porterhouse covered in salsa verde. 
Both were very good, although the porterhouse was overcooked a bit. My advice is to always order your steaks one level underdone when not in a real steakhouse. 

The service was very friendly, attentive, and courteous throughout. 

The food is good, but not REALLY GOOD. And certainly not great. I'm Hispanic, it's not that difficult to make tasty rice or beans, but Vegas strikes out once again. 

This place is just a couple of blocks away, good food, but I'm good for another year.
