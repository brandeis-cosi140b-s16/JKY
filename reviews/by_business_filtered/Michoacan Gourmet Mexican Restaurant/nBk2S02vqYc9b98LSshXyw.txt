As part of our Vegas on a budget, my sisters and I stopped here on Saturday and ended up having the buffet so that we could try the house specialties like the Biria, Chile Colorado, Carnitas and Camerones...that and the $13.95 price tag came with unlimited margaritas. We chose Lindo Michoacan because it has won Best of Vegas for Mexican food for many years in a row. I have a hard time believing this is the best Vegas has to offer. The food was very average. The house-made tortillas were good, the specialties mostly bland, the margaritas were made with Sweet and Sour and were very generic. Their house salsa served with chips is very poor. Our server was very courteous and efficient, but there was little for him to do, since we were mostly serving ourselves.
