After getting my swole on at the gym I hit up my broski Milkshake to grab some food. He tells me about this Mexican restaurant called Michoacan. At first I thought he was talking about the new Mexican Transformers movie similar to the Decepticons. Sadly he wasn't and we were headed on our way.

 After we parked we started walking towards the restaurant and all of a sudden a young African American urban youth appears on some cheap poverty scooter. I didn't think kids rode those things anymore. The 10 yr old compliments my bro on his legit/10 tats and then asks us for a dollar! His homies were prolly laughin at his broke a$$. So my bro goes "yo kid, you way too young to begging for money. How about you get a job?" I started lol'ing and as we walked inside, the urban youth yells "hobos!" I was like this cant be real tea. 

 We walked in and said "2". The Latinas were mirin. They knew our status. We sit down and in 2 minutes ordered waters and a beer. After grubbing on dat dere nachos with bean dip we ordered fajitas and a burrito. Chicken burrito. 

 The bar was starting to get packed with overweight blonde girls with a tattoo on her back that said "American Girl Bada$$" or something like that. I lol in my head and continued the conversation with my bro. Server was great and so was the food. There was an older Mexican dude playing the keyboard. Every song sounded the same. Some kind of Mariachi music. It reminded me of the time when I was in SA at the Alamo. 

 Despite the urban youths running around outside trying to hustle, I would definitely eat here again.
