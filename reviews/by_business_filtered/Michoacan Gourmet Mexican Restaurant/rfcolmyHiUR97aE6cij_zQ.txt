DO NOT EAT HERE!!!  Went here for my birthday; there were seven of us.  Six of us got sick with one going to doctor and being diagnosed with viral hepatitis...that comes from employees who don't wash hands after restroom use and transfers bowel or urine remnant to the foods during prep.  That then resulted in acute pancreatitis.  Missed work for a week and a half.  Most miserable week ever!  Do yourself a favor...DO NOT EAT HERE!!!
