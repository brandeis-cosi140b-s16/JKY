VERY PLEASED WITH THIS RESTAURANT.

I'm new to L.V. and don't eat out much, but I have been here three times now. The service has been very good every time and I think the food is quite yummy. I LOVE the Fideo soup and the guacamole made table side. I'm a pescetarian, so I have never tried any "meat" dishes but I really enjoy the Tacos de Pescado (fish tacos). They always have live music and the house margaritas are really tasty!
