My wife and I go here often. The food is very good but what sends this place over the top for us is the superior service. By now the wait staff know us by name and treat us like old friends. I'm sure the level of service we receive is observed behavior from Mark, the owner who is often wondering the restaurant, striking up friendly conversation with customers. I am happy to say the great habits of the owner, Mark, have rubbed off well to the hired staff. I can honestly say, even on days we dine there and Mark is not there, the waiters, waitresses, services, bartenders all have treated us very well.
As far as the food, I have not had a bad meal. The menu is very large and there is a large selection. I personally recommend the seafood selections but if your unsure, I have always received great recommendations from the waiters.
