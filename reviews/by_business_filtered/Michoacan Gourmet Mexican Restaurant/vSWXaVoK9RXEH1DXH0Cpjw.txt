My wife & I frequent this restaurant in NW Las Vegas whenever we go out for Mexican food. The various camarones dishes are my favorite, always good. We've been to many restaurants in LV over the past 20 years - this is one of the best managed places we've been to. I always figure, if the restrooms are spotless, that's probably indicative of the cleanliness of the cooking areas. This owner takes special care in running an establishment where the customer is king. Because he is focused on the customer we often go out of our way to give him our business. I'd highly recommend giving it a try.
