Since our visit a month ago, this restaurant has gone from extraordinary to ordinary.  The shrimp have gone in size from huge to tiny size.  The service was slow and it took forever to get our food.  The sauces are still wonderful but I don't think we will eat here again due to the portion size and the slow service.

By the way this  is Michoacan Gourmet Mexican Restaurant, not Lindo Michoacan, but a part of that chain.  The address above is correct but I noticed that many of the reviews are for Lindo Michoacan and not the one on Tropical Pky.
