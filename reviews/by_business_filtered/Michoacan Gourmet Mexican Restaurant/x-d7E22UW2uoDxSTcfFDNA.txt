I have eaten here several times and they get 5 stars before tonight 5/13/15.  our servers name was Luis and the busser that helped us was Nathan. We ordered a cheese quesadilla for an appetizer my wife had the chicken chimichanga I had the number 6 from the combination menu. Our appetizer came out and it was delicious my wife was waiting on the soup and then our meal came she politely inquired about the soup which I didn't know we got with our order they promptly brought out the soup and out of nowhere Luis apologized for the delay and immediately offered us sopapillas at no charge this was completely unnecessary but such a touch of class, needless to say the food was excellent the service was completely over the top I would recommend this place a thousand times thank you to the staff for having such an amazing atmosphere and really making our night special
