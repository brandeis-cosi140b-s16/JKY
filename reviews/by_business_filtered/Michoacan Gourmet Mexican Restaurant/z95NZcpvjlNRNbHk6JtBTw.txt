Pretty solid Mexican restaurant.  They offer the full assortment of menu offerings that we've come to expect from all of the Michoacan restaurants around town.  The food is good, but falls short of recipes at the other restaurants.  It's like there's just a little something missing, and the prices are anywhere from $2-6 higher per dish.  

Be patient.  The facility is a fairly small and during dinner time there is often a wait to be seated.  

The one area that they really conquer and rule the competition is their Sunday brunch.  None of the other Mexican joints can hang with their brunch.  It's a full buffet bar with freshly made dishes, soup, salad, and desserts.  Their tortilla soup is to die for; they offer fresh ingredients, that include ingredients such as avocado and creme fraiche to fix the soup up yourself.  Sunday brunch is $14, which includes the food and drinks.
