I really enjoy going to this place!!  It looks like a little hole in the wall but the food is great!  As well as the service!  It's close to my boyfriends work and that's how I found out about it!  Everyone he works with raves about their salsa!  And it is de-lish!  Every day they have lunch specials and it's very affordable.  They also have outside seating which is nice.
