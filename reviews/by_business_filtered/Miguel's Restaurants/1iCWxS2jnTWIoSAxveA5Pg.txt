Don't be afraid by the exterior! Lunch date here with my co-workers after our weekly meeting. First off...I really should have gps'ed the address because this place off the beaten path...or maybe too beaten. It's actually on an I-85 service road nestled between a chain hotel and an old motel. I must say I was a wee bit concerned when I got out of the car. But it was all good when I got inside.

I ordered the Quesadilla Rellino (sp) and a side order of guacamole. Of course the guac came out first and maybe its because I make a mean guacamole but this was a watered down avocado mousse with very little seasoning. I had to ask for a lime and shake some s&p before I could convince myself to eat it. Not okay!! My quesadilla however was awesome!! The chicken was seasoned so perfectly, I really could have eaten buckets of it. Overall, I will definitely try this place again san guacamole.
