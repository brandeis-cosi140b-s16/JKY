I'm officially a fan. There's room for improvement but it's everything I'd look for if I was looking for a locally owned, non-chain Mexican restaurant.

We did have a service oops. I asked for cheese dip (queso) when we sat down and ordered our drinks. It never showed up. I think the waitress forgot because it wasn't on the bill either.

The inside dining room is SMALL. As you can see from pictures that others have posted, there is also an outside portico for dining outside when the weather is nice.  Tonight it was windy and threatening rain so we didn't have that as a choice.

The location is nothing to write home about but the kitchen turns out very edible food.  Having lived in the southwest for 5 years, it doesn't measure up to what I got out in TX, AZ, etc. but by Charlotte standards, it's fantastic.

I had the Chicken Coco Loco. It was tasty!  My dining mate had stuffed pablano peppers. He cleaned his plate.

I wish I had seen the Thursday special before I ordered! I would have enjoyed that too... "Special Burritos".

For families, remember the space is constrained. I would not bring a rambunctious kid here. Your neighboring diners will be ready to strangle you and the kid.
