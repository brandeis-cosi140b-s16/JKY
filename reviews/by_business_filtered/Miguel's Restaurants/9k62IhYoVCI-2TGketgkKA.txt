The service here is great, they are very attentive to our needs. The restaurant was packed for dinner last night. Margaritas were tasty and on special! $7.99 for a half pitcher. Food was hot and tasty. I had the chimichanga which is offered soft instead of fried if you want. Charlotte style was different as only the meat was inside. The beans, cheese, sour cream and lettuce and guacamole are on top/side. My sis had enchilada and a burrito special which was wonderful. Rice and beans on the side. 
Great place and I would definitely recommend if you are in the area!
