So unbelievably good! Had an overnight layover in Charlotte and the shuttle driver recommend this place. So glad I listened! The food was outstanding, employees very friendly, decor so cutie, and service was very quick. 
The menu was huge. Around 8 pages. One that was all vegetarian options and another of American style food. So nice to be able to order tacos with a side of french fries. 
If this place was in Austin, TX I would eating here frequently! 
Very fantastical! Deserves more than 5 stars.
