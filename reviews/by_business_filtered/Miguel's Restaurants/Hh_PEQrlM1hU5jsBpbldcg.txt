The first time I went to Miguel's I ordered the fajita plate. That was pretty good. The second time I brought my wife and we ordered the special Steak Burrito plate. We also ordered guacamole on the side. Nothing was authentic and nothing was fresh. The steak was like the Philly cheese steak you would get from a frozen box and the guacamole was definitely not fresh avocado. The chips and salsa... chips were made fresh as they were still warm and salsa could be freshly made but not sure. I was disappointed the second time. Not sure if I would go back. I can make better Mexican food than this place.
