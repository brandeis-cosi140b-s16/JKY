I think this place is awesome and not because it has my name!! I used to go to CPCC and I would eat here at least 2-3 times a week. The chips and salsa are great and so is almost everything else on the menu. Do not let appearances fool you, this place is special. The price is dirt cheap and the quality is 5 star. The Serrano special is one of the best dishes I have ever had. If in Charlotte you must try this place.
