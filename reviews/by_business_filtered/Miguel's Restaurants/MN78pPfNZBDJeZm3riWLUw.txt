Basic little Mexican restaurant with so so service. The food is reasonably priced and relatively good. 

My favorite part about this place is their outdoor seating area. Covered booths with open air windows. 

My suggestion for this place would be the fajitas, something difficult to screw up. The re fried beans leave much to be desired, they are soupy and bland. I have only had a few different entrees here, usually opting for the tacos or burritos when looking for a quick cheap lunch. 

Miguel's was hard to find on my first trip there, you see it through the woods driving down Little Rock Rd. but the entrance is no where in site, not to mention once you do find it it's a little confusing being attached to a hole-in-the-wall motel next door.
