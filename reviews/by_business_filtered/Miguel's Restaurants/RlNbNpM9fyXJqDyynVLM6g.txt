Yes, it look like it should be in Mexico! But they have the best Mexican food of any restaurant Ive been to in Charlotte. 
Food is always fresh and delicious. Service is always good and prompt. 
Food is reasonably priced (and they have my favorite, chicken chimichangas on special on Wednesdays.. but I never seem to make it on that day)
Miguels is actually the only Mexican joint i will go to.
