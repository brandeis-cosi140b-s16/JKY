I've been to Miguel's over 10 times. I always take family and friends when they are in town. Everyone has always been super impressed. The food is always delicious. Service is OK, but not terrible. They always do their best to accommodate their customers, granted they are always slammed. My go to is ACP with black beans. Their queso and margaritas are a must!
