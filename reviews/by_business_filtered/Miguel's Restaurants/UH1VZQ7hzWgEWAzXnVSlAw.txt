The kind of of place I miss in San Diego.  Authentic Mexican, ho hype, great taste at reasonable prices.  Check their web site for the specials.  Busy on Thursday night at 9pm.

Their menu was extensive with many items for the non-Mexican food fan.  Looking at most of the dishes coming out, they are healthy portions.  The beers come in huge mugs.

I will come back... Often.
