As everyone else has pointed out already, this place is not much to look at.  HOWEVER, just because they don't spend their hard earned cash on decorum, doesn't mean that they don't keep this place clean.  I am not a neat freak, but I was pleasently surprised/satisfied with the cleanliness of this place.  So don't worry about coming hear for sanitary reasons.

As for the most important part - the food.  The food is delicious - classic authentic mexican - can't go wrong here.  It's also outrageously cheap.  I was hear on my company's dime so it didn't matter.  I went all out and the bill still came to under $10 for lunch.  Enjoy!
