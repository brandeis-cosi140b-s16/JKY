As other yelpers have indicated, it is hard to not be deterred when you first pull up.  The old building combined with the large Motel sign caused me to pause and think of going somewhere else.  However, thanks to positive reviews on Yelp, I continued inside and had a very good meal.  Pricing is very reasonable and the food is good.  The service, although not the friendliest, was solid and my server checked on me often.  I was in and out in about 35 minutes, but didn't feel rushed.  Overall, I would recommend Miguel's for someone looking for a Mexican food alternative to the national chains.
