The first time my husband brought me here for dinner I thought he was out of his mind. I'm so glad i kept an open mind. It took me a few visits to find my favorite entree and now that I have I'm addicted. My new favorite meal is the arroz con camarones (Shrimp w/ rice). The onions are sweet and the shrimps are flavorful. Yum. Of all the times I have visited Miguel's I have never had a bad experience. The servers are always attentive and nice. Definately give it a try!!
