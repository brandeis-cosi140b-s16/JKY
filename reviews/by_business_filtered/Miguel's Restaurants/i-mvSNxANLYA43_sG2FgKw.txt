This place might scare you at first glance.
But don't miss out!! Beer mugs are frozen. Beer is cold, service is friendly fast and food Is great!  It seems to be a family run business. It NOT a chain. It's not a shnazy place, booths and picnic tables. If you a foodie this is not a place to miss..if you are
a snob..don't bother.. Again..great Mexican food!! Home made salsa. Everything is made to order.
