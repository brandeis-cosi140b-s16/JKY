I have been to Miguel's many time in the last 5 years.  It is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants, period.  Best dish is the enchiladas verde.   Good iced tea and beer.  Chips are only OK, but salsa is excellent.I generally do not trust Mexican restaurants that do not have cracked vinyl seats and fuzzy paintings on the wall, but I will make an exception for this place.  It only has cracked vinyl seats.  Don't go here for atmosphere; it looks like an old drive-in Sonic Burger from the 60's.
