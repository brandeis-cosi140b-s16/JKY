Had to stay overnight in the area and the hotel suggested we try this place but that had warned us that is was a "hole in the wall" and that was exactly right. It could use some TLC.

Moving onto the food, they have a HUGE menu. So many meals sounded so good, I had a hard time deciding. We started with the queso and guac for an appetizer which was decent. Since it was a mexican place i did order 1 taco, I had to and glad i did. The people I was with had a pitcher of margarita also which they said was strong but good. For dinner I had the shrimp in garlic sauce which was delicious, a must try. One person though in my party did order the steak and cheese burrito which is not what she got.  We did not complain though, the waitress seemed like she really didnt want to be working that night. Skip desert, not worth the couple dollars, again we asked for chocolate ice cream and got vanilla...bummer!
