One of the best Mexican places in Charlotte, but doesn't look like much from the outside.  While it is in an odd location, the food is awesome and inexpensive.  Everything I have had here had tons of flavor.  The service was simple and fast.  It is a great lunch spot.

Go here.  You won't regret it.
