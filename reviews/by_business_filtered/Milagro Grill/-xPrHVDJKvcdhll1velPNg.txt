RIP OFF! Wow!  What a waste of money. Ordered the Pollo Caldo soup, because another Yelp reviewer said the bowl was so big they needed a step ladder to get to the soup, and it filled up two women.  Unless these women were really coked out, there's no way this tiny, eenie beenie little bowl filled two of them, much less one person, who's not very big, with a not very big appetite to match. Add to that, it was tasteless.  So disappointing. Had to add siracha to make it even worth eating. Also ordered the Papa Y Carne flatbread for my dining companion.  Decent, but NOT worth $12.  You can get much better for the same price all over the Valley. You certainly won't get full on it.  We eat out at least 2-4 times a week. This will NEVER be on our visit again list. So disappointed.
