Milagro Grill was a total and wonderful, surprise!

When you drive into the strip center where it is located, you notice a rather large patio( which is covered), with several tables, sofa's and misters to cool you off. 

Upon entering the restaurant, which is absolutely darling, you're greeted by a super-friendly hostess, and seated. Immediately, a very nice, and accomodating member of the wait staff will give you all the details of this offerings of this dynamite establishment. 

We got there at 6:28 on a Saturday, and the waitress immediately told us there were two minutes until Happy Hour ended. We quickly looked at the Happy Hour menu, ordered four appetizers,and drinks. 

WOW! The food is FANTASTIC!

We ordered the guacamole with salsa and freshly made chips, Steak Tacos, Short Rib Tacos and Camarones Dulces. ALL were absolutely DELICOUS! Although I wasn't wild about my Sangria, my husband tried a glass of red wine that he loved. 

This has become my go-to restaurant for upscale Mexican food, and I love the fact that it's owned by a local family (Macayo's family), the food is wonderful, the restaurant is very relaxing and pretty, and the staff is extraordinarily accomodating. 

See you there!
