Ok, you have heard me say this before and it bears repeating. ATTENTION: New restaurant owners; Customer service!! "Have you been here before?" "Let's make this visit the first of many!" Seriously, Soooo easy to generate more business. All right, I'm off that soapbox. 

Food, AMAZING. Once we got our bartender off her cell phone, very good drinks. and tacos, we went with the pork and short ribs, some of the best tacos I've ever eaten. That is coming from an Arizona native...just great spices/taste. 

Will make this part of my rotation of restaurants.
