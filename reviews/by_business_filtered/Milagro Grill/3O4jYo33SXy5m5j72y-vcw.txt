Wife and I sat at the bar for happy hour.  

All the food was awesome.  Only complaint was the mash 

the PB&J (pork belly & jam) was OFF THE CHAIN!!! I'm picky about my pork belly and although skeptical about this combo I was delighted.

The  short rib Tostadas were also scrumptious.  My only complaint is the potato puree it sits on.  I love the added flavor but it makes for a messy handling.  I'd love it dolloped on top instead.  

The tacos were flawless.

The prices seemed fair. Drink selection great.    I'd rather a little more focus on the the drink menu, seems a power struggle between wine, beer, and cocktails... but since the competition is light  it makes sense here.

The  service was perfect also.  Our bartender forgot to order the guac & chips, We reminded her and told her not to worry since we were full on the rest. She took the initiative to tell management and they brought it out for us at the end of our meal in a to-go bag.  INITIATIVE goes a long way.  Service is below par in the Valley, all it takes is a little initiative to change that.

Very happy!!!!  Can't wait to go for brunch next time I'm back in town.
