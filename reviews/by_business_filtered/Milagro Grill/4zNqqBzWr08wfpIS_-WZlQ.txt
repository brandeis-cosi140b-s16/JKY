My husband, father in law and I went to Milagros grill for my husband's birthday. All I can really say is DELICIOUS!!! I had the papa y carne flatbread and it's one of the best meals I've had... ever. My husband had the surf and turf and my father in law had the short ribs. Everything was delicious. The atmosphere was great. I was so happy that we chose to go there. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is the service could have been a bit better. We will definitely be back!
