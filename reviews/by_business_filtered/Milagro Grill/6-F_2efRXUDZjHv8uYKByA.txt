Yum. So much yum.

I came here w/ a Dishcrawl group. We were seated by the garage door (which was closed as it was starting to get toasty outside). Since we were w/ a set group, we had a set menu. The manager came by and greeted us, very nice. The waitress however was extremely inattentive. 20 mins for water? Really? It was not busy AT all. A couple from our group of 6 finally got fed up and just went to the bar. They were served immediately.

The food, however was very attentive...to my taste buds. We tried 2 of Milagros award winning tacos and man, did they make my taste buds dance and sing. Did that sound cheesy? It was meant to. We tried the pork and casne asada tacos, really, so good. 

I would absolutely come back here for food anytime. And if youre a margarita fan, they have a bunch.
