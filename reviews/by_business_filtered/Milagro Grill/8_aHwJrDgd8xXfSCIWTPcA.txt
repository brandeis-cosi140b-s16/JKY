Wow - So, this is my first negative review on Yelp... 

First of all, I don't care how fancy a Mexican restaurant is, the chips and salsa should be free. $4.00 for salsa and chips is ridiculous, especially when they're not bottomless.

And second, the service was awful. The waitress hardly knew anything about the menu, the restaurant that she has worked at for the past 10 months. The waitress also came to the table every couple minutes, interrupting our conversation and asking stupid questions, ie "are you done with your meal?" as I was putting food in my mouth. 

We were 1 of 2 tables in the whole restaurant that were occupued and they screwed up my order. Not only did they bring me the wrong dish, once they realized it, they told me that the dish I ordered is no longer offered, yet it is still on the menu. I had to wait several minutes for my correct order while the rest of my party at their meal. And then I ate my meal with everyone watching me. Afterwards I was only compensated $4 on the bill. 

On the plus side, the food was good, the ambiance and music were good...However I will most likely never go back to this restaurant again.
