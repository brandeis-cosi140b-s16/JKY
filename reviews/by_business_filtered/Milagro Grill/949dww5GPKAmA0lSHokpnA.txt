Nice restaurant and great staff, especially our waiter, Luke! He recommended the short rib dish and it was wonderful. Portion looked small at first, but it was definitely filling. We went for happy hour...had the salsa flights which was good but drink specials were still on the pricey side. Very nice ambiance; parking can be tough for happy hour.
