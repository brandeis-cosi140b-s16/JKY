We tried the guacamole, short rib tacos, green chile pork tacos and the tostadas.  The tostadas were surprising in that it was more sweet than savory.  Not too bad, I think I would have preferred more of a kick from the purely decorative jalapeno slices on top.  The guacamole and pork tacos could have used some salt but was decent.  The short rib tacos were a bit dry and needed some brightness (pico or any kind of salsa maybe?).  The tortillas were homemade and we were impressed by the texture and taste.

Overall the food isn't terrible.  I wouldn't expect too much though.
