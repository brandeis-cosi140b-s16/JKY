Still love Milagro Grill.  Several great visits.  
Went 4 weeks ago on a Tuesday night,  Our server .......UGH.  Glad I was schooled by him, I ordered  my vegetarian tacos with NO HEAT,  when they were served I said there were hot  peppers on my tacos.  The older gentleman offered to have them redone  but I  was told by the  server that  I was mistaken they were pickled and
 the heat doesn't transfer when they are pickled.  I put them aside, when my husband tasted them he said they were hot.    I have searched the web and culinary web sites and no one seems to agree with him.  He did take them off the bill, although I did not ask for it,   which is good because I couldn't eat them.  I really really like this restaurant, the owners are so great I want them to succeed,  Don't let your servers ruin your business.
