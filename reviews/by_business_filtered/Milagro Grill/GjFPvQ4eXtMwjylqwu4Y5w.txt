Four stars for ambiance but three for the food. We both had the pork burrito which was interesting. It tasted Hawaiian as it had pineapple in it. A little surprising-not very Mexican in flavor. The beer was excellent-Negra Modelo. The sangria needed a spoon to scoop up all the fruit. The service was good but not great. I think that an after work get together on the patio might be a pretty fun experience. The place was not packed but a number of tables were filled.
