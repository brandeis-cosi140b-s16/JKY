What a pleasant surprise - a Mexican restaurant with great food, a fine selection of on-tap beers and cocktails and attentive service. This is not a formula restaurant, rather one with a well thought out, non traditional menu, Prices are reasonable, portions large (especially the chunky guacamole) and, unusual for Phoenix, it's open until midnight.
