I really enjoy coming to Milagro Grill. It isn't the type of restaurant that is a "destination" like The Mission, but when I'm in the mood for some decent "upscale" Mexican food in my neighborhood, it does the trick.

We've been here quite a few times, and the Tacos are usually the go-to entree. Most of them are pretty good so its tough to recommend just one or two, but I'd say the al pastor are the best. We always start with the salsa flight and the guac - both solid options for appetizers. I've also had the shrimp flatbread which was surprisingly really good, topped with a few different cheeses and some sliced grapes.

Drink recommendation: Do not get the skinny margarita - it basically tastes like an overwhelming amount of sweet & sour mixed with a little bit of tequila. DO order the Jalapeno Margarita as its the perfect mix of refreshment along with some spice.

Final verdict: Nice place, good food, good service - recommend if you're in the Arcadia area.
