Went for restaurant week and it was awesome. Loved the tacos. Shrimp tacos were a bit spicier than expected but still yummy. I think my favorite one is the Castillo? not sure of the word but it's the short rib tacos. The churro dessert was just meh, churros were kind of dense and just not really a pleasant texture. Definitely try to sit on the patio is really great atmosphere and service was top notch. I'm giving 3 stars just because I can't give 3.5 and think its a solid go-to but not necessarily a must-go-to
