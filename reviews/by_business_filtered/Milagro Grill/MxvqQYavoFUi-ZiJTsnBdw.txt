Absolutely amazing food from the guacamole to the tacos this is not your typical latin american food.  This is definitely a restaurant I will continue to go back for more.  The atmosphere at this restaurant is stunning and lively.  The staff is remarkable and quick to get you whatever you ask for.  This is one restaurant that is Mexican American fusion and the food is out of this world.  When I feel like Mexican food I will choose Milagro grill from now on.
