Unknowingly ended up at this place for the 2nd time in a week due to reviews via Yelp search. Food first time around took me by surprise. The guacamole is a must have here, amazing first and 2nd time around ! First time around..we didn't make it in time for happy hour but this time I made sure to get a 66' Cadillac margarita which uses custom house tequila and features a Grand Marnier floater  4 stars because the waitress was persistent on trying to get us to buy drinks. I understand she was doing her job but if I wanted, I would ask. Really nice outdoor seating area and phenomenal food. Best butternut squash soup I've ever had! Would say it's something like a spicy lobster bisque substituted with butternut squash for the the tomato base and crab for the lobster. 

Would definitely recommend to a friend!
