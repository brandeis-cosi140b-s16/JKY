I enjoyed another great evening at Milagro Grill. We shared flatbread, quesadillas, ribeye/chimichurri skewers, guacamole, salsa, divine gazpacho, sangria, and fantastic innovative desserts. A great place to celebrate, take friends, or enjoy a tequila flight on the patio!!!! We will be back soon. Thanks to James, Ben, and all the skilled staff!
