After my shave at v's we headed down here for a proper mexican brunch.

The decor is really nice and the service is wonderful. It's a nice clean place that also has a great full size bar.

We started off with the chips and guacamole , which we thought is really weird to pay for since most Mexican places in California provide ships and salsa complimentary.

I ordered the breakfast burrito and the wife ordered the mahi-mahi tacos. First of, the salsa was nothing special, it wasn't spicy at all. The guac was good.

The tacos were the best fish tacos I ever tried. Very fresh ingredients and the mahi was prepared right.

The breakfast burrito was pretty good, it was a little dry and the eggs were scrambled and not folded like I am used to. I think the breakfast burrito should be served with salsa.

All in all, this place is good and serves pretty authentic mexican food. Minus two stars , one for the price , it's pretty pricey. And one for the lack of complimentary ships and salsa.
