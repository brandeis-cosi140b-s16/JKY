I live around the corner from this place. I am happy to see a place be successful in this location!
Bonus: Patio, Orange Blossom on tap, guac and salsas are on point, carne asada skewer is the best thing I've ever put in my mouth, and I can stumble home from here. 

To sum up my review, two words: Mini Churros.
