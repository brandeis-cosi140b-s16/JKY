Milagro Grill is one of those places that's easy to overlook or just drive past.  The vibe is a bit confusing, the decor very masculine, but I go there for their tacos , which are award winning.  The chile verde and the al pastor (pork) are exceptional!  During lunch recently, we had the place almost to ourselves, which I appreciated.  It was easy to have a conversation, without having to talk loudly, which is what you usually find in this popular part of town.  I will definitely be back.
