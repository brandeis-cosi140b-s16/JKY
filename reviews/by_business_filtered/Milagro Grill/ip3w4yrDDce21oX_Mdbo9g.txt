I have eaten at this restaurant quite a few times, and always felt that they offer exceptional food... Until the last time that I went there. I really do enjoy the chicken burrito, and my uncle usually gets the salmon entree; but the food this time was way under par. The salmon was overcooked, And my burrito was drowned in sauce and tomato juice. It was very disappointing, especially since there were only a couple other tables being waited on. It seems like the food is better when the place is extremely busy, which is inconvenient since you have to wait longer for your food. It could have just been a little off that night, so I would go again.
