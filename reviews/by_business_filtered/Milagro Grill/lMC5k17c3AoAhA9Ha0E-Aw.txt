I have been to Milagro Grill three times now, and I have to start out by saying I am 100% in love with their avocado tacos. 
Two of my visits have been around lunch time, and I have to admit that getting a server's attention to be seated is somewhat of an ordeal. It's not that the restaurant is busy (both times I have been one of two people there) but staff is few and far between midday, so you may have to make yourself known. 
Once seated however, all the servers I have encountered have been incredibly attentive and are great at making recommendations. When we visited for dinner, service was all around much better because they were more adequately staffed. 
My only other gripe is that chips and salsa are not complimentary, however they are completely delicious and worth the money! 
Overall, this has easily turned into one of my favorite new spots to go to when out in the east valley, and the avocado tacos pretty much occupy my thoughts 24/7
