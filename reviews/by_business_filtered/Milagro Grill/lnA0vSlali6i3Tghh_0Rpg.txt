I was at this restaurant in their first week and wrote a quick tip about how good the carne asada flatbread was. I did not review the service or anything else at the time because if you go into any restaurant expecting perfect service within their first few weeks of opening, you need get off your high horse and come on back to the real world.  My girlfriend and I have been back at least four times since their opening week and you can see that they've really ironed out the kinks. I think we had so-so service once and great service every time thereafter. 

Atmosphere: Somewhat dramatic with a industrial chic feel. Great for dates. I also picture myself doing a bit of Sunday Funday drinking out on their huuuge patio. 

Drinks: They have a great selection of beers on tap with a few I haven't seen at other places including orange blossom and their own house beer. My girlfriend likes their spicy margarita but is usually drawn to their bubbles i.e. prosecco. 

Food: I reiterate, THE FLATBREADS ARE AMAZING!! I have had all of them by now and each one has been great, they've even added a shrimp flatbread with grapes that I think beats the carne asada one. A feat I didn't think possible. The PB&J de puerco is so good I am drooling thinking about it, slow cooked pork belly, slow cooked tomato jam, peanut puree on a soft torta-esque bun, as Homer Simpson used to say, mmmmm...pb&j de puerco (tongue out drooling).  

I heard they are going to start doing brunch soon, all I have to say is, sign me up!
