came here while on vacation.

I ordered the rib tacos that I saw on Best in Chow, they are ok but I wouldn't rush back. My friend that went with me got the same thing and he loved them, he couldn't stop talking about them for about a week. 
To me it was just like any other taco that you can get at a fine dine Mexican restaurant.
