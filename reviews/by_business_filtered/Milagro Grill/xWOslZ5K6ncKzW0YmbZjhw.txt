Tried this place for happy hour last night- was never really told what was on the happy hour menu, and after looking at our bill, apparently did not order anything on the happy hour menu.

Our server was nice, but a bit spacey. Delivered my margarita with no salt when I had asked for salt, and a vodka martini up, instead of on the rocks as was asked. No big deal, can overlook that.

The food was good, and it was pretty unique. The chips, salsa and guacamole were very good. Tried the ghost salsa, also a favorite. It'll get ya though, so go lightly the first chip or two.

The mahi fish tacos were good, decent amount of fish on each taco. Also had the veggie quesadilla, pretty good.

The menu and drink lists are eclectic, and the decor is beautiful. The patio is awesome, and I am sure as the weather turns, it will become increasingly popular.

With that said, I hope that this restaurant does well. They certainly have some kinks to work out, but noting too severe that should prevent Milagro Grill from becoming successful!
