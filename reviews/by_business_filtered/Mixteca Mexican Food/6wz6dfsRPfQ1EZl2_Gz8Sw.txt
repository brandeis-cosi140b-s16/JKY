Fun Saturday night music venue with good food & beer for only a few $. The music is fun and tunes everyone knows. The 1$ carne asada tacos are straightforward; meat, cilantro, onion, grilled jalepe√±o - delicious! Saw some lucious burgers being served. Will have to try one next time.  Will definitely be back!

As with any outside venue, as a non-smoking asthmatic I appreciate adherence to the 50ft from door rule. I'm sure other non-poluters would appreciate as well. As seems to be the norm, smokers only care about smoking. I can appreciate that its an addiction, but think of others occasionally please.
