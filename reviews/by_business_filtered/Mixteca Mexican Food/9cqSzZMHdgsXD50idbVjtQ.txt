This place is fabulous. My husband was feeling sick with a head cold and wanted soup in the middle of a hot summer night.  He chose "Cocido" a Mexican favorite soup. Yum yum!  I am I great cook however a very busy salon owner which means I'm too busy to make him his soup. I can truly say that the way they made this soup is Very,Very Authentic. The bones which I'm sure not every bowl gets one is what makes this broth full of flavor and all the vitamins needed for my sick husband. Thank you chefs for such a pleasure 

This will be our new favorite spot
