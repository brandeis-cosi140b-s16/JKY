I want to give more stars and really like this place.  Service was ok, carne asada tacos pretty good.  Price is cheap.  They have beer.  Nice layout and good location.   All great things but................The place is filthy.  If you can't or won't maintain the dining room and bathrooms then just imagine the kitchen.  We didn't catch them on a bad day either.  What a shame.
