My family and I have eaten at this place a lot. It's usually pretty decent. But tonight our shredded beef tacos were literally sour. I thought it was just my taste buds so I tried to keep eating it. Then I realized the meat smelled putrid and had gone completely rotten. We called the manager, wasn't super helpful. Won't be going back.
