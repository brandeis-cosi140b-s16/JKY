Eat here! I ordered the street tacos and they were authentic...I could actually envision getting the same plate somewhere in Mexico. It was delicious and cheap! 

The ingredients seemed fresh. The serving was plentiful!

The service was fast and friendly. They were busy the entire time I was there and all the other customers seemed happy. There is a patio and it looks like they could host a pretty fun event out there, if needed. There are a couple of tvs so you can watch your favorite sporting event as well.

Keep it up, Mixteca! I'll be seeing you again on my next trip back to Phoenix.
