Mixteca is a cool little Mexican shop in the Glendale area. On Friday and Saturday nights they have a car show in the parking lot and music, sometimes even bands out there. It's really cool. 

As for the actual food here, I've only ordered breakfast burritos which are the bomb. Literally speaking, they can be a gut bomb but that not is always a bad thing. I recently ordered a bacon, cheese, egg, potato burrito and it was excellent, just really hard to finish, so think about sharing? I have had better breakfast burritos in my life, but I've had a lot worse, and this one is was far from the worse.  I wish I could give a half star here to make it 3 1/2 stars for the carswhows at least!

Anyways this is a good local hangout with decent food.
