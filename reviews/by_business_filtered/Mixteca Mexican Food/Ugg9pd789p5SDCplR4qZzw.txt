My taco tasted just like KFC.  Mixteca somehow found out the Colonel's secret recipe and put it on the taco meat.  While it may actually sound kind of good, no, it wasn't.  
The food wasn't very good overall, it was maybe good in the bland 'bertos-esque way that some people seem to like.  The food just wasn't cheap enough to explain away the bland and terrible taste of it.  For the two of us it was barely under $20 and we didn't even each get our own drink.  
The highlight of the meal was the drink we shared.  We got a canteloupe/watermelon drink that was off the chain.  Saved themselves from a 1 star review with that gem.
It was crowded and not friendly.
