I've eaten here twice now, once for breakfast and once for dinner.  The food here is just okay, in my opinion.  It is good for when I'm in a crunch and craving Mexican food and need a quick, convenient spot to chow down at.  However, there are definitely way better Mexican dining options out there.  I had the chorizo, egg, and papa breakfast burrito most recently when I visited here.  It is huge!  Definitely big enough to split between two people, and good portion size for the price.
