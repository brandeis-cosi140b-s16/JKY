Not a good experience. Ordered at the counter and the guy who took my order was rude and not helpful. Then I waited 20 minutes for my food and was really disappointed with it. We had a carne asada burrito combo plate and an a la carte chile relleno. Everything was lacking flavor and I would highly recommend going somewhere else for fast Mexican food.
