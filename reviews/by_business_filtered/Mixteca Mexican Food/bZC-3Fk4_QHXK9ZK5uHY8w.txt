Have been coming here for a few years now and WOW how much work they have done to improve the restaurant! The patio looks amazing!! The food has always been amazing too! I always get the combo and shrimp cocktail and it never lets me down!! You get your chips and salsa after you order and they have a variety of salsa to choose from! I have so many good things to say about the restaurant that my review could keep going! AND they have a drive though!!
