I went through the drive through and ordered 1 burrito and chips and salsa. Got home and realized I didnt have my burrito. I didnt have enough time to go back and come back home again, so I got ready for work, and then went back on my way to work. It had now been about 45 minutes since I was at the drive-thru. I walked inside this time, and explained what had happened. The girl didnt' seem to care. She grabbed a burrito that had been sitting in the corner by the drive thru for this whole time apparently. I was hoping for a fresh burrito to take to work, not an old one that had been sitting out. She said they could charge me for a new burrito. I said no thank you I will just take my money back for the one I never got. She did give it back but dropped my money on the counter with a little attitute. I guess it was my fault they forgot to put my burrito in the bag? Went across the street to Carambas to pick up lunch instead. Love Carambas!
