No idea how Mixteca doesn't have 5/5 stars across the board. I've lived in the Southwest United States my whole life, I know everything from cheap taco trucks to 5 star gourmet Mexican food and I will say, Mixteca is right up there in the top few Mexican Restaurants I've ever been to.

The food is absolutely fabulous. It is the very definition of home made. It tastes as though it was made in some one's home kitchen, some one with a lot of culinary skill. The Enchilada Plate, Chile Rellenos and the "Mixteca Wrap" are definitely my all time favorites. 

The service is phenomenal, top notch, couldn't be any better. The owner is often in there busting his ass in the kitchen and even taking people their orders or helping however he can, he's very hands on and seems very friendly to his staff, which goes to explain why they themselves are so incredibly friendly and cook such amazing food.

On Saturday nights they hose a huge classic car show in the K-mart parking lot that they share. What better than live music, cool old cars and the best Mexican food in Phoenix? If there was a 6th star, I would give it to Mixteca.
