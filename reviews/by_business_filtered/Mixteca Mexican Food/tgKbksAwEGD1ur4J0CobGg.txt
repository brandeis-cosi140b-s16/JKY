The fish tacos are made from frozen fish sticks. The menudo is dirty (tripe, pansa, or fatty meat is never washed) that's why they only have red menudo because they don't want you to see how the tripe is colored brown or gray. It is suppose to be white, I made menudo for 25 years. They overcharge at the registers, that's why they don't give you a receipt with item-to-item charges or sometimes they don't give you a receipt. They basically have ripped people off for years because they did it at La Perla Mexican Restaurant which is much worse there, everyone that works or partially own both restaurants they have sex on the tables after hours or in the bathrooms and only gets cleaned every other day. They pay off the health inspectors to give them a Grade A clean bill of health rating. I wonder if they clean the meat, chicken, or pork, probably not because they know they're going to feed them to a bunch of drunks or people don't care what they eat. Are you sure they're not serving horse meat or dog meat?
