Just OK. The staff was not friendly at all. The Carne Asada does have flavor, but they drown the chile relleno in sauce & cheese when you get the combo plate. I've never had a chile relleno with sauce. I couldn't even taste the chile with all that goo on it.  If a Mexican place does not have great beans, it shows that they do not take pride in their food. Mixteca's beans were blah! The salsa bar was a mess when we got there, and the bar lacks flare.
