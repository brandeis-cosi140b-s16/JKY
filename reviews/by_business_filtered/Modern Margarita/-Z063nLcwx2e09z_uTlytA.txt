We tried happy hour on a Thursday evening.  The place looks really cool and I had high hopes.  We ordered the 3 salsa flight and chips, those were really good.  It went downhill from there.  The chicken wings were cold on the inside and had to send those back.  We never did get plates that we asked for.  We were told the dishwasher was behind.  The manager took the wings off our bill but charged us for what we ordered instead, which we waited a long time for.  It seems they have kinks to work out.
