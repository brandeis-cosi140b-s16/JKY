Great drinks and bartenders, but that's where it ends. Hostess stand and table staff too slow. People waiting outside and multiple empty tables unbussed outside. Saw one couple steal a dirty table. Hostess noticed and did nothing, which caused an argument with the server. Very unprofessional. Give them time, they might improve.
