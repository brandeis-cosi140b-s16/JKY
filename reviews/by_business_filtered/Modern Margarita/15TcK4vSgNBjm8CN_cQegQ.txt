I didn't have my expectations set very high after only seeing a 3 1/2 star average on Yelp.  But I was pleasantly surprised as the tacos were good, and the happy hour was even better.  I had the trio of shrimp tacos and our table shared some guacamole, carne asada tostadas, and steak fries.  Everything was really good, and the pacing of the food was great as well.  I definitely prefer the hole in the wall Mexican joint most of the time, but the upscale Mexican restaurant has it's place and this one is a good one.
