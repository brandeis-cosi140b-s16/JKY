We went on a living social deal and we felt that this place was fun, great food and yummy Margarittas with great value for the money.  They were having happy hour so we added guamole, and 2 beers.
 
Started with the salsa sampler with free refills tasty. My husband had the grilled fish tacos and loved them, however for some strange reason mine didn't taste as good, however i told the waitress Jen and she asked if I wanted something else.  i asked for ONE carne asda Taco and I felt is was very good and again yummy.  I also took the other 2 carene asda taco's to go.

Customer service here is 5 star.  They really try to please their customers.  Can't wait to go back for Sunday happy hour which is all day for food and drinks.
