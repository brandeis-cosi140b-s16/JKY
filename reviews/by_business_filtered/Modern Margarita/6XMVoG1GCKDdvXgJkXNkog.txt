Was here for a singles event. Kind of a skinny setup, but it was crowded, so tough to move around. Patio is small in the back, but bigger in front. Huge bar and fair drink prices on this Saturday night - only 4 bucks for a Dos Equis from ole beer bucket gal. Jello shot girl passed me about ten times, but never asked if i wanted a shot. Free chips and triple salsa. Green was hotter than the red in this case and pico de gallo is always a safe choice.
