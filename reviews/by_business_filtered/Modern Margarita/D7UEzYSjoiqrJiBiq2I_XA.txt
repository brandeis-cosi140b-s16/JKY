Family went with a groupon deal and we were all very satisfied and plan on returning. Got the taco flight, which gives you five different kinds of tacos, three of each. It seemed like each one was better than the last. My personal favorites were the chicken and the carne asada. The pico de gallo and guacamole was excellent as well. Tried a blueberry "craft" margarita, also pretty good. Bunch of options for margaritas as far as flavors and tequila options. Overall great visit!
