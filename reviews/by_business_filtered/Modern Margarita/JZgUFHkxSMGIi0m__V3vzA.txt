Im giving two stars because it used to be ok. over all This place was a lot better when they first opened. Their drinks have become weak, their chips changed and now taste stale and have that thick store bought texture and artificial yellow color to them, and food almost always comes out cold. We used to be fans... Definitely not coming back. There service is always horrible as well, their women's uniforms are trashy and unattractive (one shoulder dingy shirts and yoga pants) , not to mention no one seems to know what the heck they are doing. Had high hopes for this place but now it's just a bunch of trashy kids running around serving bad food and bad drinks, but not before stopping to give each other piggy back rides down the patio and taking self photos to presumably post online. What happened to professionalism in the work place?

Don't waste your time .
