Modern Margarita is a really good spot for anyone that works around City North or the Desert Ridge area

They have really good salsa, guacamole and tacos- you can get a sampler platter with like 16 tacos if you cant decide which you want to try. 

They also have a really good drink selection for those tough days on the job. 1 knock I have on them is their slow service- which is due to their small kitchen. 

Other than that I would recommend this place to anyone that likes good tacos!
