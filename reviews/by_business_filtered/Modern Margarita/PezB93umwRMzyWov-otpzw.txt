Fun place to go with friends.  The "modern margarita's were excellent.  Chips and salsa "flight" was very tasty.  Like the fact the salsa and chips are free refills.  We ordered three types of tacos--they come in "flights" of three. Loved the carne asada with chimichuri sauce, pork was excellent, shrimp not so good.  Excellent wait staff replaced the shrimp so we were very happy campers!  We plan to go again and try the award winning chicken tacos.  Highly recommend!
