Had lunch here yesterday for the first time and really liked the place. Food was great and atmosphere was pretty cool. Not sure if lunch and dinner have different menus but you can't beat the delicious tacos for just $7. I would imagine that in going at night time, there's a very cool vibe (1/2 the place is outside and perfect for this soon-to-be fall weather). Everything we ordered was very tasty and I would definitely go back again.
