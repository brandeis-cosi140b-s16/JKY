I came here with friends for the first time last night. It was a great night to be out: weather was perfect, the place has a lot of life, and the taco flight!!!! Oh, the taco flight!!!! Five different kinds (3 each): fish (lightly fried), carne asada, pork, chicken and vegetarian. I didn't try the carne asada. My three friends and I ate every last one. My personal favorite (and surprisingly) was the vegetarian - so much so that I had a craving this morning and after running some early errands I stopped by at 11 when they opened to get some more. They are ridiculously good. I'm not a huge fan of mushrooms...and zucchini, to me, is pretty pointless but adding the goat cheese, pickled onion, avocado crema and cilantro/lettuce mix spoke to me. Hell, it was screaming at me, COME BACK! YOU KNOW YOU WANT US!!! What's a hungry woman to do but courteously oblige? No regrets. 
Last night, we had the chips and salsa and a side of guacamole. The guacamole was good enough, but I really liked the salsa. Tastes a little smoky from, I assume, chipotle chilis. I didn't think it was spicy, but my friends thought it had a zing. Today, I had a side of onion rings. Why? I can't tell you. I'm not a huge fan, generally, but once in a while my brain tells me that I like them. Well, now that the fairness disclosure is out of the way, I'll say that these were good: crunchy and not seriously oily. I didn't finish them just because... well my brain sometimes convinces me to do things that have no business being done. But if you're a fan, give them a try!
The margaritas last night: I had a Clooney, which was tasty but lots of ice and too small and then I tried a "casa" which was not "limey" enough: a little too sweet for me. The tropical iced tea I had this morning was delicious. All in all we had a great experience last night, and I look forward to coming back. Maybe for dinner! OK, brain, be quiet now. Oh, service was excellent both times.
