Great food and drinks! The place has a cool vibe and they just started bringing a DJ in for the weekend. Came in here with friends for lunch on a Sunday and they were featuring happy hour all day and the DJ was awesome!!! He played a good mix of music and it definitely added to the ambiance of the place. Great place and I'm definitely considering myself a "regular"!!!! Highly recommend this place!!!
