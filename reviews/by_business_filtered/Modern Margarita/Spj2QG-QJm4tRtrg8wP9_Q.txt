We stopped here for happy hour prior to an event at City North.  The food and margaritas were awesome but the service was terrible!   We sat at the bar and were greeted right away.  The bartender was friendly and made a great suggestion on a house margarita.  After being served our drinks, we never saw her again.  She was still at the bar, but never came to check on us.  We wanted to order food and had to flag down someone to take our order.  Once the food was delivered, no one followed up to see if we needed anything.  We had no plates, napkins or silverware.  After flagging someone to assist us, we enjoyed the food which is the only thing that pulled this rating up!  The food was great!   Still the entire time, we were at the bar, no one checked on us.  There were two bartenders with 5 people at the bar.  At the end of the meal, we had to flag someone down to get the check.   After reviewing the check, we found out that we were overcharged.   Its a shame as the food is awesome, but the service is so bad that we would think twice about coming back.
