This place is a disaster for drinks.  The music is that loungy music you would never listen to on your own-  Not techno, just bad loungy music there-  Hate that kind of music.  

If you get a Margarita, its tough to get more than two sips of your own drink.  They use so much ice,  No kidding,   I could drink the margarita in 30 seconds or less.  Everything is pre-made for the most part and there is so little liquor used you feel you are paying for Margarita flavored Kool-Aid for $8.00 at a time.  

They can't screw up a shot of a Tequila and there is a large(and expensive) selection.  I am not a cheap guy, but hate being ripped off.

I hope this review kicks them in the butt a little bit.  I did not try the food but I went to Modern Margarita to have of  course;  a Margarita.   I will be skipping this place in the future.  A good place to meet in front of and then go somewhere else.
