Anytime we are in Tempe we always eat at sister restaurant Modern Tequila and since we live in North Phoenix, definitely was looking forward to sampling this joint. 

So here is my experience -- our server was either not very smart or borderline rude, couldn't figure out which (Michelle) never brought us silverware or plates even after our main course showed up. When I asked her for silverware she only brought one fork, not for anyone else at the table...girl was in such a hurry that she missed out on at least 4 more drink orders and acted slightly put out when we stopped her to order another round, I don't get it, made me feel uncomfortable just asking for another margarita (good margi's.) With that said will not let this initial experience keep us from hanging on the patio again.
