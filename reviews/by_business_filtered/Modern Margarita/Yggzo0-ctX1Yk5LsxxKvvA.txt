Food is trendy and delicious! Tons of different drink options, obviously a good number of them are versions of margaritas. Go to the all day happy hour on Sundays, sit on the patio.

I didn't give it 5 stars because the service is really bad, they are not rude or anything like that though. It just takes SO long to get someone to take orders. My advice is, don't be in a rush, go with people or a person that you want to hang out with and try to not be annoyed that you've been sitting there for 10 mins and nobody had asked if you want a drink.
