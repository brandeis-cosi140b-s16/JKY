We have now become regulars at Modern Margarita because it is so fantastic. Their happy hour is second to none. You MUST try the agave glaze wings and "Casa" margarita, frozen. Other menus items to try (really, we've almost tried everything and it's SO good): quest, salsa flight, any of the tacos, and their HOUSE MADE tequila. They don't skimp on drinks or service! Our wait staff has been stellar and we look for excuses every week to come here. Support this business and if you're in the area, GO! They are amazing!!
