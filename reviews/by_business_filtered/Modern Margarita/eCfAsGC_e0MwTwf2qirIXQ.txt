The carne asana tacos are the only thing that made me reach deep and pull out a second star. Even they are not as good as they once were. I used to come here almost weekly for the first year or so they were open, but I've only been a handful of times in 2015 and i would be shocked if I return. Steady decline with every visit. Service overall was always a little spotty here, but the bartenders used to be AWESOME and service was always great at the bar if you could get a seat. No sign of the guys behind the bar on my last couple weekend visits so I'd assume they jumped off the sinking ship. The overall vibe of this joint just seems very stale, if that makes sense. I can't really single any one thing out that drove me to make this review, I guess I'm just a little chapped because I used to enjoy going to modern and it was convenient to meet friends or groups. I'm aware that the guy who owns it also has a bunch of other subpar places around the valley so maybe it's just the case of this one also falling into its inevitable niche of basic-ness. Too bad.

Finer details:
- CHIPS AND SALSA: not bad, but not good either. And they charge for them. Which is fine if they are great.

- CARNE ASADA: very good, just ok last couple times.

-MARGARITAS: Meh. Clooney used to be my fav but tastes really unbalanced these days

- AMBIANCE: sleek decor, nice patio. Should be a much sexier vibe, but current staff - and it would seem management - hold it back. Stale energy. Food isn't good enough to try to be a real restaurant.
