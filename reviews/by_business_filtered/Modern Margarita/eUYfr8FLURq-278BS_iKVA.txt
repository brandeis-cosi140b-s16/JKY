Finally checked this place out.....we met some friends there for dinner on a Saturday night. It was pleasantly busy and we had a nice table on the patio. Service was good, waitress was nice and friendly. Drinks were average...I had a couple skinny margs and they tasted pretty watered down, nothing special. Great tequila list and the pricing for tequila and food in general was very fair. The tacos were good....but just like everything trendy, STOP putting so much crap on tacos! Simple and tasty ingredients is all you need to maintain the integrity of the taco. It's meant to be a simple dish....that was really my only complaint.
