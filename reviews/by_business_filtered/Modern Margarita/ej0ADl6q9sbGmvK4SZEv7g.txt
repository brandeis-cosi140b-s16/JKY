Came here for lunch with my aunt and cousin. We shared to mahi mahi and veggie tacos they were great! I love the salsa trio as well. We also had the prickly pear margaritas which were great tasting and pretty strong. Definitely don't want more than one during lunch. The waitress even found a hair clip for my aunt who just wanted her hair out of her face. Great service and great food!
