My husband and I love this place. The tacos are delicious!! My favorite are the shrimp tacos. My husband can't get enough of the Cucumber Serrano Margarita, which is pretty tasty. Adrienne is an awesome server! She's on top of things and always knows when we're ready for another round. We'll def continue to be repeat customers!
