Stopped in last Thursday and received 2for1 Silver tequila for their Tequila Thursday special, i'll be back on Thursdays for sure!!! 
 Also, went on a Tuesday for Taco Tuesday, they have $6 pork, chicken and veggie tacos, as well as a great happy hour from 3-6:30pm, and all day Sunday 3-close, can't beat that!!!
 Try their steak tostadas! Great service, great atmosphere on the patio, great experience!!
