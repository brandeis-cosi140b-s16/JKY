Super cute, posh spot in City North. Enjoyed lunch here after visiting M3V on our girls day. My friend had told us about this amazing taco flight. 

The restaurant itself is really inviting, fun and enjoyable. We enjoyed a salsa flight along with the taco flight. 15 tacos (chicken, veggie, fish, pork and carne asada) so yummy!!! Perfect size and full of flavor! Definitely a must try!
