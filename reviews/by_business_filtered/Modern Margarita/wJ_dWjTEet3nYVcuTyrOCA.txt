Went there for happy hour the other day. I really liked the other Modern mexican place down on Mill but this one didn't have the same feel even though the decor was very similar. I had the chips and salsa flight for $3 and the chips were rather tasty and the salsas were pretty good but I could have used some spice. The happy hour beer deal wasn't great, $3 domestics, $4 mexican beers and craft domestics and $5 for imports. The patio looked nice but gets nailed by the sun in the afternoon and can be hot even with the misting system. Wasn't a fan of the fairly loud lounge electronic music, the interior has so many hard surfaces it can get rather loud. I stayed for a beer and chips but walked across the street to Blue Martini for a much more fun setting with better happy hour deals. Service was a bit spotty. I am not sure that I would go back, perhaps I will give it another shot when it's not summer time.
