I have heard some cool things about the Modern margarita, but you know.. it really didn't impress me. Maybe I am too blame because I sat outside and maybe that was the mistake, because many didn't want to sit outside, and the wait staff sure didn't want to go outside either. With that being said, the service wasn't bad. I have no problem with it. 

The food. 
For being a Mexican fusion place (which is what I assume they are going for) it really isn't much fusion at all. It is actually fairly basic, and if i want basic Mexican food I go straight to the source and I pay basic Mexican cuisine prices. So here I wasn't impressed either. 

As the sun set, it became really cozy out on the patio. With the lighting and the very open space, I could dig it.. but that isn't why I would go all the way up northern Phoenix to do a patio-hang. If that is my desire there is way better places down town to do this. 

Modern Margarita, I will give you one more chance soon. But that's it. Impress me. And I hope you are ready to bring out the fever-dream mule-kick margarita then.
