Great food, delicious (and reasonably priced!) drinks, awesome atmosphere. I haven't had anything to eat or drink that I haven't liked. As far as bartenders go, you can't beat Nick and Wally. They are both awesome at making drinks and helping to ensure that a great time is had by everyone. Ana is a fantastic server- always making sure everyone has whatever they need and always has a smile on her face even when she is super busy. I definitely recommend checking Modern Margarita out if you haven't yet.
