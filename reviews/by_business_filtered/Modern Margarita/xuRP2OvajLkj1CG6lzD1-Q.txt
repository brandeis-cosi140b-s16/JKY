Great spot in a very trendy area. 
I went for a nice Sunday snack during All-Day Happy Hour on a Sunday! 
Great Happy Hour menu with food and drink specials. 
My wife went for a Hot Mango Margarita, I went for a Sonoran(prickly pear syrup)
and they were $5(normally $8) They were both delicious! 
We ordered the Veggie Tacos and Steak Skewers from the HH Menu as well as a Salsa Flight. 
Chips were great, salsa flight was 3 different salsas. Chipotle, Pico, Verde. They were all delicious! The Verde being the spiciest, but still enjoyable! 
The Veggie Tacos were great, lots of flavor and a simple corn tortilla. Steak Skewers were also great. Meat was very tender, and was served with an awesome Chimichurri. 
To finish off the dinner, my wife went for a Strawberry Rhubarb Margarita(not a HH Special) and it was just divine! 
Great spot we will definitely go back to. We're both anxious to try more of their menu. 
Service was great, and their outdoor seating was perfect!
