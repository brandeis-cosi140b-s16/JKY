Our first time here. As a party of six, we tried the taco flight, comprised of 15 tacos - 3 each of chicken, pork, fish, veggie, and carne asada. Service was slow and inconsistent for both drinks and food. The worst part - they don't give you plates with the flight! Only 15 tacos on a long serving platter. We begged for plates and ended up getting two tiny plates and three coffee cup saucers. The pork and chicken tacos were tasteless. The veggie tacos were shredded lettuce and limp mushrooms. The carne asada was good, and the fish was pretty good except the fish pieces were deep fried in a heavy batter. As for atmosphere, it was typical loud bar noise. Much less than I expected.
