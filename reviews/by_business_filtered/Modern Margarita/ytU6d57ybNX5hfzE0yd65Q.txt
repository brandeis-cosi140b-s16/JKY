If you are going to call yourself, "Modern Margarita", it's expected to have more creative margaritas and a few more choices than just seven.  The food portions were small but good.
We were having a fun time up to the point that I asked for a draft beer and the Asian bartender poured a glass with two inches of head and then poured another glass of beer into it.  When he served it to me, I asked for a new beer and he said, "No".
