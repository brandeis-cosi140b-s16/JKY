I have been here numerous times for dinner, and what can I say, I always come back, partly because it's about the only choice real close by and I really can't complain too much about the food. Love the chips, red and green salsa and the bean dip. The servers have always tried their best to make sure we were well taken care of. I typically get the stuffed relleno and it's not the best but satisfying at the same time. My wife will often get the quesadilla and she really likes it (the one with chicken and gauc). 

Now, the other morning we went here for breakfast and it was pretty good. They have a nice selection of both American breakfasts and Mexican. I would come back for the breakfast for sure.
