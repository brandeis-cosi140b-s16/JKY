I actually had lunch here today with my son and I thoroughly enjoyed my veggie burro with beans & rice. My son had the mini (chicken) chimi's and he cleared his plate too. This is my third visit here and I've always enjoyed my food (huge portions) and our bill was only $18.00 including the tip. You can't beat that! It's definitely working it's way up to being one of my favorite Mexican food haunts. Our servers were fast, friendly and so far I've never experienced a problem here. It won't get five stars from me because the restaurant is small and if you don't get there before the rush you may not get a table.
