I would give this place 5 stars if the space was bigger. That being said, I'd also give this place 2 stars if the food wasn't so good. 60% of the staff is unbelievably rude. They act inconvenienced by customers and often congregate together to gossip. They say "Hi welcome to Moreno's" without even looking up. It's often difficult to find a table if going in during weekly peak hours or anytime on the weekends. Our solution to this problem is just to order to go. The food is unbeatable for the area! The mini chimis with jalape√±o cream cheese are to die for! As are the cheese quesadillas and rice! Definitely a go to favorite for our family!
