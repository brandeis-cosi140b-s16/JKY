I got the french toast with strawberries and bananas, it was really good. The french toast slices were big and moist. I also got the Beef Machaca and egg breakfast. It was served with refried beans topped with cheddar cheese, hashbrowns, and warm flour tortillas. I haven't had Machaca in a long time, this was very tasty I must say! 

Service was good, all servers were super friendly, and funny! 

I gave the place 4 stars because all but 4 tables were dirty when I walked in. You seat yourself so it was kind of akward at first. Other then that everythings good.
