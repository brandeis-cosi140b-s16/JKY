I'm sad to say that I don't go here anymore.  Prices have gone way up.  My favorite dish used to be $6.99 and is now $8.99.  I ordered a cup of salsa, which is sooo good.  But after finding out that they charge $5 and change for it, I stopped. I'll just buy some at the grocery store.  Otherwise to just feed myself a meal and chips/salsa, I was walking out of there paying $18. yikes!
