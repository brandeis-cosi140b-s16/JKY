Food is meh. Service is mediocre and the place is clean. It's just a smidgen better than filibertos, I guess the only difference is they serve alcohol. The tortilla around my burrito was so dry it was like chalk in my mouth. Cheese in the quesadilla was old tasting and had already hardened by the time I got it.
