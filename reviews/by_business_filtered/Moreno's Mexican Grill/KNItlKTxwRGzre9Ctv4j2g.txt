The Five Stars are for the entire experience, not just the food itself. Small and unassuming, this place makes very tasty food, serves it in large portions, the prices are dirt cheap, the servers are friendly... What else do you want? I've read a few reviews claiming that the food wasn't good. Maybe, but I've gone with friends and family ten or more times with zero complaints and a face full of smiles.
