3=good. Food looked just like the pictures. Extensive menu at moderate prices. Place was crowded. Food was good.

Four of us tried their Sonoran Dogs which were as good as any. My wife had some kind of seafood burro. There is a picture of it in the album. The other two gals split the mini chimis and something else. All were happy with their choices. 

If I go back up there again, Morenos is a definite consideration.
