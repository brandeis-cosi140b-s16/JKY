Given the lack of dining options in Queen Creek, I had to try this newly opened restaurant. Now I can cross that task off my list. 

The restaurant is a little small and customers can seat themselves. My friend ordered the #10 combo: a tamale (chicken) and enchilada (cheese). I ordered #2 taco (chicken) and burrito (chicken). One thing to note - the first basket of chips & salsa (and beans) is free, but subsequent baskets are charged. So don't eat up unless you want to pay extra. That wasn't a worry for us because while the salsa wasn't bad, neither of us liked the beans. Kind of a weird flavor. That was repeated when we received our meals, which came with rice and beans. I wasn't a fan of the beans then either.

My plate was very good - the street taco was packed. Squeeze a bit of the lime on it and it was very good. The burrito also was packed and although I don't recall spraying it with lime, the chicken had a hint of lime there as well. As Kevin R. pointed out, the rice was excellent. 

My friend's first comments were that the enchilada was very cheese - which is a good characteristic of a cheese enchilada. That was where the highlight of her plate ended. The tamale? Not so much...in fact it was kind of eeck. We both thought it tasted of freezer burn, either way she ate a total of 1/3 of one of the two that came with the order. 

The staff was very friendly. One waitress took our drink order, then two others stopped by to see if someone had taken our drink order. I don't know if that speaks of the attentiveness of the staff, or the perceived slowness of our waitress. Later when our server asked if we wanted a refill, one of the other ladies stopped by to ask the same question. 

If I go back, I would probably just go with an order of the street tacos. Those were excellent and everything else was just sort of okay. Most likely I won't come back, but if I did that's what I'd get.
