I've asked myself each time I've gone here, why did we come here?  The service has always been terrible each time.  It probably is the worst service I have ever experienced  The food is ok, not the best, but tonight it was really greasy.  we had to ask for napkins 3 times and never got any.  There are so many servers but none of them will bother looking in your direction.
I really don't think we will go back again, and I mean it this time.
