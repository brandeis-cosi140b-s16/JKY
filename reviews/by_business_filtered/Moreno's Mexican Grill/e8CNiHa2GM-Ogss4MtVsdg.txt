We've been going to this nice little restaurant for a little over a year now. The food has always been good/ great. The place is clean and the staff is friendly. The service is hit and miss. Sometimes great/ good and then other times not so great. But need less to say we will keep coming back. As far as these bad reviews the only thing I can say is there was two Mexican restaurants and that's including this place and now only one. Not including a fast food chain either. Basically one Mexican restaurant for close to 87,000 people in a town!! That's a lot of people.
