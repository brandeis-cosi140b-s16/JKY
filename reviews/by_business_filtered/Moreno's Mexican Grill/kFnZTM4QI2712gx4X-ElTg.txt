Well, this place has had plenty of time to get they're act together.  The service is horrible!  Food is just ok, which is sad because when they opened they got 4 stars from me.  I'm surprised that they're still in business but there isn't a whole lot of options here. The chips n Salsa/Bean Dip is yummy but that's it. Keep searching!
