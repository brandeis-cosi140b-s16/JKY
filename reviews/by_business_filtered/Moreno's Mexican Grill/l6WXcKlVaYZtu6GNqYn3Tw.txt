I've been here twice, the first time I thought the food was bad. Went back a 2nd time because I was out there again and there is really no where else to go. Figured, "food can't be as bad as I remember." It was, maybe worse the 2nd time. Service wasn't good either. I love Mexican food, but his just is not good.
