With so much Mexican food around this place shouldn't be as busy as it is, overly Americanized, and the atmosphere leaves little to be desired, it's cramped and bright. Topped a crab stuffed entree with way too much processed cheese and ruined it and I'm not sure they're actually putting tequila in the margaritas. Go home and make tacos, don't trust this place to fix your Mexican dinner cravings.
