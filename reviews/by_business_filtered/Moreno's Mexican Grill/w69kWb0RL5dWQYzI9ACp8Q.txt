One of the worst restaurants I have ever been in. Used to go there frequently then we noticed a change. Two employees making out in the booth behind us, Next time we are completly ignored , hardly anyone one in the place. We left after 15 minutes without water of chips.  Food is tasteless, and it is very dirty in the place. Must of changed mgmt , their are so many nice places to eat in AZ go find one  this is not it and they don't care either.
