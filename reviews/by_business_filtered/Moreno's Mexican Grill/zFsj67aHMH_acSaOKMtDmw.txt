I really enjoyed this little Mexican food joint! Even though it is quit small, they are really great at trying to accommodate all of their guest. We were seated right away and were given a very friendly welcome. The chips and salsa are complimentary as soon as you sit down, that alone filled me up for the salsa and cheese dip is amazing! The menu is a decent size, and the portions of food for the price are excellent. My friend and I both enjoyed our meal and had enough to each take home for left over's. I was very impressed by the taste, quality of the restaurant and the friendliness of the staff. I will hopefully make it back out there soon to enjoy another delicious meal. Kudos to the owner for being able to make a little hole in the wall Mexican food restaurant become so popular! Great job Morenos!
