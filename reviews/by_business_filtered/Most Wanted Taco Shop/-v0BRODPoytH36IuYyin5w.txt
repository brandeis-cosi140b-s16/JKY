My second visit here to introduce my BFF and she loved it .  We both ordered the three-taco plate , no sides .  I chose the adobada, carne asada and a spicy beef, she chose three different mild options .  
Their green salsa at the little salsa bar was hella spicy and I loved it.  
Looking for more friends to bring over .  I'll be back :)
