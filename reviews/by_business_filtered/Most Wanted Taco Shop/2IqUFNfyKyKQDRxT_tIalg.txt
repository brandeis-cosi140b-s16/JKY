I went with my family that included 4 children aged 7-13. We were greeted with cheerfulness and an offer to sample the meats before ordering. Everything is prepared fresh and made to order. I ordered the taco salad with the pork chocinita (which has a smoky, spicy sweet with a hint of cinnamon taste)  and pork palo (a mild green chile), which is the best I have ever tasted. All of the children devoured their food which says a lot about the food. It is delicious!  The decor is fun and reminds me of the movie Nacho Libre.  A definite must if you are in the area.
