Holy $hit, this place is good!  Had the tinga chicken taco, it had a little slow burning heat and huge amount of flavor.  My h had the red chile beef taco and said it was amazing lots of flavor and a good amount of heat.  Love that they give you a sample of everything, they are all amazing.  I'm usually really picky but I liked every single meat choice, sampled them all.  You can tell they are cooked slow and low because they are all very tender and full of flavor.  

Loved it so much that I also got a container of the meat to go because I knew I would be craving it again later.  You must go here ASAP.  I can not wait to go back.  Insanely good.
