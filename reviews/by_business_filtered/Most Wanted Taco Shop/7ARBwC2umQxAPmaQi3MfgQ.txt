I heard all of the hype surrounding this place, so I expected to be disappointed...luckily, I was not.  We stopped by and brought our dog and the staff was nice enough to set-up a special table for us outside, so we could enjoy our lunch.  The staff allowed me to try all of the different meat options, so I knew exactly what we would like and order appropriately - love that!  I settled on a pastor bowl and a carne asada bowl for the hubby...wow, this place is sinfully good.  We'll definitely be back!
