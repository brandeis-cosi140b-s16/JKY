Sublime!  I live right around the corner and frequent Il Posto and Scramble weekly.  I noticed signs for a new taco shop and decided to do some Sunday night take-out.  I can honestly say this was one of the best tacos I've ever tested.  The kind owner allowed us to sample all the meats and I ended up with 3 tacos filled with sweet pork topped by cheese, lettuce, cilantro, pineapple (which was magical with the pork) and roasted corn.  The meat was flavorful and tender and the combination of toppings was amazing.  Don't miss the salsa bar.  Lots of choices and all so much better than anything I've tried elsewhere

I'm so glad that Santos Lucha Libre is in the neighborhood.  Don't hesitate to try it.  The Mexican wrestling decor, kind owners and fabulous food is well worth it
