The tacos here are fresh and excellent. Definitely generous in portion size, too. The cochinita pivil and barbacoa were my favorites, but also loved the pastor and carne adovada. The horchata was also super yummy. The lady was so nice, she even let us sample all the meats. I prefer these tacos to Joyride. Definitely don't pass this place up. Great local gem.
