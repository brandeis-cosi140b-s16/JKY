What a great little find (thanks, Yelp!)! 

The staff was incredibly nice and gave us samples of all of their meat options upon learning that it was our first time in the shop. I liked all of their options, some more than others, but you can't go wrong with any. Their spicy options definitely have kick, but lots of flavor, as well!

I went with the green chile beef, creamy chicken, and chicken a la vinagreta. Their choice of 3 large (6" tortillas) or 5 small (4") tacos provides a nice way to sample a bunch of meats! It s one of the best meals we had in Phoenix...and one of the cheapest!

Overall, delicious food, phenomenal service, affordable prices, and nice atmosphere leave me with one rating option: 5 stars!
