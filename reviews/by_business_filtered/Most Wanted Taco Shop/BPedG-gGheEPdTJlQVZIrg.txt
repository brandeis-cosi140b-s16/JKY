The food was delicious and the service was great. The gentleman behind the counter was very welcoming and offered us samples of all the meats before ordering. We ordered the street tacos with chicken, beef, and pork. The only thing I was slightly disappointed with was that they were out of rice. Everything else tasted great and fresh. Will definitely be returning soon.
