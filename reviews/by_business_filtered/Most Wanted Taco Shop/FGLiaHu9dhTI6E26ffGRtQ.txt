Wow! Chipotle ain't got nothing on this place.. The only thing I didn't like was having to choose a meat because they all tasted so good! (Sampled them all) there burrito is unbelievably gynormous and their meats carry authentic homemade flavor. You can tell a lot of love went into this food! Very fresh, very good and very large portions. Also, the Lucha libre theme is pretty hysterical! Love this place!!!
