Really enjoyed this taco joint.  My favorite was the 3 fish tacos which comes with rice.  Even the rice was good.  Everything was super fresh.  The burritos are huge and the tacos were delicious.   Def make a trip out to get some, finally, good Mexican food.  I forgot to take pics cause I started devouring it as soon as the food was prepped.
