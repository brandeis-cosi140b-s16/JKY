This place is bangin! Tucked away spot with an authentic feel and traditional taste. 1lb burritos, street-style tacos, Mexican soda and smooth horchata. 

We sampled all the meats beforehand since it was our first time. There were about 6 choices and all were exceptionally good. 4 of the 6 meets were pretty spicy but not so much to take away from the flavor of the meet. 

If you love Mexican style food make sure to treat yourself here.
