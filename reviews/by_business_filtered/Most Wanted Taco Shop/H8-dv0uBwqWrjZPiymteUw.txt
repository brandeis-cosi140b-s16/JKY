The street tacos are authentic and delicious! This is a hidden gem in Phoenix. When you walk in you are greeted with samples of all the meat they offer so you can decide what you like best (honestly they are all good). We have only ordered street tacos here but the burritos also look delicious. Fresh ingredients, great prices and fantastic customer service.
