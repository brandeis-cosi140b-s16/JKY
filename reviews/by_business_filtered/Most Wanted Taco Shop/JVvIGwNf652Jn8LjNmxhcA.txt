Went here due to the Yelp top 100 rating. If you tell them it's your first time they will let give you like 10 different samples of all the meats before you order. The flavor is there, but they put a lot of juice or sauce in the meats and it makes your taco shells super soggy. My recommendation is to ask for your meat and shells separate and then make your own tacos at your table so that your tacos are soggy before you even sit down.
