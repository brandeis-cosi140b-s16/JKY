I was looking for a new place to try for the annual birthday dinner with the family.  I spent days reviewing yelp and Santos Lucha Libre kept catching my eye.  We tried calling to see if we could place a "party order" but the phone was busy all day.  I was ready to try to find a plan B, but just couldn't find anything that interested me.  So the wife and I decided to roll the dice and just drop in and place an order for a bunch of different items for the family to sample, and I am glad we did.

The tacos here are legit!  We got an order of each beef variety and each chicken variety, as well as a couple of burritos and cheese quesadillas for the kids.  They were all very good.  It all tasted very fresh, and the meat had excellent flavor.  The spiciest beef is just that, spicy; a little too much for some, but again good flavor just a lot of heat.  Everyone really enjoyed the food and I appreciate Santos Lucha Libre accommodating us with no notice.

I now have a new place to go when I need a good taco fix.  The best line I heard was from another customer who was walking out as we were ordering, "I'm still Chipolte Free."   After tasting the food hear, that is not a bad thing to be!
