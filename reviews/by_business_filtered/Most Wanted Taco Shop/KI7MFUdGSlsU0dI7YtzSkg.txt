There is usually a good reason that a restaurant has high ratings. Sometimes its just the food. Sometimes the service. Sometimes its more...

Santos hits 5 stars across the board. I had been wanting to try this place out for months after reading about it on yelp. Finally went a few weeks ago. 
Small place tucked into a strip mall on the west side of 7th street. 

Its nicer than it looks in many of the pictures on yelp. 

When you walk in you are greeted by the smells of tasty Mexican treats. 
Were were great by a very sweet lady (possibly the owner) who asked if we had been in before. When we said no she invited up to sample all the meats before we order. 

After tasting all the types f meat ranging from mildly spicy and sweet to quite spicy. I ended up ordering a few different types of tacos. Including the green chilli beef, the abodaba, and the Cochinita pibil (pork).

All were absolutely delicious and spicy. 

This place is great and totally worth checking out. Not your typical taco stand...much, much better.
