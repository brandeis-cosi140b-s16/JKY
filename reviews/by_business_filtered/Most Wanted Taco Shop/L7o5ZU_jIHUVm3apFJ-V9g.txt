Tried about 8 different tacos all different meats and it was just ok.  Yes, some were spicy but that was it, wasn't flavorful like I imagined from their yelp reviews.  Excellent customer service!!  Was given tasters of everything!  Blacks beans were decent...  I guess I was expecting more authentic.
