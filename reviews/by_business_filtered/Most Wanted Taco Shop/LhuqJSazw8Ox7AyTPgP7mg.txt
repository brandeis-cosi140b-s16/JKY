So I thought this place was gonna be awesome, but sadly I agree with the "average" comments.  I didn't take interest in the food.  If you want great tacos and burritos, eat somewhere else.

Santos Lucha Libre is a cute spot.  Clean and decent.  The decor makes it obvious the appeal is for USA americanos and not necessarily Mexican americanos.  

I got there before the crowd and took my time assessing the menu.  Typical dishes.  Meats and veggies were already prepared and sitting in the trays, the small salsa bar had some thin salsas sitting out.  El muchacho behind the counter was friendly and accommodating.  He invited me to taste the meats, but when I kindly let him know of my non-flesh desire he insured me that the rice and beans were 100% veggie.  

Rice and beans?  Really?  That's all you got?  
Just imagine my disappointment.  
No spinach...
No mushrooms... 
No cactus...
No jackfruit...  
No bell peppers and onions... 

Oh, but they also have breaded cod.  Would I like to eat a greasy deep fried fish taco?  Um, no thanks.  Not today.   

But I didn't want to leave empty handed, so I opted for the chips and guacamole.  He added a spoonful of tomatoes to the guac tray before scooping a serving out for me.  Wish he hadn't done that.  Guacamole is one of my fave dips and he just made it taste mediocre.  Chips were mediocre too.

Sigh.
