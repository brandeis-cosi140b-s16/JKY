Great food, they let you try all the meats so you get exactly what you want. Some were a little spicy for my kids but they had plain carnitas and shredded chicken that worked great for them. Everything was loaded with flavor and the service was !Excellent! BTW I love the Luchadore Design. Price was low, quality was high. Best place I've been in a long time.
