I went in for a quick fix not knowing what to expect beyond a fast casual taco shop. The reviews seemed good and my husband was hungry. I ordered him a carne azada burrito and three enchiladas for myself. The add the fixings to your liking so that was good. My order was made into tacos not enchiladas but rather than waste food, I took them anyway. I tried the chicken and chile verde. I loved them. Very spicy to my liking. Just loved them. My hubby was so impressed with his massive burrito. He loved it and his employees were impressed. He works at a retail store near by. I'll be visiting most wanted again. 
I would give 4 stars but my order was wrong. I really wanted enchiladas:-)
