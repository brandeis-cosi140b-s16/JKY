Wow, it doesn't get much better than this!!! First off, the Luche Libre paraphernalia is worth the trip alone. Love that shit!! Okay, those are just decorations and you don't go for that alone. We got there just before the dinner rush and as we checked out the menu the gal behind the counter offered us a sampling of all of their different marinated meats. Samples of the pork, beef and chicken?! Hell yeah they'll do that! You have any more kinds of marinated animal back there? Alright, got some street tacos go down the line and add some fresh garnish! Best street tacos in town!! This is how the match went down.

Chips and Salsa - Bam!!! Who doesn't like salsa bars?! Nice thin salted chips with many different salsas full of flavor and punch!!

3 Street Tacos (tried the carne asada, carnitas and pollo) - Kaboom!!! While your munching on those tacos you are getting whooped by flavor. Fresh corn tortillas, cilantro, onions, crema etc!!! Shit, my glittering spandex shorts feeling tighter! I'll just cover up my belly with my cape.

Hands down, get your ass to the corner of the ring, the match is over!! Love Lucha Libre and Love Santos Lucha Libre even more!!! Merodeador Irland√©s - that's my Lucha Libre name. You'll find me wrestling Sunday's at various VFW's in the valley.
