So I felt like I needed a Yelp profile just for Most Wanted. The experience and food provided was absolutely fantastic! Came in with a crew of 6 and the staff began with a huge welcome and offered to sample their meats. Taste buds were totally exploding, the meats all offered their own unique taste and that spice was muy caliente, but for some reason I couldn't stop loving it!? I ended up with 5 street tacos and all with different meats, and traditionally made just fresh cilantro and onions YUM! We were all treated as quickly as the staff could be and rang out at the end. The seating area was such a great vibe with lots of room and super clean. There are so many flavored and greats options here that what is not to love!? Simple, clean and fresh- let's not forget about the top notch crew working through the grills and serving up greatness! Support locals I say, you can't go wrong here.
