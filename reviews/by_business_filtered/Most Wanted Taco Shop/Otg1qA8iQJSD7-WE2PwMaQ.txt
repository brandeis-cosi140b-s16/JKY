This was an incredible yelp find. All of the previous posts are spot on : the servers are incredibly helpful and friendly, the food was amazing, and the ambience, although goofy with all the masked wrestler decor, was fantastic. 

Came with Girlfriend and we each got the wet vegetarian burritos. So good! Salsa bar was awesome too. Took the check in offer for yelp no problem. Will def go again.
