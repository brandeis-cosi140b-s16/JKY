There is no place else in the valley I've found to have excellent tacos in the company of los luchadores.

I've been here twice and the only dissapointment has been that it has not been busier. Both times we dined with one other group in what amounted to an empty dining room. I hope this is because we eat at odd hours.

My favorite in those two visits were the fish tacos, though the chicken and beef tacos (spicy) were also excellent. I want to try their street tacos, but have not yet. We also have gotten the handmade guacamole on both visits. It takes longer than the tacos to prepare, but it is fresh and excellent. 

I would eat among los luchadores more often if we just lived closer.
