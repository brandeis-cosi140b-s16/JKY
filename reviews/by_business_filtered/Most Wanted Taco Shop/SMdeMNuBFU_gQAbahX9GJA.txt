My wife and I are new to this area and while searching for our new taco place I came across this very unique place on yelp. The workers were extremely helpful and kind enough to offer a sample of all their flavors of meat! I got two large and two small tacos and both are of good proportion for the price and money. This place has a very welcoming atmosphere and at first glance it might look small but it opens up to a larger dining area after the register. It also looks like they are planning to expand at the time we went in. The churro we ordered was freakin awesome and very satisfying. Overall this place really sets itself apart from almost every other taco place we've been to since moving here and if you are ever in the area give this place a try!
