We ordered a veggie quesadilla, chips and guac, a veggie burrito bowl and horchata--all of which came up to about 20 dollars. All were good and hearty, and the servings were generous despite the affordable price. 

The people behind the counter were nice and friendly. The ambiance was a bit quirky and fun. I mean, Mexican wrestlers, pink walls, glitter...it's all good. 

We'll definitely be coming back.
