Omg! This place is awesome. I wish it had opened a year ago since I live right next door. The fish tacos are amazing, but I've sampled all their meats and its all good! Great prices, amazing food, super authentic, and it's quick! The owners are really friendly and the place is clean! Definitely check it out. Seriously I want fish tacos right now.
