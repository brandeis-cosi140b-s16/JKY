This place is amazing!  

I just moved here from Chicago, IL. And I live within walking distance of Santos Lucha Libre.  Coming from Chicago, I had a few local Mexican places that I loved and was hoping to find something comparable in Phoenix (I mean AZ is way closer to Mexico than IL, right?).

I saw that other review by a woman also from Chicago, and I wholeheartedly DISAGREE with everything she posted.  She doesn't know what she's talking about!

And boy was I glad to find Santos Luche Libre!  They found out it was my wife's and my first time there, so they let us sample the meats.  Oh man, each one was fantastic.  Some spicy, some smokey, all exploding with flavor.  My wife got the five street taco plate and I got the 3 large taco plate.  

The flavors were amazing! The service was very friendly and the decor was bright with a Mexican wrestling theme. The Mexican pop music was decent and provided a great ambiance for our meal.  

The salsa bar was really great, there were 4 different salsas to choose from, varying from VERY HOT to mild.  The VERY HOT was by far the most flavorful.  We both agreed that the two green salsas were the best.  The salsa bar also had limes available, which was surprising, considering the drought in California and the skyrocketing price of limes.  

I'm very excited to be close to this restaurant and we will definitely be back, probably at least once a week!
