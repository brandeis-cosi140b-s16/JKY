This place is awesome. I don't know why haven't been here sooner. The food was delicious and the staff was very helpful. They let us sample all of the meat to decide which one we wanted. The restaurant itself is very clean. I love their theme! Very original. This place is authentic and trendy at the same time. I will be back for their tacos!!!
