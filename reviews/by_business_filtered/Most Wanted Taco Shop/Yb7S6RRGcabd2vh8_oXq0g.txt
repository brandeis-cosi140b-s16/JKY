Holy (literally) guacamole!!

I was in Phoenix for a long weekend and decided to pop into Santos Lucha Libre for lunch with my, very hard to please, Texas boyfriend. We absolutely loved the place! We both ordered the 3 tacos as well as chips and guac, all for around $20. The guy behind the counter was super nice and allowed us to taste test all of the meats before we chose which ones we wanted for our taco choice. In summary, very affordable Mexican food, a great place for lunch!
