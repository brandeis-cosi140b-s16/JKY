Seriously if you have not been here yet - get in your car and get over there. I went because it got good reviews, it was new to me and it was Mexican food which was what I wanted today. Big surprise - fantastic food.

The restaurant is not in a swanky neighborhood but don't let that stop you. They are in a shopping center that has several other restaurants, some closed, and a sports bar. Look for it because it is not obvious.

From the pictures on yelp you might think they do not have many tables BUT they have a room next door with plenty of seating.

The motif is Mexican wrestling thus the Lucha  Libre name. Pretty well done and fun if you have not been around that before.

OK OK, the food! When they ask you to try a taste of what they offer DO IT! every taste is different and every one is fantastic. The one they will tell you is the hottest  meat will in fact remove all of your throat so be careful. All of the other ones are normal hot to just mildly spicy. The green chili is superb but as might be expected very hot.

I got 5 street tacos with a different taste in each one.

And the very best part - one of the nicest women you ever met is the owner and she greeted me and made me feel as if I  had come home for lunch. I got a case of being macho and insisted on trying the really hot stuff and they ran to the  water cooler and got me water. Someplace else probably would have grabbed a cell phone and recorded me hopping around yelling about how  hot it was (hot but actually very good).
