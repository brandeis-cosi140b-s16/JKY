Really great tacos here, and almost authentic... They accommodate Gringo expectations a bit here and offer grated cheese and lettuce and beans for their tacos, which are actually not typically found on street tacos "en Mexico".  But the meats and the tortillas are awesome, and it doesn't matter which meat- they are all fantastico!  Just say no to the cheese, lettuce, and beans.  :-)
