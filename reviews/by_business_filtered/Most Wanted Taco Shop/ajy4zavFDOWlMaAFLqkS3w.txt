If you're not close to this taco shop, that's okay - it's worth the trip.

They saw we were first-timers and gave us a free sample of every meat they had. It didn't help us much as there wasn't a bad one in the bunch. We each got a plate of 5 small tacos and it was plenty. I wish I could tell you which ones we got, but after the nap we just took I can't remember. I know they were all tasty, and all on the bottom of the meat listings (the ones with the spiciest footnotes).

The decor is odd, but I really don't care - I'm going back for the food. Yum!
