Over 10 varieties of chicken, pork and beef. Anywhere from mild to hot.  I had 3 small street tacos, and they didn't disappoint!  Staff was friendly and helpful offering up samples to try the many flavors.  Guacamole was fresh and delicious too.  Didn't try anything else, but would go back for sure.
