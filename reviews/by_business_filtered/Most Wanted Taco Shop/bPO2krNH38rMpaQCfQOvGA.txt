Plastic forks and knives. Styrofoam plates. Dirty dining area. Meats are tasty, but you don't get much. No flour tortillas for the tacos. Tortillas didn't look house made. Most of what you get in a burrito is rice and beans. I don't know what all the 4 and 5 star reviews are for. This place is Sunnyslope on a plate.
