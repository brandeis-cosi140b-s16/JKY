It's rare to find a restaurant that meets and exceeds our "foodie" expectations!  The workers were so appreciative of us coming in on Father's Day!  They ran out of chicken (because we are a family of 8) and they were so apologetic and accommodating with samples of all their meats and even gave us free churros for our boys because of it. And I actually think the pastor flavored meat was tastier than the chicken.  So, I only give 5 stars to a place that has great good and great service!  We will be back every time we come to Phoenix!  A special thanks to Erik for his excellent people skills!
