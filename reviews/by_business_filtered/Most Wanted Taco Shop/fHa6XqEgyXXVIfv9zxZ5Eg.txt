Saw the good reviews and thought I'd check it out for taco Tuesday.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  They asked if we had ever ate there before.  After hearing it was our first time they gave us samples of all the types of meats.  I decided on the 3 taco platter.  I got one chicken, one beef chile verde, and one spicy pork taco.  The tacos were good sized, well priced and made to order.  Everything was delicious.  The tacos were great,  the salsa bar had several different choices that were each very good.  I really liked the spicy one made with peanuts.  I would go back in a heartbeat and look forward to trying more meats and possibly a burrito.
