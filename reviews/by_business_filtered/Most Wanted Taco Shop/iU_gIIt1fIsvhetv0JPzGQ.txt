After reading Yelp's list of top 100 places to eat I saw this was one of them and decided to give this place a try. I read some of the reviews so I had a good idea of what to expect. The staff was very friendly and one of them offered us a sample of all the different meats which was awesome. 

The meat is really good. There really wasn't one that I didn't like. I especially liked the Adobada (spiiiicy!). Me and my son each order the 3 tacos each with different meats. We also ordered some chips with jalapeño cream cheese. I loaded up my tacos with almost every topping, I mean I get a choice so why not! The chips were super crispy and good and the jalapeño cream cheese was pretty good. They also have a salsa bar which had some really great salsa. 

Over all it was pretty good with fairly reasonable prices and I'll be back!
