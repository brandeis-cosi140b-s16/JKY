Finally had the chance to check this place out and I'm so glad we did! Being vegetarian (well, peskatarian) we weren't sure what to expect. But, to our surprise, there were actually vegetarian options on the menu. 
The fish tacos were some of the best I ever had, I enjoyed every bite! I really also liked the salsa bar full of fresh mild to spicy salsas to try. 

Service was top notch. They were so helpful and were patient to help guide us newbies through the menu. I will be recommending this place to everyone I know now!

OH! And how could I forget the flan??! Real homemade Mexican flan. We almost had to order a second one to share it was so good tasting one of our favorite desserts made right!
