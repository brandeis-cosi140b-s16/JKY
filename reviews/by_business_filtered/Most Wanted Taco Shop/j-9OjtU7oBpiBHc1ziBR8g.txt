The decor...LOL. I don't get it at all. 

Never the less. lets begin:

This place is like a cafeteria/chipotle style ordering and food preparation. You order go down the line. Customize and then pay then eat.

They let you try all their meat they have. Their spicey meats have a great kick to them. Unfortunately some meats were a little dry.  Out of all the meats the green chili pork is the best. 

I had the burrito it was ridiculously huge. Like a chipotle burrito. It was way better tasting. They have good fresh ingredients. and some that can really pack a punch (in spicyness.).

I would like to go back and try their other menu items. They have potential, but the location is kind of crappy. Hopefully they will do better there than their predecessors.
