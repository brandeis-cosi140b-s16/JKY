Every good Mexican restaurant should have a disco ball, wrestling masks and sparkly giant wrestler decals on the wall... the decor was awesome and kept my 4 year old in his seat looking around. The food was awesome, they had us sample all the meats and it was not an easy decision. They have a full range of heat in each meat type so lots of choices. I went with the mildest pork, I usually prefer more heat but the flavor was amazing, it was also not overcooked or dry.  Tons of fresh toppings, I piled mine high then hit the salsa bar for more. We all left with full bellies and excitement to come back again. It's obvious they care about their food here.
