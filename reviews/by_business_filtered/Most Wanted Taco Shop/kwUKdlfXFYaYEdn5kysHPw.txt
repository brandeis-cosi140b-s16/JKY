Super friendly service with recommendations for folks that are craving Mexican food, but in a rush & needed the eats to go! Love the pockets of commercial activity in Sunnyslope and have never been disappointed by a business in their 'hood. 

Yes...great salsa bar, yummy tortillas and succulent pork.  Next visit won't be rushed!
