Awesome, but be careful if you order something with "medium" spice level. I have a pretty high tolerance for spicy food, and it was quite spicy. Delicious, just very spicy :). Their tacos are awesome. Toppings are very fresh, and the staff is helpful and friendly! Love their salsa bar with the avocado/green salsa blend.
