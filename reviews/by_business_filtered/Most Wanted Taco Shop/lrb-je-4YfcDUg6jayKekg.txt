I went back for lunch a few days ago. The name changed from "Santos Lucha Libre" to "Most Wanted Taco Shop". They removed most of the Lucha Libre memorabilia. However the food and staff seem to be the same. The food was delicious as always. I think they have eliminated their flavored tortillas, as I only saw flour tortillas out. But they are expanding! It looks like they took over the empty sports bar that was next door. They weren't finished with the work yet when I was there. They have an application for a liquor license. I'm excited to see what this will look like when they have finished.
