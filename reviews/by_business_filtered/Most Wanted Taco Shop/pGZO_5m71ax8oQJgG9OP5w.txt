My name is Mel and I'm a taco junkie... And I'm so glad I found this place while visiting Phoenix. The tacos are amazing and the woman who runs the restaurant is so warm and hospitable. I wasn't sure what to order so I took her lead and had the tacos  dressed as she would eat them. I'm so sad that meal is over and will be thinking about them the whole long way back to Florida.
