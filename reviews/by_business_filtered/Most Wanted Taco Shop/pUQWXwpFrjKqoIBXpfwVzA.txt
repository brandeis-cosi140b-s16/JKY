We were surprised upon rolling into the parking lot.  We noted that Los Luchas Libre's name had changed to Most Wanted Taco Shop.  We hesitated and hoped it was the same.  Much to our relief only the name has changed.  The same staff were present and the food is just as good as previously.  the staff recognized us as we mentioned we were hoping that had not closed their doors.  
We have brought friends here and they love it as much as we do.  Prices are extremely reasonable even with a slight raise in cost.  Visit this place and you won't be sorry by the taste and staff.  Bring a new guest and they can sample the various meats being offered for tacos or burritos.
