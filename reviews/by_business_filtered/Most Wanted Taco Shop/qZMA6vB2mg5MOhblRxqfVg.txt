At first I thought how could it have 5 stars with 300 plus reviews, I thought they might be fake, but they are very real! Luchadores AND delicious slow cookedeeats with a great variety of toppings, free tasting of all of the meats on your first visit, how could it get better?!!? BEER is how, and they were in the process of building a bar that had more than 15 taps! I only hope I am back soon after it opens up the bar!
