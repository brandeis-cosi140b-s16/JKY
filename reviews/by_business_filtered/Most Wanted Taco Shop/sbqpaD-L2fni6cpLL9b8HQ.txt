I've been wanting to try this place for a while, and I'm glad I finally did! The ladies working the line are awesome- they give you a sample of each meat on your first visit to help you decide and you can ask to have your food any way you want it. I had a burrito bowl with lettuce instead of rice and beans to keep it low carb, and once it was all topped and I put on my salsas of choice (at the salsa bar) it was a work of art. That and the nachos were both hearty and delicious. Can't leave out the decor- it's an experience to dine next to a luchador, not just lunch
