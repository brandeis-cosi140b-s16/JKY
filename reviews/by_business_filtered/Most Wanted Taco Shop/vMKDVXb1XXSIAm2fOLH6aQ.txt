I am officially in love with this place...all I can say is WOW! First of all, I grew up eating Mexican food, the home cooked stuff. So I'm coming from a very spoiled high standards point of view. That said, this place has pretty much topped the list in terms of quality, flavor, and customer service. I mean, it jumped above Carolina's even. My husband and I arrived and she (the  talented owner and chef) asked if it was our first time. Well yes, it is! She then gave us each samples of each of the meat options they offer with their menu options. EVERY one of them was delicious, so of course made it impossible to choose. So I got 3 different kinds, one in each taco, as did my husband, and then we each got a tostada on the side to get a 4th meat - yeah, THAT good!! The rest is done chipotle style where they ask what you want in your tacos or whatever you order, and add it in. The whole meal was epic, and we can't wait to return, and bring friends and family! If you visit one Mexican joint in Phoenix, come to this one. Seriously amazing, and we didn't even break $20. My wallet loves it as much as my stomach. Oh, and the people were just wonderful and I hope to see them live long, prosper, and continue making such amazing food in this amazing restaurant! Side note - I didn't even get started on how amazing the interior was. Worth a visit just to see how great the decor is!
