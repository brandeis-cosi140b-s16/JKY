Yelp, you did me right. This place is simply amazing. On learning it was my first time in, I was offered a sample of every meat so I could decide which to have. Although, if anything, that just made the choice harder. They're all simply delicious. I picked 5 of the meats more or less at random and got street tacos. They were all fantastic.
