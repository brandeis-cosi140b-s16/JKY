There is a reason this place has 5 stars it is amazing. Tacos, burritos. All of it is amazing. Friendly customer service. Really cool atmosphere. Clean and comfortable. Great salsa bar. I am sitting in the parking lot writing this review. Wishing my pants were bigger super full. Great place just go there and eat. Sample the meats when you get there.
