Disclaimer, this place has nothing to do with Lucha Libre in San Diego.  I came here to try the tacos everyone raved about!  One of their best tacos was their fish tacos!  It was soooo good and crunchy, probably the best I've ever had!   The other beef/pork tacos were delicious.  The service is one of the best I've had for a taco place.  They provide you with as many samples as possible that you want.  So if you're not sure what you want, definitely ask for lots of samples to make sure you get the one you want!  I'll be back when I'm in Phoenix!!!
