AMAZING!! 
A small family owned restaurant hidden away but has great authentic Mexican food. By far the best burrito I've EVER had!!!

The owner and her son greeted us at the door and asked us to sample each of their 8 home cooked savory meats before ordering. Every single one was excellent and cooked to perfection. They also had a choice of 5 different tortillas to choose from, all of which looked very fresh. The food in prepared right in front of you (just like Chipotle or subway) and its done with a smile and pleasant conversation. 

I'd give this place 10 stars if it let me. Don't miss out!!  Try this restaurant :)
