Yum Yum Yum Yum Yummmmm.......

Just ate here and had to get this out. The ladies behind the counter are very welcoming. We were offered a full sampling of ALL the meats (there are about 7 of them). We tried everything.  We ended up with street tacos and regular tacos filled with all the spicy meats and spicy chicken. Very flavorful. The place is set up like Chipotle ....but here's thing, it's way better! It's authentic Mexican food, and there are many combinations of food options. They also have cool wrestling posters and masks that decorate the walls.  There are a few flat screen TV's as well. Cute place, but the food is even more amazing.  What a pleasant surprise. We'll be back.
