I really liked the decor of the place; it had a bar atmosphere with super high ceilings and a lot of luchador decorations and murals. It seemed to be either under new management or just a renovation because half of the seating area (with a full sized bar) was closed off haphazardly with booths, and the name on the Yelp listing (how I picked to eat here) and in other reviews is different. Nevertheless, the food and service were both outstanding and I really enjoyed my meal. 
I got three street tacos, each a different meat. They let you test them out before hand because they have a LOT of meat options with varying levels of spiciness (as indicated by the pepper graphics on the menu). You build your tacos or burrito with the ingredients you want a la Subway and everything looked fresh and clean.
I wish I had tried out the green chili chicken beforehand because it knocked me on my butt. The el pastor and carne asada were amazing though. The asada was probably some of the best I've ever had from a taco joint. I also got a churro which was cooked for me on order so it was hot and fresh. 
I definitely recommend this place if you're in the Sunnyslope area.
