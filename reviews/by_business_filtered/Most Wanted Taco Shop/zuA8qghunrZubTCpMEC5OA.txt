They recently changed their name back to the original "Most Wanted Taco Shop", but they've been around for a little while. Simply put, this is what you expect when you picture tacos in Arizona. They are AMAZING, and the wide variety of meat choices is part of the fun. They'll let you sample as many as you like, so definitely come hungry. They've got a few choices for your tortilla, and they do massive burritos and quesadillas, as well. Top it off with fresh, homemade guacamole and you've got all of the bases covered!

As the other review states, the space is still a bit unfinished, as I believe they are currently waiting to expand into the sports bar that closed down next door. They didn't have a liquor license when I went last time, but a few cervezas will be a nice touch in the near future!
