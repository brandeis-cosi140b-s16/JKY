Absolutely as good as it gets when it comes to simple Mexican staples such as tacos and burritos, made to perfection.

For an average of $7, you can enjoy a build your own burrito, chips, and home-made horchata.  Build with savory selections such as barbacoa, green chile, chicken, or carnitas.  They have all of the fresh ingredients of your choice such as cilantro, roasted corn, pinto and black beans, shredded oaxacan cheese, and pico de gallo. 

The beauty of this little gem is you are choosing what goes into your dish.  I had the ambrosial barbacoa with pinto beans, a heaping of fresh cilantro, a medium hot salsa, and generous dollops of their signature jalapeno cream cheese.  The savory combined with the salty and spicy, balanced by the fresh and citrus-like flavor of the cilantro made this a phenomenal burrito.

On the menu are also fresh soft and crispy tacos, and tostadas.

Highly recommended not only for the flavors, but the cleanliness and friendliness of this Taqueria.
