Awesome food! Little hole in the wall that looks like it is probably family owned. Does not look like much from the outside, however, the inside is very cute. Not very big and nothing fancy, but we didn't mind. You order at the counter and it follows the Chipotle concept. The barbacoa meat is out of this world! Very flavorful. I also tried their famous jalapeno cream cheese on my nachos and I would highly recommend it. My fiance tried the 3 chicken variety street tacos + 1 carne asada taco and he said that they were the best street tacos that he has found in Arizona. Overall very happy with the food. We loved everything that we got. We will definitely be back!
