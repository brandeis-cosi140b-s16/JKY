WOW!!  What an amazing little great find this place is.    
I had the nachos with green chili meat.   The meat had virtually no grease and no fat and had a very nice nice spicy taste..mmmm.
The vegetables were not only extremely fresh but were piled on high and the nachos chips were crisp and fresh.
While I was enjoying this very tasty dish one of the very friendly staff members came up to my table and asked me how the food was.  I was quick to say AMAZING!
Don't let the outside keep you away, the food and service was all very genuine and sure beats Chipotle hands down. 
Definitely my new hotspot.
