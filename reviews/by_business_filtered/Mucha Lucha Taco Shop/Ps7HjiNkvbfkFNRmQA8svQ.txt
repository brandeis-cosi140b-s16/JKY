We tried this place out just a few days ago. The food was fresh and flavorful, and the service was very friendly. It definitely gives Chipotle a run for its money (and I am a big fan of Chipotle).

I got the asada burrito, which also comes with a handful of chips. The man working behind the counter gave me some jalapeno cream cheese on the side, which tasted so good I ordered an extra bag of chips and cream cheese to take home with me.  My boyfriend got the tostadas. He's a huge fan of Mexican food and thinks this place is pretty great.

We also got some horchata, which was delicious. At first I thought it tasted a little watered down, but after a few more sips the cinnamon-y goodness really came through. 

If you're in the area, I highly suggest Sombrero's.
