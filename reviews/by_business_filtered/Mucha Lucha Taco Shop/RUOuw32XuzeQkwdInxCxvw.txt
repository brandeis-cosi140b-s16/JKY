I was on a mission to find the best Mexican place in Tempe, and found it! The atmosphere is a perfect Mexican experience, the people are so friendly and fast, and the food is to die for.  I have tried a lot of the things on their menu and have never been disappointed, only pleasantly surprised.  My favorite set up for a guaranteed good night is their two carne asada tostadas with hot salsa (I don't usually like spicy, but their sauce was just too good) with a large horchata. My husband's favorite is their three soft tacos with carne asada and carnitas.  You can tell the owner puts a lot of soul into his food by the way he presents his fresh ingredients, and cooks with style and taste.
