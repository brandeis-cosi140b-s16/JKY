Thank you YELP posters that rated this "hole on the wall" restaurant, like so many other "hole in the wall" favorites, this is a sure winner. He even spotted that I had never been here before and offered me samples of the different spicy beef and chicken. I strongly recommend the chicken for its abundant flavor without being "hot". The beef had a nice kick to it with two flavorful versions. I had a chicken burrito as well as one of the spicy beef burritos. 
Don't be fooled by the location, go in and try the great food. I am also a fan of the real sugar soft drinks from Mexico, the strawberry was a perfect compliment to the rich Mexican style food. The condiment bar is well stocked with a variety of great flavors to enhance your dining pleasure.
I think I have to go now, my wheelbarrow just arrived to get me back to my vehicle. 
Overall you will not be disappointed!! Happy feasting!!
