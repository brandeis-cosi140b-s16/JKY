Still sat here and just had to write this review. Small, friendly, amazing food. Try it. 
If you go out to eat for service where you are waited on, try somewhere else, if the reason you go out to eat is to try great food, eat here. Great food. If I lived in the area this would become a regular for me no doubt.
