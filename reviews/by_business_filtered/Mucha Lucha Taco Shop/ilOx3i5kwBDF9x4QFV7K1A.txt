This place is the real deal - I have been searching for decent Mexican food since I have moved here months ago.You have a choice of several different tasty meats and there is a fresh salsa bar with pickled veg and limes. I ordered the street tacos with no cheese, extra cilantro, pico de gallo and pickled red onions - topped off with a squirt of lime to the last drop. Oh how delicious. The churro also hit the spot. I dont know if there was custard in it or if it was just uncooked dough, but I ate it anyway and it was good  :-)  The staff are fast, efficient and pleasant.  My go-to for Mexican food!
