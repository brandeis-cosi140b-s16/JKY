First off the street tacos are sooo good! Their carne asada is tasty and they have told me its a super secret marinade. Be sure to get the purple onions. 
The place is family owned and everyone is kind and helpful. Thumbs up! The location is deceiving by the looks of the strip mall....do not be fooled its 5 stars!!!
