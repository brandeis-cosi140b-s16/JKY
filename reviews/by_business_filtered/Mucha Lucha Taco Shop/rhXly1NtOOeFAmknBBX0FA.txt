Had the barbacoa burrito and it was very good. The barbacoa is very tender. They do a great job of draining a lot of the sauce from the beans and meat so it isn't so wet. People there are really nice. Somehow recognized I was a newbie and were genuinely appreciate of me trying them out. Only problem is that it is a small place so I couldn't eat there since not much seating.
