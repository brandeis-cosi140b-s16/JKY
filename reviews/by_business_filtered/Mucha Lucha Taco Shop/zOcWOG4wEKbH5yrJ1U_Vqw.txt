They no longer put the chicken back on the grill when you order. The chicken is not big chunks of white meat anymore, it is stewed chicken sitting in a broth all day and I'm not even sure it is all white meat anymore. Another issue is the woman who was making the burrito used her gloved hands to fill the burrito with all the toppings. That is fine for rolling, but when your sticking your hand (gloved or not) into each bin of lettuce, corn, tomatoes, cilantro, etc, it just doesn't seem normal. They need to use spoons on thongs for the fillings.
