If you see the place and are expecting the run of the mill, Sonoran style taco-beans-and-rice kind of Mexican food , move along (this also means you can't compare the food here to Macayo's). That's why my dad hates it - it's too cutesy/nouveau for his palate. That has nothing to do with my review. Just saying as a warning. 

Pros: Husband and I have been coming here on and off for years. It has had its ups and downs, but in our experience it's been worth returning to. It's not the run of the mill Mexican, as I said, which makes a nice change. Agree that the service tends to be slow, but have never been subjected to anything but politeness, and they have been accommodating when we've wanted to substitute a side or whatnot. Margaritas are excellent. Tea is good. Love the decor and the patio in nice weather. I adore their chicken enchiladas and their rice is awesome. Husband has pretty much liked anything he's ordered off the menu. LOVE their salsa.

Cons: I never have liked the 'we have to charge you for more than the first bowl of chips' thing. Come on... seriously? Again, slow service, which you have to ding them for, because they're slow even when you and only two other tables are there at an off-time, and it has nothing to do with the kitchen. They need to start maintaining some of the patio, it's starting to look ignored/worn. 

Overall, we keep coming back when we want a break from the usual. We think it's worth it.
