It's been awhile since I've eaten here.  I used to work just a mile down University and I'd eat the shrimp tacos at least once a week.  I loved this place because it was not standard mexican food.  They put some extra care into what they servce.  The tacos were like like little shrimp salads on a tortilla.  I usually dissected and them and savored every bite individually.  

The chips and salsa are pretty good too.  Again, they don't taste like all the other places.

I think the atmosphere is pretty nice here, a little loud on the inside, but awesome on the patio when the weather's right.  Note that I've only been here for lunch, so I cannot comment on the nighttime atmosphere.

Love this place.  I miss being near it.
