One of my all time favorite lunch spots . . . it was time to stop in again with a client who was looking for somethiing a little different.

I ordered the Mexican Pizza . . . the flat bread was hot and fresh, the beans were warm and tender, the lettuce was crispy, and the marinated chicken was just perfect.

The only issue was we seemed to be lost . . . the waiter did stop back several times . . . but usually when the drinks had been empty for a while.

Definitely have missed having lunch here and I will be back sooner than later.
