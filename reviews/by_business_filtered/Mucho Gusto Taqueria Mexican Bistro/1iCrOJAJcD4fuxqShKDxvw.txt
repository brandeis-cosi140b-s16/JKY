Sadly, I didn't read the reviews before finally going here. It seems the only thing Mucho Gusto is good for is happy hour & I didn't really think those prices were all that amazing. I've never felt so ripped off by a Mexican food place before. I got the Machaco Tacos. Two tacos for $10, I figured it'd come with lettuce, sour cream, & definately some beans &/or rice on the side. What I got were tiny soft shells(I thought corn might be crispy, my bad) with a ton of VERY bland & somewhat dry meat & a slice(yeah, I said SLICE) of cheese. The only other taco I've ever seen in my life with a slice of cheese is at Jack in the Box. The side was a small cup of tortilla soup that came out with the meal. The soup & atmoshere were the only redeeming qualities. Even the picante sauce they called salsa for the chips was thin & lacking. My friend ordered the shrimp tacos(2 for $14) & the "large shrimp" were small to medium sized frozen shrimp(about 4 on each taco) & dry. Even the service fell flat. Our waiter was brief with us, no smile, no chit-chat or other suggestions & after the food came, he didn't come back until we were completely done choking it all down. The busboy(or whatever he was), although not dressed at all professionally, was prompt & seemed friendly. Had I known what it'd be like, I would've much rather gone to Chipotle where it would be half the price, delicious/flavorful & much more friendly(not to mention they have the same beer). I work at a local hotel & recommended this place to several guests in the past(mainly because of the location & atmoshere) but now I'm embarrassed & I won't send anyone else. Sorry, but this one's a stinker. Try Macayos for margaritas or Rositas for a full menu that's always good.
