This is standard Mexican fare for the area.  Unfortunately, that doesn't mean it's good.  Generally, I eat the best food at home.  We have raw milk, raw butter, and raw cheese.  My husband of Mexican lineage cooks fabulous New Mexican food when he can procure true chiles from New Mexico.  We buy very fresh fruits and vegetables and meat from pastured animals or wild fish and shellfish. So whenever I go out to a "Mexican restaurant," I don't expect anything as good as I get at home.  Even so, I can't tolerate this stuff.  I ate lunch there, and it's sat in my gut like a rock ever since (5.5 hours now).  I had salsa & chips, and the enchilada trio (I believe I had a cheese one, a chicken one, and a pork one).  A $13 entree for lunch, which wasn't very good - too much for me to pay for something I can't digest very well.  Everything had an odd flavor, like it wasn't quite real food.  Yes, I only went once, and I won't be going back.
