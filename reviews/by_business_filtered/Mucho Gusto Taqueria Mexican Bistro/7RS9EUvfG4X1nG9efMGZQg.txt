I loved this little spot!! me and the bf drive by all the time and decided to give it a try, on our way there I was reading the yelp reviews and got a little nervous....everyone seemed so "just okay" about it, but thankfully they were wrong!  

we dove right into the chips and salsa which were so tasty- I loved that they had a little bit of a kick to the salsa and you can usually tell how the food is going to be just by trying the chips and salsa.  we ordered the guacamole---OMG so freakin' good you have to try this stuff, save a bit to put on your entrees (you'll thank me later) 
we ordered the carne asada tacos and the carnitas flautas and shared with each other-best idea :) dipping them in the guac was so divine I could have bathed in it ;) haha
I also ordered a margarita which was so good!!  I like mine a little more sour than sweet and without even mentioning it to the server it came out so perfect...they had a good little kick to-if you know what I mean-so spending $6 didn't really matter to me :) 

definintely affordable our dinner came to like $43 which wasn't bad at all if you ask me...go try this place, the service was great, ambiance was fun and it was busy all evening so you get that high energy feeling too!!
