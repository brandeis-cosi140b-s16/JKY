Let me explain why they get the two stars- Small environment, but it looks nice and had creativity and thought put into it. Another star for the service we had. Our waiter, Frank, did a nice job and was very friendly. 

**Now for the food. This place is not authentic. The salsa did not taste like fresh salsa. More as something out of a can. The re-fried beans I had, same thing. I had ordered a chimichanga and it was very mediocre. Left overs the day after weren't too bad. My boyfriend had a shrimp burrito and said it was very mediocre as well. Not to mention, he paid $3 for ONE glass of Horchata that was mostly water with a bit of cinnamon. He was given water after. Again, like it was a pre-made mix or something. 

TOO PRICEY. My chimichanga, "spanish" rice, terrible refried beans was $16. I could have had authentic for almost half that. The shrimp burrito was $18, I believe. 

I love my Mexican food, and I know it's easier to find better and tastier places around here.
