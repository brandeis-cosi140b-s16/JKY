Catchy name.  Nice location.  And I love Mexican food;  I eat it all the time so I know what good Mexican food is...and isn't.  Despite the food looking the part, all of the things that make Mexican food Mexican food were missing from Mucho Gusto's machaca...like taste.  So to me having to pay the prices their menu items command is not worth it.  Not only is the food sub-par, but the prices are inflated.  Much Gusto is overhyped and you will pay a premium for the not-so-goodwill.  I will not return.
