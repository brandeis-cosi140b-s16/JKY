A to the power of two for real
Brought me to here for a deal
Lovely service taverna set
In or out left not one regret
Found tacos of white corn
Fish, beef,or pork torn

What salsa heats my heart inside
"More chips!" My hungry heart cried
I can't believe I've been deprived hence
And the ambiance made crazy sense
If my restrictions did not limit my hunga'
I would've downed a chimmichanga'

I could see plates full of yumminess piled high
How could i show up here on a diet, why?
A bit pricier than the average taqueria spot
There's so much love mixed in this hot pot
I need to say that a fifth star is not illusive
Just wish it had drinks more inclusive
I'll return not just because its on Hardy at Mitchell
But because it's food speaks my name, Mitchell....

Ok... so the rhyme is corny but the experience is not.
Don't miss this gem tucked away in Tempe...just don't make it hard for me to be seated!
