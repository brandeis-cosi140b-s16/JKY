Went to Mucho Gusto on Christmas Eve with family. It was a chilly night and we saw that it got good reviews on yelp, so we stopped in for a early visit- thought some good mexican food and a margarita would warm us up. Our wonderful plan was sabotaged by the worst hostess ever. It was early and the place was empty. We asked to be seated- there were 5 of us- and she proceeded to seat us at a 4 person table right next to the door (remember, it's cold outside, there are 5 of us, and the place is completely empty). As she was setting us up we asked to be sat at a larger table, farther away from the door. She gave us the death stare! My poor family, in from out of town, iced over by some evil control freak. She then reluctantly sat us at another 4 top (we had to drag over another table to fit us all in) and proceeded to complain to the server (within earshot of us) about us, pointing and rolling her beady little eyes. It was then we decided that it just wasn't worth it- we left (with no apologies from any of the other staff) and went to Z-Tejas instead. I would have much rather supported a local establishment, but there is no need for that kind of tude, especially on Christmas Eve!
