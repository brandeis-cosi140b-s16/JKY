Surprised about all the talk regarding atmosphere.  All I got was the constant hum of traffic going up and down University.  Decent vibe and above average Mexican.  (Improve on the chips/salsa.  They seem very half-hearted.)

If I'm in the area come feeding time it is in the equation, otherwise probably not worth the effort.
