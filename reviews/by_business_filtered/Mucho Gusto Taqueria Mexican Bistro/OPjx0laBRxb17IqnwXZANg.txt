Finally tried Mucho Gusto after years of driving by it to head to Oregano's or Mill Ave. and I was both impressed and disappointed with my experience.

I ate lunch here with my girlfriend and found the place mostly empty, with a few tables populated on the patio and some bar patrons.  We sat on the patio and were greeted with chips and salsa pretty quickly and got our food super-fast after we ordered, which was great.  The food was way better than I expected for the price paid, we received generous portions, and I was really intrigued and satisfied with their neo-Mexican cuisine.  Definitely not the place to hit up for authentico dining, but for a delicious new concept on traditional favorites, this is the place.

The downside of our trip was the service toward the tail end of our lunch.  We appeared to have been forgotten by our waiter several times and had to flag him down among the five other tables seated on the patio.  When we finally got our check, we had to wait 15 minutes, before we got up and walked inside to correct our bill (we were charged $1 more for an item than was listed on the menu), and pay.  We got a quick, "sorry about that," and were sent on our way. 

I'm seriously debating giving this place a second chance, even with their killer food.  I hope that today's experience was not representative of what they consider service to be, otherwise, I guess I'll have to leave Mucho Gusto to the college students....
