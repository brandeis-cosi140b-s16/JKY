This place looks the part. Great decor. The food is Macayo's level. Just add $2-$4 per item. A Chimichanga for $14! Even with rice and beans...I can get a number of Chimicangas for $8-$9 that taste at least as good as this one...

I don't really know the draw to this place. The staff is really cool, its just too expensive! Especially for Mexican!
