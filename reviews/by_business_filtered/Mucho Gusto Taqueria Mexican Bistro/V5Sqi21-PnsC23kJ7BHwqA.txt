Wow! Had so much fun here. Very cute restaurant and the patio is such a cool place to hang out on when the weather is nice. 
We had the Clams in the Mole Chorizo Sauce. Best clams I have had. The spicy flavor combined with their awesome mole was incredible! What a great idea!
Chips and salsa were ridiculously good. So important to have a tasty salsa.
The staff was very kind and knowledgeable about the food.
Can't wait to go Back!
