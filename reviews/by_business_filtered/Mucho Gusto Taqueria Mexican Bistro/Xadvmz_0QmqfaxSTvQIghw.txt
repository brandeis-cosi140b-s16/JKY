This was my first time coming here. I was just driving down the road and decided to check it out. There weren't that many people as it was right before everyone got off work. I was served very quickly and service was on top of everything. I tried the tamales and I have to say that it was awesome. But I may be a little biased since I love tamales already. Salsa was to die for. But again I am biased. Service was excellent and for excellent service I give a rating of 100%. That's how I rate the percentage of the tip the waiter got. For everyone that likes Mexican food go here and check it out.
