I was severely disappointed in this place. First of all, our waitress was absolutely horrible!!! She was so inattentive and it took forever to get things from her. Now on to the food... I ordered half ass burrito which is supposed to come loaded with rice,beans,pico,guacamole,cheese,and a choice of meat. My burrito had hardly ANYTHING in it. All the fillings were nonexistent except for the rice(which in itself was mediocre at best). I was so irritated at the lack of EVERYTHING in my burrito. I literally had two tiny pieces of meat in it. I didn't finish, and left hungry. To top it off, my food was lukewarm. I would definitely not go back here again. I didn't  want to make a fuss at the time because we were with some friends, but I should have sent it back.  The only good thing was the chips and salsa.
