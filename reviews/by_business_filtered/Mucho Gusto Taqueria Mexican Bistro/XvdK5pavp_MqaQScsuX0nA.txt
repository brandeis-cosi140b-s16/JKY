I've been told by others that this place is great. I was a bit worried about it not living up to the hype. This afternoon I got to try it for myself. 
First off, this isn't a "typical" Mexican restaurant. You won't see rugs and sombrero's scattered on the walls or hear mariachi music. It has a nice warm feel, beautiful patio, and comfortable atmosphere. There are many options on the menu and in my option Mucho Gusto serves Mexican food with an edge. A great edge. 
The salsa has a kick and the guacamole is by far one of the best I've had. I ordered 2 tacos (fish and carne asada). It was served with a side salad vs. beans and rice like most places. It was a nice and tasty touch and I left feeling good for eating my greens. 
This is really a 4.5 star in my opinion and will most likely be a 5 star after I try more on the menu.
