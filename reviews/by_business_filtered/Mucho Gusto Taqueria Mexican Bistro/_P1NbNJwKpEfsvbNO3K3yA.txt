Who knew this was the cool hipster hang out?  Went there on a Friday night during a pseudo reverse happy hour for the Suns game.  We ended up getting five apps to split among four people.  Everything was delicious!  The machaca & cheese flautas were amazing.  We actually got one order then ended up ordering another after tasting them.  The fundido is equally delicious.  If you like guacamole, don't miss out on their version, which includes a jalapeno and Grand Marnier reduction.  Wow, so good!  Service was good.  Margaritas were strong.  And (best of all and of no relation to the restaurant whatsoever) the Suns won!
