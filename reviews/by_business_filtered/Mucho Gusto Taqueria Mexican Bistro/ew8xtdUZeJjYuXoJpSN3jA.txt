Mucho Gusto is a great little taqueria!  I've been there a few times before for dinner and drinks, but last night it was me and the ladies for margaritas.  Mucho Gusto was actually our second choice for the evening as Mill ave was packed with those silly Sun Devil fans (Bear Down!).  We each had a couple margaritas and munched on chips and salsa.  I really appreciate that they brought out a few bowls of salsa for the table so you don't have to reach for the drippy stuff across the table.  Chips were perfectly crispy and salty.  The margaritas were delicious and tasted homemade rather that the result of a store bought mix.  Service was friendly, but less than attentive.  We had to wait a bit for drink refills and when the server cleared our chips and salsa to bring fresh, he never brought the fresh chips or salsa.  Mucho Gusto has a great patio which is apparently dog friendly.  Another customer had his two dogs there.   I'm all about pet friendly, but these dogs were roaming the patio off leash.  Kind of strange for their owner and the staff to allow that.  Oh well, I suppose it just made it seem more authentically Mexican!
