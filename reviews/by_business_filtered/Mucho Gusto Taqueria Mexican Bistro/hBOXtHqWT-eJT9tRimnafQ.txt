This place is awesome. I actually worked there back in college, and having seen how the place operates, I know it's good. Everything is made fresh. Seriously. The syrup for the hibiscus margarita is made on premises with real hibiscus flowers. They even make their own mozarella, chorizo, chips, salsa.  The few things that they have to buy (like cotija cheese), are high quality.  My favorite item was chorizo and clams in an adobo broth with rosemary fry bread. It was so good, and 1/2 price during happy hour. The fish tacos with the pineapple salsa, jalapeno slaw and chipotle crema were sooooo delicious and the red chile pork ( super spicy) too. The maragaritas are great, made with fresh ingredients, and the owner and managers really love food and care about the quality of what's going out. The wine list is great and super affordable. The only thing I never really cared for was the shrimp cocktail- had a "ketchupy" taste to me, oh well. The enviroment is really relaxed, very much a neighborhood bar. As for the some of the negative reviews, much of the menu is designed to be similar to food you would find in Mexico City, not Filiberto's, so there are some things that would be considered unusual if you were looking for standard tex-mex. And as for service, I always thought that it was good. Bar service is probably best, b/c the bartender is always there. Most of the servers at any restaurant in Tempe are ASU students, so service is always going to be a little relaxed. All things considered, the food and drink are amazing. Oh and the patio is super romantic at night, with all of the lights, there's even a fireplace.
