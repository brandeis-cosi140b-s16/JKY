I was in town for a conference last year. After growing mighty weary of the hotel fare we decided to go here for dinner. The service and the food were excellent.

*blank stare*

This was a year ago

In town again for the same conference and I must tell you that I found it hard to believe that this was the same restaurant. We came here for lunch and we had a rather snarky waiter who decided to pick and choose who at the table to be civil to. After my friend asked the waiter if they had fajitas he replied no and said "Lo siento sister". 

Huh? WTF? I'm sure that's cool at the bar with your friends but you don't know us. Keep it professional. Okay one small infraction I'm willing to let go. But this waiter kept on being a smart ass and picking on my friend. "I didn't eat the last batch or write the menu"

WTH?

Ordinarily I would have alerted the Manager or got up and walked out but at that point I was ready to leave but I was hungry and our food was on its way. Also being there with a bunch of people I didn't want to look like an asshole. Our waiter, apparently had no problem with that. 


The food this go around? Not so much. Just ok. 

I won't be back.
