cool atmoshpere. very pleasant and relaxing. menu prices are higher. they averaged $12-$14 a person. the food was very good. they do a different take on mexican food and have many choices on their menu that are not the typical mexican dishes. they add seafood and you can immediately see and taste the quality of the food. i just thought it was pricey. they have a full bar with happy hour prices and a nice outdoor patio for sitting. if you want a very good and different mexican food experience, this is your place. however, it is more expensive then alot of mexican restaurants. they belong to restaurant.com, so you can get huge discounts on certificates for eating there. good all around place. i just didn't the like the more expensive pricing.
