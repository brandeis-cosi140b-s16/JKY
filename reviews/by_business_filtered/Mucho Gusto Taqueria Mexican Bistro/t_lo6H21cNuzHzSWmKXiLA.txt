This is a mixed review for me because I love the ambiance of Mucho Gusto, the staff is really nice, and the orange jalapeno margarita is amazing.

The food however, I was not all that impressed with. We ordered the skewers - mushroom, pork and chicken and we were not blown away with any of it. Maybe I will go back and try their tacos, but I am thinking I will keep it as a good place to sit on the patio, eat chips & salsa and drink a good margarita or two. I am not into "modern" Mexican food (whatever that means) - I like authentic Mexican food!
