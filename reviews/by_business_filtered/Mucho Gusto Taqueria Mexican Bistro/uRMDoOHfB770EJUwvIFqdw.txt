As long as I've been in Tempe, I have driven past Mucho Gusto and never gave it that much thought. Grabbed dinner here with the boy over the weekend at his suggestion and headed on over. I really like the atmosphere, nicely light, warm, buzzword buzzword. We were seated right away and were brought out waters and chips and salsa to start. The salsa is okay - didn't seem homemade but whatever. 

I had the mucho gusto burrito with chicken and the side soup. Their tortilla soup is different. Good, but different. The burrito was really good. The tortilla got a little soggy but otherwise I was pleased with the filling and took half of it home for later (it's huge). Our server was great and I'll probably return.
