I have been here many times, but not recently so I didn't feel like I could review it till I had been back.  First off great chips and salsa!  I have never been disappointed with anything I have had here...the big and little ass burritos are great... I have also had the chimichanga, tamales, and street tacos.  All were very good.  My only complaint was the service this time... extremely slow at lunch time.  I understand lunch rush... believe me I do... but you can't leave your table sitting for so long without coming by.  It took forever for anyone to initially come to our table and then she just disappeared.  It was kind of hot out and we were on the patio baking away.  I am being generous with the stars because you should really give it a try.  I am certain that the service issue was a fluke.
