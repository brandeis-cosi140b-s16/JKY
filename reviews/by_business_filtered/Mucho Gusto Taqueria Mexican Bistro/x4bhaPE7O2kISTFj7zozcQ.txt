i liked it here! food and service were both good. ordered the guacamole for an app--it comes with an unexpected sweet sauce, but it's really, really good!  super addictive.  i got the enchiladas for my main course; it was ok. nothing mind blowing. 
best part of the experience was their hibiscus margarita. best margarita i had in phoenix. :)
