Went for lunch here last week with a bunch of coworkers.  It's a small sitting area - but fine for just a few people. Service was actually pretty quick.  The boasting of a 5 inch tortilla is funny.  But in reality, it's just more tortilla.  I didn't notice any more filling than a regular street taco.  The fish taco was pretty good.  But the Taco with the Bacon in it - GROSS GROSS GROSS.  There is so much grease pouring out of the side of the taco that it soaked through the tortilla and actually ruined the taco sitting next to it.  It's so much grease that it completely ruined my meal.  I think had it been cooked more, and drained - it could have been better.  Also, when we left there the smell on our clothing was so disgusting.  We were actually going up and down the hall spraying febreeze all over.  Not just a regular restaurant smell - but that smell like all you wanted to do was get out of your clothes and take a shower.  My recommendation?  Order take out and just the simple tacos.  They don't have a great handle on the more elaborate ones.
