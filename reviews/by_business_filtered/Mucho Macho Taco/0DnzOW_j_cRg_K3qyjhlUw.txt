I was told to try this place after going to Tacos Atoyac. I was very impressed. The tacos are great and nice way to try different items on the menu. The carne asada is the best one! Nice and flavorful meat to go with pico de gallo, cheese, and great corn tortilla. Although I haven't tried most things, I was not totally impressed with the Joe's Crunchy tacos. Go for more of the traditional ones instead. Also free chips when dining in and great salsas! If you're in central Phoenix make it a point to go here!
