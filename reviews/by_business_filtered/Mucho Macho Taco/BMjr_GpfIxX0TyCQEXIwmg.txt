Mucho Macho Taco - so the Macho comes from using 5" tortillas instead of 3" for their street tacos. Personally I think they should have spent more time making food with Mucho flavor instead of worrying about tortilla sizes. Mucho lacking here at Mucho Macho Taco. I went for lunch and after looking at the menu went with the brisket burrito, with green chillies, carmelized  onions and oranges.... Uh no oranges please. The green chillies were not New Mexico Hatch green chillies but instead food distributor canned green chillies. Carmelized onions, diced and slightly cooked does not equal carmelized. While the brisket was decent I am quite doubtful it was slow cooked out back for 10 hours- most likely off the Shamrock or Sysco truck as well. 
While there is a salsa bar at Mucho Macho I did not care for any of the salsa options. The "hot" salsa which kind of looks like roasted salsa is nothing more than red pepper flakes and oil. Funny, I never use oil when making salsa. The mild was simply blended canned tomatoes and lacked flavor, the green which I am guessing was supposed to be an avocado whipped salsa had decent texture but also lacked flavor. There was no pico salsa available - WTH?? 
So in closing, the location is clean, simple decor, and the guys are nice but I will not be going back here at anytime as it significantly falls short of hundreds of other Mexican restaurants in the valley.
