Went there last night.  Had been to Tacos Atoyac and were thrilled Dan was opening a restaurant near our house. My husband and I took our young adult son and his friend. We ordered tacos (carne asada, brisket, and bacon) and three burritos.  Everything was excellent.   The chips and salsa was delicious. The girl at the cash register was extremely pleasant and helpful.  A great experience and we'll definitely be back soon! Support a  neighborhood location!!
