Absolutely thrilled!!

I litterally work like a 3 minute walk from here and me and a coworker had been dying to try this but always seemed to be extremely busy especially on Fridays, I mean its a tiny parking lot space so it already has no room.

Fast forward to this part Monday. we finally decide to go. BEST DECISION EVER. 
I had 2 tacos, 1 shrimp and 1 bacon (YES BACON!!) and a large horchata.
my co worker had a carne asada torta and an horchata aswell..
we had a sopapillas for desert. everything was delicious!! 5 Stars! 
meat was perfect. THE SALSA OH MY! the best. Make sure to ask for chips to go with your salsa. you wont regret it!

Customer Serivce also gets a 5 stars.
