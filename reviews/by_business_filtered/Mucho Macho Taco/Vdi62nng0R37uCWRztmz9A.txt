I've been here twice so far, and in that time I have consumed their bean and cheese burrito, their grilled veggie burrito, their brisket burrito, and the fish tacos.  I'm a fatty, deal with it.  All food items were super tasty, and their salsas were great as well, cool people, and a cozy interior, hard to beat.  So far, the grilled veggie burrito is my favorite, definitely nom worthy.
