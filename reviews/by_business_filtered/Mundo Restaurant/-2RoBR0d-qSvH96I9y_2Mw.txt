Went there for a birthday dinner.  Three of us, two cocktail orders, and one of those was forgotten and had to track the waiter down in the middle of the restaurant 20 minutes later to get it.  Nice glassware for 'tinis, no special glasses for Ritas. Chilean Sea Bass was okay.  Served wrapped in parchment paper, everything from the bass to the potatoes to the tomatoes had exactly the same texture.  The chicken tortilla soup appeared to be beef bullion based instead of tomato based.  Guacamole left quite a bit to be desired as there was a big void in the seasoning.  All in all, will NOT return, nor would I recommend the dinner to anyone.
