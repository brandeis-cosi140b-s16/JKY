I came here with some friends for some early dinner but we were unaware that the kitchen didn't open until 5pm (It was 4). We sat at the bar, had loads of awesome drinks, and the bartender made sure we had chips and salsa the entire time. Once it came around to ordering food, it came out pretty fast considering the restaurant was pretty packed by the time the kitchen opened. I had the scallops, and they were AMAZING. Best part of the night, our bartender gave us an employee discount, making our bill about 50% percent off. Of course, we left the a hefty tip since she put up with us for a couple of hours!
