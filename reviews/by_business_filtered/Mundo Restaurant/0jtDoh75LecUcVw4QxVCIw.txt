I don't even know where to begin with the good things I have to say about this place. Let's start with the most important thing-the food....Uh-mazing! I have ate here quiet a few times and have tried most of the of menu and I am NEVER disappointed EVER! Every single item is cooked perfectly, fresh, and loaded with flavor. Just perfection. The Sea Bass is one of my all time favorites, it comes out like a present, and boy is it a treat. The queso and street corn is unlike anything I have ever had. Just Heavenly. (My mouth is watering and my stomach is growling as I am typing this.....) the decor is a dream, everything down to the menus are sheik and beautiful! Everyone on the staff is always so helpful, friendly, and fun. Mundo really is a hidden gem.
