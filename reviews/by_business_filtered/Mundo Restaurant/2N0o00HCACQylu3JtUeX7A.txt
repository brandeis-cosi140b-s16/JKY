I ordered the special which was a blackened ribeye which was way overcooked! I ordered medium rare and it was served medium well. Waiter never came back to check on us so I could get another one. I liked how it was blackened but way too done! The others in my party liked their dishes but I tasted theirs and they were just ok. Overpriced! I ordered the special because nothing on the menu sounded that great. chicken enchiladas were served in a bowl. (?) Sticking with Lindo or Don Juans.
