Gosh there are so many gems here in Vegas. I'm just loving this town. This was my first time here and it was such a great experience. Just a treat for the senses. We celebrated my friends birthday here. There were about 10 of us and with that many people to serve there could be so many opportunities for failures, but there were no mishaps. In fact everyone was happy. The drinks were flowing, the food was superb and the staff was attentive and the deserts left me speechless. I had scallops over rice. It was perfect. The presentation, temperature of the food, the perfect balance of Latin seasonings and the perfect heat (spiciness). For the deserts we had an assortment of deserts that consisted of tres leches, churros, flan and apple crepes. All were good by my favorite was the churros. (my mouth just watered typing and reminiscing). What made my night also was that they had Mexican wine. I don't remember the name but it was really good. I think it was some kind of granache blend.
