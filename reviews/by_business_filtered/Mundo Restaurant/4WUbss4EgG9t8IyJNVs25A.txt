Randomly found this place while shopping near by and have been back twice since. The appetizers are awesome, the guacamole has a ton of extra ingredients and it really adds to it. Literally the only knock on this place is the quality of the salsa, but it's not nearly enough to make me knock a star off.

I can personally vouch that the Chilean sea bass is amazing, as is the filet mignon. Other than that I can say of the 15-20 people I've been to the restaurant with, not 1 person has had a complaint about about their entree, so I imagine most of the menu is as good as what I've tried.

Lastly, the desserts are all great, especially the banana empanadas. And I won't leave out that I loved the service, decor and overall feel of the place.
