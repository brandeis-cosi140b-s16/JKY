Mundo is a hidden gem in Las Vegas! Located in the World Market Center, it's centrally located near downtown. Trendy and cool you definitely feel like a VIP. I had lunch with a client at Mundo and had the chicken tacos. Served al a carte, the portions aren't huge but perfect for lunch. We also ordered the guacamole which was made to order and delicious. My tacos were $12, a little pricey for a lunch, but definitely worth the food, service and atmosphere.
