The food and service were excellent!  We went on a Thursday night around 6pm and there wasn't really anyone there besides employees standing around which was kind of concerning at first, the food was slightly over priced and we assumed that's probably why the place was dead. We enjoyed our food and drinks and it's highly likely we will return because it was that good.
