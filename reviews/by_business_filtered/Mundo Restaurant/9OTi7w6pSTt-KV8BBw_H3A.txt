Took some out of towners for dinner last night.  There were muy impressed with the world market center and the lovely decor and ambience of Mundo.

Our food was excellent.  We started with the queso flameado and guacamole.  

Unfortunately, they served our 2 quesos with 6 tortillas and we had 7 people.  Honestly Mundo!?!? You can't serve 1 tortilla per person when we ordered $28 worth of queso??? Not cool.  We asked for more tortillas and received them approximately 12 minutes later after the cheese had congealed.

I had the scallops.  They were seared with a cripy outside and tender inside; topped with a mango  brunoise and accompanied with a flavorful rice.  It was delicious - SPICY!

Everyone else was pleased with their meals too.  All plates were spotless after the meal!

Service was mediocre at best but food delicious as always.
