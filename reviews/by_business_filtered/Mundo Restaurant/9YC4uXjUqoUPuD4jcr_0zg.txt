This Mexican restaurant is very upscale though I think the interior decorator may have pulled a fast one on the owners.  Our server, Jose Luis, was exceptionally informative and assisted us as we worked through the menu.  We started off with complimentary tortilla chips and 3 excellent dips.   My wife chose the avocado leaf crusted sea scallops with poblano and corn rice, mango relish and salsa verde.  I selected the tamarind ancho chile glazed pork tenderloin served with a mango relish and Mexican risotto (double cream, poblano and corn).  The tenderloin took 20 minutes to prepare so be forewarned.  We both agreed that this was our best dining experience in a very long time.
