Located in the World Market Center in Downtown Las Vegas. This is a real hidden gem, not what you would expect at all. Great food, in a secluded atmosphere. I was going to say if you find yourself downtown stop in, but i think it's worth a special trip. Yes it's that good. Live it up you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!
