First, kudos to the YELP app.  I was able to make a reservation and the restaurant sent me a reminder of my reservation. 

Next, even though the chips, salsa, guacamole and margaritas were amazing and I appreciate the beautiful d√©cor, I do not like waiting a long time for my meal to be served and this is why they received a four-star.  

This was the third time there and will continue eating at Mundo's
