After getting lost and nearly getting into an accident, we finally found this restaurant. We could not figure out where to park, so we parked in the outlet mall parking structure and walked over. The signage for the restaurant was poorly designed and difficult to see at night; we informed the hostess of this.

There was a singer belting out Rat Pack classics; he was really good. Service is excellent, cocktails delicious, food sublime, and d√©cor wonderful. A perfect experience and highly recommended. Will definitely return, especially after a day of outlet shopping next door, now that we know where this wonderful restaurant is.
