If it weren't for the super slow service, I would give Mundo 4-1/2 stars.  The food is phenomenal but I cannot get past the poor service.  I work across the street so I've been coming here for years.  I always think the next time, the service will be better.  Nope.  I'm shocked they cannot at least get their act together for Smith Center shows. It's bust every Weekend night before the Broadway series but they never seem to be staffed appropriately. I feel bad for the bartender, he probably doesn't get tipped well because everyone is mad by the time they get their check.

However, the food really is great!  Best chips and salsa in Las Vegas.  The chimichurri steak salad is amazing.  Perfect seasoning, perfect accompaniments, perfect portion.  The shrimp tacos also will not disappoint.

A nice note on the atmosphere as well.  Fun and inviting, upbeat and fun but not too loud.

If you have the time to wait for the server, your drinks, your food and then your check, go for it!  The food is definitely worth the wait.
