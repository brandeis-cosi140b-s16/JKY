We had our wedding reception/luncheon here on a Saturday, and they made a reservation for us for 30 people no problem, and had the table ready to go and beautifully decorated when we arrived. They even asked if we had special requests of how we would like it set-up. We ordered from the brunch menu, and everyone was more than satisfied with the food. A couple orders did come out just slightly behind the others, but they made sure to come and acknowledge it, and provided a complimentary entree for us to sample while we waited. The decor of the Restaurant was gorgeous and they allowed us to take wedding photos in a side room that happened to be empty, and even offered to adjust the lighting for our photos. They were willing to split the check by couples, and the entire staff was very courteous through the whole experience. I was nervous about going here for such an important event, considering we didn't know anyone that had actually dined here before, but it turned out so wonderfully, and helped create some beautiful memories.
