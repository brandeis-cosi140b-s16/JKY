Just ate here tonight.  Had the guacamole - decent.....crispy calamari - very good........chicken with a sweet chile sauce - very good. Wife had the filt mignon chile relleno - good, but the sauce seemed to be somewhat bland.  Finished with the flan which is among the best we have ever had.

Overall good, however a bit pricey, so expect to spend about $50+ (includes tip) per person.
