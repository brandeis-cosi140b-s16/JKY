Every once in a while there's a blurp in service, but I've never gone to Mundo and not had an absolutely delicious meal.  I don't know why everyone is giving 1-2 stars without even mentioning the food.  Dollar for dollar one of the best restaurants in Vegas and it's a travesty that more people don't go here.  They really need to change locations though because there's literally 0 walk-in traffic in the off season.

The wagyu beef skewers, mexican street corn, and the pork tenderloin is pretty much my perfect meal.
