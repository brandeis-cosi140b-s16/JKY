very good yummy food, the place is very stylish and beautiful. I liked everything. But this place receives 4 starts only because of the very very veeeery bad hostess they had today (Feb. 9) for lunch. when we came in she didn't even lift her eyes to acknowledge our presence, told us to wait for a table and didn't even tell anyone to set up a table for us (while the place had only 2 full tables LOL) and when we (only 2 people) told her that this was ridiculous, she still would not allow us to sit at a table. Very not proper restaurant hostess attitude!!  But, once again, I was to emphasize that the food was great, the rest of service was spot on. I will go back for sure, but I hope I won't see the same sour face at the door.
