I have been to this resturant three times so that should tell you that it is a good place to eat. the food is awsome the love the fact that the dinner menu is different from the lunch menu which allows you to try several different items on the meni. the happy hour portions are nice size as well for you to have sometyhing to snack on while having drinks. The pricing is well worth what you get in food size and taste. The one issue that needs to be addressed is the service. thw two times i was there i had servers who seemed as if they had just started with the resturant. Overall i would for sure tell people to try this place i will be going back when my friends come into town in two months.
