As the Downtown Las Vegas dining scene continues to expand faster than Kirstie Alley's waistline, along comes Mundo. 

Located on the ground level of Word Market Center at one of the most architecturally interesting intersections in the valley, you will find Mundo-A Culinary Haute Spot. 

You will discover a hip dining area and bar that is tastefully decorated and (like the food) incorporates a fusion of influences. 

I think you could throw a dart at the menu, and be very pleased with what comes out of the kitchen. Think freshness, flair, and fab flavor. This is not you're mamacita's Mexican restaurant. Dishes that are ordinary at other Mexican eateries are extraordinary at Mundo. This is on the upper end of the pricing scale compared to most Mexican places, with most dinner entrees in the $20-$40 range-lunch $10-$20 (a la carte), but this is clearly more labor intensive food, prepared with soul, fusing fresh-top notch ingredients into a world of savory flavors. 

Mundo-A Culinary Haute Spot, will rock you're mundo (world).
