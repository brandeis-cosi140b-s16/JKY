I would give this joint 5 stars if I didn't get a stomach flu after eating here. BUT, this could have completely been my fault. I enjoyed most everything I ate here.

My fiance and I shared the calamari appetizer. we tried our friends grilled calamari appetizer and I actually prefer that texture and taste better than the fried.

We then shared a diablo shrimp platter that was packed full of flavor and is definitely on the spicy tip, but not too too spicy where you can no longer taste the flavors. It was perfect and actually enough to split into 2 entrees (if you tell them you are sharing, the y will split the entree for you).

The table then shared the churros, which were really good! Warm, and with ice cream; yum!

We also shared the street corn; this was bomb.com/amazing!

The ambiance here is quite inviting. They had a live performer singing beautiful melodies that I didnt' realize was a real person until I turned around to look at him. This is a great place for date night, or a nice family dinner or dinner with close friends. It provides an intimate setting, and great food!
