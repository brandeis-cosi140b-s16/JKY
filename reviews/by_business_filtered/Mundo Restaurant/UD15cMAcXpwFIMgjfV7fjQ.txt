Just had lunch here for the second time, and this place does not disappoint! The lunch prices are pretty reasonable, the dinner prices are a bit more expensive but that is to be expected. The interior is gorgeous, metal lanterns hang all over the place and you feel relaxed as soon as you step inside. The location is a little random, but hopefully that will keep this place from getting packed so I can still wander in for lunch without worrying about a reservation. 

The last time I ate here I had the carnitas in black bean cilantro sauce....mother of YUMMMM it was good. That is unfortunately on the lunch menu anymore, but I'm hoping they bring it back in the winter maybe. The pork is fantastic and tender and you can taste that everything is homemade with quality ingredients. 
This time I ate the Sarape de pollo, which was a thinly pounded piece of chicken with manchego, black beans, and chimi churri sauce, pico, and guac on top. Again, simple but so so good. Also the chips you get when you sit down come with 3 salsas that are all also quite tasty. 

I haven't tried any of the drinks yet, but they have a happy hour with $3 drinks that I'm going to try sometime soon. If you enjoy simple, delicious Mexican, check this place out, it's INCREIBLE!!!
