Mundo would rate a full 5 stars but I am subtracting a half star for the poor music and the high volume even at 5 PM when there were no young things there who wanted to listen to techno music done loud.

Other than that, I really enjoyed going here tonight.  It is pricey, but I knew that going in and we had a $25 Restaurant.com certificate.

We were brought the chips and salsa and we ordered the guacamole.  The salsa and guacamole were great!  The waiter gave us plenty of time to study the menu.  When we were not yet decided, we asked him over to answer some of our questions. Based on his full knowledge of the menu items and their manner of cooking, we ordered.  My wife got the pollo rostisado with a side of spinach with garlic and onions.  The side came with her meal.  Since she's such a gringa, she had them make the spinach without the jalape√±os (what a shame!).  Her chicken came with a great seasoning and she got the tamarind chile glaze in a side dish.  Together, the seasoning and the tamarind glaze were superb!

I ordered the sea scallops with diablo spiced rice, ripe mango relish, and an avocado leaf crust on the scallops.  This was another winner with great seasoning - spicy on the scallops and good zing with the rice.  I ordered a side of Mexican style street corn with chile arbol, cotija cheese, with citrus and cilantro.  The corn was very good and it also had good spiciness.

I decided to go for dessert, too.  I ordered the churros.  They serve them with caramel inside and some caramel drizzled over them.  There's a small bowl of Mexican chocolate for dipping the churros or spooning on and a small dip of vanilla ice cream.  It was a perfect end to this dinner.

I really like Mundo.  I like the interior with its light wall and the chain lamps hanging from the ceiling.  It really was an enjoyable evening.  Service was prompt, friendly, and knowledgeable.  I know I'll be back!
