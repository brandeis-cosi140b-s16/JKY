Monday night dinner... Fantastic! Service fantastic. I ordered the sea bass in parchment paper - delicious!! Our server advised me it would take longer for prep
- and it did. She advised it was spicy, and it was. But totally worth the wait and my taste buds were happy - spicy and yummy! Sadly, it was not busy. Selfishly, it was great for us. Service was great and noise level was minimal. And that was great for us. Valet is free - just tip, and worth the few bucks rather than hoofing it. My friend said it was  busier during the day. I suppose the design / furniture stores, outlets and downtown biz folks draw a different crowd. But I would def recommend Mundo, and return, regardless of the time.
