went here for our parents' 40th anniversary. called ahead to make a reservation. the staff was very friendly and made our parents' feel special by congratulating them as they walked in (so they had taken a look at my notes on the reservation!). we had a beautiful table awaiting us, the music was soft, the decor wonderful. easy to have conversation, very attentive staff, and absolutely delicious food. 

i would recommend the 'pork tenderloin' as the the single most delicious dish on their menu. 

great place for family. we had a 9month baby with us and the staff was very helpful in making sure to get us any thing we needed and also were kind to the baby.
