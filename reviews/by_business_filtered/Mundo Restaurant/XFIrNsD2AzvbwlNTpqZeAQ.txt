Great mexican food!  Go with a group for a tapas-like experience. Otherwise, the dishes are pretty large. 

I normally don't like queso that much but this one was incredible (goat cheese and mushroom). 
Also, the scallops were amazing. Only about 4 but they are large, get something else if you are hungry.
