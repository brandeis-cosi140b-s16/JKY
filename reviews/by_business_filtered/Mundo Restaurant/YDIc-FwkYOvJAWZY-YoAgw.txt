This is without a doubt the best Latin restaurant I have been to in Las Vegas, and I've been to quite a few. 

Every dish I've tried at Mundo has been delectable, but the red chile crust prime filet mignon and the pollo rostisado are my favorites.  There's also a great selection of wines to complement every meal.

To top it off, the decor in the restaurant is stylish and elegant, and the service is outstanding. 

When family and friend come to visit, I take them to the Mundo Restaurant and I recommend it to everyone.
