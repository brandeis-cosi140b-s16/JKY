Excellent food and great service! The receptionist, however, was so busy talking to girl friends that she didn't acknowledge our party.  One of the other girls attempted to confirm our reservations on the computer and the receptionist took the computerized pad out of her hand, a second attendant attempted the same thing and became frustrated with the hostess and seated us.  After that the friends left and the hostess was totally unconcerned.  The attendant apologized for the hostess, but the hostess could care less.  Terrible public face for such a great dining establishment.
