First of all, I probably never NEVER ever EVER would have discovered this restaurant without yelp's assistance. Thanks for that yelp. This Mexican restaurant is tucked away in the World Market Center, which most people in Vegas are clueless about anyway. I strolled in here on a Saturday afternoon w/ a friend around 2. Even though the showrooms of the center were closed for the weekend, Mundo had a few groups of patrons. From the moment you walk in you just feel cool. You already feel like you aren't in Vegas from the outside. There is chic (and comfortable) furniture, trendy mirrors, CNN on the plasma, and a pleasant vibe. Its fancy, but not so fancy it makes you feel like you have to use your most prim and proper behavior. The waiters were very attentive, the menu is easy, drinks come in large wine type glasses, and you get complimentary tortilla chips and sauces. 

I had the "Chicken Tostida Salad" and my friend just got some guacamole (its ridiculously priced at $9, but its mashed fresh to order). Although I expected a larger portion of the salad, it was divine! In all honesty, best salad I've ever tasted. The chicken was roasted to perfection and very tender. Be warned, it is spicy, but I probably should have expected that. For iced tea (unsweetened) and a salad, my order came to $17.30. The waiters were very friendly and stopped by our table multiple times to check on us.

I HIGHLY recommend this place. Can't wait to go back and get some more. As its not at all noticeable from the outside, its definitely a local surprise that everyone should experience.
