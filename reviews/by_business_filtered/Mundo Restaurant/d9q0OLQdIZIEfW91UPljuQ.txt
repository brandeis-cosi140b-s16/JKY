The boyfriend and I decided to have date night and dress up.
He planned the night and chose this place as his roommate raved so much about it.

As we drove up, I was pretty shocked that it was in the World Market Center because I thought only people in conventions were allowed in. Low and behold, it was right outside World Market. The walk up was simply amazing as WM is just a huge behemoth of a structure.

When we walked in, it felt so homey and comforting. Like I was in grandma's extremely nice house. All about the lighting, I guess.

We had a table with one of those big/king sized chairs. So big that the BF wound up sitting next to me during dinner.

Our waiter was really funny and informative about his and the restaurant's fave dishes.

Started our dinner with a few cocktails. I forget the names of them but, I know his margarita wasn't as sour/tarte as they normally are so, I liked that a lot.

We ordered the ahi tuna pizza app and it was AHHHHMAAAAAZIIIIIIIIIING.
Crust was thin and crispy. Reminded me of a really good and waaaaay fancier Mexican Pizza from Taco Bell (but, obvs way better)! I could've eaten 4 of them stacked on each other as a meal!

For entrees, I had the Chilean Sea Bass and he had the filet stuffed Chile Rellano; and elote for a side.
The sea bass was soooooo beautifully presented. All wrapped up like a delicious gift!
His filet was perfectly juicy and tasty; and went very well with the spiciness of the Chile. The sauce added extra kick and spice to the dish.
The elote was elote. My FAVE, as always. You can never get Mexi corn wrong.

We were so stuffed that we didn't have room for dessert. Which I would love to come back for.


What's even more great about this place is that they are vegan/vegetarian friendly. I was excited to tell my roommate who is dating a vegan/vegetarian.


All in all, I'm excited for more date nights here. Very romantic and intimate!
