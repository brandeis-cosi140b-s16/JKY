The atmosphere is great and the food is alright (my dish was too spicy), but it is pretty darn pricey for the overall quality. I'd rather go to a fancier restaurant for those prices. The service was a little slow but nothing to complain about. I don't think we'll be going back because the prices don't match the food and happy hour is only for those at the bar boo!
