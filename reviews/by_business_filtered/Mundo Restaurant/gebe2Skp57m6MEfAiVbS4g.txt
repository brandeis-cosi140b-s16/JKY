Atmosphere: 
Being inside the World Market Center, Mundo has certainly earned its right to the space inside this building. The mood is created by soft lighting (iron cast lanterns and dimly lit candles along the wall) and mirrors. Inspiration came from several places. The oversized teal and leather brown armchairs coupled with regular restaurant seats created an "Alice in Wonderland" feel to it. The lounged also captivated imagination with a similar approach. The use of mirrors, lanterns, and large objects was intriguing. 

Drinks:
He had a mojito and I had the sangria. They were decent, B-class drinks. The mojito was sweet and refreshing, the sangria was nice.

Food:
Appetizer - had the fried calamari. It was delicious!
Entrees - he had the carnitas (cooked to tender perfection) and I had the scallops. They were orgasmic! I would recommend these two dishes and order them both again for sure!
