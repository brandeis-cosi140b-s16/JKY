Located in the World Market Center in downtown Las Vegas.  My dining companion and I came here due to the positive yelp reviews.  Firstly, I would say that though yelpers have rated it "casual", it's not--I've spent the entire day walking the strip in the heat--casual.  My dining companion was wearing shorts and a t-shirt and felt under-dressed.  I ordered the chicken enchiladas and my dining companion had their carnitas.  Neither dish was outstanding.  Maybe I've had a little too much absolutely amazing cheap Mexican food (in both Mexico and places in CA) but if you're charging me nearly 20 bucks for a couple of chicken enchiladas (no sides), then they better be over-the-moon fantastic.  They were not.  Dining companion reported the $24 carnitas solid but not fabulous.  The one redeeming factor was the service.  Our servers were excellent--friendly, prompt, and everything you'd like a server to be!  4 star for the service, 2 star for the food--split the difference and hit it with 3 stars.
