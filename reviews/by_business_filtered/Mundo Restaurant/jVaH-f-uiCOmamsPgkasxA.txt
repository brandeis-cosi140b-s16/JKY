Love this place!!  Never disappoints.  The only thing I will say is that the Valet people are very inconsistent!   We arrived for dinner and parked in Valet.  Kind of empty, but none the less we knew we were there for a good meal and not the social ambiance. 
We started with the Gilled Calamari .  Very tasty and definitely a unique amazing spicy flavor to it! If you like spicy this dish is for you!  It come along with a sauce that is delicious and some  mixed greens  and grilled veggies which give the appetizer an amazing flavor.   If you are not a fan of spicy we were told you can let them know so it is not made as spicy, but trust me when I say good as made by the Chef!   
Next we shared a few other dishes.  We had the Sweet Chipotle glaze shrimp tamale , Pork Chop, Ahi Tuna Tostada and  the street corn.

The sweet chipotle glaze shrimp tamale  I had never had before!  My  friend had and he recommended it.  OMG  it made the " I MUST HAVE  LIST"  perfect combination of sweetness form the tamale and the grilled Shrimp in glazed in chipotle is perfect. 
 Pork Chops perfectly cooked layed on mashed potatoes. 
 Ahi Tuna Tostada I had never tried either. Again, another dish that is a a must with a good amount of spicy. 

Last, but not least.  The Street corn is always a treat. 

Oh I forgot to finish my story on valet  guy.  It seem they always leave early.  He walked around giving keys back to customers as they were having dinner.   Which tends to ruin the dinner experience.  Mundo was not closing as 3 other tables still were sat after we were given our keys. It seems this happens a lot more often than I would like it to.  I under stand if only 1 or two cars are left and the place is closed. However when people are still eating and you have to stop to get your keys, tip them( lucky I had a $5 otherwise would need to ask for change)  I am don ranting about Valet.   Food is awesome and if you have not tried this Gem out do so soon.   Lunch is always great also.
