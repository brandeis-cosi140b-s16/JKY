I order something different every time I go. I am never disappointed, the service is great, the food is phenomenal and the prices are not horrible. I love their street corn, and the enchiladas are flavorful and spicy. I recommend making reservations when you plan on going to the Smith Center before or after because it does get busy and who wants to wait. I can't wait to go again :)
