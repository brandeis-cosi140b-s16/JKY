Not an easy place to get to but worth the trip. We went for lunch. The hostess was super nice. We came with my special needs adult son in a wheelchair and she took the time to engage in conversation with him. The atmosphere is very nice. We started with hot sauce, guacamole and chips which was very good. The chips were nice and warm. Hot sauce was not spicy but good. I like a little bite in my hot sauce. Guacamole was nice and fresh My husband had the wagu skirt steak salad and it was delicious. My son had the chicken enchiladas and it was good but a little soupy for my taste. I had the chicken tostado salad.  It came with a delicious roasted chicken thigh with some char.  Couldn't really taste the black beans on the chalupa shell .  Would have preferred a little less shredded iceberg lettuce.  Otherwise it was good.  Waiter was attentive and our tea glass was always refilled. I would come back.
