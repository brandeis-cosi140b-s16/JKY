I hope I'm not gushing... I try to reserve 5-star reviews for REALLY exceptional places/experiences, but as my lunch at Mundo was BY FAR the best meal I had during my recent trip to Vegas, I think it is warranted. Everything from the decor to the food, to the service, was EXCELLENT. And very reasonably-priced! It's a bit of a Hidden Gem, being located in the back of World Market Center, but that made it feel all the more special. A special reward for those who put some extra effort into seeking out something cool. Would definitely go back the next time I'm there (and probably WILL, as it's near my company's location in Las Vegas). Am looking forward to it!
