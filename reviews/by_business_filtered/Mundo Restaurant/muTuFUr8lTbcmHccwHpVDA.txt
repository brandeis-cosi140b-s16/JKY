This place is a nice modern Mexican cuisine spot next to the world center.  I got the diablo shrimp here.  It was excellent.  The shrimp was cooked perfectly and had the right amount of heat.  The rice was nice and fluffy.  Would definitely come back again.  

It is on the pricier side for Mexican food - I would say about $50 per head.  However if you want Mexican and want to avoid a super greasy hole in the wall - this place is a nice change of pace. 

They do give free chips and salsa.  All very delicious.
