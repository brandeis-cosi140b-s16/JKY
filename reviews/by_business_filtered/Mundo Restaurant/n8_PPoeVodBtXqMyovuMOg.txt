Been here twice for lunch! Chips and salsa are good! First time I had the Chilean Sea Bass tacos... yummy but a bit too spicy for my taste buds! Nonetheless, it was still flavorful! Today I had the Steak tacos... Yummers!! Love the decor! Friendly & quick service! Kind of pricey for Mexican food... but it's worth it!
