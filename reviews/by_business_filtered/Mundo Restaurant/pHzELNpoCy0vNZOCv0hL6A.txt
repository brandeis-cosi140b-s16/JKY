Amazing food & atmosphere! I had the chicken enchiladas...best I've ever had!  My husband & friends had the prime rib chile rellenos & they had the same reaction. Margaritas are phenomenal!  The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating is because I feel it is a bit overpriced. Must try once for sure & will def go again when in Vegas next!
