My husband & I have been loyal customers of Mundo since they were La Madonna off of Fort Apache. The cheese risotto is to die for!! The pollo rostisado with the tamarind glaze is another favorite. 
Our absolute favorite waiter is Jose. He's very attentive even when swamped with a large group. His busboy is also very attentive. 
If I could eat avant guard Mexican food every day it would definitely be Mundo.
