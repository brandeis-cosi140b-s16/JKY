What a delightful culinary experience! What a pain to find. Once we got there, it was so well worth the effort. 
We started with the guacamole,  served with the house salsa and chips. The guacamole was flavorful, just the right heat for even those who prefer the mild side. 
The tortilla soup was amazing, the chili flavor dominating the broth. Yummo!
Then on to the main courses: the enchiladas... outstanding. The scallops... to die for. The steaks.... a little disappointing. Not a lot of flavor, one was way underdone (ordered medium rare, was served basically raw), but not a major detraction to the meal.
Service was beyond attentive. Glasses always filled,  just perfect  without "hovering". The ambiance was pleasant, quiet, no loud, overbearing music.  
Bayliss is a favorite of ours, and Mundo certainly shows his talents once again.
