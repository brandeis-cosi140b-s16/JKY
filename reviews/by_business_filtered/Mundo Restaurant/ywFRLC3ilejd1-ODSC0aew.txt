I'm constantly surprised by Mundo.  I seem to wind up here every couple of months, whether for lunch or dinner, and each time they have managed to come up with another tweak to their menu that takes Mex food to the next level.
Is service the greatest in town? No.  Are prices low? Definitely not.  What Mundo does have is a unique, tasteful space, rocking sangria, and a veritable monopoly on gourmet Mexican fare in Las Vegas.  I have yet to take a first-timer here that hasn't been impressed.
My only big complaint is that they took the Roasted Poblano Corn Chowder off of the menu.  One of the most phenomenal soups that I have ever tasted.  If you're a meat fan, I highly recommend the Ribeye, and the Poblano risotto is fantastic.
