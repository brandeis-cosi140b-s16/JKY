The only thing this place is good for is to get drunk off of margaritas. That way u won't be able to taste how horrible the food is, and won't notice how crappy the service is, unless they're not keeping the drinks coming. By the time they brought out our food, the lettuce in the fajita salad and southwestern salad was soggy. The Mexican rice was dry, and the kid's nachos were served with stale tortillas. The only thing that was good was the so called "filet mignon" fajita meat and the white peach margarita. 
I noticed a private party in the back with about 3-5 dedicated servers; which would explain why our service was slow and nonexistent.
