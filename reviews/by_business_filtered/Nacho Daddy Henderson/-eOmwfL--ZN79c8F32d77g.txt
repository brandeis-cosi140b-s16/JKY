Really eager to check this place out (especially bc Ioved Fire fly). First impression was terrible. It's Sunday 7pm and not really that crowded but the servers don't seem to have a clue what they're doing. We were greeted after being seated for 10 minutes and then took another 10 min to bring my wine.
