Stopped in for dinner. The service was good. They let me substitute some sides, which was nice.  I had the mahi mahi tacos. They were really flavorful but the shells were a little on the greasy side. I could only eat one whole one. The other one I gutted but the fish was moist and tasted fresh.  Their hot salsa had a great flavor and some nice heat to it. Over all I give them 3 1/2 stars. It's not a bad place but I just wasn't overly impressed.
