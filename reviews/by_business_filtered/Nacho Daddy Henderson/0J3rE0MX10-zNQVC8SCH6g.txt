Had lunch here on a Saturday (6/28/14). This was our 2nd time here.  I give our original server 2 stars for being patient while we made up our minds but the restaurant was not incredibly busy.  The table was sticky and required  a wipe-down.  Once we put our order in, it seemed to take a long time..  We ordered the Enchilada nachos and the Thai Chicken nachos (second time we had it).  The food was adequate.  The first time we ate there, I had a more favorable impression.  The wait for our check was tortuous.  Luckily another server noticed we wanted to leave.  Given all the places in Vegas & Henderson to eat it, this won't be on our rotation anymore.
