In the mood for nachos? They've got it covered.  There is a huge variety of nachos you can get here.  I've tried several different ones.  My favorite that stands out is the Supreme Tostada.  It's topped high with seasoned taco meat, cheese blend, Queso, refried beans, jalape√±os, sour cream and guacamole.  My husband doesn't like cilantro so our waitress out the pico de gallo on the side for me.  They no longer have two different sizes if nachos.  The one size they do offer is plenty to split between two people.  Delicious! 

We also split the fajita cheesesteak sandwich.  Absolutely wonderful with seared sirloin, onions, peppers and white Queso.  Again this was huge enough to split.  You offer sweet potato fries? Sign me up! They were perfectly crisp and soft at the same time.  Yum!

Service here is hit and miss.  When we sit in the bar area, it's not as good.  But when in the dining area, it's fantastic! Chelsea, who was our most recent waitress, was awesome! She had a fun and bubbly personality that made our visit even more wonderful.  

It also helps that we receive coupons in the mail quite often which makes it a great deal.  Try them out!
