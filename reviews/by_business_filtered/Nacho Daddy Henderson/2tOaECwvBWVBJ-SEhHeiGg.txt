We really enjoyed our dinner here.  When we arrived we went into the bar but they were having Trivia Night and since I don't know anything we went into the restaurant area.

Great service (Terra K) and the food was delicious.  My wife had the Carne Asada Tacos which were large with thick but light and flaky tortillas.  I opted for nachos since this is their primary draw.  Had the Supreme Taco Nachos and the ingrediants were top notch.  Normally you get more chips than toppings but not here, I had good stuff until the end.  Chose the hot salsa which was good but not on fire, I would call it gringo hot, but if you are from the midwest you might want to choose a more mild version.

Although not necessary we thougt we would split a dessert and chose the Flan.  Very good and just about right for 2 people that have just stuffed themselves.  We will be back and give the Happy Hour a try.  Oops, forgot to add that they start you off with two moist and tasty jalepeno corn bread biscuits - could have eaten dozen.
