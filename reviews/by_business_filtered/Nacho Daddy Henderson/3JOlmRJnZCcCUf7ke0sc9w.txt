Staff is nice, the facilities are nice, the nachos suck!

I guess any place that offers chez whiz as a topping is a red flag. The 3 cheese blend we ordered came out as an all white looking cheese that tasted like washing detergent. The flour chips were greasy and under cooked. I think the nachos at the movie theater are better... Sad! 

I think there is potential in this place, but if they can't make good nachos, what's the point?
