Nacho Daddy is the place to go if you are in the mood for nachos and great margaritas!  The fiesta chicken nachos are one of my favorites.  The salads are all really delicious too.  The enchilada nachos are good, but they tend to get a bit soggy because they are smothered with enchilada sauce.  They have live trivia on Wednesday nights, which is fun and different than your average bar.  The patio is a perfect place for margaritas, good food and fun!
