If -minus stars were an option, this place would get minus 5. OMG, this is the worst food I've ever has. Ordered some type of nacho plate and a cup of tortilla soup. The soup was so salty and the nachos were so bad that I had one bite, paid my bill and left. This was several months ago and I read they have new management, so hopefully they've got their act together. I'm afraid to go back.
