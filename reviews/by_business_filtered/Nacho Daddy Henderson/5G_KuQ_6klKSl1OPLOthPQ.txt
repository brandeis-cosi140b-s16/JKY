First came here when they took over from El Jefe... thought the food was average and that they took tortilla chips and piled anything on them. 

Last week we got a menu in the mail, it appeared they had revamped things so we decided to check it out. 
We were nicely greeted when we walked in and seated within minutes. 
Our server was great! Bright, bubbly and answered all of our questions about the menu items. 
We were greeted with jalapeno cornbread muffins, they were good, but chips & salsa would have been better. They do have it on the menu with a charge.. Not the case at most mexican restaurants
My husband ordered the Cheesesteak with a mexican twist, I took a bite and it was great! Soft bun, tender meat smothered in white cheese, peppers and onions. It came with fries, however he ordered a side salad. 
I ordered the ceviche. Fortunately it did not have the word shrimp before it. Although it had great taste, there was most likely two shrimp in the entire dish cut up smaller than bite size, and lots of cucumber. Which I like, but don't expect it to be the center of the dish. 
My children ordered off the kids menu which offered both american and mexican food, They ordered sliders and a bean & cheese burrito. The sliders were a little greasy on the top of the bun. Both were happy with their choices.
