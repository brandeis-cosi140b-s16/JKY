I went in this establishment on 9/24/14. I ordered a frozen margarita and chicken tacos. The tacos were very bland. The margarita was disgusting!! I don't understand how a bartender can mess up something as simple as a margarita, but he/she did. The server was polite, but only returned to leave the check. I was shocked they didn't offer complimentary chips and salsa. I wouldn't recommend this place. The only redeeming quality this restaurant has is the EXIT door.
