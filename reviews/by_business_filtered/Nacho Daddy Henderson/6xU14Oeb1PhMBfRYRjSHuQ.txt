This was our fourth trip to Nacho Daddy, after after a long deliberation of where we would like to go for the evening. Let me start by saying that it wasn't horrible, like some of our initial experiences. I ordered the Tostada Nachos,  the little lady ordered the enchiladas. The enchiladas weren't anything special, lacking any major seasoning that would set them apart from more spectacular enchiladas like at Lindo. The Tostada Nachos left much to be desired. The three cheese blend tasted like a love child of velveeta and Kraft cheezwiz.  The ground beef was a swelling chunk of unseasoned, dried cow remains. The jalape√±os tried to save the travesty, but only offered subtle jabs at the taste buds.  Oh, the corn appetizer was decent. The three star review is due to the great service and friendly staff, but the claim that they have the best Mexican food is a fallacy and utter ridiculous.
