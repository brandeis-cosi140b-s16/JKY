Was in Vegas for work and picked this place solely because of the funny name/location to my office. We went at lunch on a Tuesday and got seated immediately. The server was very sweet and helpful. We got the buffalo nachos and the florentine nachos. Both were good- I think the buffalo were better but they're spicier than the others. Would definitely go back.
