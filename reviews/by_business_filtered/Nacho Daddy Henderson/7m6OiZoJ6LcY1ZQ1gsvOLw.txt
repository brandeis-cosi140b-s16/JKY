Giving Nacho Daddy a star bump!

Went today with Vanessa N and her hubs. Food was better than before and I think they have bumped up the quality and service! 

I'm still not 100% sold on their "nacho" sauce--I remembered when I was eating it why I didn't really care for it before. It tastes like Velveeta. I'm trying to eat less Frankenfood these days but I have never, ever, ever liked the taste of Velveeta. But everything else on the nachos was great!
