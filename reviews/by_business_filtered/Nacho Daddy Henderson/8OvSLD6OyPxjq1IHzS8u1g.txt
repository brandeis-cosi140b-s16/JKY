Let me preface this with my experience was from about a year ago, but have just begun really using yelp, and my experience left a serious impression.

I was working in the area at a local school, and a co-worker mentioned this concept.  We both love Nachos so I was psyched and amazed  that someone finally came up with this idea.

I ordered a build your own nachos to go.   When I arrived to pick up the food the place was pretty barren. I sat at the bar and the bar itself was incredibly sticky and kind of gross.  

My food was suppose to be ready in 15 minutes and it took closer to 30 which surprised me.  When the food arrived it didn't look incredibly appetizing, and frankly tasted like canned rosarita beans and imitation cheese.  

I had really looked forward to trying this place and was sorely disappointed.
