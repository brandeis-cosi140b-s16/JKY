I give it 3 stars because I feel generous. They have a really nice bar. Its the first bar I've seen that had Cabo Wabo. So that's pretty good... Just everything else they fumbled with. My mother ordered a cocktail and 10 mins later I ordered one. Mine came out first. She had to ask not once but, twice to get her drink.  I ordered a burger but, they forgot to take that completely. My mother ordered soup. They forgot that. 
I saw this waiter bringing out nachos. I look at him as if to say "yeah that's ours" 
He wanders around through 4 tables before finally serving us our appetizer 
They fumbled the drinks. They fumbled on the main course. Everything took a little too long. 
but, the food was good.  I saw the supervisor check on us twice with an white envelope in her hand. She waited until after the bill was paid to give us the envelope. It was a $10 gift certificate. To make up for the lost order of soup and a burger. 
It was just barely enough to keep me from being outraged. 
Though, the nice big bar and the good food kept me from being outraged. I'll give it another shot.

This place still needs work.
