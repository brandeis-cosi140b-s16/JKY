im not gonna lie, the main reason that we checked this place out was the name! i expected it to be an authentic mexican joint (it used to be a mexican restaurant). the decor was still the same as it was before. huge bar area and the main dining area was roomy as well. 

their menu comprised of mostly nachos (surprise!) and your typical bar fare. they had simple pastas, a couple burritos, salads, etc. since they specialize in nachos, they had a plethera of every kind of nacho combination you can think of. they had some novelty items on the menu like the nachos with meal worms, circkets, and scorpions for the more adventurous eater, or the hawaiian nachos with spam, pineapple and kimchee.

i had the steak fajita nachos. typical steak fajita served on top of crisped flour tortillas with the usual fixins. it was pretty average. the amount of meat was al ittle disappointing. my bf had the fish tacos. battered white fish on corn tortillas.

nothing too exciting with their food really. pretty average. just a good place to hang out and watch the game and eat appetizers i guess. catchy name though :)
