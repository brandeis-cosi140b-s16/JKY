First time being here with family and I gotta admit this place is freaking awesome. Chilled and quiet atmosphere for family. Best part is that there is multiple  televisions so we could enjoy your favorite professional team playing(if they are playing that day). Also a nice feature is if your friends, there is pretty nice looking bar where you and your friends could enjoy some beers or enjoy a couple premium drinks. Another good part about this place is there food. Especially there nachos, which is a really big portion and they taste fantastic. I like how there is different kinds of nachos which is a nice option. 

One thing I like about this place is there specials. Especially on Tuesdays which they serve 10 tacos for $10. And the tacos also taste fantastic. If you want to come here, enjoy some great food, great drinks, and game or two. Come here!!! You won't regret it!!! Now!!!!!! I'm serious come to this place!!!!
