The service and food were good. I got the pork street tacos and overall they were good. I like the pork but not the cheese stuff on top. My boyfriend got the fish tacos and they looked pretty and he said they were ok. 
Out waitress was quick and seemed nice. She didn't talk much which was fine by me as I'd rather just get my food and not chit chat. 
However out table and my booth seat were super sticky. And the seat was broken so it stuck to me and slide around.
