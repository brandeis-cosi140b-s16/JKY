So, I'm from out of town, my brother brought me here. He has been here many times with outstanding reviews. That's why he brought me here, good food and lots of food!  Ya, it was good, which is why they got two stars. The margaritas were good too, but a bit sweet. The real problem here? Not enough food! We got some Nachos to share and there were so few chips we were all quite disappointed! As a matter of fact we had to ask for more chips just to finish all the toppings from the nachos. Now we are still hungry and off to get some Chicago pizza!
