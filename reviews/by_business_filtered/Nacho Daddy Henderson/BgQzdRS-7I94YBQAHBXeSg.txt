Found this place on groupon and were so happy to have come! Our waitress Kim was welcoming as we told her we just arrived in Las Vegas on vacation and had never been here. She was super friendly and made our experience at the restaurant wonderful. We shared an entree and the Filet mignon nachos and she even had them plate it separately for us. We loved the food and service and would highly recommend it!
 
I saw that there were mixed reviews on this and all I can say is to at least give it a try. A review is an opinion after all. Yes, the filet mignon nachos were a bit pricey but search out some coupons if you want them cheaper. The quality of these nachos were worth the price in my opinion. Of course we would have loved a gigantic heaping mound of nachos but it was a decent amount of toppings and we left feeling stuffed!
