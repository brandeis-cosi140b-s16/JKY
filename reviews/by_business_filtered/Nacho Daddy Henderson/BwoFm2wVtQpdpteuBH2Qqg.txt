I don't think I can do it again, but I gave it a shot. Husband ordered filet mignon nachos and shared some of my entree as well. He said he enjoyed it, but, honestly, I think his taste buds and judgment were clouded by the margaritas he drank before the food was served. I ordered the enchilada trio and an iced tea. The iced tea was great...and I'll leave it at that.
