The food is great if you can stand the bad service. Sat at bar, ask waitress to ask mgr to change one of the three TV's to my football game because two TV's were playing same game. He said NO! The games playing were requested. Five minutes later he turned the TV to a baseball game that was requested after my request. We came to watch our game and eat and drink. We won't be back!
