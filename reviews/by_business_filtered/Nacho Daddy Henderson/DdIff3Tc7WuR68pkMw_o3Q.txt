Not much of a Mexican fan, especially since most places around are fast food types and not formal dining, but I was pleasantly surprised. 

We got the fajitas (well first someone nearby got the fajitas and the combination of the sizzle and the smell made me crave them beyond what is normally humanly acceptable). We got the combo chicken shrimp fajitas. I will say they were pretty good. Portion was quite large and ended up taking some home. There was sooo many peppers and onions, a lot of chicken, and a decent amount of shrimp. Only part that was on the small side was the guacamole. Taste wise, everything was good, just not over the top great. Guac didn't taste that fresh, but the chicken and shrimp were well cooked and seasoned along with the peppers and onions.

Ambiance- the game was on, but didn't really bother us in the dining area. 

Staff- out waiter was great, very attentive. On top of everything. They were about a third full in the dining area, and our guy looked like he had a few tables. But I never needed to look for him.

Overall- I wouldn't say this is the best Mexican I have had, but it it's proximity to home, great staff, and decent food certainly warrants a return trip
