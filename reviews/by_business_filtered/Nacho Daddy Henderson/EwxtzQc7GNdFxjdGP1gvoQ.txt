The manager reached out to me immediately after my review to address the issues I mentioned. She seemed truly concerned about my experience at her establishment, asked for more details about the day I had my meal, and asked me to give them another chance. Just for the concern about her business, I'm giving them a couple more stars. I may even stop back in for a second try.
