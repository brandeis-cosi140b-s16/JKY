This is tthe second time we've tried Nacho Daddy's (each time we used a Groupon). The 1st time a was about 6 months ago and it wasn't too bad, the portions were large and the service was satisfactory. Unfortunately, this time the portions were smaller and the combo plate was no where near as good as Roberto's or Fausto's. Overall it was sort of sucky, I would have been upset if we had paid full price.
