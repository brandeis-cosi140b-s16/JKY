Gourmet nachos... who knew. Besides the super cool name, this place actually has a lot going for it. Its still pretty new so its never really crowded, the food is fast yet tasty, and the servers are always pleasant. The guy in the back that makes the tortillas even gave my kid some dough. This is a family friendly environment that doesn't cost a fortune. Let's face it who doesn't like nachos.

The chicken florentine looks like a work of art. Thankfully it taste as well as it looked. So far the best tasting nachos were the prime rib. I would stay away from the cheese burger, something about the relish just kinda grossed me out. They wouldn earn a 4th star if the portion sizes were larger. But I would recommend them to my fellow yelpers :)
