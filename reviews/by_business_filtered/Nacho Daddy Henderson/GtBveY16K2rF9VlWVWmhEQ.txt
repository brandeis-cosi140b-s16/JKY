I ate here for the first time today and honestly It's was so good that I have to write this review!

I'm a big Mexican food lover but sometimes I avoid going out for Mexican because sometimes it ends up being more of a stomach ache! But after eating at Nacho Daddy I officially found my favorite spot! 

Everything was so fresh and authentic that It made me feel right at home! My favorite part was the entree with ribs, garlic fries and jalepanio corn! I know this isn't your typical Mexican entree but I think that is why I liked it so much! Every entree we ordered had the Mexican taste with an American twist!! The service was exceptional too! Our server truly didn't miss a beat! She always made sure we had fresh drinks, napkins and plates! I never caught myself looking for her or waiting on something!

I will definitely be eating here again! Thanks Nacho Daddy!
