I had been to this restaurant about a year ago and thought it was okay.. we decided to go back the yesterday and it was amazing! I was pleasantly surprised. Everything we ordered came out looking beautiful..everyone had to share their meals because it was so good! I really liked the twist on mexican. My FAVORITE is the Buffalo Nachos so different and brilliant! There was also this corn that was beyond! We joked we'd order the corn to go every day of the week!! My new favorite restaurant!!
