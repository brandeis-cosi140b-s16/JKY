Believe both the good and the not so good o the reviews for Nacho Daddy's.  Service was very slow for a Saturday night at 8pm.

The introductory corn muffins were tasty but I would have preferred chips and salsa considering how slow the service was.

We had a pitcher of the house margaritas which were heavy on the sweet and sour and seemed light on the alcohol.

I had the spicy shrimp nachos and my g/f had the mexi Cobb salad. The shrimp were the tiny shrimp which lacked any real taste.  Her salad seemed fine, both portions were good sized.

Overall, not great value, fair food but nothing special.
