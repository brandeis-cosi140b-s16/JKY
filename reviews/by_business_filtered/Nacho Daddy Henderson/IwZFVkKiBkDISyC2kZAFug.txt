Finally! Made my way to Nacho Daddy and I must say; overwhelming menu options. All nacho portions are shareable, there were so many different ones I wanted to try but decided on the Fiesta Chicken. Loved that all the ingredients were fresh, guac was delicious! Wasn't too impressed with the cheese drying up and sticking to the tostada chips ;-/ love my nachos cheesy and not dry. Chicken was grilled to perfection and very flavorful. Nothing crazy or out of the ordinary, just a big plate of nachos with the works. 2.5/5.

Service was stellar! Our waitress was attentive, sweet, helpful and kept coming back to make sure we didn't need anything. 5/5.
