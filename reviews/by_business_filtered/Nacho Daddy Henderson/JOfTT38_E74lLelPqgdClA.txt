The 5 stars are for the margaritas that were made for my girlfriend and I.  The bartender made me a fresh muddled blackberry margarita.  it was 110 degrees outside and it was absolutely perfect. There is a reason a margarita takes 5-10 minutes to make because it was AMAZING!!!!  Kudos to her, i cant remember her name but she did say she makes them like she like to drink them which is a nice personalized touch, hopefully she reads this yelp and management puts it on the employee board!

I cant wait to go and get 2 for 1 tequilas on Tuesday!!
