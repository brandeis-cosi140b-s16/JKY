Lost and wandering shoeless somewhere outside of Henderson, NV I was hungry.

I don't go out for breakfast much because I like my own cooking (eggs, pancakes, omelets) better than your typically Brkfst joint.

But, after suckling on cactus on the side of the road, I was desperate.

Now, I'm not really sure why NDaddy opens at 8am on a Thursday,  but I am GLAD they did. They need to publicize the fact from the road better. I actually wasn't sure they were open until pulled on the front door. Even then, no one greeted my and it felt uncomfortable because I was the only person in their big/ cool dining room.

I was met by a nice waitress and taken good care of. BUT the the star was the awesome rancheros.. Go to NDaddy for breakfast. It's great
