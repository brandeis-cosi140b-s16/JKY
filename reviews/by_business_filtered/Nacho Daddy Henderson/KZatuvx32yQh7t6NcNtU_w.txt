Weird experience. I went with my  dad and my husband and we asked for a booth, and the waitress said, sure let me clean off the booth. A group of four came in behind us and asked for a booth as well... She said sure follow me... What?!? We waited a good five minutes while she cleaned off a table (sooo long when you're watching the booth you should have gotten get drinks...) them she sits us at a super tiny 3 top... I looked at her and said "have you looked at dad???" (He's pushing 300 lbs)
  She just kind of didn't get why it was a problem to force us to sit at a tiny three top (it was a 6 top table that had a booth half way around the table)
 We ended up leaving because she just didn't get why it was frustrating to make us wait for a tiny table and then asking if we wanted to wait some more... Annoying in the land of a million delicious Mexican restaurants.
