First time here. I have been reading fellow yelpers info on this place as well as others reviews so, my husband and I thought to give it a shot. We got there right when they opened 11am. We were the first one's and was seated right away and put our order in for drinks. They have the d√©cor theme for sports/Corona etc. Our both we sat in was ok I felt I was sitting on the floor because the table hit me just at my chest area :) I think they need to be restuffed. The waiter brought us out 2 corn jalapenos muffins just out of the oven not bad and my husband was surprised he was able to eat it because he hates spicey/hot  food!! 
I ordered the cheese quesadilla with chicken. It came to me cut up in 5 slices with guacamole, sour cream and pico on the side. Great presentation and it tasted wonderful.
My husband ordered a plate that had chicken/rice burrito with chips he also got sides of pico and guacamole. He said it was fantastic. 
During our meal the waiter was interactive with us and even told us to save room for desert! But we were so full afterwards we had to skip desert.
We will be back to try more and I think we will sit at a table and chairs :)
