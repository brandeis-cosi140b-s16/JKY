Worst experience ive ever had trying to watch Monday Night Football at a restaurant/sports bar that promotes coming down to watch the big game at this Henderson location. Don't even try to get there early with a party of people to watch a game on a TV right in front of you, because they will change channnel completely for someone strolling in late at bar....right in middle of it...even after they ask you if you're watching game on a particular tv and you say "YES"..please dont change it. The manager changed the channel and than hid from us and sent a waiter over as "acting supervisor". Ive never seen a bar allow a group of people to leave over a "buddy" at the bar. Good business model. The female bartender thought it was funny too.. Oh...and expect to deal with plenty of children near the bar area too as they sat a birthday party nearby with loud children everywhere right a few feet from bar area. The biggest shame is we used to be "regulars" last season that supported this local business. The food wasnt bad, but clearly its not run very well. They have lost my business for good as we will drive farther to spend lots of money elsewhere. Oh..and the waiter also collected our email and phone numbers before the game for a $100 bar tab raffle that never happened...felt like a scam. Never go back.
