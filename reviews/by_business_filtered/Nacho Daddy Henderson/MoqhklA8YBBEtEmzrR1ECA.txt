I really wanted to like this place, because we need a fun, nice Mexican restaurant with good food in Silverado Ranch area.  This place isn't going to be it.

My friend ordered the Fajita salad and it was edible, but it's a pretty simple entree so it was really disappointing that it wasn't better. 
Originally I ordered the nacho with brisket and it was ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING.  There was just this horrible taste.  You couldn't take a bite with out being grossed out.  The cheese didn't taste good either.  I don't know how you can screw up cheese.  I sent that dish back and ordered the 3 tacos.  I ordered each taco a different way, so that hopefully one would be good.  Nope.  they  were also disgusting. Don't do it!

The service was ok.  Not bad, but not great.  The restaurant itself is nice.  I like the idea of being able to sit on the patio, but I will not be returning.
