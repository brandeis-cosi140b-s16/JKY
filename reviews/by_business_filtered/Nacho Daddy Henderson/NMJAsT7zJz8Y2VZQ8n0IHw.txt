Came to try out Nacho Daddy with some co-workers tonight to watch the NBA Finals and we sat at the bar... Had carne asada tacos and some nachos with queso dip.... Food was pretty good... Best part of the night though was our bartender Kimmi... She's awesome- definitely the best bartender in Vegas... Was on point with our drinks, very friendly and funny to talk to... Plus, the girl knows her sports! She had a ton of regulars in there that she knew, but still treated us like we were regulars even though it was our first time... We'll definitely be going back to see Kimmi... 5 stars all around, especially for the service!
