Food come fast great environment , the food was delicious we ordered steak fajitas that was amazing the size of the dish is big and very generous and the food was full of meat. I love it and definitely will come back.
At the end we wanted to order dessert but most of them are containing cinnamon which I'm allergic to so hopefully next time they would have something delicious with out cinnamon beside that everything is perfect.
Our server mike was very fast and welcoming and took care of our needs perfectly.
