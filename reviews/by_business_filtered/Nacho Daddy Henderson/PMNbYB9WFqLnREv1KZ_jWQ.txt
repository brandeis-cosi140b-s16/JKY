I've been to ND twice and both times have been disappointing. I literally don't understand how this restaurant has 4 stars? The last time I went I had dinner at the bar with friends. Service was great! My enchilada nachos were disgusting, but I had to eat because I was starving and drinking. I don't think I'll ever be back.
