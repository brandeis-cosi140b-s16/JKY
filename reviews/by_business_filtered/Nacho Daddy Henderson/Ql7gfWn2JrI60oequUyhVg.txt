Before you totally avoid this place, trivia on Wednesday nights is a ton of fun. It's two hours of fun trivia action. There are plenty of prizes to win, and the categories can get pretty entertaining. There's also a drawing contest for the night and if you have the most creative drawing, you get points for your team. 

Trivia aside, this place wasn't great. They have great beers on draft but I couldn't find prices for them. Then when I found out the prices, they didn't match up to what I ordered (stone IPA I thought was seven and a hefe was five but I was charged 14). The bartender made me close the tab immediately, I asked if I could use the card while I sat down, implying about keeping it open. She said you can you just have to close with me. I don't understand why? Maybe they don't like open tabs. Could have been some miscommunication. She just seemed rude about it. 

Service was really terrible. I understand it's trivia night and there are plenty of people in the place but then you should have more people working. Fianc√© ordered a burrito and it was supposed to come with chips. It didn't. She had to ask twice to get the chips. The second time the server asked her if she REALLY wanted the chips. Well hell, she paid for them and she's asked twice. What would you think? Also had to ask three times for a box. 

My enchilada was okay. I've gotten better at Roberto's but it wasn't bad. The rice was actually pretty good. Doesn't make up for the subpar service. 

I would come here again only for the trivia. And then I would probably pack beers in my car and go to Roberto's first to get some food. Just to avoid having to be served. This place is probably better when it's less busy but I won't try hard to find out.
