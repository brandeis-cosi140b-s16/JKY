Extremely disappointing. 

Our server was MIA nearly the whole time we were there. He never asked us how we were doing or if we needed anything. It wasn't so busy of a night, but he just wasn't around. He only came from the back when he had a check to process or if he had to bring out food. The girl who refilled our waters didn't even acknowledge my glass was empty the entire night yet she loved to bat her eyes at the two guys I was with and take care of them. I even asked her to refill mine and she still picked up our other guy friend's glass first. I brushed it off but she could've been a lot more classy. Her job isn't rocket science. 

The prices were decent but I do think it's a little ridiculous they don't give complementary chips and salsa with a meal purchase - BUT it's understandable because if you came here just for nachos (hence the name) then you wouldn't need it. The shrimp tacos are basically made with fried shrimp you get from the dollar menu at Long John Silvers. That was a huge disappointment. We were all disappointed that the margaritas weren't blended but it wasn't specified and we didn't exactly specify the way we wanted it either. 

We just assumed it would be a classic margarita just like we ASSUMED this was going to be a place worth going to. But it's not. Just go to Jalisco's or TGIF instead. 

Don't waste your time, don't waste your money. Thanks for absolutely nothing.
