wanted to try something new so stopped at nacho daddys. was hoping for a full on mexican style restraunt. first thing server told us is that they were known for thier nachos(of course). i even ordered the house recomondation of bland sparsley loaded bbq chicken nachos. my husband had a burger!! not impressed n not going back
