Ugh after a long day at Anna's, Marshal's and Homegoods the GF finally caved to doing something besides looking at bedding.  Ahh Nacho Daddy, an island in a sea of Chick Stores.

Our Server Amy was friendly and attentive.  We started with a couple of $3 beers, some special they were doing, must have been with the football on Sunday night.  She then brought us two little jalapeno cornbread muffins.  That was nice.

I had the Traditional Nachos and GF had a fajita salad.  The nachos were piled quite high and I did like the continued layering of toppings, nothing's worse than getting down to a pile of chips with nothing on them.  BUT they just weren't mind blowing, I guess I figured that if I ordered the namesake dish that these nachos would be da bomb...not quite.  GF's salad tasted like a salad, dressing was good.

I'll stop in again, but only if I happen to be near by.
