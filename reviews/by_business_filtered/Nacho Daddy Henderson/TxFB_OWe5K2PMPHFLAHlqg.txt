Their food is great since they changed the menu. Lots of variety. They also send us coupons in the mail which is an added bonus. 

Customer service is ok. Not bad, but not awesome. 

I give them 3 stars because they don't serve complimentary chips and salsa. You have to purchase them. This is a restaurant specializing in Mexican food. That makes no sense.
