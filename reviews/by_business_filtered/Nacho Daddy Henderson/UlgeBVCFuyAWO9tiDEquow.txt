First, let me say that either we came here on a great day or the management has been reading the complaints posted by other reviewers because our experience was completely opposite from the recent reviews.  First off we were pleasently greated by every waitress and hostess.    Once we were seated we looked at the menu and drooled over each and every nacho choice.  based on the reviews we were expecting poorly made nachos and processed cheese on our BBQ pulled pork nachos.  Instead they came with crisp, lightly salted chips and an excellent melted cheese sauce.  The flavor was perfect and the pork was very tender.  We also ordered the mahi mahi fish tacos.  The beans and rice were bland but the fish tacos were excellent if slightly underseasoned.  The children's menu is extensive and offers a huge bean and rice burrito, quesadillas, and tacos to go with the usual hot dog and burger fare.  

We loved the Blue Berrymore martini.  The waitress was Caitlin was very attentive and kept our drinks filled.  All in all, we were very impressed with this economical and tasty meal and will definitely put it into our rotation.

Update: 9/7/2012  - We have since been back and once again had an excellent experience.  Further, we have received notice that the Nacho Daddy management does in fact read the reviews and strives to improve the experience for all so if you are one of those who had a negative experience a few months ago, please give them another shot as they are working very hard to address the concerns and make this place the best Nacho experience!
