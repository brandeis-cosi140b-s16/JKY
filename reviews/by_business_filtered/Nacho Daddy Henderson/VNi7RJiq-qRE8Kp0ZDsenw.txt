Applebee's quality food, ridiculously high prices. Just dined here for the first time. Ordered the street corn appetizer, $5 gets you ONE piece of corn, tough pre-frozen corn. Enchilada nachos tasted like canned/frozen typical bar food (think Sysco Systems) and barely fed two people, which seems crazy for the $10 price tag. The ONE redeeming quality was the blood orange margarita, which was delicious, but not good enough to make up for the subpar, overpriced food. Will not be returning.
