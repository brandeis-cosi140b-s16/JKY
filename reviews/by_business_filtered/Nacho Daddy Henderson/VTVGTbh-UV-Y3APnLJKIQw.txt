I love this place! The nachos are insane good, my favorite is the barbecue chicken nachos. The Big Daddy Burrito is really good as well, I like to get it covered with the red sauce (wet). I eat lunch here at least once a week with some of my co workers, and they love the place also. The lunch menu is perfect and the service is always great, Megan ROCKS as the lunch waitress!!
