We have been to Nacho Daddy twice in 3 weeks for dinner. The first time we both ordered the Fajita's - chicken for me and shrimp for the wife. The food was GREAT, the server was awesome and except for the crying kid 2 booths over we had a wonderful meal. The next visit I ordered the "Tres Enchilada's" - 2 chicken, 1 pork, and the wife stuck with the shrimp fajita's. The food was again was great, no screaming kid and the server did OK. The prices are really reasonable for what they serve you and I had no room for dessert. We will be returning for sure.
