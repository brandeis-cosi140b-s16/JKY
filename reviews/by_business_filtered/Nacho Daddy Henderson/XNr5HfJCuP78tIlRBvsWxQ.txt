Really?! Our friend asked us to try it and against our yelp judgement we said ok. This place was dead and still the service was horrible!!!!!!!! We were there ready to eat but that all changed when our waitress disappeared in the back to show off her baby. I'm all about socializing but dang the other servers couldn't see us waving? 
The name of the place is Nacho DADDY so I expected NACHOS not a small skillet of chips and sauce. I don't get it...but if they are trying to get on the gourmet bandwagon then they need to redo their menu. 
We will not return. So it looks like this place will continue with bad reviews.
