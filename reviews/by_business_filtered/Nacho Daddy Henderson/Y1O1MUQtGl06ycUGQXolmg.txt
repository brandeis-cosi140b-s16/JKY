My first time here did not disappoint. The nacho menu is filled with delicious combos, I shared a giant platter of filet mignon carne asada nachos with my boyfriend. DELICIOUS and very filling! Nacho Daddy offers much more than nachos, a rather extensive menu for salads, burgers, and even a Vegan menu! I definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a reason to break free of her diet! 
Almost forgot, there is also a long beer and wine list. I had soda, so I can't comment on the selection.
