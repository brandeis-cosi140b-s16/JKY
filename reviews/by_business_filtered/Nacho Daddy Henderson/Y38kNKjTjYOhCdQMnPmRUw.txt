Bummer. Came in here at least 3 times a month for the best margaritas and nachos. Taco Tuesday was a great deal too. Now...not so much. The taco Tuesday deal is 3 for 5(chicken and pork only) instead of 10 for 10. The shrimp tacos are clearly frozen (3 for 7 on Tue). Better deals at Long John Silvers. The award winning margaritas are now mostly mixer. We had to add a shot to make them normal. All of the best bartenders and servers are gone now. Management change? Who knows why this nose dive happened. Very disappointed and  not sure when we will be back
