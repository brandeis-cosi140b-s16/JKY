I've ate here on numerous occasions for work events and tried the 
Mayor Hafen's Macho Nacho which has worms, scorpions, and crickets in it.  Those nachos were something to experience!  When taking a bite out of the macho nacho I could feel the insects crushing and oozing in between my teeth.  I'm not sure if I gagged from the insects or from the layers of cheese mixed with it.  Try it if you're adventurous.  I got the t-shirt for eating it!

While they do specialize in nachos, I've tried their other bar food such as the chicken wings which were of good size and flavor.  The quesadillas were delicious, but nothing special that I couldn't find somewhere else.

When I went back for lunch last Thursday, I did try Mexi-chicken sandwich with their ranch seasoned fries on their lunch menu that was delicious.  The chicken was seasoned just right and juicy.  It was filling.

Overall, I've been pleased with the service and enjoy trying new items on their menu.
