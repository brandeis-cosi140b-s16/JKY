I love the food and the healthy options, especially the breakfast items. Even the coffee is good. It could only be improved upon with the use of organic or at least non-GMO foods. I love the sports channels on all the TVs sprinkled through out the restaurant. 

So why the 3 stars? Service. It comes down to the service. It's inconsistent. Sometimes it's good as far as sports restaurants go, but then we frequently get the apathetic or lazy server who gives off the impression that she just wants to turn the table, as the phrase goes. Not friendly, forgetful, and seemingly put off by our presence, is what we get sometimes. My 8 y.o. knows the servers she likes and doesn't like. I won't call out the server who we sometimes get stuck with, but we got her again today. (My kid quipped: "I don't like her.") 

Just be ready if you visit: the foods is consistently good, but the service is spotty.
