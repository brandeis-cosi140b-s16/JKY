In our job we work long hours so sometimes (okay most of the time) we don't have time to cook. That being said we like to eat out. A whole lot. Last night the ENTIRE group from work, all 15 of us decided to try Nacho Daddy. Not only did they fit us in, they made special accomodation for us in thier bar area which was smart considering our group has NO filters on our mouths.
 
We began with lots of cocktails and beers. The beers were ice cold and the pitchers of maragaritas were phenomenal. Mike, our serever who was a total doll made several suggestions to us and we didn't say no. The guacamole flight and the salsa flight was a perfect way to help us wash down our margaritas. We ordered the Buffalo Chicken Nachos . . . and the Shrimp Diablo Nachos to continue snacking while we were all chatting and relaxing. 

What a perfect atmosphere, the music . .  televisions and the attentive staff. The managers came by to say hi and chat with us a bit, the chef, it was all pretty cool. 


We stayed long enough to go ahead and order some meals as well. I had an enchilda trio plate and I have not one complaint, other than I was getting stuffed. 

I will say this . . .  why bother going on Yelp to give 2's, 3's and 4's?? Either you like it, or you don't. All these BS, middle of the road . .  "the chips were too thin" garbage . . . "but I enjoyed my company" WHO CARES?????? All these wanna be food critics, stick to what is relevant  . .  PLEASE.

Bottom line on NACHO DADDY
Food- great and fair prices
Drinks- awesome and GREAT prices, wells are decent liquors
Atmosphere- very easy going and CLEAN (which is hugely important)
Service- Fantastic


I think we found our new Sunday night hang out . . . .  perhaps Monday as well.
