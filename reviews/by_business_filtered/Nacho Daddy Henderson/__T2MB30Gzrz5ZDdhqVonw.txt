What's up with the hype? Decided to finally try Nacho Daddy after a year or so and it was a letdown.

First off....I know this is a no brainer but DEFINITELY not for the health-conscious or "i'm on a diet" people. After sharing the SPICY SHRIMP NACHOS I felt like a big fat elephant. The nachos were good (see pic attached)...but ugh...make sure you come here HUNGRY...even STARVING perhaps. Maybe that's why I didn't enjoy it too much.

Besides the nachos, my date order some pork tacos a la carte. He said THAT was amazing. He liked it a lot. MIGHT come back next time just to try the street tacos.
I ordered a southwestern grilled chicken salad. It was good..but nothing amazing.

Also...service wasn't very attentive. We arrived 30 minutes prior to closing time with maybe 2-4 tables besides us and our waitress took awhile to take our order. 

We came, we tried and most likely we're not coming back.
