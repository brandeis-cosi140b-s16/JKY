Great experience!  I was Leary as my experience in Summerlin was terrible but was pleasantly surprised.  We were seated and served promptly.  The waitress (I forget her name but long brown hair) was super friendly and accommodating.  We had the kids quesadilla made with soy cheese (no sour cream) and it came with sour cream.  We immediately sent it back and she was extremely apologetic making sure the order was promptly fixed.  We also had the veggie tacos and tofu nachos- both so good.  We will definitely return to this location!!
