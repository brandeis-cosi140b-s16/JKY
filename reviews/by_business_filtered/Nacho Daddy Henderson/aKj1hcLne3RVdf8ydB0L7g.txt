After going there on two occasions, I am going to give them the benefit of the doubt and round up to three stars. Being 1/2 the menu is dedicated to nachos and the like, I went with that on both visits. Personally, the buffalo nachos were kind of a let down as the chicken was soggy and doused with some low grade hot sauce while the Cajun nachos were pretty awesome. Service was solid both time but could be a bit slow at times. 

One thing that I love about this place though is they have my favorite beer on tap.... Negro Modelo. Solid!
