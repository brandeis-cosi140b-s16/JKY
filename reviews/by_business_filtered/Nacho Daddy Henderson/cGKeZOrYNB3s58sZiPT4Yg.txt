Came here the other day and ordered the Thai Chicken Nachos and BBQ Chicken Nachos. My husband and I had the personal size of each one and it was a pretty good portion. Overall, the nachos were interesting and tasty but I think I expected a little more from the Thai Chicken Nachos but I'm willing to try this place again and get something else next time. They're a little overpriced in my opinion but I would definitely come back during happy hour when nachos are only $6 instead of $10. 

Can't say much about the service since we ordered takeout but the hostess was very nice! We will be back to try out more nachos. Good place for groups since they have lots of seating.
