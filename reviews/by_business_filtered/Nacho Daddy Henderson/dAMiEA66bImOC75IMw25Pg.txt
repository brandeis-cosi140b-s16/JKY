Now I know why these guys have bad reviews!!!

We have eaten here twice and this was the last. The first time was pretty good, wasn't sure why the bad reviews... Now I know. Went went May 4th and they were apparently promoting Modelo/Corona... At least their 12oz plastic cups. I ordered a Dogfish Head beer which comes draft(awesome right?!) but it was in this tiny cup unlike last time when it was at least 16oz's of awesomeness. I asked the waitress who was pretty meh I don't care at all and gave me this story about promoting Modelo(yuck) but if I wanted the rest of my beer she'd get me the other 4oz in another glass.... It's a $8 order of beer, if you're going to short me at least have it reflect on the check but she didn't. Oh and this time the same order we had last time of nacho's was soggy and not very good. 

Figure it out Nacho Daddy! What a waste of a name...

Oh and what Mexican restaurant doesn't give you free chips and salsa?????
