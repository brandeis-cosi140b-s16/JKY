Decent Nachos, good amount, nicely distributed ingredients. They have about 10 different types of Nacho choices, I got the Supreme Tostada Nachos. Ground beef, beans, cheeses, jalape√±os, sour cream, guacamole, and avacado lime salsita. I liked the lime salsita, very good, ground beef had a good flavor, enough cheese. I did need more salsa and asked for some red instead of the lime, It was great but...they didn't tell me they charge $1 for extra salsa! That's crazy, they only give you a little container, not enough for the pile of nachos, they should not charge for more. Also, my husband asked for no salsa on his, shouldn't that count as a credit towards my extra salsa, lol! One of the better bar nachos I've had. They do serve it a mile high on a cast iron skillet, which looks cool, but I found hard to eat without it toppling over onto the table, so I asked for a plate. Nachos are about $8-10 and we had a 20% off coupon from the mail. I would return, probably with a coupon.
