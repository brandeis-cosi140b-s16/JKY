It seems like a really unhappy place. Waitress and hostess were unhappy, everyone else dining here seemed unhappy, and by the end of it, we were unhappy. Nothing was really memorable about the dining experience but this collective unhappiness. We had some specialty nachos--don't remember them, and some kind of enchilada plate--don't remember it. Looks like it has changed some staffing and menus since I went, so maybe I'll give it another chance.

It seems like it would be an awesome place--it's a great location with inventive-looking recipes that somehow just miss the mark.
