LOCATION IS ON EASTERN:
Food was good .  Service was by far the worst service I've had in a long time.  I'm speaking of the one server we had and can't speak about rest of staff.
Ordered chips n salsa:  came with entrees
But had to ask a different server to bring the chips.
Water was empty with no refill 
Had to ask multiple times for extra salsa and ketchup.
Bill sat on table for 15-20 minutes at least 
Before we finally had to call her over just to pay the bill.

Wasn't busy was only 2-3 tables to serve.
