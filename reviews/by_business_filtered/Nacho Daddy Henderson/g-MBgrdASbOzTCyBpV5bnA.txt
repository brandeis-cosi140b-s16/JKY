I think this applies more to the outside patio.. When I walked inside it looks pretty clean, but it might be because it is dim inside. LOL

1. The table was dirty all sorts of marks (get some orange force please)
2. Both Menus covered in cheese and ripped up in the back..
3. Hair in my nachos, ill give the benefit of the doubt here even though my hair is brown and over a foot long and the hair was two inches and black ( still ate it, so I'm not a complete Germ-a-phob)
4. Handle and wooden skillet(?) was disgusting!! (Picture provided)
5. My drink cup had left over food on the sides... I scratched it off with my nail .___." 

Please maintain the cleanliness of your restaurant. I only hope the kitchen is kept tidy. I can't emphasize how much quality is lost in the basics... 

As far as the food.. It was okay, they give you a lot though! One if good enough to share. Not a fan of the enchilada nachos though~ the BBQ pulled nachos were great (minus the hair).

Two stars for a great server and "meh" food.
