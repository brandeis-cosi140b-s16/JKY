If I could give this place 10 stars.. I would! I've only lived in Vegas for about a month & I don't think I can count how many times I've been here! The selection of nachos is out of this world!! My favorite has to be the pulled pork.. Although I had chicken fried steak nachos for breakfast the other day, which were also phenomenal. You can't stop here without trying their white queso either! Service is always great (we like the bartender Erin & the server Loui)! They have several TVs that show games... & often have drink specials too. (Be sure to catch the $15 pitchers of daddy's margaritas during football). We will definitely be back (maybe tomorrow lol)
