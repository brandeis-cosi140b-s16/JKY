Me and my family went to our seat and we got 3 different waiter comin from left to right...like really? Plus I don't know what going on here it wasn't pack that night we was there cuz we were waiting for a long time (an hour) to get our food. The taste of the food was ok, it seem like it been sitting out for a while even though it look beautiful. It a sport bar + restaurant w/ ton of flat screen everywhere which is cool. They got outdoor seating area. But overall it a no from me, sorry.
