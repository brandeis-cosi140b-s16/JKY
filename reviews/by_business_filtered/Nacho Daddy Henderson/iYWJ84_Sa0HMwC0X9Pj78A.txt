Came in sunday night for dinner and it wasnt too busy. Carmen was our server. We give 4 stars bc of her great service. We ordered a margarita and moscow mule, they were good. Our daughter got the kids chicken and fries, and she enjoyed hers. My husband and i shared the mexcian street burger. This was very delicious. We got the parmesean fries with it and my husband liked those. The fliet nachos were a disapointment. I think taco bells are more generous....
