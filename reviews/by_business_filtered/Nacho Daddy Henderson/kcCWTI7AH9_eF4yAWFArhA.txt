I ordered the enchiladas, and they were just right - excellent, homemade sauce, good proportions of tortilla and filling, right portion size. I was plenty happy with that. I got the queso dip, but it seemed a bit doughy, like the base sauce had too much flour. I'll give it another try before I decide whether this is a worthwhile trip.

My wife ordered the florentine nachos, and she was pleased with them. I wasn't a fan, but it could be because that was totally not what I was in the mood to eat. 

My son got regular nachos which were nothing to write home about.

My other son got the Philly Cheesesteak Fajita. Interesting concept, wasn't wild about the execution. 

The server was really nice and friendly, and the atmosphere is great for families. 

I'll be giving it another shot.
