We come here almost every Thursday night for Jokes with Friends comedy show.  I will have to say that the food has come a long way from when they first opened.  I really like the Buffalo Chicken Flat bread, the Southwestern Chicken Salad and their burgers the best!   The nachos are good I prefer the chicken over the ground beef any day.
