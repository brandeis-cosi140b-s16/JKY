I want to start this review by saying-- we did not get any complementary chips and salsa! Isn't that a given when you decide to eat at a Mexican restaurant. And everyone around us got some and we didn't! 

Of course we had to order a round of margaritas. I went with the Mango Thai basil & Nieves D got the guava flavored. Both tasted identical. I didn't taste an ounce of guava in her drink. They were pretty strong tho. You only need 1 drink! 

I went with the Ceviche. This is the first time I ever said this-- my ceviche did not have enough lime. I'm usually complaining about how sour the ceviche is but this time it's the opposite. Also, it really lacked in shrimp. It barely had any. But I did enjoy it! It wasn't terrible. 

Nieves D got the Salmon. Holy smokes it was a BIG size salmon too. They weren't cheap with the salmon for sure. The black bean sauce on top was pretty darn good. The veggies were seasoned pretty well. 

Besides the missing chips and salsa, the service was good. We were checked on the right times and our check came fast.
