Love this place. I was happy to find it and the portions are GREAT. To bad I put them in the microwave the next day, Didn't fair to well. I suggest couples go here. 

I also like the fact they didn't make a big deal out of me being in uniform. I met my wife for dinner and I was in uniform and armed. I thought they might have an issue, but they sat us in the back and where generally happy to serve me. I cant say rather they had an issue or not with me being armed, but they didn't say anything. 

As for the food. I love their Nacho's, its the only reason I go there.
