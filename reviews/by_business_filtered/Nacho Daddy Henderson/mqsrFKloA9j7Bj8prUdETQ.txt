We've been here for dinner several times- mostly with the kids because this place is KID FRIENDLY and smoke free. Last night, my husband and I went here for dinner alone. As always, the food was excellent! We started with ceviche, and had beef brisket tacos, fish tacos and combo enchiladas for supper. I am eating the left overs right now (YUM). Beyond the food, the service was EXCELLENT. Chelsea was personable and almost psychic with her anticipation of our likes and needs throughout the meal. Wonderful experience!
