This was my second time visiting this restaurant. Each time, it's been a decent experience. Today I am writing my review based off of lunch. I got a sprite, chips and salsa, and a kale salad with chicken.My husband got the beef enchilada with raspberry tea.

I was a bit annoyed the the raspberry tea was from the fountain. My husband didn't like it but the wait staff brought him a refill before he even drank two sips. It was if they were scared of not proving so great of service that they didn't care if they wasted food.

Regardless, my salad was great aside from the cubed chicken. It wasn't worth the $3 dollars extra to get that protein.

My husband wasnt a fan of his enchiladas.  It had the appearance it had been sitting under a heat lamp for a while. But in the past we've had great nacho dishes, specifically the Thai chicken nachos.

I'll probably come back, but I'm slowly dissecting what parts of the menu are worth trying.
