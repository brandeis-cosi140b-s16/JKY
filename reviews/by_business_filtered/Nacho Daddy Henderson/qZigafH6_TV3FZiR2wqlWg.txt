I always give in to my honey and his obsession for Nachos. He talked about this place for days. So as our first meal in Vegas we decided to go here (of course). 

The atmosphere inside the restaurant is a typical sports bar. Filled with multiple TVs. On this day it was perfect, since it was a Sunday = Football Day!! 

We decided to sit at the bar area. We were served by a lovely waitress. She was very friendly and always asked us if we needed anything. 

We took advantage of the Yelp Check-in offer of free salsa and chips. They brought us two types of "colored" chips and salsa (hot & medium). 

We ordered the VEGAN NACHOS. If your expecting nacho cheese sauce. Be prepared to be disappointed. It's basically chips placed on a hot skillet they topped with Crumbles of veggie patty, Daiya cheese, beans, corn, saut√©ed peppers and onions, guacamole and a small amount of green salsa. This nacho was DRY as hell! It seemed like they put everything together and then slapped it into the oven. The nachos stick together. Making it hard to pull apart.

Just when I thought the Nacho was dry. I was "served" the Driest Tex-Mex Burrito. Is there a shortage in sauce? I won't go into detail with it because no amount of sauce can make this taste good. It's like eating dry rice and beans. The sad thing is both Burrito and Nachos are not cheap. 

I did think the massive Bloody Mary bar was cool. Other than that I don't think I would come back unless my honey begs me to. Then maybe just maybe, I'll give in!
