Good margaritas and average food; great happy hour. 

Happy hour is from 3p-6p daily with cheap beers (if you like PBR, it's less than $2 a beer) and half off appetizers. They have specials on margaritas too (buy one get one free). I actually enjoy their margaritas but don't care for their food. I've been here a few times when I used to live in Henderson but I haven't been back since I've moved closer to the strip.

Would recommend Nacho Daddy for margaritas and beer during happy hour. I wouldn't go hungry though...
