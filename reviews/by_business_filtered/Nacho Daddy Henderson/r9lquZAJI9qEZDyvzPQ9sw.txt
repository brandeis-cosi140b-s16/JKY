I had wanted to try this place for a long time and had high hopes with a name like that!  Always seeing that huge billboard from the highway makes you really want to try this place out! Thinking as the title suggested, I ordered Supreme Tostado Nachos and thought their specialty would be super wow nachos.  And they were just very average.  Nothing special and at first glance the dish looked huge, but when you started eating it they were actually smaller than the what you pay for (around $13).  We ordered the chicken quesadillas and those were good but sort of greasy.  Nothing special and nothing different from other places.  The service was good and nice, friendly, helpful staff that gave good suggestions when asked but the food was so so.  Didn't try much else and the wait was long so we sat at the bar.  The bar and drinks looked like a decent selection but didn't drink that night.  I would pass on this place though and just left sorta disappointed.
