So Nacho Daddy does not like Jennifer J., or at least it just wasn't my night.

We arrived with a group of five for dinner on a Friday night and we were seated promptly.  Our table ordered a few beers and sodas, but they were out of the first beer that I ordered.  So I ordered a different beer.  The waiter came back to tell me they were out of that too.  Ok...different tactic, let's order a soda.  He runs off, and then he's back again.  They are out of Dr. Pepper too.  At this point, I just ordered a water (which they had, yay!).  

We placed our orders, I chose the chicken enchiladas, which they did have, but the chicken was very dry and there was hardly any of it in the enchilada.  There wasn't much cheese on it either, so the whole thing was just really dry and it didn't have any flavor.  My boyfriend ordered the steak enchiladas, and they were delicious.  We had the chips and salsa appetizer (it's not free and on your table, you have to order it), but thanks to our Yelp Check In coupon, ours was free.  Because they were out of pretty much anything I ordered, they did offer me a free dessert and I ordered the S'Mores Nachos.  They were not good at all, just stay away from them.  It's literally a pile of chips on a plate covered in about a bag and a half of chocolate chips topped with mini marshmallows and then thrown under a broiler to burn the marshmallows.  The only saving grace was that someone else in our group ordered the deep fried ice cream and they put half of it on these terrible nachos which made them edible for a few bites. 

The best part of the night was the photo booth they have in the lobby/waiting area.  The boys were able to goof off before we were given a table and the pictures were great!
