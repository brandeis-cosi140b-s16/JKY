First time I have been back there in a couple years. Went at 7:00 in the evening. The place was very busy, Saturday Night. We were seated immediately and our server came by right away. They gave us lots of time to review the extensive menu.
The food was above average, nothing spectacullar. We had burritos and tacos on the table. We watched the nacho's being delivered to other tables and they were monsterous. Our service never lacked. We had some confusuion about one of our oursers. It was not the servers fault at all. It was our fault. They fixed it immediately and with no hassle. Great job Nacho.  You are improving and enjoyable.
