Generally I wait until I've tried a restaurant a couple of times before I write a review.  But I will not be revisiting Nacho Daddy, so this review is from our one shot last night, and I think a more appropriate rating is 1.5 stars.  I came back after a few days working in the middle of nowhere desert  and was craving nachos.  Even after reading a slew of mediocre (at best) reviews, I figure I'd like to check it out for myself.  We downloaded the menu, made our selection, and called in a pickup order.  The voice on the other end was none too thrilled to help us with the order (strike 1), but, I've had plenty of experience with disgruntled front desk staff at perfectly good dining establishments.  We ordered two nachos, the loaded chili cheese, and we had a hankering for the taste of wings, so we ordered the "buffalo hot".

The loaded chili cheese nachos came as the chips covered in some wilted green onion slices, with a side of the chili and the nacho cheese (nice of them to want to keep the chips from getting soggy).  They forgot the sour cream that comes standard, and my addition of guac (strike 2).  The chips were light and flaky and the chili was tasty with a hint of spice, but the nacho cheese was just standard roller-rink style canned orange nacho (I was hoping for something more like white spicy queso, since it's title is "que bueno cheese sauce").  So, meh, definitely not worth $10.

The buffalo nachos were missing the BUFFALO part (major strike 3)!  There was none of the promised buffalo sauce, cayenne pepper, etc, so it was just nachos, mozz cheese, fried chicken bites obviously dumped out of a bag, blue cheese and celery (a nice touch).  Seriously, how can you forget the buffalo sauce on the buffalo nachos?!  Not cool.... So, the idea of the place has promise, but with such flawed execution my money is going elsewhere.
