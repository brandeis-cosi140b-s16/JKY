We visited today to watch a preseason football game.  We had never been before and were looking forward to some good food and drinks.  Unfortunately, our experience was less than desirable.  First, I had a large chicken bone in my tortilla soup. The waitress was not sympathetic to this at all. Then, she confirmed after she took it to the kitchen that it was a chicken bone. I thought to myself "I sure hope so considering it was a chicken soup." Geez! Due the bone and the waitresses lack of reaction to the situation we will not be visiting again or recommending to anyone.
