I tried. Twice. I just can't do it again.

A large group of us went for Cinco de Drink... err, Cinco de Mayo. Partly because it's Mexican food, partly because of location, and partly (probably the biggest part) because of the specials and opening deals they offered.

The nacho specials weren't bad, but they were short lived. They are not still on the menu. While they were generally tasty, they didn't offer enough of the key ingredients (i.e. meat choices, etc.) and we were digging through the chips to find what we had ordered.

The service was bad. There's no other word for it. It was slow, even with multiple servers watching over our group and others. I had to go to the bar to order drinks more than once.

I spoke with the manager, Amy, about it. She was great helping me set up our large group and after when I talked to her about our experience. She explained the situation (staffing issues, temporary fill-ins). While I found that understandable but not excusable, we discussed the possibility of another try.

That said, a month or so later I went back for a quick dinner in the hope that, outside of the "holiday" crowds, that it would be different.

I was, again, disappointed. I opted for the custom nachos and my guest had the enchiladas. The nachos were small and expensive (I didn't even add meat), the chips seemed stale, and the sauces and salsas seemed as if they'd been left out for a day. Her enchiladas were so spicy as to be almost inedible.

The waitstaff was slow and inattentive, and we had to flag down the waitress more than once. 

We had to bring to the staff's attention that the restrooms hadn't been looked after in some time.

I will not be going back.
