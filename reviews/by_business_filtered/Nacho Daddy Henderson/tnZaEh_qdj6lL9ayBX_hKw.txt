Today was our first time trying Nacho Daddy and it was a little bit of a mixed experience. First, the positives! Our server was very personable and helpful - we are vegetarians and I had forgotten to ask about the refried beans on the nachos. She asked if we wanted black beans instead since the others are made with lard. That was very kind and appreciated. The food itself was quite good - we shared a salad and nachos, sans meat, and liked the flavors of everything. The chips for the nachos did not get soggy, also a plus. Now, the less than stellar. Right toward the end, we had our credit card ready to go with the check. A male server in the next section over picked it up. He then bussed some tables with credit card folder still in hand and went in back. He then came back out with it, not processed, and handed it to another server - the wrong one. She went back with it. Then a manager came out with it for my husband's signature. We kept a close watch on the credit card hot potato game, but it wasn't the ending we had wanted. Honestly, although I have no reason to think there was anything untoward going on, it made me a bit uneasy. I think if they can organize the service and staff a bit better, it will really help.
