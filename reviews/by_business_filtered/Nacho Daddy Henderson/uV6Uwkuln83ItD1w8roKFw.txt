I just moved back to Las Vegas from Arizona but my parents live here and every time I came to visit my mom and I would come to Nacho Daddy. It's always been a pleasant experience for us.

We were promptly seated and served water while we debated on our drinks. Our order was taken quickly without any hiccups (so I'm not sure what the bad reviews are talking about)

I really do love their salsa because their hot is actually decently hot. I might have a slight addiction to spicy food so when I say I want it hot I mean it. We are OBSESSED with their fish tacos. No, I mean it. Go try them...like now.

I love that I can always catch up on any sports team while I am there because they do have so many screens around the dining and bar area. 

But seriously this is my go to place for this side of Vegas, you will not be disappointed!
