Reminded me of a Chi-Chi's from back in the day: Americanized Mexican. Had a $9 margarita, that I sucked down in about 2 sips. Didn't care for the salsas: very tomato-y. The queso was yummy and kept warm with a little candle chafing dish. The service was prompt, attentive, and very friendly. The street tacos were fine: the pork was my favorite as the chicken had very little flavor and the beef wasn't very special either. Sports on TV, and large parties made it pretty loud, or festive if you prefer. 

They use the evil evil styrofoam to-go packages though.
