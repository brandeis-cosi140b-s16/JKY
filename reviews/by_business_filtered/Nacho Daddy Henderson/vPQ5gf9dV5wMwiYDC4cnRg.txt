If you're going to go, go during happy hour. (3-6 Mon-Sat) Much more reasonable pricing and its a slower time so the service was prompt. 

We ordered entirely off the happy hour menu. They've got two for one margaritas you should be careful about, they are strong. The guacamole was fantastic, not sure how fresh they make it, but it sure tasted great.The street tacos were good and messy. Your choice of chicken, steak, or shrimp wrapped in two corn tortillas topped with pico de gallo. I do not suggest the BBQ pulled pork nachos. Overly saucy, and the BBQ they used was way too sweet for me. Overall, its a decent place but I'd rather go for something a little more authentic!
