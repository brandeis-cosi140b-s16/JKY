We are calling this a "soft four" because the food was ok, prices were ok, atmosphere was ok, drinks were ok, beer selection was ok, service sitting at the bar was sub par. Each request made to her wasn't taken with haste. May we have silverware? Done with appetizer. May we have waters? Done with meal. May we have the check? Longest wait for pick up ever. But they do have elote.

It's seems that my regular haunts aren't taking my patronage seriously. Please have your friends visit you on your own time. While I am here sitting at your bar I expect your full attention as a paying guest.

I'll give it a try another night in hopes of some one else behind the bar.
