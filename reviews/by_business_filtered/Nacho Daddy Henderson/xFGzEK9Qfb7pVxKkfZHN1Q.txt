This has actually been one of the most disappointing mexican places I've been to in a good long time. Went with a friend who ordered the BBQ chicken nachos, which had barely and of the cubed box chicken on it..but the worst part was it was so tiny for what it cost. $10 For something that small is ridiculous . I had the fish tacos which came off too sweet due to the mango they throw into it. I'm what you'd call a fish taco man and these were worst than Dell tacos. Not a recommended place even though i love the.name
