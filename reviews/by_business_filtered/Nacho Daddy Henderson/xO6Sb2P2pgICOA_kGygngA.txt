Today we went to lunch at Nacho Daddy, using a groupon.  We found the food tasty, service wonderful (thank you Adryan) and although we used a groupon pricing still  wasnt bad.  We ordered chips and salsa.. mild but once our server came to refill the salsa, we asked for medium and wow that was good too. I ordered the chicken fajitas and husband ordered big burrito wet..food was tasty and majority of it went home with us,  a bag of chips and salsa was added at no extra charge.  Our soft drinks were refilled without us asking and that in my book was great.. love that kind of service.  By the way our server knew we had a groupon and that did not affect our service or the attentiveness of Adryan.  My husband used the restroom and said it was cool..   We WILL return...
