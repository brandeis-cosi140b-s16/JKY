Slow service waitress looked like a train wreck with piercings and tattoos from head to toe.  Ok I can overlook the insane look but then her greet at the table "hi" with a blank stare and then odd silence until I ordered a drink and told her I was waiting for someone.  Her service was horrible it was slow in the restaurant and she was never around.  The other staff at tables near us looked great and personable but this woman was a train wreck needs a job at a gas station or local tattoo shop.  The food was okay not horrible but sort of bland for mexican but I am interested in trying some of the other nachos that are offered on the menu.  I will be back again everything deserves a second chance but if the next time is anything like this visit my bet is on another restaurant failure within a year.
