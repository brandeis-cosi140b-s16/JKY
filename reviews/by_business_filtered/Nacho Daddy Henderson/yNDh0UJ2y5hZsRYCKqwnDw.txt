Nacho Daddy has a brilliant concept, I will give them that. Who doesn't love nachos? Tons of toppings and the ability to create your own masterpiece is pretty freaking awesome. It seems the execution has a ways to go, but they are new so I'm hoping it will get better. 

Service for us was fabulous. Our waitress was prompt, friendly, and brought us samples of salsas and whatnot to try. 

The food was...just OK. I tried the nachos with the sundried tomatoes and spinach and chicken. An interesting take on nachos and fairly good. My husband came up with his dream combination but wasn't overly impressed with how it turned out. I'm having a hard time here because these are just nachos after all, and the toppings seemed to be of decent quality. I guess at a nacho place you just expect them to be the best nachos of your life - the nachos at Nacho Daddy are not. 

I tried a frozen margarita and it wasn't terrible - better than most of the slurpy style ones offered in Vegas. I wouldn't order it again (I'm spoiled from TX), but it's worth trying it you're into frozen margaritas. 

Overall we'll wait a few months and give it another shot. Service was great and the nachos have potential .
