I'm addicted to this place! The Daddy's Supreme Chicken Tacos are to die for, every mouthful makes me say mmmmm.
 One thing I didn't expect at a place called Nacho Daddy, was the best wings in town!! I LOVE them, they're huge and meaty, with lots of extremely tasty sauce on them. Seriously, try them!
 Another favorite of mine is the chips and salsa. So very fresh, obviously made to order. Plus, they're bottomless! Can't beat that!!
 Literally every thing I've had here is amazing. The only thing that gets iffy is the service. Last time I waited about fifteen minutes before I even got to order a drink, and they weren't that busy. But, I'll deal with it to get the amazing food!
