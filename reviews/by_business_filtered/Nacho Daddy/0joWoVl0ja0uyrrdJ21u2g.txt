We are return costumers- this time we brought along 6 friends- they haven't stop raving about how delicious the breakfast style nachos were...Bingo!
Love that Nacho Daddy is local and within a short walk of many of the downtown hotels.
 Really, if folks are looking for a quick -in and out type meal- may not be your place- this place allows you the time to enjoy your meal and mostly the company you are with,  This is what we dig about Nacho Daddy- 
 This time we jumped into the Photo booth- breakfast and photo booth - great combination! starts your day off right--
we will return..
 Only bummer about our visit this time- Bartender wasn't in yet.. just missed my morning Bloody Mary...
