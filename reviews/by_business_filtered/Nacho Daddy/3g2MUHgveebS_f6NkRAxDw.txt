You know, it wasn't bad. It wasn't great. It was busy, but it wasn't packed. Service could have been wonky. But our Server was a CHAMP and made the whole experience AWESOME! 
Not to say the food was bad, it was just Meh... But the confusing part was, 2 burritos, 1 nacho plate and 2 beers and it was like $100. That seemed kinda high. And although it seemed kinda high, we still had a GREAT time! Most people won't let Management know about great service, however on our way out, I made sure I let the MOD know what a great Server we had and what a great time we had because of him!
