It was my first time visiting this restaurant and I gotta say that I'm very pleased with the service and food! We went in and were immediately seated, we arrived there around 6:30PM. We were treated by our waiter, Shawn, who served our drinks quickly. My table and I ordered the BBQ Pulled Pork Nachos for an appetizer and they were amazing! The size was large and honestly I would have eaten it as an entree. We ordered our entrees and I got the camp fire burger (not exactly that name, but around those words) with a medium rare meat and garlic parmesan fries. The meat of the burger was so juicy and the buns were toasted to perfection. The fries were made to perfection, all of the fries were crispy and they didn't lose their crunch through the entire meal. But the fries were just a little too oily but still tastes amazing. Overall, I would say A++ for the food and service. Thanks to our waiter for the amazing suggestion and service. 
The environment was nice. I liked that they had late 90s music playing in the background with the music video playing along. They also had sports games on tv like baseball, cross fit, and football. So A+ on the environment. 

So I went here two days after (July 26) and the service here was bad. But I don't completely blame the waiters. There was probably 3 waiters serving the entire restaurant which made our food service slow. I do not know exactly how long we were waiting here for our food but it was probably 30-45 minutes. This place has its good and bad days. Let's hope that if you do go here, you get here on a good day.
