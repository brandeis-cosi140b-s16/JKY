I've heard a lot about this place and nachos are my life so we went in with really high expectations, so maybe that's why my dinner was so meh. 
I ordered the Daddy's Margarita and that was awesome!!!!
Also good? The bottomless chips and salsa. Everything was pretty blah from there.

I got the Tostada nacho appetizer for dinner. The seasoning on the meat was like...they tried to do Mexican flavors but got confused or were missing the right spices and used something else. It was just weird. And I totally appreciate super loaded nachos... these were just too much. 

My husband got the buffalo chicken nachos and got approximately 3 tiny pieces of buffalo chicken on them. 

Thank god for the bottomless chips and salsa or we probably would've gone hungry. 

Our server was great and had an awesome sense of humor, so that helped. I'm glad we went and tried it out, but I don't think we'll be going back.
