This is a very welcome, un-Vegasy place to get a quick, relatively cheap tasty meal and drinks! I love nachos and think nacho-focused restaurants should really start taking off, especially if they have a play-on-words name because I also love that. So many kinds of nachos but my husband wanted to stay away from anything too spicy so we hot the Nacho Average Burger nachos and they were great! The meat was well seasoned, the queso was good, and then of course there was also bacon. I got the spicy blood orange margarita and it was just too spicy for me, I was dying, but I couldn't stop drinking it, because it was delicious! My husband's house margarita was also excellent.
