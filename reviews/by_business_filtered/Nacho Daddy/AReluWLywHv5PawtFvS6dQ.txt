Reading the reviews for Nacho Daddy's seem to run between like and hate, no ambiguity.
I went there tonight with the sweety, and we really enjoyed ourselves. We like the building, plenty of room. We liked the service, Cason, our server was nothing short of excellent.
The nachos were Prime. I ordered the enchilada nachos and was very satisfied with the choice, they were tasty indeed. My sweety ordered the Thai Nachos and she was Ecstatic!  She absolutely loved them . We agree, we will definitely be going back.
Why 5 stars on the first visit?  The nachos were THAT good. Our server was helpful, kept our iced tea full, and altogether delightful to talk to.
Nacho Daddy's has a very good tequila selection, and beer selection, as well. The menu is extensive, not just nachos but tacos, burritos,  bowls, salads, sandwiches, appetizers, and desserts. The prices seem fair. 
Did I mention we really liked this place? Yep. We'll be back, to sample the tequilas, and eat more nachos.
