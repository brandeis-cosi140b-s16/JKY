Was super excited to try his place we were actually down town and couldn't find the exact location of the establishment down there so we went to the one closer to our house. It was pretty empty inside I'm guessing because we came like right before the dinner hour. Our waitress was nice don't remember her name we ordered the trio dip and the ceviche. We didn't care for the ceviche at all, but the other dips were good, only thing that aggravated me was our entrees literally came out not even two min of our appetizers. I'm guessing she didn't explain not to fire everything at once. She came over to check and explained that the food just comes out really fast. But then she followed that by saying she just she shouldn't have put everything in at once. Food was decent,  would prolly be willing to give this place another chance
