Ordered the Daddy's Bowl delicious with the wild rice ( differently tasty ), black beans, garlic sauce and cheeses, was extra hungry so had it with the filet mignon. Delicious! 
 Husband had the enchilada chicken plate, super tasty . 
We did a carry out and there was problem, when my husband returned to correct it, the manager was SUPER, he comped our bill. 
A++++ we were so impressed. 
Food and service was great. Will definitely eat here again.
