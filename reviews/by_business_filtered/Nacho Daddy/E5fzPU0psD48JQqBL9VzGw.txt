Beyond Fremont Street resides Nacho Daddy. Old school music videos on the screens. Reasonably priced and decent Street Tacos during Happy Hour. I had the shrimp. They were battered and crispy.

Friendly and interesting banter with the bartender. Wasn't too busy. It was before dinner. This was a linner meal. Late afternoon. The staff seemed to laugh and gab about enjoying themselves. 

Service was quick. It was a pleasure to dine there. The air conditioner worked. Good conversation. Good tunes. I have zero complaints. I was contented. I would like to explore the menu more. 

Whilst in Vegas, hop over to Nacho Daddy. You'll be glad you did.
