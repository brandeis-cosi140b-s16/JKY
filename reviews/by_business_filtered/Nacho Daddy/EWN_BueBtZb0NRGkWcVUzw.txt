I wanted to like this place, I really did. 

Pros: 
Prompt service
Good margaritas
Friendly atmosphere

Con's:
Noisy kids
Sub par nachos
Price

My nachos were just okay. They were chicken nachos and it was a constant scavenger hunt trying to locate meat. They should've been called 'bean nachos with a chicken surprise'. My date ordered some beef nachos, and this is where the 2 stars come in, his were great! Very flavorful with just the right amount of spice. The margaritas we ordered were very strong and a little sweet which made them perfect. At $60 for 3 drinks and 2 sets of nachos, definitely not worth it. I actually felt like Roberto's food had more flavor and I hate them.
