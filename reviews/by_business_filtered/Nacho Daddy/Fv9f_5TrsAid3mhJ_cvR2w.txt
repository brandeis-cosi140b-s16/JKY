Came into nacho daddy on a fly today with two of my friends cause we wanted to grub on some Mexican. Sat at the bar. Our bartender was named Zulma. She was really friendly and actually pleasant to talk to. Refreshing for a Fremont bartender. Food was solid we had the enchiladas and queso. Couple of bloody Mary's which were surprisingly good and they had bacon in it which is always great! Their coffees are good just wouldn't recommend the Mexican latte. Overall experience was good. If you want a margarita or a relaxed atmosphere. Check it out.
