If you're a fan of the Chilis restaurant chain, then Nacho Daddy will be a familiar concept. They serve a Combination of American and Mexican food dishes, with emphasis placed on their unique selection of nacho dishes.

I tried them for the first time today and I probably should have stuck to the nachos the namesake suggests. I ended up getting the grilled cheese sandwich (stuffed with roasted Anaheim chilis, two cheeses, and applewood smoked bacon), because it sounded different and awesome. It was good, but nothing to celebrate, or probably even order again. The bread was a little too buttery tasting and there wasn't as much cheese as I'd expect from a grilled cheese. Bacon was good, but thin. I've gotta applaud the creativity, though.. This sandwich had so many things I like cramped into one package.

My wife went with a sandwich as well and got the cheese steak. It was actually quite small, and I didn't see any cheese on it at all. The beef was flavorful, but the bread also had that weird buttery taste. I like butter, but I'm pretty sure this was some kind of soybean oil based imitation. 

Overall, both sandwiches were good, and the sweet potato and garlic Parmesan fries we ordered were great.

I think next time I'll definitely be trying out their nachos, however, because the pictures and descriptions looked really good, and the food I did have just wasn't good enough to bring me back on its own.

We liked the bottomless chips and salsa. Chips were excellent but the salsas were average. Medium was pretty good, but the hot salsa made me laugh. It was just the same medium salsa with a handful of pickled jalape√±os sprinkled on top.

The beer selection was pretty stellar, so if I'm ever looking for a place with great brews and appetizers, this is definitely a top choice on my list!
