Stopped here to watch some NFL games before LIB a few weeks back and was pleasantly surprised with the new digs. They had most of the out of town games on, so I got to watch my Jets lose by 40 to a team from Ohio (boo). Sunny day? Gotta grab a Pacifico on tap and a Daddy's Supreme Taco (carne asada, mozz, roasted salsa and cilantro). This was a bomb-a$$ taco and was really like a smedium 'rito. A thicker than normal tortilla allowed all the toppings to stay right in place, so no leaking from any end and no breakage in the middle. The lunchtime price of $8.95 didn't break the bank and the whole bill (2 beers, 1 shot, taco, chips) came out around $20. Not too bad. Will def be back!

Pro-tip: Don't ask what kind of tequilas they have unless you have a while. There are lots.
