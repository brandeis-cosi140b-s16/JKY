seriously nasty and obnoxiously overpriced.  10 bucks for a draft beer in a warm mug.  not a good way to start.   I also tried 3 street tacos (pork, chicken and beef).  other than the pork taco being similar to a salt lick, they were pretty flavorless.  on a dare I also tried the Mexican corn on the cob.  I know it's nearly winter and realize that no self-respecting restaurant would ever serve "fresh" corn on the cob this time of year, but I couldn't resist (if only to have something to write about on yelp).  it was truly gross. a single, lifeless ear of corn most likely cooked some time yesterday or the day before and heated up for service.  at 6 bucks I could only laugh.  it lived down and exceeded my lowest expectations. zero chance this place will make it.  if I want food this lame and this overpriced, i'll go down to the strip.
