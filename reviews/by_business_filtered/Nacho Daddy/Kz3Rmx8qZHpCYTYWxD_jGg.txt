We walked in intending to spend whatever we wanted. It was late at night.. 11:30 PM. We walked into the bar with a group of 5 and the girl behind the bar (for a place that is open until 3AM) was acting like a rude you-know-what. I have been a faithful customer at Nacho Daddy for years and this was really disappointing. Because of this bartender alone, I and my friends will not attend this establishment. She worked at least from 11:30 to midnight tonight (11/25) pm, because someone in our group had to use the restroom, this bartender felt the need to attack us as we walked in the door. We will explain to our friends that this bartender alone is the reason that no one should feel welcome to this establishment. After an attempted explanation of our friend going to the bathroom, we were attacked and criticized for using the establishment for that reason and immediately left.  We will recommend to our friends and relatives that the location in Henderson is the more welcome location in town.
