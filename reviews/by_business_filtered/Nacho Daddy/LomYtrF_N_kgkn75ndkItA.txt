This place opens at 8:00 am. The bartender asked if we would like the bloody marry bar and my husband said sure... Oh wait it was not set up yet. I took her (Alex) over 15 minutes to bring us our drinks - did I tell you we were the only one at the bar. Guess I need to stick to the one closer to my house and not the tourist one downtown. Won't be back.
