I have been on the vegas strip and all around fremont for vacation. This place is awesome to snack and drink. That scorpion shot is awesome. This place would kill in texas. Im from san antonio. If you ever want to expand outside nevada. Ill invest. This is a legit place to come to. Your staff was awesome as well. Bartender is quick and friendly. Our server was really cool. This will be my spot every time we come. And we come to vegas a lot!
