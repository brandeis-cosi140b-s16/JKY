Ordered the peach margarita in the jug. Pretty good. Husband ordered a few shots of tequila to spike his drink a little more. I liked it as is. Nice buzz afterwards. We ordered the chicken quesadilla and spicy shrimp nachos. Substituted the cheese for the yellow nacho cheese on the nachos. One word amazing! Have to eat em pretty quick so the chips aren't as soggy but they were still good. Probably have light salsa on em next time too. You will not be disappointed
