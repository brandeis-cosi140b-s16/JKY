Walked in and we were greeted by a miserable looking kid. He told us it was a 5 to 10 minute wait. We sat down near the fireplace and he said it might take longer. Not something you want to hear when you are greeted.
We sat down about 10 minutes later and ordered immediately. The server was nice but he never really checked up on us. He was focused on 2 other tables that were a bit larger. We had to flag him down for water and condiments. It was hard enough to just get his attention with music blasting. 
The food was between del Taco and Robertos.  That's the only honest description I can think of. I opted for the queso dip and chips and quesadilla. My husband ordered the burrito, which was huge, but nothing phenomenal. The queso dip was made out of real cheese, but that was the only dish that stood out. The kids had nachos and Mac and cheese, so, that too was mediocre. 
I don't think I will come back here anytime soon, maybe for the happy hour. Maybe I will update my review then.
