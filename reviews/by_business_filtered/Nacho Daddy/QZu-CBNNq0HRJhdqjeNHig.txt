Not impressed with Wednesday night trivia here. The music is playing too loud in background, servers are polishing silverware and singing happy birthday, making it hard to hear the questions. Server, Shawn, was intrusive, telling us answers to questions. Did we invite you to be on our team, shawn? No. Not sure we'll be back.
