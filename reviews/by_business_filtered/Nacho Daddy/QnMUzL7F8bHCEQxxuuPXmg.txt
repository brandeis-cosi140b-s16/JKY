I like this place because the people and the vibe are amazing. The servers and bartenders interact and socialize in friendly manner. Its open late and  it's right downtown. 
The last time I  was there I had a really young looking waiter by the name of Mikey. He was prompt in the beverage service and suggested that I try the Mexican cobb salad since I wanted something light. The dish was really good and had just the right amount of dressing to compliment the flavors. 
I felt the food and drinks are a little over priced for what you get. Especially since There are many other great places to get a bite and a drink in the area, but I will definitely come back in the future.
