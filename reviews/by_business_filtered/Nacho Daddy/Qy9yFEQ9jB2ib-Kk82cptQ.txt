I got suckered into this place by their mail ads for their taco Tuesday's and also had 2 for 1 coupons but forgot to bring it. I'll probably only go back to this place to use the coupons. 
We had the the shrimp and carne asada street tacos 3 tacos for $7. The shrimp was popcorn shrimp and tasted like any ordinary popcorn shrimp u can get from your local grocery store. The carne asada tacos you can get cheaper and better taste from a late night taco stand. It doesn't come with any sauces beside tapatio and cholula already on your table.
This place is too Americanized and rather go to an authentic Mexican restaurant for the flavor and price.
