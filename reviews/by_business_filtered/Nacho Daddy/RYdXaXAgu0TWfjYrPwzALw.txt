We were excited to see this new location of Nacho Daddy!

Our service was AMAZING! Our waiter was on point every second, even though it was very clear that he had just been slammed with 5 tables. It did not matter, he did not miss a beat! 

Food- Everything tasted really fresh, came quickly, all being delivered by friendly food runners. Was it mind shattering Mexican food? No, but it was all really good.

My biggest obstacle is the price point. All through my college years I survived on big delicious burritos because they were super cheap. So in my brain, I think Mexican food should be at least slightly inexpensive. 
We ordered 1 appetizer - Queso Dip- It was good.
3 entrees- 2 burritos and a plate of nachos.
2 soft drinks, and a single beer.
Our check with tip was $100! - OUCH!
I could name 8 places in LV that would be as good and 1/2 that price.

I would go back, if it was suggested.
But, honestly, I am not sure I would suggest it myself.
