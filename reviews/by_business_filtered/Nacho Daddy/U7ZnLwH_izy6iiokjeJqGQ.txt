Having been to the Henderson location a few times I guess I expected better at their vegas location. Service was very slow but friendly. Took a loooong time to be served. I had the steak supreme tacos, I rate them as a 2 star taco. The meat had a very strange texture. The rice was nasty and the retried beans were runny and tasted flat.
