I always jeered at the prospect of going to a restaurant that specialized in nachos.  I would hear stories of my friend who would praise Nacho Daddy on his side of town for hours on end.  I was so close to going the one Downtown, however I was recalled home prematurely by my significant other.

This time.  This time, it was DESTINY!   My friends and I counted the days to opening when we first saw it was coming to our side of town.  The the time came.  We sat, we ate, we got full.  We left happy.

This place was awesome.  Great ambiance.  Awesome Servers.  Insane menu!  The prices may be a tiny bit higher than what we usually spend, but totally worth it.

I got the "Fiesta Chicken Nachos" with my now infamous custom order of Diet Cherry Coke.  

Both were spot on.  The Nachos were very tastey.  When they came, I didn't know how to attack it.  I accidently got a  little bit of cheese on my finger and when sucked my finger clean, it hit me!  My first bite of Nacho Daddys.  It was epic.

The Fiesta Chicken Nachos was very creamy, very rich (but not too rich) and there was definitely enough for me to take it home if I was sensible that day.  But I wasn't.  I DESTROYED the plate and it was glorious!

I swear up and down that it tasted like I was hitting pockets of CHOCOLATE in my nachos.  As crazy as that sounds and as gross as the prospect may be, it was good!

Our server was astute and prompt.  For being open for only a few days when we visited, the place was well put together and on the ball.  

I highly recommend this place.
