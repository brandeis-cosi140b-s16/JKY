Courtney was our bartender,  and the service was very good.  We had the spicy shrimp nachos and grilled corn on the cob, off the cob at happy hour and they were outstanding.  This place may be classified as a dive, but there is a very diverse crowd in the bar.  I would suggest that anyone visiting Fremont St. make this place a must see.  I will definitely visit this place again next time I am downtown.
