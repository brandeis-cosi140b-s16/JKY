Sat at the bar. Drunk gal kept reaching over and taking food from our plate. Bartender's response to this is to give her a free bowl of nachos. Got the bill and handed it to the gal who ate half our food. Then she gets all loud and offended. I ask for the manager. It took well over 5 minutes for a guy named Nick to come out since apparently he had left the building. I try to explain the situation to him while the bartender is repeatedly whining that he didn't do anything wrong. Nick offers no adjustment on our bill nor anything else to make us think the place cares about making the customer happy. I tell him I plan to tell everyone I know not to go here, but I think others have beaten me to it since it was pretty empty for a Friday night. The food is unremarkable, forgettable, and overpriced. Fancy serving trays just don't improve the taste. Not to worry, the drunk gal was hiding in the corner of the parking lot and on her way back in once she saw we were leaving.
