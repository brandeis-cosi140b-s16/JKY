Buffalo Chicken Nachos.

That's pretty much all you need, really.  Go ahead, I'll wait for you to order and finish.

SEE?!?  Weren't those things awesome?  In any case, I am a fan of that particular selection, although their burger nachos and chicken fried steak/egg breakfast nachos are no slouch either.

A decent little location just across the way from the Neonopolis, and nestled well within Fremont Street, I liked the low-key vibe there, with their poppy music videos on the TV, and a pretty tasty Bloody Mary (also of note, their coffee selection is excellent).

The service is friendly and keeps tabs on you.  Prices are reasonable, and portions are BIG.  Come hungry, for they will hook you up if you are suffering any sort of nacho deficiency.  

In any case, I took it upon myself to visit this location four times over two weeks, if that tells you anything, and now that I'm thinking on it, some buffalo chicken nachos do sound remarkable tasty right about now.

They need delivery.  Because as strong as my need for nachos is, I'm not feeling the cold right now.

We need to work this out, Nacho Daddy....
