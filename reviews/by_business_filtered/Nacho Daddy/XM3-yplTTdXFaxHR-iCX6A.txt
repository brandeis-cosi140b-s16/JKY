My group was hanging out on Fremont Street and people were hangry. So hangry in fact, that after attempting to find a place to accommodate 10 people, most of the group headed back to the hotel.

That left 4 of us to get something to stuff our faces with. We went with Nacho Daddy which turned out to be an awesome decision.

It was not crowded at all on a Monday night, so we were sat quickly and placed our appetizer and drink order. We went with the pulled pork BBQ nachos, which turned out to be phenomenal. The pork was good (not the best I've had but this ain't dixieland), but the sauce and queso made this spectacular. Their BBQ sauce was very tangy, with just enough sweet and a little kick at the back end. The white queso was interestingly underneath the pile of chips and toppings but it works well as it keeps the slimy chip situation to a minimum.

Our margaritas took a while to obtain but were good. Mine was the house rita, which was a tad sweet but mixed strong enough and with fresh lime juice.

Everyone at the table ordered various iterations of Gringo and Street Tacos. I personally got the steak filet ones which were great. I would have preferred shredded cheese to queso, but it turned out ok. Others in my party were really impressed with the shredded pork tacos. Refried beans were on point as well. The Spanish rice was unimpressive, it was a bit overcooked but had the right flavor.

The only reason I gave this only 4 stars was because the bar was a little too slow in getting drinks out. Our server was awesome! We were given great recommendations and he took a few pictures of our group since we learned he's a serious photographer!

Should we find ourselves hangry or even hungry on Fremont Street again, this place will be in the short list for sure!
