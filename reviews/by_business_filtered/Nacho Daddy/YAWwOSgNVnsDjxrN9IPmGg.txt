Definitely start with the guava margarita!  Good thing Zach recommended it! The food is very fresh. I was rushing so I order cerviche and guacamole and chips. Guacamole was excellent,  the cerviche was good and different than most. I would only change one thing more shrimp in the ceviche. Request Zach he is very accommodating!
