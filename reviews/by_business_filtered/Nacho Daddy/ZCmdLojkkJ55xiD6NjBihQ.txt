We went here for lunch thinking that since it's a bar, it's gotta be cheap. We ordered the nachos tostada and the two enchiladas that came with rice & beans and a guava margarita and a peach one. I'll admit the chips were outstanding. The enchiladas were pretty damn good too. I guess I forgot to tell them no beans. Flies were flying around everywhere. Including on our food and glasses. The waitress gave us a dirty look when we told her we needed a minute to look at the menu. But then she gave us a fake smile when she came to the table. She didn't deserve the tip we gave her. 
Lunch came out to be around $60. Not worth it. But good for a one time thing.
