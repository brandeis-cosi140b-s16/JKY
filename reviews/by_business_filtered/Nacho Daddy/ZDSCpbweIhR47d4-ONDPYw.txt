My boyfriend and I came here for the first time a month ago. We've been back once a week for two reasons. 1. The food is fantastic. 2. Bill is the best waiter we've ever had. He keeps us laughing, keeps our beverages full, and always remembers what we like. He is the only waiter we let take care of us there. The filet mignon street tacos are my favorite so far. Must try! Great service, delicious food, what more can you ask for?
