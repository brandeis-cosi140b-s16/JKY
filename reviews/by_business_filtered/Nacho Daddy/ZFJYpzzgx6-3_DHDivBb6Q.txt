It takes a lot for me to complain at any restaurant and it takes even more for me to not leave a tip! Being in the restaurant business for over 10 years I value customer service... That being said thank the food gods for the the amazing Filet nachos they were simply amazing from the presentation to the very last bite I was thoroughly impressed and mad at my stomach for being full... Skip the wings tho lacked anything that would make wings good! My biggest complaint was my waitress, blond never got her name and barely had her attention the entire time! Don't ask her for anything she gives you this smile with I don't really don't wanna be here or talking to you look... I ordered a traditional margarita took a few drinks hated it but hey I ordered it I'll finish it, but as I continued to drink it I noticed that I had the dirtiest glass Ive ever drank out of... Showed my husband he said it has to be stained I took my finger and wiped the glass it was filthy it was disgusting! Did the manger care?!? Oh no she didn't... Said would you like another I said no and she never apologized she did agree it was dirty but the way she acted it was like normal... I'll never go back to that location... Not a good way to send off guest! Customer service wouldn't have gotten any stars but the nachos were bomb!!
