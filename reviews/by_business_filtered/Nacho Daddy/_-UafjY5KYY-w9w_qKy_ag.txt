I was trying to give this place 3.5 stars, but it looks like the option is only 3 or 4.

Nacho Daddy is located in the heart of Downtown, Las Vegas, just a couple blocks down from where I work. I've tried several of their dishes and have never walked away with that "wow" factor. Their nachos are very satisfying, and they come with a heap load of toppings to ensure that every chip has some kind of yumminess on it. The BBQ nachos are the best, in my opinion. 

I've tried their filet beef street tacos. The beef is cut into very small pieces, and then topped with a sprinkle of onions and cilantro. The food is then placed on two mini corn tortillas. The tacos do the job, don't get me wrong, but the meat was a bit overcooked to my liking, and I had to add a bit of hot sauce to keep the tacos moist. Again, not a terrible meal.   

My favorite thing on the menu is their fish tacos. This is definitely a dish I would go back for!! The fish is slathered in herbs and spices and then thrown on the grill for good measure. The well flavored filet is then topped with cabbage and a little salsa, but the best part is the thick handmade tortilla it comes on. Everything works together well, and two of these babies will definitely leave you with a smile. 

The service at Nacho Daddy is okay, and the environment is relaxing with a nod to the famous 90's bands playing on the TVs. All in all, I'll be back.
