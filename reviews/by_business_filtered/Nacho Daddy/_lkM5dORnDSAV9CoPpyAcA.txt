Always pass by this place so my wife and I decided to try it out. They sat us right away which was nice. But then we waited 15 minutes and left... no one came up to greet us or ask for drinks or anything !. The sad thing is the place wasnt even busy . Sorry but if you cant say anything withing 15 minutes of me seating at a table that means you offer bad service.  I will never give them another chance . Good luck with staying open.
