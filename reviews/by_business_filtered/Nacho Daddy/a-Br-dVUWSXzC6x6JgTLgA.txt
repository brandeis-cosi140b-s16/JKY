Came in for drinks and was welcomed from the minute we got in. Sat at the bar and was greeted by Ann the bartender(great smiling and upbeat personality). Saw the sign outside saying you have the best Margarita in town. Ann suggested the Primo Margarita and decided to give it a try. I absolutely loved it!!! Your employees are very attentive to the needs of your customers, I will be back in the future!!
