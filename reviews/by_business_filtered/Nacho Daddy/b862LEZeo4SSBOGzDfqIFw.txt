Eh... I was a little disappointed, which made me sad because this was my birthday dinner AND I'd heard so many good things about Nacho Daddy!

I made a reservation two weeks prior for 20 people. I called that afternoon to confirm the reservation. ("yep, we have it, no problem!"). When we arrived, no one seemed to know what we were talking about! Luckily, they weren't super busy, so they were able to set something up for us, but that definitely put a sour taste in my mouth to start.

Secondly,  the menu is NOT the same as what is posted online (only the Henderson location  posts their menu). This was especially disappointing because I'd already planned out what I wanted, but lo and behold, it wasn't on their menu. The menu of the Downtown location is much more abbreviated. 

I ended up ordering the BBQ nachos, which were good, but the sauce was very strong, and there was a lot of cilantro. We also had chips & salsa. The chips were great, and the salsa very hot. 

I also had a Raspberry Margarita, which was super sweet! I like sweet drinks, but this was even too sweet for my taste.  

We also got an order of the s'mores nachos to share and sing Happy Birthday to me! They were okay. Just beware that the marshmallow sauce is REALLY sticky! Just passing it around the table, a girl got some of it stuck in her hair, and I know I got some  on my face and it was hard to get off!

The service was very friendly and casual, but I think they were a little strapped for servers (it looked like they might have only had 2 and 1 or 2 bartenders?), so they didn't come back to check on us and our needs too often. 

I do want to check out the Henderson location, but I don't know that I'll return to ND downtown.
