This place was amazing! Wanted something different than the normal tourist fair. This was a  very refreshing experience. Our waitress Eva was very happy helpful and playful. She made our experience here great. The food was huge! Not what we expected. We came on a taco Tuesday there were 3 of us 2 guys who are big eaters and myself and there was food left over from our supreme tostada nachos and 10 for $10 tacos which were not your typical skimpy tacos Tuesday tacos.  Will be coming here every time we come to Vegas.
