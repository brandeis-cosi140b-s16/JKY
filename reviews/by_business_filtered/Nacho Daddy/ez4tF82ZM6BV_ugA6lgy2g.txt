Really good food and they have a pretty large menu. They have quite a few different kinds of nachos plus regular Mexican food and breakfast. I had the supreme nachos but without beef. The chicken ones look great, too, so I would love to try those next time. The nachos were really good and big enough either to share or eat on your own, depending how hungry you are. The service is really good, too, so can't beat that.
