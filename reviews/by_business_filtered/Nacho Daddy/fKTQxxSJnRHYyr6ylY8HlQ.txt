Worse service ever! They weren't super busy at the time we went but it was a good 5 minutes before we were acknowledged them another 5 before we were seated (they needed to clear tables that looked like they have been dirty for some time). It took a while before we were offered drinks and even longer before someone took our order. When our food finally arrived to the table, the waiter spilled red enchilada sauce all over my boyfriend's White Sox baseball hat. Another waitress witnessed this but instead of helping us out she told another waiter working on the other side of the restaurant who then proceeded to give us water to clean off his hat. We were ready for our check and couldn't find our waitress or anyone to bring it to us. Did not like our experience here at all and probably will not recommend or return.
