What do you call cheese that isn't your's?  Nacho cheese!  *ba-dum-tissss* Thanks folks, I'll be here all week.  

After sampling some of their delicious bbq nachos at the last yelp event, I was eager to go here.  I finally got my chance yesterday 11-15-15 at 11:30 AM.  This restaurant is located on 4th street which is right smack dab in the middle of the fremont street madness.  We parked in the fremont parking garage and it cost $2.  


$35.74 got me a bloody mary, a triple dip appetizer, and a barbecue pulled pork sandwich.  Our server, Jon, was very attentive and brought us a high chair, crayons, and a kids menu for the boy.  

The bloody mary experience was unique to me....it was a bloody mary DIY bar.  For $8 they give you a mason jar with ice and Absolut in it, and then you go up to the bar and make it the way you want it.  They had bloody mary mix, pickles, celery, hot sauces, cucumbers, olives, lemons, etc. I thought that was pretty neat.  

The triple dip ($11.95) consisted of white queso dip, guac, and salsa, and it came with the world's saltiest chips (see photo).  That queso dip....oh wow....I wish I could fill up a jacuzzi with it and drink my way out.  It was heavenly.  Their guac, however, was yucky.  It tasted like the kind you can buy at Wal-mart.  I would have given this place 5 stars if their guac was good and I didn't have to wade through smelly street performers to get there.  

The pulled pork sandwich was awesome...so juicy and messy!  It came with piping hot fries that I really enjoyed dipping in the queso dip.  My only critique would be that the pork was in large chunks and I prefer it more shredded.  

Yay! I'm a fan.  Next time I'm getting the buffalo nachos and street corn.
