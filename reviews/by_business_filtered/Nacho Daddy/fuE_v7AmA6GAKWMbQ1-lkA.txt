Off a side street from the craziness of Fremont, this place is a treat! We didn't eat full on meals because we just wanted something light and a drink but the food we got was great. I got chips and salsa (some of the best I've ever had) and my bf got one of the spicy nachos (I forget what it was called exactly). My bf ate almost the entire plate of nachos by himself, that's how good he thought it was! He even wanted to go back the next day. Only complaint is our server was slow to get to us and it wasn't really busy at all. However she was very lovely after that! Great place, I'd definitely return!
