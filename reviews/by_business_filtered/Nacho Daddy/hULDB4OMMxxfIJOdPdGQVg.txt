Nachso good service
Angie.  Last night we returned to see if our service would be better than my previous trip as outlined below.
We brought a friend from BC for some food and drinks. Upon arrival there was a table on the patio with customers so we chose the opposite side after waiting a short time my wife went in and asked the Bartender if we could get service. Answer was yes. 23 minutes passed , no service so she went inside ordered 2 shots of Julio 42 and a Reposado.  Finally a server with Bunny ears came out and took our food order.
Really piss poor service.  I get it.  Downtown deals with tourists equals crappy service.  Hopefully your new store in Summerlin will care about and cater to locals.  Will give it one last try.  Thx Earle
We stopped in to check ND's out.  Heard about Nachos from watching it on the TV show Mystery Diners. Also a big sign out front advertising $5 tacos and $6 Titos 
We sat at the Bar and had a great time talking with him. The day we dined was National Taco Day as well as Vodka Day. Go figure. Tacos and Vodka.  With that said.  Nachos had $6 Titos cocktails. So we had street tacos and Titos 
Later that evening we decided to return with a friend for a cocktail. We ordered 3 Titos and service was really slow "different bartender"  took forever to pay.  Got the bill and the bartender charged us $9 a drink instead of the posted $6 price. After some discussion they finally adjusted the bill. Then sent a guy out front to take down the posted special sign.  Not sure if or when we will return
