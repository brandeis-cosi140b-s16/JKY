Let me start off with how AMAZING the shrimp nachos are, best part of the meal/experience

The staff? Bartenders, not so friendly, we felt ignore for majority of our experience. They got us drinks & our food order but then..
Nothing.. I work in restaurants, I hate when people have to flag me down.

We started with the amazing spicy shrimp nachos, hands down some of the best nachos I've ever had, piping hot & full of flavor 

Then.. We waited.. 

Ignored by the guy bartender while the girl bartender ate food in plain sight. I understand you have to eat but in front of customers?

We continued to wait.. With empty waters (we were having cocktails too) 

When we received our fajitas, they were cold. I shouldn't be able to touch the cast iron they're served on. I had to be that person to flag the one bartender down, not sure of his name, he had a small curly rat tail hairstyle. I told him they were cold, he looked surprised, they weren't sizzling like fajitas should be, so he took them back. They brought out what I assume we're the same fajitas just reheated somehow. They were ridiculously greasy & lackluster. 

The salsas served with the chips were delicious and spicy..


Highlights- shrimp nachos/chips & salsa

downfalls- bartenders, ignoring us/ cold fajitas 

We are going to try a different location & see if it's better
