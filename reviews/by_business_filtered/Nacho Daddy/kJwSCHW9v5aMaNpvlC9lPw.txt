Ok so the nachos were really good. My son and I shared the tostada nachos supreme, and I had the fish tacos. The fish in the fish tacos was tasteless and undercooked, now with that being said I've had some of the best and  freshest fish tacos from around the world. Service was mediocre at best, they messed up my order then the server comes out and tells me that I can't have fish taco without the beans and rice. Overall it was ok and I might try it again.....maybe.
