Ever since eating at this downtown Las Vegas spot, I've had a recurring dream where I'm in the middle of a big plate of nachos ready to be devoured by giant versions of my friends a la Honey I Shrunk the Kids. And no, it is not a nightmare, because the nachos here are so good I can't think of a better place to perish than in the gooey goodness of a soggy, cheese-smothered tortilla chip from Nacho Daddy.

Before you ready any further, take a moment to appreciate the pun of the name.

...It took me a while at first, so just want to make sure we're all on the same page.

BREAKFAST NACHOS. BREAKFAST NACHOS. BREAKFAST NACHOS. BREAKFAST NACHOS. BREAKFAST NACHOS. BREAKFAST NACHOS. BREAKFAST NACHOS. BREAKFAST NACHOS. BREAKFAST NACHOS. BREAKFAST NACHOS. BREAKFAST NACHOS. BREAKFAST NACHOS.

So the chicken fried steak breakfast nachos are in my top ten favorite dishes of all time. I was even inspired to make a version for my friends on a few occasions to great success, but I haven't come close to beating the original.

The one drawback to this place is the service. When we did get service it was great, but the waitstaff/bartenders were spread thin and trips to our table were few and far between.

Even so, you neeeeeed to go here if you find yourself in downtown vegas. Back to dreaming about the next time I get to visit here.
