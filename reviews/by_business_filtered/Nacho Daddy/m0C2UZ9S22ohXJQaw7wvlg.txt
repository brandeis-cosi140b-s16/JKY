Perfect! I've been here twice now, and I'm sad that it hasn't been more. I'm too busy running my own restaurant, but I'm glad when I come here. 
First, I was greeted promptly and with a smile. Next, I was welcomed by the manager with fresh chips and roasted salsa. The margaritas were strong and tasty! The Mahi Mahi tacos were filled with fish and slaw and I barely got to the to rice and beans. ( which were fresh and hot) 
Check and exit greeting were on point and I could not have left more satisfied and pleased. Congrats Nacho Daddy! Well done!
