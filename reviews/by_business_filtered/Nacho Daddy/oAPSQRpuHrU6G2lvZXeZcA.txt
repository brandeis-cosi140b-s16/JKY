I would give zero stars if I could.  Eric was our server and it was the worst service I've ever had in my life.  He took 30 minutes to get us chips and salsa.  He gave 2 people in our party the wrong order.  One of which took 30 extra minutes to get the right order, so by the time she got her food we were all finished.  He never came around to fill waters or get second drink orders which we all wanted.  He added people's bills together.  It was so bad I didn't leave a tip at all which I've never done because I was a server for many years and know how difficult the job can be.the food was jus ok not nearly good enough to make up for it.  We tried to make a complaint to the manager but she was too busy eating at the bar.
