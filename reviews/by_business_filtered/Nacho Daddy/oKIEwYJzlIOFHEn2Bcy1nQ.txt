We wanted something different for take out last night.  After looking at the menu online, I called and ordered a Mexican Street burger and a Cuban sandwich.  I ordered both with garlic parmesan fries one of the sides that comes with the sandwiches.  I was told 15 minutes and that was about exactly right although I was thjere early because they're so close to where I live.

My wife enjoyed the Mexican burger and the fries very much.  My sandwich was good but it's not a Cuban sandwich.  It's pulled pork and a slice of ham with some cheese on a toasted baguette and not a pressed sandwich as every authentic Cuban sandwich should be.  I liked the fries.

The packing for take out was good.  It was firm plastic but on the cold day we had, it wasn't the best insulator.  It wasn't a good day for takeout for most places with the cold.

The sandwiches were OK but nothing I'd get again.  Pricey for what you get.  Too many good places around.
