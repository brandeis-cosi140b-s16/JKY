Ok the place is really dingy and somewhat depressing inside! It's also a very narrow building with a very narrow walkway into the place!
This wouldn't be an issue except that the bar is right there as you come in the door, and the bar chairs tend to get bumped into A LOT!
The Music was ridiculously LOUD, and VULGAR! Now I'm no prude but I don't particularly care to hear the F word or the N word 800 times while I'm eating!
The food however for the most part was very good! I had the street tacos, one Carnitas, one Chicken, and one Shrimp!
All were delicious! I also ordered chips and salsa! The salsa was underwhelming (whole pickled jalape√±os) muy no Bueno!
But the chips were hot and fresh and plentiful!
Service was good as well! Will try again but during the day when perhaps it is quieter!
