The spicy shrimp nachos were AMAZING, the best I've ever had. The salsa was fresh and so good. The service was eh. My friend and I sat at the bar, hoping for prompt service. Both bartenders were polite but no very attentive, we had to flag them down for water multiple times and there was only 4 other people st the bar.  We sent back our fajitas, they were cold, fajitas are supposed to come out sizzling and there was zero heat. They reheated it instead of making a new one, which was ok I guess but they still had no steam whatsoever.  We were hungry and didn't want to be annoying so we ate them. I won't go to this location again but I will to another because the food (besides fajitas) was great.
