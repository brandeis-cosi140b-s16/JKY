Came here two weeks ago and was beyond disappointed. Sat in the main dining room and was immediately greeted and put in a drink order. 15 minutes later no one had been back to our table and I could see our drinks sitting on the bar. Came in on 4/4 and sat at the bar. Our bartender  courtney with het red hair was awesome! Super attentive and made awesome drinks. Completely changed my mind about this location. Definitely would come back if she was at the bar.
