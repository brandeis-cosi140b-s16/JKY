Service was horrible. Came to watch a Chargers game however instead of being straight up with us from the beginning that they were having a satellite issue, they insisted the game would be on in time for us to watch, had us put in our order, then when game time started, still gave us excuses..... Still no game.... We won't be returning to watch any games here.
