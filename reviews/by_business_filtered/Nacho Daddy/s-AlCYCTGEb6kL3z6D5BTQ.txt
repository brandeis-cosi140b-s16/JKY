We had a great experience last night & this morning. "The manager" was our Watress last night. Fun personality yet professional with details regarding our food & drinks.

This morning the manager greeted us and Jesse was our Watress. Authentic Mexican food & good Bloody Mary's  ! 

"Jesse" covered all the bases with a smile.

"Martha" who works in the kitchen went out of her way to see the food was as ordered & brought me some extra salsa. 

Sincere caring service !
 
I highly recommend this Restuarant. !
