I had a friend in Vegas for the week and was excited to bring him here. I had heard mixed reviews, but was willing to try it myself. The place looked dirty and smelled like sewage. I went to the restroom to wash my hands and was greeted by cockroaches. The dirty appearance, awful smell, and roaches were plenty of reason to leave. And we did. It's unfortunate. Won't be back.
