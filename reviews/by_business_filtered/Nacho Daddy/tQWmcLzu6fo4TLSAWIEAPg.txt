Was visiting Vegas with my boyfriend & decided to try this place out after reading recent Yelp reviews. Yuuummmm!!  Their street tacos & nachos were so tasty!  Met a couple of new friends while watching the Stanley Cup finals back in June at the bar. Vegas is the place to have fun & especially on Fremont St!  Atmosphere is always great!
