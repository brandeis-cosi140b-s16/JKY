Great selection for vegans. I had the Kale Salad, it was tasty and refreshing!  The roasted corn is fresh and straight off the cobb. I also got the guacamole; it is fresh and simple. It's amazing how many people can mess up guacamole and Nacho Daddy did it right. It's chunky with hand chopped onions and tomatoes. Honestly it could have used more cilantro!  My husband got the Spicy Tofu Burrito, look out taste buds!  I didn't even try it because I can't do spicy but he said it was great but not for the weak belly!  Overall the experience was good, the chips were light and fresh but almost too salty. I will eat here again!
