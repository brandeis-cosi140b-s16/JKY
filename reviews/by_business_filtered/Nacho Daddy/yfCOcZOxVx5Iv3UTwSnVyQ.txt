Service at the bar is awful!  Two of us sat down and got a drink and ceviche.  The drinks were ok and the ceviche was good but small.  We finished the drinks and food and wanted more drinks, but when we tried to get the bartenders attention he completely ignored us.  Sat there for over 20 minutes without anyone coming to get another drink order.  We even pushed our empty glasses and plate in his direction and still ignored us.  Politely shouted over the music and raised our hand, still ignored.  Awful awful awful service but it wasn't just to us, three groups on our side of the bar all experienced the same thing.  Maybe the bartender just wanted to keep serving the dude who he fist pumped since he got two rounds before anyone came our way.
