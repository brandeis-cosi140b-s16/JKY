Me and my friend were craving Mexican food when we decided to come here. We sat outside since it's still not too hot out. We were quickly greeted by Sarah. I always like to see what servers recommend, so I put her to the test. I wanted a very refreshing drink, she was spot on about the mango Thai basil margarita. One of my new favs! It went awesome with Sarah's recommendation of the spicy shrimp nachos.
