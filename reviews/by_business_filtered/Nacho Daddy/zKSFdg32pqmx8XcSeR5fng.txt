Lauren is a fantastic server and gave us excellent service the first time I dined here. We did not have to ask for what we wanted, she knew or she asked us. Love it!

However, the second time I came was not so fantastic. Miss pouty face server told us 3 times in a 20 minute period that they were "still brewing coffee". It takes 5 not 20. We were not checked up on until Lauren took over our table 50 minutes into our experience and we JUST got a second cup of coffee. Thank you Lauren for making it happen.

I don't attribute a negative Yelp review to one servers poor customer service though.
The food is delicious, the environment is great, 70 different types of tequila is rad, and the owner was kind. I love the restaurant concept.
