Oh god! No!! Terrible!! No flavor in the food or drinks! The margharitas were sooo weak!! Everyone I know who has gone hated it!! There are enough good Mexican restaurants on the East side don't waste your times here! But then again...its slim pickings this far out east mesa. The service wasn't great either.
