Eeeewwww!!! Not only did they mess up my pick up order, the food was gross. Got the salsa but NO CHIPS! The 3 hostesses rudely pointed me to the BAR to pick up my food, only to be waiting forever to be called in... What a joke. Got home and what I ordered was not IN MY BAG, starving I tried to eat it anyway....yuck. Blobs of cheese, tacos burned to a crisp (that's a first) enchiladas were runny ( not with cheese) disgusting!!! I ate here before , never a problem. I don't know if they had an off day or what. But $30 worth of take out food should be at least satisfactory...... This was NOT.
