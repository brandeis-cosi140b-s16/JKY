Atmosphere: Dark, intimate seating in a large space. You are in your own world at your table with other tables you can see, but cannot hear well. Good for groups and couples alike. 

Service: Friendly, attentive, and well-informed waitstaff. They know what is and what is not vegetarian and they have great recommendations for drinks, food, etc.

The drinks: I ordered the coconut margarita, which was flavorful and not-too-sweet. Nice, smooth house tequila; not the best booze, but certainly not the worst. Each table also has a pitcher of ice water, so you can pour your own water. Great for when you bite into something spicy and you then drain your glass of water and your date's glass of water. 

The food: Chips and salsa while you peruse the menu with an extra thing of hot salsa, so you can customize your spiciness. We ordered the chile con queso dip, el numero nueve (cheese enchilada, shredded beef taco, chile relleno, and rice), and an a la carte bean tostadas.

The queso is definitely not a Tex-Mex queso. A fellow Yelper compared it to the quesos of Austin, TX. Not even the slightest bit true. Nando's queso is a good queso, but it is watery when it first comes out. The chips served with the queso are puffy and great. Don't get me wrong, I will return to Nando's for the queso.

The bean tostadas was huge, great, and cheap. Lots of guacamole on it. Yum.

The nueve combo was HUGE, covered in cheese, and very, very hot. The shredded beef taco was a great suggestion from our server! My date ended up taking 2/3 of his meal home because he couldn't finish it. 

Overall, this is a solid Tex-Mex restaurant. Large (HUGE) portions, good drinks, queso (!!!!), and a great a la carte menu where you can order a ton of food for about $5 each. Oh, and lots of vegetarian options with good (meaty and cheesy) food for meat-loving dates.
