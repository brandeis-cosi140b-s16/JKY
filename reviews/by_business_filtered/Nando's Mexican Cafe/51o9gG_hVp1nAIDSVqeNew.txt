My wife and I have enjoyed our several dining experiences here.  

The chips and salsa were absolutely delicious.  Light, thin, non greasy chips, salsa comes in a small bottle that you can mix with the offered hot salsa.  Verrrrry good!

The margaritas are really great!  Generous glasses, but ya gotta be careful, you're on to your 1st which leads to the second, and WOW!  Heh!

My wife had the Barrios Tacos which she enjoyed very much.  I tried a bite and they're very good.  I had the El Numero Seite (aka #7 Cheese Enchilada, Taco, Beef Tamale, and refried beans w/ melted cheese on top and a garnish of lettuce and tomatoes.  Outstanding freshness and taste!  Also, the portions are generous enough that most will take a to go box.

Overall, our experience with the staff has been generally positive. However, several times, they've (either the wait staff or the chefs) made mistakes (overcooking beef on two occasions or missing meal items) on our orders.  On our latest visit for dinner a couple of days ago, our sever was talking with some guests that were apparently her friends.  We had to wait several minutes to get her attention. This happened twice and was a bit annoying the second time.  No problem with wait staff being friendly to patrons, just remember, you have other guests in your area that may need attention during their meals as well.

Overall, Nando's is a very good Mexican restaurant, one that I'm sure we'll enjoy for years to come.
