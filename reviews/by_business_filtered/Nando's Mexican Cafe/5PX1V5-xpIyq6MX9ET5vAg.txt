This new Mesa location (about 2 weeks old as of this writing) is kind of quirky.  It's situated right on the South side of McDowell road across from Red White & Brew.  I often drive by and glance at the folks sitting outside.  

We chose the porch as well, which was goodly-sized and equipped with hanging lights and a flat screen TV.  Must be nice at night.  I'm not sure if they have misters but Red White & Brew does.

The interior is spacious and the bar looks comfy with many screens, but it's not a super big bar, just very simple.  The restaurant has a chain feel, but the staff are very friendly and the food options were plentiful.

I ordered the spinach enchilada lunch special (really nice) while my sister got the bean and cheese burro (it's big).  Even the kids' meals seem large in portions.  They offered my nephew a "kids menu" but it was really a piece of paper and two crayons (orange and purple - Go Suns!) on which to color.  (The regular menu includes the kids menu).  Mixed drinks looked pricey but beer seemed reasonable.

The food comes fast, tastes great and the restaurant is very comfortable.  This would be a good stop before heading up to the Salt River to do some tubing.  Definitely coming back!
