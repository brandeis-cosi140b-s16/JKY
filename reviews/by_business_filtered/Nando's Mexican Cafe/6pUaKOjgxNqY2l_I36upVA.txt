The line took forever which i don't mind figuring my first time there it would be great food.....low and behold the salsa taste like heinz ketchup...my sonoran chicken sandwich was dry and it took forever. The only positive thing I will say about this place is that they did have good service...very friendly....My first toime there will be my last!!!
