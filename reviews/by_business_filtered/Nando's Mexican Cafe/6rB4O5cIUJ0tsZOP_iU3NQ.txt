PLEASE keep in mind I worked at an authentic Mexican restaurant where we home made EVERYTHING, so my taste buds have been exposed to REAL and AWESOME food. 

The atmosphere is absolutely enjoyable, the patio being very romantic and peaceful. Our queso dip was really good, mixed with several different flavors. Service was plentiful and pleasant.

However, the meals were disappointing. My chicken tacos at first bite honestly disgusted me, and that is hard to do. The shells were pre-made and not hot as if they'd just been placed in the fryer. The sour cream was thick and bulky, as though it came from a store bought container, and the chicken was absolutely disgusting. It was neither not nor seasoned. I took 3 mouthfuls and for the first time in my life lost my appetite. 

Perhaps I chose the wrong dish to order? I may give it another go but I was very disappointed :( However, our server did take the dish off being that I didn't touch anything else on the plate which I found to be good service.
