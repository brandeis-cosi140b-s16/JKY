I love this place my fav go to mexican. Service is always great. Watch for prime nights or you will be waiting awhile. Todays lunch hour was great, not busy at all.  I ordered the enchilada n taco plate.. must remind myself not to order anything but the mini platter.  I love the mini sizes. I would normally give 5 stars but today my taco wasn't up to par..was left in fryer too long cuz my meat was all fried and it left such an odd taste..usually they r always on point n delish.. so for today you loose a point. Was my birthday lunch too. I'm from San Diego..so trust me when I say if you want good mexican food in Phx..go to Nandos.
