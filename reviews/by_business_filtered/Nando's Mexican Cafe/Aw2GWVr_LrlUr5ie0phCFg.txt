This Mexican joint is legit.  I moved here from Southern California (little Mexico) and I couldn't find anything I thought was good authentic Mexican until I found Nando's. Normally I get the mesquite steak tacos but also will get a chicken taco w chicken enchilada plate. I'm super stoked that they expanded to Chandler. Not sure why they have an overall 4 star rating. I read the other reviews and all that gave 4 stars had nothing but positive things to say??? Anyhow, I've had multiple things to eat here and all were great and the chips and salsa are as good as any! I eat here a few times a month.
