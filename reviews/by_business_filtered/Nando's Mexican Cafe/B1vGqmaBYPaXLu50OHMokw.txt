Nothing unique about the place other then you get alot of food for the price.  Dishes are pretty messy and covered in cheese but tasty.  Not the healthiest place to eat and nothing creative about the foood but if your on a tight budget and want to pig out, I'd choose this place.  Good place for friends to hang out, I'd like to try the margaritas.
