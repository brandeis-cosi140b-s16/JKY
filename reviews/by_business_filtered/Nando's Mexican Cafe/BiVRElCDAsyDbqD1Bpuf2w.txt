WOW!!! I have been to the other 2 locations in the valley but I love the Ambiance of this location, beautiful interior with a lot of beautiful tile work. 
The food is excellent, from the chips to the salsa, we had the Baja Shrimp Salad. It was huge with 10 seasoned and grilled shrimp with avocado, onions, cheese, tomato, creamy Jalape√±o dressing, the creamy Con Queso dip with chips, loaded with flavor, and the fried ice cream with honey and chocolate  sauce. That was huge too. The staff is friendly, the owner very nice and the food orders come out fast.
I am a regular,only Mexican restaurant I like.
