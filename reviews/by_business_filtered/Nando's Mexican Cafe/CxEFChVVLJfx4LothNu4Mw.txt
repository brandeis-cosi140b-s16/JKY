Best nandos ever! The food is SO good! We went out to dinner with friends and our server was Charlene and I have to say she's probably the best server I've ever had in my life. She kept our drinks full the entire time and our friend spilled a little salsa on his shorts and she brought him a napkin and a separate glass of water to clean it off without even seeing it or him asking for it. She even labeled our to go box with what was in it and today's date. She's amazing!!!
