Yesterday while visiting a neighboring restaurant for a latte, I noticed Nando's. The restaurant itself is nice however Nando's needs to raise the bar on their food; quite bland, full of cheese and lacked dimension. I ordered the spinach enchiladas and added shrimp (up charge). I found two bites of spinach in the beginning and the portion size (small) was a surprise. I had added a mango margarita and was so-so. Guess I've been spoiled by La Casa Blanca (Chandler).

I visited Nando's in hopes to bring a work group activity here.
