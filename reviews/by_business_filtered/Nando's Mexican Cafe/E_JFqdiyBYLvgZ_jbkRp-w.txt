This is one of my new favorite places in Chandler for Mexican food! Even if it didn't have great service food and drinks, the restaurant is beautiful! The patio is amazing, decorated with lights and wrought iron fencing. Very rustic and old world Mexico. Large pillars, tile work, stone and old wood everywhere. Great ambiance. But I do love the food! Not your typical combo #6 with beans and rice! They have fish tacos, pork verde and steak entrees. The appetizers, like the Mexican pizza, is enough for dinner! I like their nachos, piled high and loaded with fresh ingredients. I usally grab a taco plate of some kind. The carnitas are amazing! They have a great tequila selection and happy hour specials too. The bartender offered me up a sample of their habanero tequila. Which is just a blanco tequila in a large jar with habanero chilis! Ay Carumba!! Careful with this one kids! It's not meant to be  a shot! The servers are friendly but not the best or fastest I've had. The bartenders I know, Mike and Gary are very helpful and friendly. Overall nice place for good Mexican food where the chips, salsa and margaritas flow!
