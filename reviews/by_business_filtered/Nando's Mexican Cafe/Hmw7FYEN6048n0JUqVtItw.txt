We had a business lunch on Friday, they were so busy, but we got in the restaurant  and got seated very fast. We were waited on very promptly. They have such good, tasty mexican food better than  I have had in a long time. We had four adults and ate for around $10.00 a piece. The portions were so big that we ate our leftovers that night for supper.

This place has three other chain restaurants around the Phoenix area, you won't be disappointed. Very good, lots of cheese, tasty try it you will like it.
