One of our local favorite hangouts. Fajitas are very good, pollo rico is amazing. Always plenty of chips and salsa. The perfect storm margarita is one of the best margaritas I've had north of the Mexican border, period. Above average Tequila selection, especially for a place that is restaurant first and bar second. Wait staff is friendly and prompt, but don't always know the menu. Manager is very good and often comes by to check on guests or drop off a complimentary shot of anejo ;)
