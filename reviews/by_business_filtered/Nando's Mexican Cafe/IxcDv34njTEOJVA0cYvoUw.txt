Really craving good nachos so my husband ordered my nachos and his chirizo burrito to go and after arriving he waited 20 mins which is longer than I'm sure it takes to make said items so calling ahead is a waste. The burrito was tiny with the slightest amount of filling with a little shredded lettuce garnish, lovely and my nachos were inedible as the thick layer of cheese on top had been so over cooked it now had the texture of  car tires mmmm yum and everything under was grease soaked and lacked cheese. The worst part is the have zero contact nformation so I can't even tell them how miserable their food is.
