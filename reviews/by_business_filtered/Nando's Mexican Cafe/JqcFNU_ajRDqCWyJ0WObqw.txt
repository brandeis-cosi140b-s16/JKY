I finally found a second fav Mex place to dine. My first is Rito's in Phoenix . I grew up in el paso, tx & know good well executed Mex food & Nando's  
Cuts the mustard. There are few good Mex places to eat here in Phoenix. I'm so thrilled to have found Nando's. I had the #9 plate. I pray they expand into Phoenix and the west valley
