I really wish they had a Nando's in California where I live! It's the best Mexican food I've had! So good, I crave there enchiladas and rice and beans and chips and salsa ect.   good service. Great food. Decent prices. Also, if you like cheeseburgers, they have the Nando's Burger, it's one of the best burgers ever! Go, go, go
