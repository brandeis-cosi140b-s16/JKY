The food came out hot, and it was plentiful. I agree that Nando's uses too much cheese (and I am an avid cheese lover!). I prefer less heavy, more fresh-tasting Mexican than this. The food wasn't bad; it just was too cheesy/too salty. The chips were horrible, however (lacked taste and were not warm or crispy). I liked that the server put a pitcher of water on the table because I drink a lot of water with my meals, and I hate to flag down a server for multiple water refills. However, I think the pitcher was an excuse for the server to be non-existent during our meal. I don't like a server to hover, but I do expect someone to check if my food is to my satisfaction or to ask if I need anything else during the meal. Ironically, two servers did start to hover when we lingered too long after finishing our meal. I would probably come here again because the price is reasonable, and the food was prepared decently. I just wouldn't expect anything out of the ordinary with the food or service.
