I was not impressed with this place.  The salsa was horrible.  Bland.  Tasteless.  Watery.  Like tomato sauce...or juice.  Food was nothing special either.  Even the margaritas left a lot to be desired.  Service was a little on the slow side and their patio is depressing.  I'm not sure why so many people like this place.  There are way better Mexican restaurants out there.  We won't be back.
