Ok...It's not Los Dos...(you know what I am talking about).  It's not El Charro or Blue Adobe.  It's the best thing we got in NE Mesa.  Never fail....get the cheese crisp. They know how to do a cheese crisp.  Yes, the salsa is ok, but drink more cerveza's.  My brother is a chef....for some reason he like the green chili burro's...he's been gone for over 5+......so that might have skewed his judgement.  The place is inviting, definitely a neighborhood place.  Make sure to tell them go light on the sweet n sour mix...other than that, the marg's are good.  The portions are huge.  You will not leave hungry here.  Salute!
