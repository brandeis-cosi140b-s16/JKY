This location in Gilbert is awful. I'm a regular at the Nando's in Mesa (McDowell) they have the Gilbert location beat hands down. 

I ordered take out, I called in, right? I got put on hold twice- once right as I said "take out" next was because I have no clue, she said "hold on I have to get management approval". I ordered simple items- 2 bowls of red chili, tortillas, lunch special A (enchilada and taco with rice & beans), side of rice, and a pint of hot sauce with chips. Needs no approval right? Had me wondering at least. Well I got to the restaurant and it was pretty dead- 2 employees working only. But they bothed seemed friendly. My ordered didn't take to long but what surprised me was when the guy came out with a box. Normally it's bags, instead my order was in a box... The problem with this location is the FOOD. The enchilada sauce is salty, the salsa is bland and tastes bad, even the hot sauce is bad, red chili meat is tough and orangish color, and finally the shredded beef taco is drier than a bone! I was extremely disappointed. I've never had a bad meal at that Nando's in Mesa. But it's my fault for trying this location.  Never again!!

The main difference between Gilbert and Mesa location- if you go in at the same time (let say 3pm) Mesa will have 7 people working. Gilbert will probably just have 2. Gilbert location didn't even have a bartender (happy hour is 3-6pm).
