If you like mexican food, this will become one of your favorite mexican joints.. and actually if you like cheeseburgers, they have the Nandos Burger, it is AMAZING! 1 of the best I've ever had!! I'm a big ranch dressing fan too, and it's Sooo good! Great mexican & American food together. I think that's pretty awesome myself. Always get either cheese enchiladas & rice & beans (because that's my favorite and the red sauce is exactly my style) or the Nandos Burger, (because it is mouthwatering)
