After reading a lot of good reviews for Nandos's, we decided to try it out back in April with high hopes of a very tasty meal.

Well.....that didn't happen. Like most Mexican food places, we started off with chips and salsa. The salsa was extremely bland. Would not be surprised if I found Costco sized bottles of Pace in the trash bin. Even went so far as to try out the Habanero salsa in hopes of a good spice. Tasted a little better than the regular but was still not spicy at all. Major disappointment.

But not as sad as our dinner. We decided to split the El Jefe Chicken Chimichanga. Like the salsa, was flavorless, filled with onion, and no spice. And the chicken looked and tasted like Fry's $5 rotisserie chicken after two microwave reheats. Depressing... Only redeeming quality was the atmosphere and satisfactory service. May give Nando's another try but won't be holding my breath.
