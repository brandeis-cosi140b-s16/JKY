Alexis and I have eaten great Mexican food!   We remember when Mi Amigos was good.  Garcia's the restaurant that all others were compared against.  It has been a long time and we have eaten at a lot of places trying to find a replacement.  Nando's is not only the replacement but we have stopped looking for great Mexican food.   We have found it.  

I could spend hours describing how good each one of the dishes we have tried is.  Instead we will state that there has no dishes that weren't just great!  Our favorite is the the Chile Con Queso Dip.

Anyhow, good food, great people, great restaurant.
