Went there on a friday night at 9PM.  I think it closed at 10PM so not really a night place. The chips and salsa are terrible.  The expensive margaritas are so-so, still tastes like they don't use fresh limes even though they say they do. So far not so good, but the service was great.

Second time there got a carne asada burrito off lunch menu.  Tasted great and definitely filling.  

Went there the third time for breakfast, but was disappointed with the menu.  Seemed more like American food than Mexican.  Coffee was good though, and so was the service.
