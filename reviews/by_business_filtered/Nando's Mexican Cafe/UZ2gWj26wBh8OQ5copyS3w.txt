Pretty good Mexican joint.

Margaritas are good and decently sized. I had the Chicken Chimi which was very good. They did mess up the order (added sour cream when I requested none) and offered to replace it, however at that point I didn't want to wait for them to remake it as the rest of the table's food had arrived.

Not my first choice for Mexican in Chandler but would go again given it's convenient location to my apartment.
