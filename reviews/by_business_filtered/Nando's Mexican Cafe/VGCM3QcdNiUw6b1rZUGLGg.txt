Great local spot and hearty portions of Mexican food. 
Can't go wrong with a tasty margarita in this 100 degree weather. 
The chicken chimichanga has huge chunks of white meat chicken. They don't opt for the cheaper dark meat alternative. 
I'm a sucker for really good salsa and this place delivers. 
Overall it's a good place to go and grab a drink after work, some good food and unwind on the patio.
