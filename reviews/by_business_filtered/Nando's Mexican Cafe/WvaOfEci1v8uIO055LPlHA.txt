A lot of my restaurant reviews are 4 stars - I wish they had 4.5 and 3.5.  This is a great place, a little hidden behind the car wash, but it is where locals come to eat with their families a lot.  huge portion sizes and traditional sit down Mexican food.  Nothing about this place seems "WOW!" but you find yourself going back there again and again.  That is an endorsement all it's own I suppose.
