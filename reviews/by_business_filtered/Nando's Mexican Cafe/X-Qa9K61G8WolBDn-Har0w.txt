I am In Love.

We had the spinach enchilada and the pollo rico, lunch portions. There was enough to take home. Really good, all the right flavors and textures.

I had the Heat Wave Margarita, SPICY but oh so good. Be warned it is spicy.

Service was excellent, fast and accurate. Good job Maria. 

And that is all I am gonna say about our experience.
