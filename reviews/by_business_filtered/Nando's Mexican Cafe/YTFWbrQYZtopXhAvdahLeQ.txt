My husband and I were hungry for tacos and we really enjoy Nando's.  It was a beautiful night so we sat outside on the patio.  Yes.....me....I sat outside.  LOL   I don't care for real hot salsa and theirs is perfect for me.  Their shredded beef is flavorful and moist.  The only negative I have with this place is every time I have been there the wait staff is not a friendly as I would like and they do not make eye contact.  That is a pet peeve of mine.
