We arrived here at about 3:45pm and waited about 5 min for someone to even greet us meanwhile there was about 10 ppl in the restaurant.  The hostess came up and we asked for a table not a booth and she said "ok, I have one in the bar or outside". So we went over to the bar area and the two tables were dirty, she then stated "oh they are dirty so all I have is outside!" REALLY when it's 105 outside! I asked if she could clean it and she said "that's not my job I don't clean the tables" WOW! We left and went to another place that actually cares about their customers!!!
