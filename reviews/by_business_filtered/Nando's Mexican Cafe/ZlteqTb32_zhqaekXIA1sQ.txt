Celebrated a family member's birthday here last night. A place she's been wanting to try for a while and I'd never heard of before. Our party consisted of 20+ people and I must say we all could not have had a better time. The food was great - I tried the Pollo Rico and my wife had the Mesquite Tacos - excellent!. What gets the 5th star is our amazing waitress, Charlene. Even with our large party she was attentive and managed to keep our drinks full and she got our orders out quickly and took very good care of us until our party ended - and this, on a very busy Saturday night. We will definitely be back and highly recommend Nando's!
