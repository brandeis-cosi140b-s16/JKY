Very big sizes.  I recommend getting a takeout box, you will have extra! The food is very tasty and very delicious.  Service is always great! This isn't the most authentic of Mexican foods, but they have a great menu and great infusion of different styles.  There is typically a wait on the weekends, but well worth the wait.  This has become a regular spot.  I suggest the Del Mar enchiladas, but I have had a lot on the menu.  You will enjoy.  I promise!
