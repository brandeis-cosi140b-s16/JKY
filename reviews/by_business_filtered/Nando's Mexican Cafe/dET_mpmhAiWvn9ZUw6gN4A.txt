I have to agree with Eric.  It was decent food, but not even close to the best mexican food I've ever had.  I would eat there again, but I wouldn't go out of my way to do it.  It wouldn't be a destination for me anyway.

My mom-in-law and sis-in-law love it, I didn't find anything to write home about.
