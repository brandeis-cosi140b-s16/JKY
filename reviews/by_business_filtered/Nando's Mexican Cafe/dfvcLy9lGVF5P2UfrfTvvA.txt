The food at Nandos is phenomenal. The portions and the size of the plate will fill you up guaranteed. I've only discovered this place a few months ago, but out of any Mexican restaurant I have visited, Nandos easily takes the number one spot of my favorite place to eat. Also, the service they provide is excellent. I have never had to call my waiter or waitress over to ask for a refill, and my requests for extra hot sauce was fulfilled the minute it was requested. 

The prices are high when compared to the other Mexican restaurants I have visited, but if you come from 11 AM to 4 PM you can order the lunch specials, which I recommend big time. I have never had a bad experience when I visited Nandos, and I am sure I never will.
