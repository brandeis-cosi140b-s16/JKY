I recently discovered Nando's in Gilbert on an unexpected drive by.  Needless to say...when they opened the one they built directly behind my house, I was thrilled.  The food is unbelievable.  I have been dying for a good Mexican place that makes me happy...and I found it, finally!!! I am a chips and salsa-aholic, and this place doesn't disappoint.  Salsa could be spicier, but I have a small child and he loves it, and the flavor is so great, I could drink it.  Yum.  They do bring a small container of spicier salsa, and it is good enough for me.  They didn't get 5 stars from me simply based on the fact that the children's meals are completely over priced.  $4.95...not too bad, however that is without a drink or options.  $2.75 for a lemonade for a kid is ridiculous on top of the $5 for food.  Ugh!  Also, my son loves the grilled cheese (it is big) but he would much rather have the carrots and celery with ranch offered with the wings than the 5 pounds of french fries they put on his plate that go to waste.  (Hope the owners read these!).

That being said...I have to say...one of the most delicious things I have ever eaten...and would recommend to everyone is....the PIZZA BLANCO!!!! OMG.  Enough said.  It is big enough for four people (wish they would offer a smaller serving!). Two can order...it does heat up great.    I did venture past it and get a chicken quesadilla this time...just as amazing.  It is a tortilla with cheese and chicken for goodness sake, how can it be so good??? What does this place put on it's chicken??? I actually think the chickens walk into the kitchen and just surrender because they know how damn good they are going to taste after they are grilled!!!! KUDOS to Nandos. :)   Even better, I can drink too much and walk home!  I recommend the Prickly Pear and the Huckleberry margaritas!
