Yum! Yum! Yum!  

Friends introduced us to this place - they're regulars and we may be too.  It's a hidden place, but once you find it you are welcomed into a gorgeous restaurant with plenty of space.  

They have a good sized drink menu, and my first "Yippee!" happened when I saw they had choices for margaritas that didn't include syrup and sweetness that you can get with margarita mixes.  I could actually taste (and later feel!) the tequila.  

My second "Yippee!" happened when I was informed that the Chile con Queso was (gasp) vegetarian!  It was absolutely delicious and hot and if I wasn't watching my athletic figure I would have chowed down on it and the thick chips that go with it.  

My third "Yippee!" happened when I saw black beans on the menu.  Black beans that are lard free!  My black bean and cheese burrito was amazing - not too greasy, just the right amount of cheese.  They also had more vegetarian choices, and I'll have to try the Spinach Enchiladas one of these days.  

Loved everything about this place - will definitely be back!  But not on Tuesdays, since I'm not interested in seeing kids eating free.
