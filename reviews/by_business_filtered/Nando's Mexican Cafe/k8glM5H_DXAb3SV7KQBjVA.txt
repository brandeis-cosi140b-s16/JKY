This place is disgusting!  We went here twice on a work lunch. Last year everything was fine, the food was good. It was the first good Mexican food I had in a while.  This experience, however... NOT GOOD! I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO THIS PLACE. 
First off, there was dried food in my water glass.  My co-worker who sat next to me had something stuck to his fork, so he exchanged it out for different silverware and the new set had cheese still attached to the knife. I was repulsed.
We got our food and I ordered chimichangas.  They were gross!  The ground beef on the inside was tasteless, not even salt or pepper... nothing.  When I cut it open water, grease, or some liquid poured out.  I can't believe that someone would serve that quality of food and charge the prices they were charging.
I will not eat here again even if it is a work lunch and is paid for.  I would rather fill up on chips and salsa and not even order a main entree.
