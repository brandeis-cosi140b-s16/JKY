THE NANDOS ON MCDOWELL IS 10X BETTER!!!!

I love the food, truly do, but the service at this location is most certainly 5 points under where it should be. We were taking our friends to dinner to share with them some very important news on a Saturday. We arrived at 6:30 and checked in for a party of 6, was told it'd be a 25 minute wait. At 7:00 I decided to check and see how much longer and was told that my party was already seated. I informed the little hostess that we were not, we were all outside, and she blankly stared at me in disbelief. I asked how much longer and she said probably another 25 minutes. They had my name written down along with what shirt I was wearing and I at no point saw another women with a blue striped tank top arrive with a party of 6 so I demanded to see the manager. Instead of getting the manager she went and got the bartender, who was by no means apologetic for their obvious mistake. Nothing was done or suggested to try and make up for their error and we were left going across the street to Chipotle. I will NEVER be returning to the Gilbert Nando's again.
