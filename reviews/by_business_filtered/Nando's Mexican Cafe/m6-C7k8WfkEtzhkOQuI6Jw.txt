The salsa here at Nandos was amazing.  I usually make great judgement with the salsa, as I pour a ton of salsa all over my main entrees.  I do not do it because the food lacks flavor, but I do it because I love salsa just that much.  I ordered the Jalapeno Chicken Soup.  I wasn't terribly hungry and I banked on eating a lot of chips and salsa to fill up.  The soup was okay.  I was happy it was white meat chicken, but it lacked some flavor.  I tried some of my friend's rice and beans, and it was a little too salty for my liking.  I will have to give this another try and maybe my ratings might improve a little.
