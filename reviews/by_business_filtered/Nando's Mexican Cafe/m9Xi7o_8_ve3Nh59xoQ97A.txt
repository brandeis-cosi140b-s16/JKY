We love Nandos. It is the best food EVER!! It is just a little local joint in Gilbert if you blink you would probably pass it, but we just went to there new location on Power/Mcdowell and it was impossible to miss. Our family are huge fans of their original store, but their second store was even better than the first. The Spinach Con Queso is amazing! The fajitas are big enough for a family of 4 to share NOT KIDDING! The kids meals are enormous and the best part we have found that we can go any day of the week if we bring an A paper or A report card our kids get a free meal. Our family loves this restaurant we go at least 4 times a week. The best part is the staff is the same everytime. They get to know our kids and are just so kind! Thanks to Nandos for opening this awesome establishment in our neighborhood! oh yeah great margaritas too
