Very bland and flavorless. My husband got the fish tacos. The mahi mahi was very very dry. The beans were gross, like they came from a can. The rice was very plain. I got the chicken chimichanga. It was pure chicken wrapped in fried dough, no seasonings, no veggies, and not marinated. Even the salsa was bland! The mild taste more like marinara and the hot was just bitter. The only food they got right was the chips. Even overheard another table state they thought their food had turned bad. 

Our sever was nice but he checked in on everyone else, and not once did he check in with us. Overall this was a lacking experience, it did not satisfy any of our Mexican cravings. It's better to drive a mile south to Serrano's.
