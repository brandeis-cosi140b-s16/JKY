Had combo steak/chicken fajitas - lunch portion.  Fantastic!  One of the best plates of fajitas I've had.  Only problem - the $10 lunch portion is HUGE!  Enough for two meals!  Ended up here as Tia what's her name is closed in Mesa now.  Great alternative!

Great service, great prices, and great food.  What more can you ask?
