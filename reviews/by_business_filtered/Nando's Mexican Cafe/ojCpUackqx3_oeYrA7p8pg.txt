I was excited to try this place based on what my friends have told me and what I read on Yelp.  I decided to take the family out to dinner this past Saturday.  We arrived around 5:30PM thinking it would not be that busy and that we would have a short wait, boy was I wrong.  The place was packed and we were told there was a 40-45 minute wait and due to the excitement of wanting to try this place we waited and waited and waited some more.  After 60 minutes of waiting we were finally seated and our waiter was very friendly and took care of our needs.  The food was a small step above Serrano's with the salsa being a little bland for my taste.

I did a little research after eating here and would recommend calling ahead to get your name on the waiting list no matter what time you plan on visiting and ask your waiter for the hotter hot sauce if you don't find the salsa they bring to the table hot enough.

I will probably give this place another shot down the road.
