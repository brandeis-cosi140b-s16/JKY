Food is excellent.  Service needs some work.

The food was excellent.  There were three people in my party, and all three enjoyed their food.  

The service, however, was mediocre.  Perhaps our server was new and inexperienced, but he started taking our order, then abruptly left our table to go to another table across the room to answer their question.  Right in the middle of taking our order!  Once our order was in, he was okay.  But, we had to wait several minutes after we were finished eating before he brought the check.  Then, after leaving the credit card, he disappeared.  After 25 minutes, we got up to leave and had to find the hostess to let her know we were still waiting for our bill to come back.  As we were talking, our server came with our check.  (Apparently, they had accidentally thrown away our gift card and had to fish it out of the trash...)

We will probably go again because of the food, but hope they step their training of servers...
