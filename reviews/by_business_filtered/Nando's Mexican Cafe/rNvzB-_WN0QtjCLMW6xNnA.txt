I have been to Nando's several times over many years and I can't think of one time where I've left disappointed. Their pollo rico is my favorite dish that they serve. The staff is always attentive and friendly. If you go make sure you ask for the flour chips when they bring you the corn ones...love them! As for areas that I dislike: 1. The parking can be lacking which leads me to 2. There can sometimes be a lengthy wait depending on when you go. Guess that's a good problem to have :)
