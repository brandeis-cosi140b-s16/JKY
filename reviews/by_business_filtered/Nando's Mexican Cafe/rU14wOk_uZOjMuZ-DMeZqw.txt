Arrived on a busy Saturday night, on a double date with some friends. 
Waited about 15-20minutes, the place was buzzing! 

Ambiance was so cute, dimmed lighting with twinkle lights everywhere!! 

Chips and salsa were the best!!!!!  Ugh! Can't say it enough, I could've probably drank that stuff! 

We promptly received our drinks & ordered. 
My husband ordered a chicken chimichanga 
I ordered the flautas combo with rice & beans. 

We loved our meals, his chimichanga was stuffed and flavorful 
My flautas were stuffed with meat & topped with guac, fresh tomatoes, lettuce, cheese & sour cream
Mmmmm so much happening there I couldn't even finish the 2nd one!!! Yummmmmmm

However, our party was all in the agreement that the rice and beans were horrifying 
Beans were dried out (like they've been sitting in pan or heating lamp for hours) & the rice was bland with no flavor
The one downfall of the whole meal, a bit disappointed 

The service was wonderful and so was were the entrees, so we will be back!
