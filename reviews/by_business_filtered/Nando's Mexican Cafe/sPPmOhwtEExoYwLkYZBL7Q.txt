I just will NOT eat here anymore. Tonight was the breaking point for my family at Nando's. 

We live close by and have come here often over the last couple years but continually have come away not feeling well after eating. The chips/salsa is good but the food is so damn SALTY and GREASY!!!. 

My wife ordered a plate of grilled vegies to try and eat healthy...they came out looking brown and slippery cause of all the soy sauce and butter. She even requested to have them cooked with low salt and low butter...didn't help. 

They smoother many of the dishes in so much cream cheese and cheddar that you know your belt will fit tighter the next day. We ordered the chicken taco pizzza from here a while back and both of us threw up VIOLENTLY that night. My wife was so sick she had to go to urgent care and get hooked up on an IV. This is a true story. 

Even a simple muchaca burro, not deep fried, isn't clean or healthy. It is so SALTY you can't get the sodium taste out of your mouth for hours later. GUESS WHAT...Nando...yes the man who created the restaurant...he recently had a QUADRUPLE BYPASS HEART SURGERY...because he "liked his food salted heavy" and probably greasy too.. This was explained to me by the people who work at Nando's. This is true facts. 

The food does taste good here for the first bite or two, but then it just makes you feel bad when you leave. Sorry Nando's, I have thrown you away. My body rejects you.
