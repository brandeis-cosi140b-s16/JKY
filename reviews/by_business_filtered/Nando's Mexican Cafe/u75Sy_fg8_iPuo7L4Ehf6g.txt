Yum!!! 

When our friends were trying to think of a Mexican place to take us for dinner they asked us questions like, "do you guys like spicy food?" and "do you guys like cheese?" The cheese won!!

I had the spinach enchiladas and the bf had some sort of chicken thing, chicken rito maybe. All covered in cheese!! The rice and beans were excellent and the amount of food was insane! We all took home a box filled with enough food for 4 people. The margaritas were also very good. Oh, I cannot forget the chips. They were hot and fresh and severed with delicious salsa.
