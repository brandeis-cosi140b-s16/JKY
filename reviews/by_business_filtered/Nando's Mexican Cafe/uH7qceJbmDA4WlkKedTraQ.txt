I've really done my best to give this place a try, but it just hasn't been good for me ...

I've been three times now, on a Tuesday night during the peek of rush, a slightly slower Thursday night and a Saturday lunch.

All three times I've had service that was adequate but not amazing. I have much better luck in the dining room than the time I sat at the bar. There were two bartenders on but they seemed to barely be interested in the customers at the bar.

The food has always been, in a word, salty. There's some decent flavor in a few items, but everything from the beans to sauce was always punctuated by a strong salt taste. The worst of it was the Sonoran Enchiladas, which were highly recommended but almost inedible.

The menu is packed with items, and given a thousand recommendations by a thousand monkeys, i'm sure there is a great dish to be had there, but I just haven't found it in my try's and would rather take myself further down the road than this convent spot around the corner.

I do have to give credit where credit is due - It's an amazing building. The bathroom's are well kept, the patio looks great, and the ambiance is great.
