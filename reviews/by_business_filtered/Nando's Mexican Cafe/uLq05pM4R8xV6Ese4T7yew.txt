Chips and salsa are some of the best I've had in AZ.  The house margarita was decent, also.
 
Service was fine.  The booths are small and really close together, so you'll be staring at the guy facing you in the adjacent booth.  Lunch overall was decent, but underwhelming.  My burrito was nothing special, and they didn't have great lunch prices.
