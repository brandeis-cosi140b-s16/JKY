Definitely going back for more. The chips were unexpectedly good. I was surprised at just how much food they give you, especially at lunch. . I had the Spinach Enchiladas which were perfect. The white sauce was good, and it was not too heavy for lunch. Everyone else enjoyed their food as well. 

Also I saw the nachos at another table. They were huge and looked amazing. Also I spotted some kind of desert in a taco salad shell and chocolate nachos. I hope someone else orders it and lets us know how it is. 

The wait staff was very attentive. (The fact that Fox News was filming there could have had something to do with it.) She warned us that the portions were large, and she was not kidding. Make sure to have room in your fridge for left overs- even when ordering from the lunch menu. Oh and parking was so much better than at red White and Brew.
