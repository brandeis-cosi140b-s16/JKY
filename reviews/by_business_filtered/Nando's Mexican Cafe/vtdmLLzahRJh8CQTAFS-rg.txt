My favorite part is multiple vegetarian options, this trip I enjoyed spinach enchiladas, not the best I've ever had but very good.  Service was pretty good, I didn't love that we were seated in the bar all by ourselves during a very slow lunch time.

I don't care for the salsa, it's sort of neat that you can add the hot sauce to blend your own heat, since I love heat but I also have a 2 year old who loves salsa.  It was nice to mix him a bowl of a more low key temp and a hot one for use.  Outside of that though the flavor is really lacking, you'll find superior salsa just about anywhere in the valley.  My mom and husband shared the mini combo app so they could get a feel for everything on the menu, they enjoyed it.  Again they said they'd had better but this was good.  

I think we'll return, I love a place that has vegetarian options, and black beans I can eat because they're not cooked in animal fat.  But I'm still on the hunt for better.
