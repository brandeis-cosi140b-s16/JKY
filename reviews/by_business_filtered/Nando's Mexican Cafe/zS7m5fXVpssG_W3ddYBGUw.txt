I had my first Nando's experience last night. The place is good. I would say this place falls above chain Mexican places,  but falls short of smaller independent places.

When we arrived we were told it would be a 30 minute wait for a table, but we were seated within 15 minutes.

The salsa served with the chips was ok, pretty bland if you ask me. 

The menu is pretty big and has many, many options to go with from the specialty plates to the combo platters.

The portions are very big. Half the party I went with took home over half their meal.

The food was above average. I had a healthy portion of beans, rice and the enchiladas were big. I do wish there was more red sauce. Most of the enchiladas were covered with cheese. I wasn't a fan of the onion inside my beef enchilada. I wish I knew about this before. Not a fan of chunk onions in my food.

My biggest complaint was the rice. The rice just didn't measure up to other mexican/spanish rice. Rice is one of my favorite things when eating Mexican. 

The service was very good. Our order was out quickly, sodas refreshed and bill all served quickly. 

You get good value for the good served here. Most plates were around $11-13

I can see myself going here in the future.
