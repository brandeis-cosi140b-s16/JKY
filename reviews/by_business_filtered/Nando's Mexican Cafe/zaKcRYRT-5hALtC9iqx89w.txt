I cannot believe it too me this long to eat here. I have eaten here twice and after the 2nd visit I am downgrading this from 4 stars to 3. 

Freshly made chips but the salsa is BAD. Whodathunk bad salsa at a Mexican place?

The cheese and green chili enchiladas are good but way too much cheese put on them plus way too much cheese on the nachos and its not nacho cheese which really makes the nachos really not very good.
