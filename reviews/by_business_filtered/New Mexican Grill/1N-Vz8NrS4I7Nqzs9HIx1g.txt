I've been eating here since they first opened and have always loved the food and service is good. A couple of weeks ago I had to work late so decided to call for take out.  I looked the number up on my phone and placed my order.  When I arrived the young man said he didn't have my order; he said "you probably called the Gilbert Rd store". He showed me the number and I had. So, I asked if he could make the order for me and he said; "no you ordered from the other one and you have to go there." I told him I live in the other direction and would call the other store to cancel and again he refused to make the order for me. He said "it will take you just as long to drive down Gilbert as it will for us to make it so go there". I was appalled!!! It was 8pm and I had just worked a 12 hour shift and now I had to go 3 miles out of my way.  I realize it was my mistake but the way I was treated was unacceptable. I always enjoyed going there for lunch; Ralph and the day staff are very pleasant but I won't go back.  Also, they now serve on paper plates and use plasticware.  Prices have risen, portions are smaller and now we have to eat on paper.....I don't think so!  I have many colleagues who feel the same; these prices are not fast food paper prices.  Good way to lose business; it's a shame that a great place is going downhill.
