We had Shredded Beef Tacos, Red Chile Beef Burro, and Quesadillas.  All were wonderful.  We went on opening day, had dinner.  They open at 7A for breakfast and I am seriously thinking about going back tomorrow morning.  Is it bad to eat at the same place twice within 12 hours?  I am really excited for this new establishment, can't wait to tour the menu!
