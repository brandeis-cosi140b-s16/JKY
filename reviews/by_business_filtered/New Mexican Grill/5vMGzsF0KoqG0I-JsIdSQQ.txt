This is a nice little spot. Homemade New Mexican style food is done well. Red sauce, green sauce, meats are all good. My usual meal here the past 5 or 6 visits has been the two enchilada plate. I like the pork with green sauce and beef with red. The chips are good. 3 different salsas to choose from, all with different characters to enjoy.

I don't understand why people give a 1 star review because they don't serve breakfast past a certain time or they have plastic utensils. I know it's a bummer if you wanted chorizo or something, but the food here is good regardless of what time you come. Counter employee changes are fairly frequent but I've never had any issues. $7-9 for a big plate of flavorful homemade food is a good value to me.

My family enjoys it and we've brought other families here and they're now regulars too. It's also one of the only places around to get good fry bread if you're into it.

Los dos Molinos and Richardson's aren't in this immediate area but NMG holds it's own in an easy and casual, value-oriented way. Yummy!

Check it out if you haven't been here. Hopefully you'll enjoy it, too!
