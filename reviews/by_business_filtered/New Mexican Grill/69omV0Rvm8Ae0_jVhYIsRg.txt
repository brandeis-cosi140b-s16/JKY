This place is great.  The Salsa is outstanding, and the verde pork is amazing.  I can understand why the place was busy, but the wait for my food was entirely too long.  The staff is friendly and always eager to help.

If you can catch this place when the crowds aren't so heavy, DO IT!!!  You will not regre it.
