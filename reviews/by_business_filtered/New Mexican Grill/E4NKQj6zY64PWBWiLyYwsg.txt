With a heavy heart I'm giving this place only three stars. I love their food, don't get me wrong. It's the level of customer service that really sucks. The kids working there have an attitude that makes you want to use some quality adjectives, throw the bird, and just walk out. Their damn good food has a hold on me. It's like an abusive relationship that I just can't walk out of. If they were to actually be friendly and stop acting like they're doing YOU the favor, this place would rock. Please! step up your game. You're killing me softly.
