Fantastic!!
Had the green chilie pork once and the pork chimichanga another time. Great.
And the salsa was amazing! The green salsa was the best I've ever had....just something about it. And the second time (not so much on the first) the pico was awesome.
One of the few things I found in Phoenix area worth writing home about!
