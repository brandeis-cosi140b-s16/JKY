Review based on breakfast only

The good:
Pork and green chili very good
Decor fits the concept

The Bad:
No complimentary chips till 11am. Even though they have them sitting right there in the kitchen. 

No half and half for coffee only powdered creamer

No Mexican rice for breakfast. The potatoes they serve are bland and covered with cheese

Tacky handwritten notes on window blinds. See photos

Cashier who takes the order doesn't know the menu thus creating confusion for the kitchen and customers. 

I'll probably return but take the food to go.
