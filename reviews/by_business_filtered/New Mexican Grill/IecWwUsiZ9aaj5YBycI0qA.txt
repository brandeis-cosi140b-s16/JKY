Been here several times and will continue to go back. I always love the food and so worth all the little qwerks of a small mom and pop restaurant. 

I wish they still served breakfast burritos all day.

It seems like every time I go there, they are closing a little earlier. And it's not uncommon for them to start closing up 30-minutes before the actual closing time, so plan ahead. If you call 15-minutes before they close, good luck getting someone to answer.

Would totally go 5 stars if not for those little things.
