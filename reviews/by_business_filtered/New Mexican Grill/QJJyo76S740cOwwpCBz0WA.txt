This place is great! I come here strictly for the fried bread. The staff is always welcoming and so is the environment. If I am ever unsure about what I want, the staff will offer sampling sauces, meat, Ect. The owner always come by my table and says hello and is always friendly. The food is extremely affordable, plenty and of course... Delicious!  I have actually arrived at other restaurants and got back in my car to come here... This place is so good I wrote this review before I finished my plate! Thanks NMG!
