I was a loyal patron of the Gilbert/Queen Creek location. New location is just as good with a little bit less seating. Food is so good here, you can tell they know what they are doing. Service is great. Frybread tacos are amazing as are the regular tacos. They will smother anything you want in red Hatch Chile sauce or green sauce. One of my favorite places for quick quality food.
