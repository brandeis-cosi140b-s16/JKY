Yummy!  I was in AZ in August and had a Navajo Taco in Cameron.  I have thought about that deliciousness ever since!  Finally I'm in AZ again and was on a mission to find me a Navajo Taco!  Lucky for me I found this place right here in Gilbert.  Ordered the machaca (shredded beef) fry bread, mmmmm just as good as I remembered.  Good food and good service...I will be back before I leave and I'll be thinking about this until the next time I visit Az.
