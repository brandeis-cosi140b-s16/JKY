I've got to give this place a 5 star! We drove from Maricopa to go furniture shopping and decided to stop here for lunch. The restaurant was clean and decorated nicely, and the staff was very friendly. My boyfriend had the carne asada burrito and I had the shredded chicken chimichanga. While we waited we helped ourselves to their chips and salsas. Now, I am very picky with chips and salsa, I really like fresh authentic Mexican food and can't stand things like pace picante and tostitos, sorry but no. The New Mexican Grill has awesome chips and salsa!!! Even though I usually like thinner chips, I really enjoyed theirs. Our food came out piping hot and everything was flavorful and moist, nothing was dried out, including the rice. Both the green and red hatch chilies were very tasty; i preferred the red and my boyfriend liked the green better. Also their prices were pretty fair so that's always a plus. We had an excellent experience and will absolutely be going back!
