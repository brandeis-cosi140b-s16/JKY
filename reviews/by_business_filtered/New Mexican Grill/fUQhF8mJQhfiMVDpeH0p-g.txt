We're from Albuquerque, so we're always on the lookout for good New Mexican food.  Several family members have been raving about this place for months, so I was excited to try it.  I was not disappointed.  I had the chimichanga with shredded beef and red chile.  It was amazing!  I tasted my sister's green chile enchiladas, and they were equally delicious.

The owner and his staff are very welcoming and friendly.  The seating area is somewhat limited, but the owner told us that he is working to add more seating in the future.  The only thing I would do differently next time is remember to buy some tortillas to take home for later.
