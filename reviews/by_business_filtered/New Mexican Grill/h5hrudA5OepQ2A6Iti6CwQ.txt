I lived in New Mexico for over 25 years and then moved to Washington state. I just moved back to the Southwest six weeks ago. I had really missed good New Mexican food and someone recommended this restaurant. I love it. They use Hatch chilies and their green sauce is so good. Love everything that I've eaten there and the prices are very reasonable. I could eat there every day!
