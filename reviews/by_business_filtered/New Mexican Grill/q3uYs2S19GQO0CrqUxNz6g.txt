Love the food. Hate the customer service. My husband and I decided to go there tonight. We arrived at 7:50 forgetting they closed at 8:00pm. We debated on leaving, but then saw that another couple walked in. So we walked in right behind them and saw that other couple was being able to order. So we stood in line and waited. An older lady stood by the counter and told us they were closed nothing else just "we are closed". Mind you the couple in front of us was still ordering. This service left a bad taste in our mouths. So if you come here be prepared to be treated badly. My suggestion to the business if you are closed then lock your doors!
