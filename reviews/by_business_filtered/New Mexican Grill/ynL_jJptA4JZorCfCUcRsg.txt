What a great lil spot! Even my kids choose this place for their normal quesadilla or bean burrito over all the rest! Everthing I have tried has been great. The Chile relleno is as good as it gets and it was hard for me to finally order something different. Then I discovered the green Chile stew! My only somewhat gripe is that the spiciness of it seems to be random. I like my food hot and have the tolerance for it but have had this same dish served mild and way spicey, a week apart. They could do without some of the hand written policies posted around like others said...but the food and the people are great.
