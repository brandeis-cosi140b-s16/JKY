Great place to eat outdoors.  They have tons of flavors of tortillas and give you some of their freshly made tortillas of the day with some sort of buttery spread complimentary before your meal.

The House Margarita is pretty excellent and you can refill your glass with the shaker they leave at your table.  Almost 2 glasses worth.

The outdoor area is filled with plants and trees and twinkling lights.  If you're in the mood for outdoor dining, this is a great option!
