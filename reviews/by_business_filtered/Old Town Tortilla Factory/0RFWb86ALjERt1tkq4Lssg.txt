My husband and I went for dinner this evening at the Old Town Tortilla Factory in Scottsdale.  We didn't know what to expect after reading some of the reviews.
We got right in and seated as soon as we got there. Water was brought to us as soon as we sat down.  Our waiter was excellent, very attentive.
We had the Carne De Fuego and the Pollo Margarita.  Both meals were great.  Food was well prepared and hot.
Thought the place, service and food were very good and would definitely go back.
