I cannot believe this place has such bad reviews! There are so many good things about this place! 

My co-worker suggested that I go here when traveling to Scottsdale for work. He really insisted. Then my other co-worker seperately decided to take me here because "it is the best Mexican food ever". He even claimed it is better than San Diego's Mexican, which I cannot agree with ;)

So, we went before I checked Yelp.... The patio is GORGEOUS. I took pictures, it was like a fairy tale land. The waitress was on top of it! Everything she suggested was awesome. We got the margarita that she said was the least sweet and oooh let me tell you, it was Uh-Mazing! She suggested the queso dip and that was another winner with nice big pieces of bean and tomato. I had the chicken enchiladas with green sauce. if you like enchiladas GO FOR IT!!! So Good.

One thing I will say is that it is a little pricey. Work was paying for it but I definitely wouldn't have gone all out like we did if I had to pay, call me cheap... whatever... hatas gonna hate!

And the dessert was... eh... ok. the deep fried banana... wish I woulda got the flan or cheesecake.
