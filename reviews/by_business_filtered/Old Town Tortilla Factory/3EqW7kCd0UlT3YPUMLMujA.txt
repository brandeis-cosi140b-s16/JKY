YUMMY!
Pretty sweet and simple. I haven't had the opportunity to dine in, but I hear the ambiance is great. We generally do take out when we work late nights, and the food hasn't disappointed me yet. 

The Nachos del Sol is great..
Tortilla chips topped with chorizo, pepperjack cheese, pico de gallo, guacamole,chipotle sour cream & jalapeno peppers with house salsa. (not appropriate for those sensitive to heartburn) 

A healthier approach would be  the Tequila lime salad with grilled chicken. The dressing is a great touch and the flavors just mix well w/ the chicken and greens.

Last but not least- you must try the Chicken Tortilla soup. Thick, and sooo good with the touch of avocado and sour cream. 

So next time you're looking for a different touch for take out- you should try Old Town Tortilla Factory
