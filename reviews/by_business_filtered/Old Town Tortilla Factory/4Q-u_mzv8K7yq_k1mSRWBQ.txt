I can't believe I have to give a star to this place in order to provide a review.

Had the worst restaurant experience, EVER, at this establishment.  The food was a nightmarish mess.  It was so bad it was hysterical!  Service was absolutely 3rd world!  The nerdy waitress had the nerve to overcharge our table $40.  The manager stumbled out bellowing, "What's your problem now?!" 

"FIRST OF ALL, we aren't pleased with the food and the waitress overcharged us." I retorted.

"Well get out, we're closing in 20minutes anyway!" he snickered.

Long story short --- this place is an overrated outhouse.
