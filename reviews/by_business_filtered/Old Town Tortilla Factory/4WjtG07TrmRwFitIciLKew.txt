Samantha was super interactive sweet and we connected right away pregger to pregger! She spoiled me and my husband aha  We order the nachos for an app, simple but tasty. I got shrimp tacos. Yum! The portions are huge so you def get your $s worth...You better believe we brought home two bags of left overs. Davy got the green enchiladas they were good not great, however I highly recommend the choc cake! Mmmm the cakes kinda dense but soo good! We will for sure come back to see her.
