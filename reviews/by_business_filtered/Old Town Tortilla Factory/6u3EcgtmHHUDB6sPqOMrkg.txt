It's in a pretty good location in DT Scottsdale, just slightly off the beaten path.  There's a large area outdoors for those nice fall/winter nights.  

The pros:  the bread (in this case tortilla) is really good.  It's served with a special tasty spread.

The cons: the rest of the food is pretty mediocre.  

Service was not so good for a slow night.  Waiter only came by about twice.
