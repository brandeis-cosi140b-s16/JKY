It's not bad and it's not great.  I definately don't think it's worth the price.. But, I get why people go here.  I guess I'm just one of those folks that doesn't need an expensive diner menu to feel that I am getting quality mexican food.  In addition to this, we were starving when we got there, so we wanted some chips and salsa, which we ended up paying for.. Which is fine and all, but I kinda like when those are complimentary..

The tortillas they had the night I was there were potato.  They were delicious.  I could have lived off of them, and the margaritas.  Which, btw, were a great price during happy hour. ($5)  I had an enchilada dish and it was good.  My boyfriend had a pasta dish, and it was also good.  All in all, what we ate was good.  That's all, just good.  If I go back, which I don't know if I will unless someone else suggests it, I'm going to live off the tortillas and margs..

Soo, overall, 5 stars for the tortillas, 4 stars for the margaritas, 3 stars for the service, and 2 stars for the food quality vs. price...
