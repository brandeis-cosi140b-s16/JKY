My roommate and I took his parents here while they were visiting. We were in the mood for Mexican. I couldn't believe I've lived so close to this hidden gem for so long and never knew it was there! The spacious patio area is great. A perfect setting for a date. The food was really good too and came is pretty large portions. We left full. The ONLY reason I did not give 5 stars was because my margarita tasted like it didn't have much alcohol in it. But overall a great experience. I highly recommend!
