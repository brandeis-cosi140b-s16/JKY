First night in town and we decided on Mexican food. This place was recommended by the concierge thus we tried it. The outdoor dining area is terrific but was awfully dark making reading the menu difficult. The menu items were more of an "upscale" selection. Our dinners were fantastic, but I would prefer some more traditional choices, as well.
