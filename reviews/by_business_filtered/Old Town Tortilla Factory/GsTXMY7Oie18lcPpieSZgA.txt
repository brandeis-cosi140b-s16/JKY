I expected tacos, tacos and more tacos..  What I ordered didn't even come with beans.  the tortilla du jour was spicy, and not amazing. However the food was pretty good.  One of our entrees was pasta, and it  was very good.  My Something Fuego, had far too many green peppers, and nothing to do with a taco.  Ok, I could have spent a lot more time reading the menu.  What I read was on Yelp, and I didn't get it.  Margarita was VERY good... at one of the lower priced drinks.  No meals in the bar
