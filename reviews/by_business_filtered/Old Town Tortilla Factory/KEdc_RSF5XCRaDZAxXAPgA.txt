This place was fabulous.  It was an hour and a half wait but in the meantime we tasted delicious Tequilas and they let us keep the super cool bottle!  
Had the amazing stuffed quesadilla for an appetizer (I mean seriously delish).  Then we headed inside for our main meal.  The cheese tortillas with chive sour cream were delish as well! 
When it came down to the main meal I was way too adventurous for a tex-mex place and ordered the Mexican meat loaf.... eh.  I am sure some would love this but it was definitely smothered with too much chipotle gravy, and the asparagus was, well..... limp.  
No worries though, the service was fabulous for the most part, although a little slow to get our bill out to us but that's fine.   
The place is really fun with a cool vibe and totally worth the semi-expensive cost.  
I would recommend it to anyone!
