Great place! I just went to OTTF for a first date on Friday and it was a fantastic choice.  Great outdoor ambiance with open space, ample shade, good lighting, and cooler temperatures provided by the mister system.  The food and service were top notch.  The margaritas were the best I've had.  It's not cheap, but what you get is great quality. Definitely coming back here for another special occasion.
