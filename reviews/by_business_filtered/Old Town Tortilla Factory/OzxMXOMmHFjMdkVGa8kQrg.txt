I had no idea one could find Mexican food THIS disappointing in Arizona.  This place wasn't just bad Mexican for Arizona, this would even be considered bad Mexican by Pittsburgh, or maybe even China standards.

Had the meatloaf (which we expected some kind of Mexican twist...) it sounded amazing.  AND the waitress recommended it!  So three people in our party of ten were stuck eating what tasted like meat flavored foam.  My step father ate all of his green enchiladas, but that means little -- he would eat anything someone put in front of him.  When I asked if it was good, he nodded with a "meh" expression on his face. 

The drinks were ok.   The tortilla bread service with butter was the highlight.  

Not inexpensive but not outrageous.   But if you're in Arizona, WHY ON EARTH WOULD YOU SETTLE FOR SUBSTANDARD MEXICAN FOOD?   Just don't.
