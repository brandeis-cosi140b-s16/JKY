i heard so much about this place, so came with very high expectations.  the outdoor patio dining space is nice, the lighting is cute.  they have good tortillas and the tequila sampler was good.  everything else was just edible.  the funny thing is that everything looked tex-mex, and the ingredients were mexican but it just didn't taste so mexican to me.  maybe they should rename this place fusion tortilla joint - this way people can better prepare their taste buds and expectations.

lesson learned: filter the concierge recommendations with yelp.
