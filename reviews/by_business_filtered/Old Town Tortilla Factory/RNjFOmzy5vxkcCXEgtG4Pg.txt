I would say that "meh" accurately describes my experience here. Came here a few weeks ago for the first time and was seated with a large group on the patio. The patio is fantastic and their drinks (treasure margarita) hit the spot. We started with the chicken quesadillas which I think were overthought in execution and didn't enjoy too much. Munched on the chips and salsa for a bit. I decided on the margerita chicken which was not what anyone who ordered it expected. The "stuffed chicken breast" is actually 4-5 pieces of chicken that are stuffed/rolled. In any event, it wasn't AMAZING, and the people who got the pork and salmon off of the menu seemed much more pleased then the chicken diners. I'll definitely come back and give this place a second shot
