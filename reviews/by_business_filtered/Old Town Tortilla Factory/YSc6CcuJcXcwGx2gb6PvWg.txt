beautiful ambiance. Food was ok. Not much options for vegetarians which was not good. The margaritas were amazing though. Especially the strawberry margarita. It had fresh like strawberries in there. Was very empty considering it was a Saturday. We sat outside but went inside and no one was there and outside just 4 other couples and one party. Waiter was really nice too. I think food is overpriced though.
