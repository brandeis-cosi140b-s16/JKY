My friends and I went here on Saturday night, not only did we have the worst service I have ever had at a restaurant, on an extremely slow night, the manager and a bachelorette party sitting next to us ended up getting into to a physical and screaming fight next to us where the MANAGER began to cuss out the women, after their servers messed up on all of their tickets. I love the overall look of the place but will not be going back for a long time, hopefully they hire new Managment and servers soon.
