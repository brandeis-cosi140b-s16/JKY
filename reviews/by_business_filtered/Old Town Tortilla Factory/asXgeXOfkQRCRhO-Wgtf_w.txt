DO NOT EAT HERE.  I was ecstatic to find they had a gluten free menu completely separate from their normal fare. After ordering tacos off the GF menu I knew immediately something was wrong after eating one taco. The waitress came around and I asked her the tortillas were
GF, which they weren't. She brought me GF  tortillas but it was too late. I had already thrown up in the bathroom
and was extremely sick. Also, the margaritas are NOT smooth, and the chips
and salsa are not free. If I could give a negative star review, I would. STAY AWAY.
