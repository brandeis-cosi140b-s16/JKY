As far as the food goes it didn't seem to be the traditional Mexican type of food that I'm used to I had the chicken enchiladas and the sauce was not very good. But the fried banana dessert was excellent.

Seems to be a very popular place that you would need to make reservations for which we did the ambience is beautiful. 

Service was great. But if you're going for good Mexican food and you might want to go someplace else.
