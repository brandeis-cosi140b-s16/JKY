Awesome place with a very cool ambiance.   Great bar area with a HUGE selection!  They have a very large patio seating area, but it was drizzling when I visited so wound up waiting a half hour to get seated. It's probably wise to make a reservation for this place.

The food was great.  We had stuffed quesadillas for appetizers that were absolutely delicious!  The complimentary cheese tortillas when we were seated were also quite the treat!  I had the Fish Tacos, which were also fantastic.  

It was a bit expensive, but it was worth it.  Highly recommended.
