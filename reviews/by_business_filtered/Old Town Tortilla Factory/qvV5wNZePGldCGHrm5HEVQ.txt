Our stop was a spontaneous drive by, the place was packed...so we decided to stop in because my sister was in desperate need of her spicy Mexican fix.  The service by Trent was fabulous! My sister offered to marry him for the fish tacos and his extra attention to the side of cabbage.  The  house salsa was incredible, and the banana crisp with raspberries was incredible! Worth the extra 30minutes on a treadmill afterword.  We both had the house chips and salsa w gauc, the fish tacos with sauces to which we had the added shredded cabbage, and we split the banana crisp.  Thank you for a great evening Trent!     - from Ohio
