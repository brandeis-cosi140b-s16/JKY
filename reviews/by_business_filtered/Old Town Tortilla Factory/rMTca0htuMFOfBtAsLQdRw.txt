If I had to break down our experience,  it would be: 4 Star Ambiance, 3 Star Food, and 2.5 Star Prices. My Carne de Fuego was pretty good but my wife wasn't impressed with her Flautas con Mole; my meal was $16 and her meal was $10. I've paid less money for better tasting food, but the meals were not bad at all. They also served black bean tortillas with cheese flavored butter which was Delicious.  Outdoor seating was quite pleasant but I wish the staff would've been more proactive in turning on the heaters as it was chilly outside (we asked at the beginning of our visit but they forgot about it until we tried to turn the heaters on by ourselves).
In summation, the experience was visually pleasing but there was still room for satisfaction in the taste and wallet region. This place is an "okay" choice for a night out.
