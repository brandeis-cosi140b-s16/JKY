I was asked to check our this restaurant while I was on vacation for a possible future work function and I cannot wait to go back. The surroundings were amazing along with fantastic service and stellar food. The Chorizo Fundido dip is a must for an appetizer and the Flan is a work of culinary art, I can't wait to have dinner here again.
