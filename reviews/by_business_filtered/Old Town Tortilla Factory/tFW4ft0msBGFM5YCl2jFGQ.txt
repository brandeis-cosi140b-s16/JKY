Was there Saturday night and they were busy but we were seated right away. Server took our order quickly but food took a long time to come out. There were two large parties so I'm assuming that is the reason. Our server took pretty good care of us considering he was waiting on a large bachlelorett party also. Food was yummy, the chips and queso were awesome. Nice ambience on patio.
