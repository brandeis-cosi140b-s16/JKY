This place does not even deserve a star. Upon arrival get handed a pager with half of the restaurant empty. We still had to wait 20 minutes for a table. Tired of waiting asked I we could eat at the bar, was told no as a dinner plate goes to a couple at the bar. We finally get seated, starving thinking okay chips and salsa... wrong that's an appetizer that is 4 bucks. So we order what ended being a basket of stale chips and some fondidto (melted cheese). Well after the third attempt of serving the cheese actually warm enough to eat, it sucked. I am waiting for my entree as I write this only for the entertainment of how horrible this is going to be. Should of gone to Oregano's
