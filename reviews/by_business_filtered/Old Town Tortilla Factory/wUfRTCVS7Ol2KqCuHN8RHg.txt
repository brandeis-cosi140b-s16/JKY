Not terrible but with all the other food options around I would try somewhere else. The food is okay, I expected it to be much better for the price. I got the old town tacos which are a build your own platter with shrimp, chicken, and steak. The shrimp was good but everything else I barely ate any of. The portions are very big. The margaritas were even disappointing, I got the premium marg and it was very sugary and served in a plastic margarita glass with a palm tree shaped stem...cheesy. Everyone else's margaritas didn't look appetizing either, they looked like they were straight out of a slushy machine and had either too much pink or green artificial dye. I did appreciate that they had a gluten free menu.
