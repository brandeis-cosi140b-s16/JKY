Only a 2 because of the great atmosphere. The patio and lights were terrific at night.

Unfortunately the food was terrible.  Possibly the worst Mexican food I've ever had (and I've had a lot!).  I was vacationing in Phoenix with my wife and fell for the pretty pictures of the patio.

They attempt to be innovative (eg cilantro tortillas with butter for an appetizer ... Which was awful) but it doesn't end up tasting like Mexican food or frankly anything that I'd care to eat

The chili verde was nearly inedible.  The sauce was soupy with very odd flavors and the meat was gristly and of low quality.  

Avoid and hopefully the'll close down and something else will move into this great location
