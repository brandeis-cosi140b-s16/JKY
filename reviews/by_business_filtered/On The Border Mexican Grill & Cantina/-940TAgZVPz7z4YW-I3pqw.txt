The mango coronarita was yummy but that was all that I liked. The food was not very good to me. I got a chicken & cheese stuffed fried avocado, chicken enchilada, and refried beans w/ rice. The avocado had no flavor, the enchilada comes with some kind of white sauce (should have asked) I like mine with green sauce and again no flavor really. The refried beans have this smoke flavor and that's all you taste, If I want smoky I'll hit up bbq. Rice was eh not much to rave about there. Won't be back.
