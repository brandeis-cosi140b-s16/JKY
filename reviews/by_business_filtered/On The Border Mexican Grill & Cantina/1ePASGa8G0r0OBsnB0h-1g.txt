I have rarely been to a place where all the food was uniformly awful. This is one.

The first Margarita I ordered tasted like overly sweetened fruit punch so I sent it back after one sip. They sent me a house Margarita next, but it warm, watered down, and again way too sweet. I gave up on drinks and tried to eat the bland jalape√±o poppers. I made it through all six, but suffered horribly with stomach pains and worse (I'll leave the details out) for a day. 

My wife made it through half of her shrimp fajita before giving up. The shrimp were overcooked and lacking jn flavor. Everything just seemed like it was indifferently slapped together. I could have paid half as much for a better meal at Rubio's.

About the only bright spot was the service, which was always with a smile. In short, if you want a meal that makes you feel like you got food poisoning eat here! At least you will get your food quickly and the waitresses don't make faces when you send it back.
