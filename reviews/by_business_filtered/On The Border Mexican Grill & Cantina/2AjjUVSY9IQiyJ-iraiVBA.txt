It's not Mexican, its Tex-Mex so as long as you realize that you're going to be ok. The salsa is awesome, the service is awesome and most of the food is awesome. We drive from the other side of town to go to this place. I have not had anything here I didn't like and most of the servers have all been great. Drinks are great too if you're looking for drinks.

They just redid the patio and it is super nice!
