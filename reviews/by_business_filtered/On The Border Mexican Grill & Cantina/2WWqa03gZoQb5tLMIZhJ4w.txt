Worst service ever!!!  First off there were six dirty tables that no one had bussed in the bar area when we were seated and they remained dirty until around thirty minutes after being seated. It took our server more than ten minutes to come to our table after more than twenty minutes of being seated we realized no ever brought us our chips and salsa so we had to ask for them.  My friend ordered a salad and never received it.  The food was good customer service sucked worst ever!!!!
