I'm not big on chain restaurants, but sometimes you have no other choice but to eat at them.
My husband and I ate here last Friday as we just couldn't decide on a place to eat and since we were across the street from On The Border we just said "let's go there."
We had eaten here once before about a year ago and I remember the food being ok, but not good enough to make me good back sooner than a year later. 
I ordered the empanadas (sp?), which were decent, but all I kept thinking was "I know this is  pre packaged frozen food" and the queso dip is clearly Tostino's brand dip. My husband tried one of their new chimichangas and he said it was pretty decent. 
The one thing I really liked about our visit was their version of a mojito. They call it a Mexican mojito and it was pretty tasty. Instead of rum they use tequila. 
The staff was friendly and accomodating. The manager even came by and gave us a coupon for a free app on our next  visit.
The place was very busy and loud and one very unhappy child that wanted everyone to know just how unhappy he was. 
The food wasn't too bad, but I've had better and I will probably go back mainly to use the free app coupon.
