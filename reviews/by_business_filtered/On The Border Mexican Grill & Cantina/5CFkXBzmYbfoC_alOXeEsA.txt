I took my 3 year old here after a mommy and me morning. We were passed 3 times before someone seated us or even said hello. We sat there for a good 10 min before someone came to get our drink order.  The chips and salsa were good but too hot for my little girl. I asked if they had a milder salsa and she said she would check. She took our food order and I didn't see her again the rest of the time there. A man started helping us. I asked for more tea and some limes on the side and it was never brought. When we were done eating we sat there for 17 min (yes i timed it) waiting for someone, ANYONE to come by and wrap things up with us. Nothing. I had to go to the bar and tell them i was done and couldn't find anyone to help me. I will not be going back. I have worked as a server many times and its not that hard people. To the employees that work there. SMILE, if you are that miserable quit and let someone who wants the job work. K im done...
