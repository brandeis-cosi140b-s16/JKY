It was my first time eating/ordering here.  I had a gift card and I ordered online.  Why because my kids decided to eat/play at next door Chick Fil A so it was convenient.  They have special parking for to go order pick ups, too.  Service was fair. My order was ready as posted about 20-25 mins after completing my online order.  The menu was extensive and intriguing/different than other mexican restaurants.  I ordered/created the 3 combo deal.  A chicken enchilada which was filled with chicken and 2 fish tacos.  Wow, when I opened my to go bag.  A huge portion/bag of chips! I mean a bowl full that you'd actually get at a table if you ate in.  Plus salsa (which was med spicy) The chicken enchilada was tasty and creamy.  The fish taco was also a good portion and filled with cabbage.  It didn't come with lime wedges but it was soo good and filling that I didn't even finish the 2nd taco.  I think it was also because I finished the refried beans.  I only took a bite of the rice/corn, which was good but I was already full.  So all of this was in my to go bag and all for $12 and some change.  Wow, so much food in comparison to Rubios' prices.  I've got leftovers for tomorrows lunch! I can't wait to try their margaritas next time I eat in.
