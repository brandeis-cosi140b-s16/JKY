We tried On The Border for the first time this past weekend. It was an okay overall.  The restaurant is designed cutely, the menu is pretty diverse with the regular Tex-Mex items and some things I haven't seen before. 

I had a lunch combo of 3 items for $9.99. The lunch combo is available everyday, including the weekends, which was a nice surprise. It was a great deal because I got a ton of food for that amount.  I went with a bowl of chicken tortilla soup, beef empanadas, and the sour cream chicken enchiladas.  The sour cream enchiladas were definitely the winner of the trio.  My hubby got the carnitas burrito and it was tasty too.  The meals also came with rice and beans.  My kiddo got the kid's quesadilla and it was an awesome quesadilla too!

What really made our experience was our server Dennis.  He had some extra email coupons that he offered to share with us, so we ended up getting one meal free.  He also was really friendly, on top of drink refills, and quite helpful with out toddler.  Yeah for awesome service!

The place is nice for Tex-Mex food.  It isn't my go to joint, but it will be in our rotation of places to visit from time to time.  If you are planning on going, check out their email club for lots of freebies.  Our server said they are always sending free stuff out, so it s definitely worth it.
