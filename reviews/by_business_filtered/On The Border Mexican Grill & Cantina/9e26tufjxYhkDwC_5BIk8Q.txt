For the most part I like this place. The food is decent and with one exception (more on that later) I've gotten good service here. Some of the specials in the bar area (like the $1 taco Tuesdays) are hard to beat. One disappointing thing is that they charge for sopapillas, which many Mexican restaurants provide free. If you sign up for their e-mail list you get some nice discounts.

About the one exception: We went to the bar area for taco Tuesday. My wife had just been for an eye examination and her eyes were dilated. The seater put us at a table where the sun was shining directly in her face. I asked our waiter if he would please close the sun shade. He said sarcastically "I would make the sun go down if I could", and walked away from the table. He never closed the sun shade. Throughout the meal he acted as though it was an imposition to wait on us, while he seemed to have plenty of time for other people (apparently friends of his). Afterward I sent a letter to the general manager complaining about this unacceptable treatment, but I never got a courtesy reply or even an apology.

Fortunately poor service is the exception (most of OTB's people work hard to please their customers), but this bears mentioning. This employee still works at the restaurant.
