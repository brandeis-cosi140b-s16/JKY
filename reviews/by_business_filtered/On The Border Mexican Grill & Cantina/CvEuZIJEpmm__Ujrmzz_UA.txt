This place was amazing in Texas and is just as amazing in Las Vegas.  I am SO SAD this is the only one in the ENTIRE valley -- where is the South Vegas love, guys?!

Yes, I have made the drive JUST to eat at this place.  And that's almost an hour.  I would drive further if need be.  Sadly, because of said drive, I can't go here as often as I like... but maybe that's better because I'd be super-broke.

Every single visit I have made here (about a handful?) has been epic.  The servers we have gotten each time are extremely awesome, helpful, and always have crazy great personalities.  They seem to genuinely love their job.  Wow!

The food is just as good as it was in Texas.  Scratch that... GREAT.  Guacamole Live is a staple of my OTB ordering.  I cannot visit here and NOT order it, even if I end up ordering other things.  Margaritas?  Awesome and HUGE (and taste like they get extra shots in 'em...whee!), the beans are awesome (and I'm not crazy about beans), their homemade chips are GREAT (ask for a to-go bag of them -- you can reheat them to their cooked perfection with the special bags!) and pretty much anything else I have ordered is stellar.  Carne asada tacos, queso, quesadillas, you name it -- they rock it.

I wish I could teleport here at will -- then I would give it 6 stars.  -;)
