I really like OTB. No matter where you get it (I travel alot) it's consistent and tastes good. This OTB location is no different and in Vegas it is the only one I know of. Always go with the Ranchiladas. Nice, juicy steak, cheese enchiladas and beans and rice. All you can eat salsa and chips is also great. Top it off with a Kahlua ice cream pie..... yum.......
