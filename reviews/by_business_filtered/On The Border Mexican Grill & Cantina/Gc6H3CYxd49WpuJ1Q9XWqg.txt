This is not the place you would want to go if you are a vegetarian.  There are literally no options. I ordered a veggie burrito and when it came to our table I think it looked like a burrito bu tclearly it wasnt a burrito which I have been having all these years. It was just a tortilla stuffed with veggies. There was no rice and beans were on the side.  I asked for a side jalepones and I got just one lucky jalepone sitting on top on what looked like a burrito.  I will never visit this place.
