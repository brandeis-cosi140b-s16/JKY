Not gonna lie....I go here for their large house margaritas that are priced pretty good and eat chips and salsa.

the food here is typical Chile's chain food (pretty sure same company owns em) so I dont call it mexican food my any means. So if you wanna know of  the food....I will pass. But always go for a few drinks and chips and salsa.
