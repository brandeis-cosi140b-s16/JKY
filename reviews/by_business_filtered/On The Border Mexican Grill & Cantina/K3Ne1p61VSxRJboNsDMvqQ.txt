We had dinner here Thursday. August 28, 2014. Around 6pm. 

Dinner was good. We even tried fried avocado and loved it!

Wonderful waitress, greeted during the meal by the manager to check on things.

Brought half my dinner home as I had ordered the sample dish, and it was huge!

On the down side, the women's bathroom was disgusting! 

But the worst part? We reheated our leftovers to enjoy, and my husband bit into a WOOD SCREW!!! OMG that's horrible! 

How and why did that get put inside our food? Not on top, but baked INSIDE the food!

The sad part is that I enjoyed my food and would have enjoyed eating there again! But the fear of what is in my food will keep us from doing that.

Either one of us could have been seriously hurt by that wood screw! Just that thought turns my stomach.

I would not recommend this location. Sorry, but this is totally unacceptable!
