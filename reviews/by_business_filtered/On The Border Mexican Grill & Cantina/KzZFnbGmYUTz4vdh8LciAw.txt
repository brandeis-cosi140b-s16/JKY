Original Queso dip was good. Service was so horrible we'll prob only ever order the dip again. IF we come back. We ordered unlimited tacos. Took 35mins to get the first two. Another 30 mins to get the 2nd two. And that's was only After we had to flaged down the manager. And they came out cold. Mgr took care of entrees but so what the service sucked. What a waste of a meal time
