Despite the crappy reviews, I have to say I'm a fan of this place!

Met a co-worker here for happy hour (which is M-F 3-7p), and was pleasantly surprised by the decent service, cheap drinks ($3.25 mixed well and even less for huge draft beers that the hubby was drinking), and 1/2 price appetizers.  We ordered 2 apps, the Firecracker Stuffed Jalapenos (YUM) and the chicken quesadilla (double YUM).  Perhaps we were just really hungry, but at like $4 each they were awesome!!!

Also, their salsa is no joke.  It's tasty and spicy, just how I like it.  I only wish they had stopped bringing us the "bottomless chips" because I just kept eating that salsa all night.  I would say that their salsa would be on my top 10 list...  Hmm, speaking of a list...

Anyway, if you're in the area and are looking for a good, cheap happy hour, give this place a chance.
