I have to say I was skeptical to come here based on recent reviews. The only logical conclusion I can come to is maybe they were having a bad day?

So the service was wonderful, he even walked us to the door and opened it! My ice tea was never low. 

I thought the food was excellent. It was a little on the expensive side. Two of us got iced tea, guacamole, two dinners and some sopa pics and it was 49 bucks but I think worth every bite!

They also had football on in the dining room, huge plus for me! Maybe their lunch service has bad service but the dinner shift doesn't.
