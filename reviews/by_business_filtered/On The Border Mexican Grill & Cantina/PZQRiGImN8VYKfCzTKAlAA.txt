I have had some scary experiences here with the service. But several months ago I had a talk with the manager and she really made me feel like she was listening. So I have come back quite a few times since and have not had another bad experience. So now the good food, clean and nicely decorated restaurant seem to have finally got there service down. 

On a complete silly side note there is a shorted woman that has worked in the kitchen for I believe a few years. You can see them back there working through the open fajita grill window.  While I smile every time I see her using a soup spoon to press bottoms on the microwaves. Which was well above her reach. I think a stool is not to much to ask for
