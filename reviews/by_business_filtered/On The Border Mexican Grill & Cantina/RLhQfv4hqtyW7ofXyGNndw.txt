I keep giving this restaurant chances even though I have yet to have any sort of consistency.  Some times it's ok some times it's crap. It is a shame because I actually enjoy this chain.  It really would appear that this restaurant suffers from a lack of good leadership. My only hope is that the restaurant will read the feedback on yelp and actually try to get better.
