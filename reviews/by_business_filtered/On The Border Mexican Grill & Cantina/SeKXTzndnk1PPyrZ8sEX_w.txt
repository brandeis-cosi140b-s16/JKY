I've been here on three separate occasions.  The first time I visited, the place was absolutely marginal.  As I was eating I'm thinking to myself, "Yes, I'm eating a burrito...but I don't know why it doesn't taste as good as, say, Taco Bell."  The second and third visits to this place were work related, and I wasn't the one driving or deciding on lunch, so I didn't have much choice.  And I kept thinking the same thing that I thought on the first visit: Why isn't this as good as Taco Bell?  

If I give a place one star, that means I'll pretty much have to be dragged unconscious to the establishment in order for me to step back inside.  Yes, I do think Taco Bell is better than this place (especially when it comes to price), but I'm not going to throw a fit if somebody else is footing the bill.
