Had a great experience at this place. I went during lunch, had the chicken fajitas, and loved them. I definitely recommend this place at lunchtime, as it isn't too crowded and the prices are better. Also, our waitress was amazing! She waited on several tables and even heated up the tortillas. She also gave my family water to-go when she heard we were on a roadtrip. Loved it!
