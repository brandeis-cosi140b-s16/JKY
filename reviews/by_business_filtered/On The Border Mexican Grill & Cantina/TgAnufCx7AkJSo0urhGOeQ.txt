Arrived just before 5pm. Not many patrons at that time, we placed our order and waited, and waited for our meals. After about 20 mins. was told the order is coming up soon, another 5 mins. later and it  finally came. One dish was cold, and needed to be sent back, while I had the worst steak fajitas. The beef? had the softest texture to it like it had sat in water for 3 days, definitely not an enjoyable meal.  I had to eat my meal while the wife waited for hers to get re-heated.

All I can say is Adios "On The Border"  we're NEVER coming back !!!!!
