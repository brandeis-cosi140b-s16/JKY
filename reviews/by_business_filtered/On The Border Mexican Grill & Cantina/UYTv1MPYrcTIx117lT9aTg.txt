When an On the Border opened in WA state where I used to live, we followed the herd and had a go. It was delicious then, but this location is not great. Our service was fine and the chips and salsa were good, but  our entrees were strange. I ordered a three item combo because I was really hungry. Mine came out  on two huge platters, one had of them had a chiles rellenos and nothing else . The other platter had two items resting parallel to each other flanked by beans and rice. Everything had a packaged, Campbell's soup taste to it. I got a stuffed avocado that was obviously old. I won't go into detail but everything else tasted like the crummy "mexican" food that was passable 30 years ago, now good Mexican food can be had almost anywhere else.

A better option is Leticia's Mexican Cocina.
