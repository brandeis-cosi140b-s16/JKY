Although, we wait usually to be seated (when its slow and staff is everywhere) I still like OTBs solely for there bomb.com happy hour! There avocado fries are so good & a lot of there drinks. They are located in a very busy area right off the fwy and close to so many other shops. I like this place, its like a new mexi type of place.
