Well, I went to this restauraunt on my brother's birthday, said it was great, so me and my parents decided to go.. After receiving a basket of chips, I almost got full since they were so good! I ordered 2 tacos with no cheese which came out to $8.99.. Okay price but the food should have been better than any other mexican restauraunt that serves tacos... My tacos were outstanding, the rice was a bit cold, my beans were also cold and didn't taste right.
