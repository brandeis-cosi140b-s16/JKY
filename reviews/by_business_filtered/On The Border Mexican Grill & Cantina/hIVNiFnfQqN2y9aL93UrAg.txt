After being on a green smoothie cleanse for five days for all meals, i was looking forward to my pre wedding anniversary meal at OTB with my wife and kids.  Arrived just after they opened and was seated rather quickly. Server took drink orders quickly, the complementary chips and salsa came out promptly and our order was taken. We ran out of chips and our server was busy on the other side of the room helping other patrons or getting food out from the kitchen so we were worried we wouldn't get a refill till our meal came out. After about five (wife says more like 10) minutes of waiting, the hostess surprised us and delivered some fresh chips to all the dining tables including ours.  Food was filling but the flavors didn't provide any wow factor to make us want to come back anytime soon. The chicken empanada was the worst item. Only minimal chicken inside whose flavor was overpowered by the cheese. The cheese inside as well as the cheese dip it came with tasted like canned cheese from the store. Bright spot of OTB is the runner who first delivered our chips and then our meal. She was very cheerful, and acknowledged us when we said thank you as compared to our server who did his job but seemed to already be thinking of the next table.  Three stars for providing a filling meal but not an experience.
