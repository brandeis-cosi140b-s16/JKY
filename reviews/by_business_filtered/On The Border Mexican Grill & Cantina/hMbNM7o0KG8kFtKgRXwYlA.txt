Only went because we had a gift cards.  Otherwise, based on the yelp reviews and the fact that it is a chain restaurant we wouldn't have gone otherwise. 

The garbage can out front was so full it was spilling out on the sidewalk.
The free chips and salsa were okay.
The service was not very good at all - the restaurant was almost empty, lots of employees standing around and the food took FOREVER.
Kids menu options are good and inexpensive.  The meal comes with main dish, side dish, drink and dessert sundae.  
The lunch fajitas were good (except the veggies were cold and had to be remade.)  My son and I shared them and had more than enough food.
We were charged 99 cents for a side of queso which was not worth the money.
Drinks are $2.49 each!!  Pricey!
The kahlua mud pie was $6.50.  It wasn't bad but quite small for the price.  I much prefer the one at Elephant Bar and it is much bigger and less expensive.
