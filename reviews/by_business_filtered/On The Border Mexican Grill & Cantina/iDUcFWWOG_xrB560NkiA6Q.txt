We decided to end our Summer Vacation at On The Border!

Josh took excellent care of us!  We sat on the patio all by ourselves! 

The chips were really great and the salsa was a bit more intense than usual, which was fabulous. We found out OTB doesn't have pickles for their kid's burger.  The Mahi Mahi grilled tacos are really tasty. 

It was a great ending to our Summer Vacation fun!
