OTB has been consistent the 3 times I've been there. I like sitting in the bar area better because I like glancing at the tv while eating.  There is enough room in the dining area for large groups which is a good thing. 
Service has been average- timely, friendly, and professional. 
Food is not as spicy as I would like it- but that's ok because I just order a fun drink and that helps out. 
I've ordered a few dishes from fish tacos, spinach quesadilla, to appetizers. One thing- dishes come with a lot of food. We always get the leftovers to go. Prices are on level with chain establishments of this kind.
