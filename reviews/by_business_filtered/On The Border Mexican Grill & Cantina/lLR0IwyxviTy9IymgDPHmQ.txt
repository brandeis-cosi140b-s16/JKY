I must say, I am confused by the negative reviews other people have posted about this On The Border location.  I have never had an issue with the service here and the food has always been amazing.  I was just there last night to take advantage of the cantina happy hour special on tacos.  I got one of each.  One BBQ beef brisket, one Southwest chicken and one carne asada.  Each was excellent.  The carne asada was the slightest bit pink which is just the way I like it.  It was so tender.  I had juices running down my arm.  The closer it gets to the elbow the better.  This made it about 1/3 of the way there. The margarita I ordered, though served in a beer mug (shrug), was good.  It was refreshing.  The chips are thin and crisp.  The salsa is blended and a little bit soupy but with a mouthful of flavor, it matters very little.  I have had a few different enchiladas here.  I have seen some unique chili relleno's that you don't see anywhere else.  It is not just the standard cheese stuffed fried pepper.  The same can be said for the enchiladas.  They are not the standard boring fare you find at some other restaurants.  I love On The Border.  I have always been pleased with the food and service.  Perhaps that makes me the lucky one.
