This place is just ok. They serve the best beef chimichangas for my area. I always sit at the bar or take my food to go. The staff are nice. And should I call in a order they do they best to fill it right the first time. Great black beans/rice and they go down hill with the dips. The cheese dips are not good at all. It don't matter if u have it in the store or should u take it home. Each time you go something is very good and something is very bad. They often bring you dirty glasses. That's just so not cute. I'm in a good mood so 3 stars for them but look twice I may give them 2 stars.
