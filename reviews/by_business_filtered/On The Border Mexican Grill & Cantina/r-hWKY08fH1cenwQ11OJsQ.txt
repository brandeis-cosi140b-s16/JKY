The now two times that I have been here, I have been EXTREMELY impressed. The first time, we got several alcoholic drinks that were pretty great (and big!), and the food was seriously delicious. 

Tried it again a few days ago, and had the very same -- maybe even a BETTER experience. The waiter, (Robert?) was so friendly, and helpful, and patient -- even with some of our party's more picky/particular requests. 

Both times here I believe I've gotten what's called the Del Rio (?) combo -- SO freakin good. Fish taco, enchilada.. the tortilla chips they bring at the beginning are even good, very lightly salted and the salsa is fantasstic.

Maybe this isn't a bona-fide Mexican place, but it certainly ranks way above your Taco Bells. The food is of excellent quality and tastes GREAT.

Highly recommended. I don't believe you'll be disappointed.
