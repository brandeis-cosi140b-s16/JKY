Overall impression, It was good but I wouldn't drive all the way down to the other side of town for mexican food. 

My bf and I both ordered from the 2-3 Combo plate section. I ordered the Guacamole Tostados, Brisket Taco and Cheese & Onion Enchilada. He ordered the Shredded Beef Enchilada, Chicken Empinada and Carnitas. 

Food tasted pretty good. I love anything with cheese so of course its good to me, haha. 

There wasn't much of any service from our waitress.
