Perhaps my love of OTB comes from having worked at one for 3.5 years, making it feel a bit like a second home. The location didn't last in my town so I was excited to get my OTB fix (after 4 long years) while visiting my sister in Arizona.

The hostess was really nice and greeted us right away. Though quickly seated at a booth, it took quite a few minutes before a server came to ask if anyone had helped us yet. Seeing as no one had, he got our drink order (frozen house strawberry margarita! yesss!) and brought chips and salsa.

They straight up haven't changed the menu  in a long time, as everything was exactly how I remember. We had the Vegetable Fajita, Big Bordurrito, and Ranchiladas...all of which were awesome. Other good choices if you're in need of help: Grilled Avocado Enchilada, Southwest Chicken Tacos, Border Sampler, and Ultimate Fajita.

My sister and her bf have pretty much been disappointed by all the Mexican restaurants they've tried around Tempe since moving here 6 months ago, and while not authentic, she already wants to go back to OTB so she can get some Empanadas. This place rules!

One odd thing I can add is that when we asked about the free queso for joining the email club thing, the server said he didn't think they were honoring that and there had been a meeting recently in which a manager said they weren't giving away free quesos anymore...but there is a chalkboard advertising it in the front entrance of the restaurant. Sooo, they should come to a decision. Do know it'll take a few hours to receive your coupon by email - we had been asking for future reference since she lives close by.
