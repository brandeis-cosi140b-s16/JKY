Very disappointed in this place. Their food is alright, but service is awful! Our waitress forgot our soup and didn't apologize and simply asked if we wanted her to take it off the check. She also forgot my guacamole, again no apology, and still put it on the check! We had to ask for silverware and it took an exceptionally long time to get our entrees. Called with this feedback and the managed did apologize, but we will not be going back here ever. We get better service at places like Baja Taco, Roberto's, and Leticia's and all those places are cheaper.
