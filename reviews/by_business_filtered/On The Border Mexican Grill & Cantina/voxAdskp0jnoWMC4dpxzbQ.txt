I think the only thing I can say I am guilty to like is their empanadas and cheese sauce but how to you eff up fried dough stuffed with meat and some melted cheese?

I came because I'm hella bored with the foods around the house that I frequent and we haven't stepped into a On the Border for a while. 

Big mistake. 

Look now I can't quite possibly prove that my cousin did not give me a stomach flu the night before with his BBQ, but no one else is sick.  Yes, I wasn't feeling great before eating, but it was mostly related to being hungry. I was in pain a few hours after and was throwing up and riding the porcelain bus so frequently that I wish I had a padded toilet seat. It's day two and I haven't eaten and I'm just sipping on pediatric electrolyte....Slowly, because drinking too much causes severe pains. 

This place is no bueno!
