The first time I ate here was when it first opened a few years ago, I decided to go back and I wish I didnt. The service was mediocre, not great but definitely not bad. The food was horrible. You would think that getting your food 5 minutes after you order it sounds like a dream, when in fact, its not. Everything seemed to be heated over, if it was heated at all. The food had cold spots and just looked unappetizing. My boyfriend ordered his plate with black beans, and got what seemed to be red ones? I ordered a enchilada and taco combo plate. They didnt include sour cream or guacamole so I ordered some one the side and they had the nerve to charge me almost a dollar for each. I know in most Mexican restaurants those condiments come standard with the meal. We ordered two entrees and two iced tea's and our bill came out to be almost $35 without tip. I will definitely not go back and not recommend this place. Too pricey for bad quality.
