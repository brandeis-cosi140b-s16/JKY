This is absolutely THE best Mexican restaurant on earth! We shared between 4 friends. Carnitas, Beef Fajitas, and Bacon shrimp fajitas!Home made tortillas...soooo good!  It was pure bliss with a side order of fresh guacamole they made table side!! If you go to Vegas... a must stop!! Margaritas to wash it all down! :)
