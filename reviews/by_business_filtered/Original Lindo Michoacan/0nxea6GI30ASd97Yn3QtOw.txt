Never disappoints! Been here several times and every time we leave happy. Margaritas were great. Loved the Chile relleno. Chips are perfect. Brought a friend and he bragged so much his girlfriend was jealous she didn't come with us. Will keep coming back! Might try Henderson location next time just to mix it up!
