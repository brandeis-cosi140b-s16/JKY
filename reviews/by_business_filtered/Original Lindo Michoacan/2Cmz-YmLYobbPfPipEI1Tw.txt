Excellent food, service and musica. 
I went in on a Friday night for dinner and it was a packed house. 
The food was super delicious. I ordered a carne asada burrito, which by the way was HUGE! The meat was so good, it was some good ol' steak without the fat, which was awesome.

If you're ever in Vegas and want some authentic Mexican food, try Lindo Michoacan. 

Only one con, the horchata is fake. I only drink REAL horchata but other than that, excellent.
