This is one of my go to place in Las Vegas.  Any night of the week, the place is packed.  You will be waiting on a Friday and Saturday night.  The table side guacamole is awesome, I get it every time I am there.  The food is more on a traditional Mexican side, not the fancy stuff you get on the strip. If you have a rental car, it is worth the drive. I will go back the next time I am in Vegas, for sure.
