The food, which was average, was generic Mexican food. However, what prompted me to write a review was an incident that took place during our meal. One of the members of my party had her purse stolen off of the back of her chair by either an employee or another patron. When the issue was raised, the restaurant staff responded horribly, and refused to call the police or check the tapes until the following day. When the manager was called to the table, his response was, "so, you're going to go file a report, right?" My friend, obviously distraught, was shown no empathy or compassion and it seemed like every manager and employee we spoke to was incompetent and confused. Oh! And they proceeded to bring her her bill at the end of the meal, to which my other friend replied, "she will pay her bill when you find her wallet." After some persuasion, they comped her meal. Not a good experience. This was my first time here and I will not be back.
