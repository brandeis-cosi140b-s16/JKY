The atmosphere was quite pleasant. That's the only reason for 2 stars, because the food.... Big MEH.

We had heard all the rave reviews. Methinks these people have never been to California and tasted what real fresh Mex is like. Lindo Michoacan is NOT all that. Most of the stuff is pure canned flavor.

Save yourself the trip. Head over to Mandalay Bay and get some decent food at the Border's Grill.
