This place is awesome..Locals told us about this place a few years ago and we always make it a stopping point whenever we go to Vegas(like in 3 hours:-)..They even have video poker if you want to gamble..The buffet on Sat/Sun morning is awesome..If you like/love Mexican food, you definitely want to stop here...Very easy to find....Pete
