Food and drink are great!  Authentic menu and ingredients with plenty of options for even picky eaters.  Large portions, I always end up splitting plates.  Top-shelf spirits and service.  Our waiter has even helped us out to the car because he saw we had a baby!  The only ding this place gets is the birthday mariachi.  With a baby in tow this really should not be the place to go if you want peace and quiet.  It's very close quarters and you will know if there is a birthday, or anniversary, or any other event in the house (and there usually are about two or three!).
