Went there Sunday night for Dinner with my Children.  Not a native of Las Vegas, Live in LA.  But I will tell you the food, the drinks, the ambiance, and the entertainment were beyond great.  I have a favorite in LA and this trumped it.  The home made tortillas were great.  The beans were like my mother use to make.  Recommended for the hispanic who misses Mexican food.
