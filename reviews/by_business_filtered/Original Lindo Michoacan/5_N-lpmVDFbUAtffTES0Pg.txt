Carlos is the worst server there.  



I was sat got my drink and then waited 10 mins for the Guac that I wanted.  Mean while a table gets sat next to us and the place wasn't busy like it has been last time I went there.   The other table gets drink and their order taken before he even thinks about taking ours then walks away.  No water in our glasses I am out of my beverage from the bar I have to wave him down and get him to come over to me I ask for the bill because I am tired of dealing with idiots and then all of a sudden he wants to be the best waiter in the restaurant.   I told him not to bother his manager because I didn't want to waste his time.  There is nothing that the manager could have done even if he spoke with me to please me after this visit here.   Yet to remind you that I live 24 miles away from the restaurant in North North Las Vegas.  Needless to say I will no longer go back to visit this restaurant.



This is the first time that I got so mad that I left a restaurant.  I am a chef and I know that sometimes people are busy but when half the restaurant is full that is not busy.  It just means that you knew someone to get the job and trust me the only break this guy got was when they hired him.
