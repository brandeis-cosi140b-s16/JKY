Amazingly flavorful mexican food..!! Loved the strawberry margarita , bean and spicy salsa dip and fresh hot chips!!
For a enchilada non-lover, I am totally converted!! I loved their cheese enchiladas!! 
So many vegetarian options!! Even their rice n beans don't have chicken stalk. Great portions.
Excellent service..

Can't wait to come back again!!
