Great authentic Mexican  food...very fresh. They have awesome customer service. The chips they bring are warm and they bring beans and salsa for dipping! They didn't have the sauce for the shrimp I wanted so they gave us a free dessert! The entrees: my hubby got chile rellenos with shrimp...so good!!To my fellow out of towners, make the trip off the strip to come eat some authentic Mexican food...you won't be disappointed.
