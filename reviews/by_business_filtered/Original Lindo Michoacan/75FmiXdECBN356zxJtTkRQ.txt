What a beautiful restaurant. The colorful tile, the fountain, the artwork, the stained glass window... Very authentic. Guacamole made fresh and to order at the table. The homemade tortillas were hot and delicious. We had attentive service for our group of 10 during lunch rush- they even let us order on separate checks. Food was served quickly and to order. Drinks were refilled often.The employees seemed to really enjoy working there. I saw a place for a live band and a very well stocked bar.. I will be back to enjoy that!
