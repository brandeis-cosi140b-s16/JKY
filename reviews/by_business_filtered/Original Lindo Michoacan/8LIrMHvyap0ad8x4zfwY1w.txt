Very fun, authentic atmosphere. We dined here as our first night as Vegas residents, and are very lucky to have such a great establishment so close by. The food was awesome - the chips and salsa they serve is maybe the best I've ever had. Portion sizes are very generous as well. 

Great service. Really good margaritas too!!
