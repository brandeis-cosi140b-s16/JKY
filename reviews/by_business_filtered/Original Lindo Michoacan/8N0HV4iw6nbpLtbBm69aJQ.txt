I'm from Cali I was in Vegas for the weekend and wanted some Mexican food I asked my cousin she reccomended this place so we took off it was about a 10minute drive from our hotel we get there and there is a big parking lot it was not full so I thought it would be a bad place the place started getting packed ppl where coming in left and right good thing we got there early after we go in and get greeted by some girls in some Mexican wear really nice they sit us down and then our waiter comes ask us for our drink then takes our food order. My wife asked for puntas de filets de albañil its steak with onions tomatoes and jalapeños I had a hangover and ordered me a menudo. Before the food arrived they bring you chips and salsa and some bean . also with your order you get a fideo soup really good. The food had an authentic Michoacan flavor I know because my dad is married to a lady from over there. Food was good and the restaurant it self is like being in Mexico  I liked it and I will go back when I'm in Vegas again.
