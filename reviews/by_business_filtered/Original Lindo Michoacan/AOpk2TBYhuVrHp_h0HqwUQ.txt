I love Lindo and Michoacan! I even love their vegetarian options as well! 

I have dined in this restaurant many times and my experience has always been superb!

However, this review is specifically for the catering service which the manager was very attentive to our vegetarian requests. We all know that most beans are cooked with lard which is made out of meat or pork fat etc..and the rice is made out of meat or chicken broth.  Nevertheless, Lindo was kind enough to cook vegetarian beans and rice in addition to our regular non vegetarian order. They also made avocado tacos which was so delicious!! Another veggie dish that they made was fajitas! 

All were yum yum in our tums!!
