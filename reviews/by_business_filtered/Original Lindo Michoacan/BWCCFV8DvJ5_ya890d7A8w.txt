Best Mexican food I have ever tasted in the U.S!! There were so many options it was so hard to choose! My family is originally from Michoac√°n and if you have ever visited, it's true we do have the best antojitos around! The food and drinks were awesome! I fell in love with the decor of this place too. 

The only reason I did not give this place 5 stars was because our waiter was so sarcastic it wasn't even funny! We just had some questions because one of my friends is vegetarian and he was being rude. The bus boy on the other hand was more helpful at answering our questions. 

A little ways off the strip but well worth the drive! The carnitas were finger licking good and I usually hate the beans at restaurants but I finished all of them. Oh and you can't beat the tasty handmade tortillas. I will defiantly come back next time I'm in Vegas.
