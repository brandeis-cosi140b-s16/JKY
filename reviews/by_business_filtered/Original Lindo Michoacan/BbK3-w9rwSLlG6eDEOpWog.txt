This is the second time i come to this restaurant while visiting Vegas. This time i had the carnitas plate. Crisp, moist and flavorfull. It came with rice, beans and chile toreados (grilled jalapeno peppers). You also have a choice of flour or corn tortillas. I got a free desert just for doing their survey. The food came out fast and the staff is very friendly, a plus. Overall, i wod definitely return.
