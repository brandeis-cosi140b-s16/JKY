First time eating here at this restaurant.  We had seen a show in food network that show cased a spicy ghost salsa.  We had to stop and try it. For those who like spicy food this is a must try.   We tried the Buey de cilantro, aguachile, chilaquiles, queso fundido, taco dorados, torta and table side  guacamole and hand made tortillas. Everything was delicious and service was great.  

Es un buen lugar para celebrar un cumpleaños ya que te cantan y te dan tu tequilazo cumpleanero.  
 
Definitivamente recomendamos este restaurante y será unos de nuestros lugares favoritos en las Vegas.
