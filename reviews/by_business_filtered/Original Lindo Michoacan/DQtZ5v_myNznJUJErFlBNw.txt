I love Lindo's! The tortilla chips are freshly made and continually refilled alongside fresh salsa and refried beans. I would highly recommend the fresh guacamole, made tableside. It never disappoints. Chefs specials are all really good. I like to order the fajitas or the taquitos. If you leave room for dessert, go for the fried ice cream!
