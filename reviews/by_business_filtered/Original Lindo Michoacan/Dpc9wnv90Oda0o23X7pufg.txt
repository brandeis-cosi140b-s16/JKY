This place is great for groups with friends and/or a romantic dinner w that special someone. Your meal will always start out with their delicious freshly made chips/ salsa/ and refried beans, but pace yourself on them... Yes I know it'll be hard but you want to leave room for the real deal. I highly recommend their margaritas if it's been "that kind of day" or even if it hasn't you deserve it right? Now as far as their menu selection I will let you explore that yourself... I fell that giving away my opinion on their entrees would be the equivalent of telling you how that movie you haven't seen yet turns out... And I'm not that evil. I will tell you this you won't be disappointed, the place is highly authentic and delivers in price point. Now try it out... And write your own review.
