First visit, based on stellar reviews. Service was awesome, fast, friendly and efficient. Chips & salsa and complimentary soup came out quickly. We had the Camerones Ranchero (wish it was more than 7 shrimp for 20 bucks, and was a bit overcooked), and the chicken fajitas were a bit greasy. The flavors were great, and so was the Margerita. Would come here again.
