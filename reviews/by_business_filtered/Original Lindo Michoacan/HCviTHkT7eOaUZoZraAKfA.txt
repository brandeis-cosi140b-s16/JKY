My 2nd time here  and definitely  not my last. This place has the best food, great prices, strolling mariachi,  live music, clean, nice decor & friendly servers. Love the beans and fideo u get b4 the meal. They make fresh guacamole at your table and gave us a free round for texting their promo code! Sweet deal! Tab for 4, with 20% tip, was only $104. Love this place
