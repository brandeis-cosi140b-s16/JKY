So i have read and heard all this hype about how good this place was and i'm here to say WHY? i have had better food at chevys or even a robertos, The place was hot as hell feels like there's hardly any ac going at all. The food was decent at best and  for the price range this would be one of my last pics for sure, the point is skip it one of the most overrated mexican food joints in las vegas
