This is my favorite Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas.  I love that they serve chips and salsa with a separate bowl of retried beans for dipping.  I have never seen that before.

The combo plates are delicious.  I enjoyed the tacos and the enchiladas a great deal.  Didn't do dessert, but everything looked good.

This is not a restaurant for tourists.  It is not convenient to The Strip or Downtown.  This is a locals joint with a following.  Go here of you are serious about Mexican food.  You will love it!
