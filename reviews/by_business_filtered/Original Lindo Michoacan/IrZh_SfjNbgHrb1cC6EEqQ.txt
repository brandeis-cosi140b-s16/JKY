I recommend Lindo Michoacan if you want authentic Mexican food. I appreciate the fact the menu isn't littered with Tex Mex options. The menu includes authentic dishes from the region, and the staff are eager to recommend your next favorite dish. I have a gluten allergy, and I was still able to find some really excellent dishes. The decor is lovely, and the place doesn't have a cheesy feel. I look forward to dining here more often, especially since it has so many yummy margaritas.
