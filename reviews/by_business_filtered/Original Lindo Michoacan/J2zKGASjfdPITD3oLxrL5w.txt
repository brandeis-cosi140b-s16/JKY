I've always had a good experience at Lindo Michoacan BUT today was a different story. I was there at 2:00pm with my family. We took my mother there for an early Mother's Day dinner. We sat 15 minutes before the waiter, Carlos asked what we were drinking. We finally ordered our food. It took a long time to get our food and it was cold. I'm guessing it must've been up but our waiter didn't bring it out when he should've. There was this party of 8 with kids and they were ordering drink after drinks. The woman was laughing SO LOUD we couldn't hear anything but her!!! All we could hear was that loud laughing hyena. It was so hard to hear my family. Everybody there looked annoyed by the loud noise coming out of her mouth! To make matters worse, our waiter didn't check on us. He was busy singing happy birthday to 3 tables. It was a really bad experience. I will NEVER go back to that location again.
