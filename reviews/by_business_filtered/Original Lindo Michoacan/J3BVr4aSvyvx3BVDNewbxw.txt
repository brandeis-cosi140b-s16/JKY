We went on a Saturday night and boy oh boy was it packed. I personally would rather go to the one in Henderson but my family says it's not nearly as good. They said 10-15 minute wait but it was more like 30 minutes. I had the carnitas de la Mexicana and it was pretty good hot and spicy must have been the jalape√±os. The restaurant is always festive with a musical quartet playing guitar and violins and singing Mexican songs. It's probably the best Mexican food in Las Vegas. I had to park in no parking spot next door at the office building. Nobody in our party complained and even my two-year-old granddaughter ate her full of soup and guacamole.
