Tourists!! There are gems to be found outside of the glittery Strip... and some of these gems have shuttles! Hence, Lindo Michoacan, five stars for you.
First of all, quick service with a smile always goes a long way with me. Secondly, chips and salsa AND bean dip to start off... win. Thirdly, tableside guacamole spiced to your preference? Getouttahere. Fourthly, a menu with something delicioso for EVERYONE, including us vegheads. Fifthly (not even a word), the fact that they had a full house and could still capably handle the group of 18 that we were in... seriously en pointe service. Drinks refilled in minutes, orders placed in front of you instead of called out (one of my huge pet peeves) and never felt pressured to get out once the check was presented.
Take advantage of the shuttle situation and GO!!
