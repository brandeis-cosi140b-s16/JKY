Lindo Michoacan, I know you well. According to the Yelp app I have 41 visits (sometimes I forget to check in so it's about triple that number) and I am the Duke of this place. While I've visited you for dinner, lunch is what keeps me coming back. First it was a cheese enchilada and beef taco lunch special, but that was all forgotten about when I discovered for $1 more I could get fish tacos. And I could get them grilled to boot! Your lunch special with tip and all isn't exactly a low-buck lunch, but when I'm really hungry and I want to get in, get out, and get on with tending to the daily zoo I call work, you pretty much take care of me. 

Parking: If it's busy parking can suck. It's tight and people are in a carb induced or tequila induced haze when leaving and it makes driving through their parking lot quite interesting. And getting back on to Desert Inn can be a pain. Service: If you get someone like Ismael at your table you're golden. But some of the servers have issues. I don't ask for much. Just bring me iced tea, and refill my salsa. Do that, my tip is 25%. Don't do it and you get snarky tips on Yelp complaining about the service. 

But for all my gripes my 41 check ins and Duke status speak volumes. Lindo is just good food. Consistently good food. Also if you or someone with you has a birthday make sure and tell the staff. You'll get the whole staff singing to you and a tequila shot! 

4 Strong Stars.
