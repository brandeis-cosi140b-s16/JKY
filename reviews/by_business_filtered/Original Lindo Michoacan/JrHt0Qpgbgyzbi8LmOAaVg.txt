Everytime we visit Vegas we fill up here. Great cure for a hangover, aguachiles, michelada, and oysters. Everything is so good and taste so fresh. Maybe its the booze but I am always impressed with their food, service, and authenticity. It's off the strip but most cab drivers know it. They also offer you free transportation back to your hotel if it is available!!
