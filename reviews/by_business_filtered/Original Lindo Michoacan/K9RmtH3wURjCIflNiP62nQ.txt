Food was 4 stars and 5 stars for service.   They were so attentive from the moment we entered the restaurant.  Even when they messed up our margaritas they were quick to fix it and even took one drink off the bill and asked if they could get us anything else.  We took a cab there and when we we getting ready to leave they asked if we'd like to use their shuttle back to the strip.  Overall, I was really amazed how well we were  treated.  I was so impressed by the service I could barely focus on the food but it was good.
