Wow. This place was great! We recently had our sons graduation dinner here. There was 15 of us and we called ahead for a reservation. They had our table ready when we got there and the ambiance was great. I ordered the don't Francisco. It was one enchilada with a piece of flank steak for around $18. It was solo good. The meat was so soft and cooked perfectly. At the end they all came around and put a huge sombrero on my son and dang to him. It was awesome. We are definitely going back here. Can't wait.
