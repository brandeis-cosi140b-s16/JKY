I bought the Groupon and little far from our house, but the review and my friends were talking about this place made me to buy this deal, Wholaa!! i though this place is not great food when i was parking my car in the parking lot bcos of the old looking front view, Believe me, this place is the best Mexican food so far i tried. we were 7 people and all of us were so happy about the service and the food. Only thing is the loud sound in side, but i can understand the Mexican tradition, and the loud music always go together. 
Such a great place to get the authentic Mexican food, My favorite was Stake Ranchero, Also My wife got Chicken Fajita was Delisious!!!
