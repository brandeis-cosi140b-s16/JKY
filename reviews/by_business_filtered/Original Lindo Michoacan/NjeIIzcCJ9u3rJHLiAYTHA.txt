I'm not a huge fan of Mexican food but we tried this place close by. They start you off with fresh tortilla chips and spicy salsa and bean dip. The bean dip is good but I am not crazy about it. I tried a pulled pork and scrambled egg (it seemed kind of like a breakfast concept). It was just ok to me. The horchata was good, and the tortillas come out nice and hot but cool and harden up very fast if you don't eat it right away. They seem to have a huge variety of different Mexican food, I even saw meats like beef tounge.
