and back I am...
this time I visited with my son Lorenzo, who despite his young age is well educated as fare as food is concerned...he has a grandmother who is from Naples (Italy, not Florida!) and she cooks real meals for him every day.
Thas said Lindo's cuisin is still attractive. We went there for lunch and it was quite a bargaing.
I will be back for the annual event of CES in january...and I'll take some of my fellow journalist and a new charming girlfriend to this place...
