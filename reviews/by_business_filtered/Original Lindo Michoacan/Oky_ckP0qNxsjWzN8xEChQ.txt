I've been visiting this restaurant for over 35 years. Still run by the same family (second generation). The cuisine has always been wonderful. Service? It's like being served by .... Guess what? ...... family. Of all of the Mexican Restaurants in Las Vegas (and there are many) I'd rate this one now Number One. Our ultimate favorite (Vega's Cafe) closed its doors a few years ago.
