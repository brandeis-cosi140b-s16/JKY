I was in Vegas, tired of the boring junk on the strip, I was checking Yelp from my phone, found a few reviews.  The reviews of Lindo were good (especially the recent ones) so I suggested it and the whole family drove over.  From the moment we sat down our group (6 people) we were totally taken care of.  The service was amazingly fast, (food too) the menu was like 6 huge pages of great dishes.  Everyone in the party got something different and everyone was raving after we walked out.  The manager stopped by once or twice to check on us as well as numerous staff.

I can't thank my fellow Yelpers enough; this has to have been the best YELP find ever - however I have found a lot of really good places.  If you are in Vegas for any reason you owe it to yourself to try this place, I was 100% satisfied and I bet you will be as well.
