Came back here on our return trip and was just as happy as our original visit. this time around I tried the carnitas. I enjoyed them very much, great flavor, they could have been a little more crispy, but taste-wise, excellent.
love love love the warm chips and bean dip, salsa is excellent. 
husband got the chicken with a funky name to it....i can't remember what it is called, but it is covered in a spicy-sweet sauce that is EXCELLENT!!!! and our waiter told us the very simple ingredients, so now I'm going to try to recreate at home. lol
oh, and the fideo soup? awesome awesome. love it when they have fideo on the menu, it is kind of rare to find here.
