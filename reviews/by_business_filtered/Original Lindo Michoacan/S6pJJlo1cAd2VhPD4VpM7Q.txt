This restaurant has one of the best waiter service ever. The waiter at my table was so nice and smiled a lot and he recommended some things to order. I ended up getting the birria which was delicious. If your in Vegas it's only 10 min away and you won't regret it. It was nice to the girls wearing their amazing Mexican dresses. 

Pro: Huge selection of food to order from 
Con: It's 10 min from the strip
