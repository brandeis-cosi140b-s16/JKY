Haven't had authentic Michoacan food since I was younger traveling to Morelia. The overall service was great, server was prompt and helpful, busser didn't waste any time clearing our plates out of the way. The chips and salsa AMAZING! Never seen any place serve bean dip with their chips which was great even though it needed a bit of salt. I would advise come hungry if you're doing the apps and entree with dessert. Oh before I forget they serve breakfast day or night!!!
