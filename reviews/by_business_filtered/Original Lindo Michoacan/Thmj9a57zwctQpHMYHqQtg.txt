I always go there for breakfast before leaving LAS VEGAS. This time (yesterday) I was a little sad- they no longer offer he brunch buffet in the mornings :( This meant limiting my taste buds to just one main item...LOL. I went with the Red Chilaquiles which were very good. The waiters (we had two men) were very attentive and my glass never went below halfway. The friendly atmosphere is very welcoming.
