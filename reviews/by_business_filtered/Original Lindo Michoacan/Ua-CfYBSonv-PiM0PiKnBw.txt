Had the pleasure of finding this Mexican gem in Vegas. The wife and I came for the Red Snapper fish plate and was very pleased. Delicious. 
We wanted to give a thumbs up to the Service!  Loaisa was a field commander ensuring we all got top service/attention. Bravo!

Highly recommend nice place and good food!  We are from San Antonio and we had a fair share of mex restaurants to know a good one!  Buen Provecho!!
