I am from Southern California where you can get authentic Mexican food pretty much anywhere! Since moving to Vegas, I have had a very hard time finding decent Mexican food.  I read so many positive reviews about this place that I thought I would give them a try.  I don't know what you people consider "authentic" Mexican food, but this isn't it.  
The decor was very nice, I really loved the inside of the restaurant.  The staff were all very friendly as well.  The salsa was not good at all.  It wasn't spicy enough and was actually kind of bland.  The fideo soup was new to me, I've never seen that before in a restaurant and it was alright.  I ordered a beef taco, beef enchilada and chile relleno plate.  They used the same green sauce on both the beef enchilada and chile relleno.  The sauce tasted like it was from a can.  And unless everyone else has it wrong, I've never heard of green sauce on a beef item.  I do not recommend this place, nor will I eat here again.  It is kind of sad too because as I said,  the decor and service were excellent.
