We visited on a Sunday and probably should have gone with the brunch buffet but as it was our first visit we ordered what we wanted. Everything looked good on the buffet table but the did not have chorizo con huevos and my brother had green chillaqueles, both dishes were good. In fact everthing looked good on the menu. I would probbly go back if I ever had the chance.

 So why not more stars? Mom, who had a cup of muendo did not have any posole in the bowl. We were so surprised thinking maybe this is the unique prepration advertised in the menu. As it turns out it was just bad luck because the bus boy, who was much friendlier than the waiter assured us that the meundo on the buffet table had hommonie in it. The other reason it did not get more stars was because we asked ourselves what we considered a 5 star Mexican restaurant and we agreed it was Casa Garcias in Anaheim, CA. This was based on the food alone because the atmosphere is much nicer here. In all it was a good visit but we tend to be a lot harder in our evaluation of Mexican. 

On a side note, it was interesting to note that the owner was named Timoteo Barajas, which is the same as mine.
