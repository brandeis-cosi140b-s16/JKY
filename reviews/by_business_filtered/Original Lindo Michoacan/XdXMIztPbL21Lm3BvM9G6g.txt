My family was craving authentic Mexican food, I have lived in Las Vegas for about 5 years, always passed by this place and shame on me for not stopping!! When we walked in, my family was greeted right away. Seated, chips red salsa and refried beans. I'm not a fan of red salsa so I asked if they had green salsa. OMG it was heaven!! Absolutely delicious!! They have 36 lunch specials that include a soft drink at reasonable prices. My 2 kids received fideo soup, very nice jester to keep the kids from screaming or crying before their food comes out. I had the carnitas when I tell you they melt in your mouth, they really melt in your mouth!! Incredible flavor!! My hunny had the 2 item cheese quesadilla and shredded beef taco. He gave me a bite. It was delicious! In the back in the middle section there is a lady handmaking tortillas, I wanted to kiss her...lol they were that good! Will definitely be back and spread the word about this wonderful place!!
