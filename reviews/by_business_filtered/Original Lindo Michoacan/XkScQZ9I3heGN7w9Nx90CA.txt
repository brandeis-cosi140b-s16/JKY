It's been a while since we last stopped here for a meal.  It was a busy Sunday afternoon but we managed a booth right away.  

The adjacent table had a nice looking margarita, so I ordered one and enjoyed it immensely with our appetizer.  sopitas steak chorizo's, six hand made corn tortillas lightly fried and filled with beans, lettuce, cheese,  sour cream and joice of meats, we had chicken steak and chorizo.  Very good.

For my entree I got a combination plate, I love too many things to just pick one, so a combination plate allows multiple selections.  So I got the morelia, a chili relleno, chicken enchilada and beef taco.  All three my favorites.  

The food is fresh, cooked well, with enough flavors and spice to satisfy.  The service is quick, the restaurant clean, and well managed.
