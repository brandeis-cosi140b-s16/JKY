I've decided after my first meal here that table-side guacamole making is an important life skill that everyone should have. Like learning to drive a stick shift. Or knowing how to replace an air conditioning filter. When you're two Asians and two gringos in a Mexican restaurant, you know you're doing something right when even the Latinos around you are ordering the table-side guacamole. 

I got the 3-taco plate and opted to get one each of carne asada, lengua, and al pastor rather than getting three of just one type of meat as the menu listed. The al pastor was so awesome - sweet and juicy, but the carne asade and lengua were both on the blander side. 

I'd come back though - tacos are tough to perfect, especially when everyone feels like they've found the Fountain of Tacos out of their coworker's neighbor's abuela's cousin's pickup truck in the garage and no longer see the value of paying a premium at a sit down restaurant. The menu here is extensive, and I definitely saw a lot of items that caught my eye for a next visit. On top of that, the service is genuine; you don't have to habla espanol to have the servers be at your every beck and call.
