I would give it 3.5 stars but it will not let me. I ordered the fish tacos and they were okay but the tortilla fell apart.  And the fish lacked some sort of pop flavor (pepper, lemon or something) 
The chips and salsa were okay, they didnt look homemade and you inly get one bowl. I have never been to a mexican restaurant were they charge after the first bowl.  My husband ordered the fajitas and it was good 

The one thing that I would give a huge compliment is to the workers. From the greeter to the server and the waiter. Everyone was extremely nice, friendly and fast
