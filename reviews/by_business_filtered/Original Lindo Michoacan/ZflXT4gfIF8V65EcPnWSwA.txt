Friends, DW, and I dined here 01/08/12.  This is a great off the strip Mexican restaurant.  Arriving in the evening after dark, the restaurant does not look very inviting.  However, based on yelp reviews we sucked it up and went in.  

Interior is nicely decorated if not a little dark in one room.  

Service staff were outstanding across the board.

We ordered guacamole which was prepared table side.  Fresh ingredients make such a difference!  Neither of our friends "liked" guacamole, but I can tell you they helped us polish it off down to the last chip!

Margaritas were very good.  Beers were cold and served with chilled mug which is always a nice touch.

Entrees were all outstanding.  Among the 4 of us we ordered 1 burrito, 2 Carne Asada dishes, and Carnitas.  All were excellent, with the accompanying homemade tortillas being an excellent treat!  and when I say homemade I don't refer to the tortilla pressing machine that I have seen in other Mexican restaurants.  Sylvia was making them by hand throughout the evening.

We love Las Vegas and go about once a year, and will definitely come to Lindo Michoacan again.
