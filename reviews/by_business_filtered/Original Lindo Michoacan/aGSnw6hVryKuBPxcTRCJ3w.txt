Holy guacamole. 

Or maybe holy beans and chips would be more appropriate? They bring you that, along with some salsa as soon as you sit down and boy, it's delicious. No need to order dinner based of how much beans I ended up eating...

1. I highly suggest the guava margarita. HIGHLY suggest. $10 and its huge. 

2. Their menus huge. I knew I was gonna be full of chips so I ordered a taco and enchilada a la carte and the portion was perfect. 

I have wanted to try this place for ages (Vegas locals always come here) and it did not disappoint.
