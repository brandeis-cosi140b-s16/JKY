We went here for our wedding reception last year.  We were craving some menudo so we decided to come to the original Lindo Michoacan, and were not disappointed.   It was super packed, minimal wait and the service was excellent.  The food was even better.  The best part was the live mariachi band they serenaded a newly wed couple.  It was beautiful!!! The prices are higher than most mexican restaurants in town but well worth it.  We'll be back!!
