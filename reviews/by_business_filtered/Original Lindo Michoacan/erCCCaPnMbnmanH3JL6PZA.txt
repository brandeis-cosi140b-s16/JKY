This place was suggested by someone and turned out to live up to its claim. The restaurant was busy but we were promptly seated. There was not a moment where we didn't feel attended to as multiple employees checked on us. Service is top notch here. Food came quick, was full of flavor and well presented. The lunch pricing was a great value as we found ourselves paying less than we budgeted, and less than we'd expect for this level of service. We are happy with this suggestion and we recommend it too!
