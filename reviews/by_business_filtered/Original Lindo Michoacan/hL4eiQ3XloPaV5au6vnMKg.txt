We had friends recommend this restaurant to us (there are more than 1 but all the same)
OMG was it wonderful!  Believe it or not, the HOUSE margarita was actually the BOMB...so figure it out from there.  I had this CRAZY chili relenno that was stuffed with shrimp, octopus, fish and I think scallops and then deep fried.  It looked like the BOMB and tasted like the BOMB!  Husband went safe...was very good but he should have listened to the waiter.  Great Place to come and off the strip!  YIPEE!
