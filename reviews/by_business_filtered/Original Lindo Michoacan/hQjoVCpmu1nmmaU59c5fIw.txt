Great food. Salsa was fantastic. Our server Pedro was super friendly and fast. The fideo soup is killer! We had two little kids with us, and no-one treated us differently. Thus is our new go-to for any trip to Vegas. The carnitas are to die for!!! Worth the drive a little off the beaten path. Don't miss this place, if you are a fan of authentic and delicious mexican cuisine.
