I still dont understand how Las Vegas can rank this as best of Las Vegas in the RJ.
3 of us tried this last night using the 20% off coupon in the RJ.  This has got to be some of the worst and most overpriced mexican food we have ever had, even with the coupon.  This place was packed with white people and not many mexicans except for the servers.  2 people in our party were mexican and the both said this was just a glorified taco bell.  Food was covered with white/yellow goooe oily cheese.
portions were small.  My friends called the free sopa de fideo, sopa de calcetenas (sock water)  It had no flavor and just a tomatoe colored water with pasta in it.  Guys, there are much better mexican restaurants in town.  I dont know how this chain stays in business.  The prices are $$$$$$$$ $19 for any seafood, $14 for combos, $15 for chicken dishes.
