This place was some of THE BEST Mexican food I have ever had. Went to this location 2 times while in Vegas. 

Service A+
Value A++
Atmosphere A+ (IF you like Mariachi bands)
Taste A+
Wife and I ate dinner for only about 50 bucks!!

Had quesadilla carnitas, margaritas, and the nearly Devine LINDO FLAMEADO!!!

Please stop by when in Vegas. Absolute must!!!

Only complaint was that the bathroom was really cool and I felt I could only go in once not to look weird. 

TERRIFIC!
