Wow, what a place! A huge menu that is quite a task to figure out where to start and for me I ended up with the Carnitas - lean pork marinated with fresh oranges and spices. Served with chiles toreados, green sauce, and guacamole and was very happy indeed. Service was super fast and very friendly and the entertainment was fun as well. Located far enough off the strip to make you forget you are still in Vegas is a big plus too.

Between the birthday's being celebrated and the bride and groom coming in with their wedding party after getting married it all made for a fun evening that was just the right balance of loud and peaceful.

We did not take advantage of it -- and nor did I know it existed until we saw it when we left but the amazing part is: Our Desert Inn location, Just 10 Minutes From The Las Vegas Strip offers a free shuttle service from the Las Vegas Strip for our out of town guests! Call 702.735.6828 to make a reservation. Now that is service!!!
