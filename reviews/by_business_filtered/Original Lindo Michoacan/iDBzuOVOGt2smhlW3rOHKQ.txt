We found this place on yelp so thanks to the previous people who recommended it. Clean restaurant, friendly staff and awesome authentic Mexican food! My family and I were so impressed with the quality of the food, homemade tortillas and how friendly everyone was! Not only would I go back to this place I'll recommend it to anyone I know traveling to Vegas!!
