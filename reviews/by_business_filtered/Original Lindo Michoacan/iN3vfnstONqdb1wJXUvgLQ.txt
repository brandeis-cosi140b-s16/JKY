Like many other reviewers, my dining experience was decent. 

The food was underwhelming. It may be due to regional differences between food I'm accustomed to and what Lindo has to offer, but the flavors felt compromised for the sake of palatability. The carne asada was a disappointing entr√©e here, lacking the bravado one expects of a canon dish. The smokey flavors of the grill were absent, but it was tender and had a nice flavor. The burrito came wet (with salsa spread on the top), forcing you to use utensils. Unfortunately, it was wrapped loosely, making the fillings fall out as soon as you lifted a piece to your mouth. The enchiladas had a decent kick, but the texture of the tortillas was very rubbery, and the contrast between the flavors of the enchilada salsa and tortilla was awkward. 

I don't regret coming here - the non-Mexican people I came with enjoyed the experience. If you're white, chances are this place will knock your argyle socks off.
