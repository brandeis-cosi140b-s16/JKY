I live in the bay area and a friend of mine who's from Vegas recommended this place to me for our trip here this time around...its one of the most delicious Mexican food restaurants I've ever been to. Authentic food (really!! My hubby is part Mexican and he ordered the chile verde and devoured it), not to mention the decor makes you feel like you're really in Mexico! Tortillas are made in-house, guacamole is made table side, and the complimentary chips and salsa (and bean dip) is right up my alley. There was also a one man band playing that set the mood and the soup before dinner was tasty. great experience with friendly staff and our food came out so quickly! Wish we had one in Cali!
