I heard a lot about this place that it had great food, I came here with my family and tried it. The service was excellent but none of the food had flavor, and the salad had way to much. The soup was awesome! If you've never had real Mexican food I'd suggest this place for a quick bite not a good place to go if you want the real expeiriance.
