Good find! I went here with a big group of colleagues (around 45 people), after a sales meeting at a convention. They struggled with the large group, but I'm sure that table service is fine when it's  just a couple of people or a family at a table. 

For folks used to Mexican food, this place has a great menu. You'll see most of the usual favorites and they start you off with chips and a fiery salsa. Most meals came with a simple Fideo soup, which was really nice. Our group had tableside guacamole, which was good, but maybe had too much tomato. 

The menu has a bunch of Michoacan food, which is amazing. It's divided up by beef, chicken, seafood, and pork, with traditional Mexican stuff, too.  I had ranchero-style Octopus, which was in an amazing sauce. The rice and beans were awesome. I also tasted another diner's Mole Poblano, which is easily the best mole that I've ever had. 

I had a "Javier's" margarita, which was top-notch. A bunch of folks had margaritas or daiquiris. They must have two hundred tequilas at the bar. 

We finished with their great Churros. Everyone loved it!
