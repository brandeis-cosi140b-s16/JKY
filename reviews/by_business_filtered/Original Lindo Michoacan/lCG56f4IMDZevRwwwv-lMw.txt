Came in on a Saturday night around 7:30 and the place was jam packed. Luckily we managed to snag a couple seats at the bar. 

I had the Don Francisco which was a steak served with tortillas, rice and beans and a small scoop of guacamole. It was nothing to write home about. The steak was quite tough, but most steaks at mexican places usually are. The rice and beans were standard fare. The tortillas were fresh and very tasty. Most dinner specials come with a small cup of soup which was pretty yummy. It was a tomato based broth with vermicelli. Strange but tasty.

I had a regular margarita and a top shelf margarita and couldn't really tell the difference between the two. My friend had several beers and they ended up comp'ing our drinks because we both played video poker. Pretty cool!

The restaurant itsself was very loud because it was so busy, but the mariachi band was entertaining. The view of the city was awesome.

Overall a decent place - definitely not the best I've had, but a fun atmosphere nonetheless.
