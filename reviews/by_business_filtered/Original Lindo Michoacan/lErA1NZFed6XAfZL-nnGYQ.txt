Best Mexican Restaurant!! I have been coming here for years and it's still amazing. The food is always so good. I usually order some shrimp dish..I try too change it up. Beans are amazing and you can tell everything is fresh. Everything I order..not one thing I didn't like. They also have great kids meals too. Friendly staff as well.

I have noticed the prices have gone up but it's well worth! I have been too the one in Henderson and this location seems too be a bit better. So good!!
