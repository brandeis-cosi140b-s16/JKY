Always a "must eat" whenever we're in Vegas.  This is such a fun place with a menu that you can't go wrong with.  Everything we've eaten here has always been sabroso!  Here are some tips:

1) Love the bean dip & Salsa 
2) I'm not usually a fan of ordering chicken at restaurants but they have some awesome chicken dishes
3) Mango Margarita...yummm

Service is always fantastic and sometimes they even have live music :)
