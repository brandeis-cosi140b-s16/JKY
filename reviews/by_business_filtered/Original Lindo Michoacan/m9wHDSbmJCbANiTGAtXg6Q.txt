Really good family owned restaurant.  Home made tortillas, waiters really knock themselves out to make sure your dining experience is everything it can be.
I ordered a burrito- it was HUGE.  I have no small appetite and was only able to eat about 1/4 of it.
We ordered guacamole- really yummy.  They make it up for you at the table.  We had some who like spicy, some mild, he made two bowls- one of each.
My husband had chiles rellenos (his yardstick by which he rates any and all Mexican restaurants) and gives them a full five stars.
Knocking off a couple of stars for the following:
AC was off for most of our visit.  I don't care how good the food is, if you're uncomfortable the overall experience suffers.
We had to relocate to another booth because we were sardined in.  The next table over had ample room for the 4 of us. 
The soup they serve to everyone at the beginning of the meal reminds me of Lipton noodle soup. Bleh.
