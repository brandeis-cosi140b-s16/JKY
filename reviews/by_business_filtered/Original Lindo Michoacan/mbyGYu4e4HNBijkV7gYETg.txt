Not the best mexican food I've ever had but so far for Vegas this is the spot.. 

Our 1st experience was for dinner over a year ago & our 2nd experience was about a month ago for lunch. 2nd experience much better than 1st..lol.

Personally I think the dinner menu is too big of portions for me & not enough items I like.. It was evening so atmosphere was very dark, also very loud & crowded.. We were in a both by a 20 top..lol. Couldn't even here ourselves talk to each other..  but that's okay.. thats what type of ambiance goes with authentic Mexican joints :) food was so so.. My husband found musclely stringy tendon type meat in his beef.. & was pretty grossed out to say the least.


Buuuuuut we have recently went back for lunch.. just randomly stopped in. And it was amazing! food was fresh, service was great & lunch menu was just right for me 

We LOVE their hot suace they give you with chips. We love how spicy it is.  

FYI they charge for refills.. meals come with a drink & one refill..
