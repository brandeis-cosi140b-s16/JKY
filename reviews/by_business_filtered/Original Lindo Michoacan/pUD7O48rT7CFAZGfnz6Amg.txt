I have been coming here for years. Great food, great prices and the staff is always so nice. 
Even when I order something as simple as the tacos I'm always pleased. 

Their guacamole has this unique kick to it that I just love. 

I love when the mariachi band cruses the dining room. I never find it annoying. :) It makes for a festive experiance!
