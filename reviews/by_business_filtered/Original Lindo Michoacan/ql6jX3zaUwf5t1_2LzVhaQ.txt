We stopped in for dinner tonight and I was underwhelmed (sadly). The food was good for the most part but it was the service that was a major letdown. 

One of the "drinks" we ordered, a simple glass of ice, never came. I even asked a second time but it did me no good. We also never got our sopa de fideo that comes with each meal. After our dinner arrived we saw very little of our waiter. Honestly the bus boy gave better service and more of it. Had to wait for the check too. In extreme circumstances this may be understandable but it didn't even seem like the place was packed. 

The saving grace was the food. Both the pork and chicken were tasty. I also enjoyed the salsa verde and my family seemed to enjoy their meals. They were a little skimpy on the rice and beans and the guacamole lacked some flavors IMO (salt, lime, cilantro) but it wasn't anything worth fussing over. It's a shame that the service was such a letdown. Good food + bad service = a poor dining experience. Bummer...
