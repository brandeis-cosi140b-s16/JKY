Our favorite Mexican restaurant in Vegas! 

They serve delicious complimentary chips, salsa, warm bean dip and soup with tomato broth and pasta. The portions are huge. Lots of fresh veggies in the rice. My husband ordered steak--the waiter had the chef grill a second steak because the first was overcooked. I loved the shredded beef taco. 

Their lunch specials last until 5:00 (for vegas partiers who wake up late) and are half the price of dinners. 

The restaurant is nicely decorated with authentic colorful pottery, glass sconces, pots, fountains, comfortable booths and solid wood tables and chairs. The servers wear traditional clothes and were all friendly. 

Free lollipops for dessert!
