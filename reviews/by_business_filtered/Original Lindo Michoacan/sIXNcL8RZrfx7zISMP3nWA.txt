Service is excellent the moment we arrived til we left. The signature pork carnitas platter was edible, but a little dry and tough. The rice was dry as well. The guacamole was very fresh. The combo #1 was better with an excellent chile rilleno, but dry chicken enchilada, and a good taco. The house mango and peach were excellent. The dessert menu was disappointing since they had no tres leces cake instead a cheesecake? A lunch on saturday for $61 plus $12 tip is not worth going back to.
