First time visiting few nights ago, and was impressed. Bean dip was tasty, but salsa decent. Friend from Texas said "Bah, better in Texas!" but his nachos could have fed at least three people, and my steak quesadilla which turned into a shrimp 'dilla somewhere between the waiter and my plate, was outstanding. Would order shrimp 'dilla again, for sure, despite the mix-up. I heard their peach margaritas are notable, too. Will find out next time.
