Excellent food - great service - Funky Pimp Juice 

I ate here over the weekend with the help my favorite Chowhounder (see: http://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=4TByNfzySEQ0K9nglTaJzQ ) - Jim C..  He seems to find the gems with the help of the obscure tools of the chowhound site...

Pros:  
Awesome tasty food
Great service - Noe Rocks!
Live music (Friday night)
Locals, locals, locals...

Cons:
weak margaritas

Highly recommended!  For out-of-towners this is worth the drive or the cab-ride!
