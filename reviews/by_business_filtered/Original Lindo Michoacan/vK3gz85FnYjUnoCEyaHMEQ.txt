This place is decent. I took my order to go, so I can't comment on the restaurant itself. The food was good though. It was about as good as any other Mexican restaurant. One particular thing I liked about this place was the Pollo llora hor, llora manana. It was the spiciest dish I have ever had! I loved this dish with the rest of the meal, but I did not care for the taste of the ghost chilis. They have kind of a burnt taste. However, mixed with the beans and rice this dish is delicious. Just be sure to keep a powerful antacid near by for afterwards! That chicken is no joke!
