This Restaurant is like Heaven, The Food is really good, and the Staff there are really nice. A lot of people though. My family and i Visited Lindo Michoacan this past Summer because of the Review But we had to Wait for a about 20 minutes. We were about to leave. But then they found a great table for us. I got to see how the hand made tortillas were made from that Table.( They got alot of Kool Mexican decorations. Lindo Michoacan doesn't disappoint, But over all its The Best Mexican restaurant in Nevada
