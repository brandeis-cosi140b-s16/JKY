A friend from work highly recommended this place and you know what, he was right.  Original Lindo Michoacan was fantastic!  Our waiter quickly brought our drinks and some complimentary hot chips, salsa and bean dip while we looked over the menu.  Now while I could have gotten full just eating those wonderfully hot chips and dip, I had to stop myself from eating them all up so I could save room for all the other food we ordered.  We went with the Queso Fundido with Chorizo, the Enchilada Tarasca and some Carnitas a la Mexicana.  

Omg the food was glorious!  Super flavorful, filling and tasty.  I only wish I could have eaten more.  The Queso Fundido was the most deliciously gooey combination of cheese and spices.  I wish every day I could eat me some of that cheesy goodness.  And yes I do love cheese that much.  Then my lunch special that included an enchilada filled with cheese, beef and chicken ... drool worthy.  

Everything and I do mean everything I tasted was delicious.  In fact I was only planning on eating half of my food and taking the other half to go to eat later, but that didn't happen.  The food here was just too good.  My friend, who is a pretty picky Mexican food lover, absolutely devoured all of his as well.  We both thouroughly enjoyed eating here. 

I will definitely be back the next time I'm in Las Vegas.
