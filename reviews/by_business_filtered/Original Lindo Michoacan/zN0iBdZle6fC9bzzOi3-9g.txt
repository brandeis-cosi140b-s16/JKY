The original Lindo Michoacan! Although I've only ate at this location, I've heard you can't eat at any other location but this one. It does not compare.

This place is uhhmaaazing. Hands down, the best shrimp ceviche in town. It has the perfect amount of lime juice in it. The perfect amount of shrimp. No one else compares!

I love how when you order guacamole they make is fresh. So fresh that they make it right in front of you. And let me tell you, one of the best guacamoles I have ever tasted. When they make it, they make plenty. I had to actually take it to go. And the day after guac taste just as good!

They also always bring out a cup of their soup. Very simple but very tasteful. 

When going to a mexican restaurant you always have to order a Margarita! I got a Mango Margarita. It was so good. They put lucas on the ring of the cup. Bomb.

Service was good. Nothing to complain about. Great place to get my mexican fix.
