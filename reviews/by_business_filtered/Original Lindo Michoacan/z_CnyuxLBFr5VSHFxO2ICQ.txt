This expansive restaurant offers an authentic Mexican experience. It's traditionally decorated, with many tables and low-lit booths for romantic dining. Though if you're planning lots of convo with your lover, request a seat toward the back, because a mariachi band plays live music. Better yet, stop yapping and listen while kicking back with a cocktail because the band kicks ass! These are pros, folks, playing violins, trumpet, guitars--super tight, with festive songs and beautiful singing for the ballads. 

The service was attentive, efficient, and friendly; waitstaff never far. The food is just right for the price point. I had a steak enchilada with the house mole, dark and rich, with subtle layers of cocoa, nuts and spice ($15.95) My date had Gallo al Conac ($16.95). Don't know how it was made but he was swooning over it. The house margarita is $9 each. We paid $4 more apiece for the jumbo (make it a double!). Fried ice-cream, aka Lindo Flameado ($8.25), was the logical and delicious choice for dessert. We were celebrating my friend's birthday on a Friday night, so it was the perfect fiery and fantastic ending to our meal. He blew out the flames shortly after dessert arrived and made a wish. He didn't let the liquor burn off on its own, so a very rummy spoonful was his reward, lol!
