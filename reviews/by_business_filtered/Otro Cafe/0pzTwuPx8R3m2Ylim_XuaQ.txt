USED to love Otro. However after an awful experience with service I'm done with them. I emailed the owner to give him feedback on my poor experience. He promptly responded. His response was apologetic and positive. He offered to send me a gift certificate for which I was very thankful. Great way to redeem yourself and your business to a regular guest! Well..... Not so much. A month went by and no gift certificate. I contacted the owner again and was told "sure! We'll get that right out to you."  A few weeks later and nada. As I scroll through reviews there seems to be MANY issues with service. Get it together Otro. You've lost someone who loved your food. Too bad so sad.
