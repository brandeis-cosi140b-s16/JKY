I have been regretting the thought of writing this review, but feel I need to in hopes Otro can meet its promise.  We have been regulars (at least weekly) at Otro for over a year.  We preferred its former sister restaurant - Gallo Blanco - as it always had better food and service, but Otro is in our neighborhood.  We had hoped the closing of Gallo Blanco would bring its higher standards to Otro, but the exact opposite has occurred.  The food at Otro used to be good and now has taken a step down in quality and consistency.  The service at Otro has always been mediocre, but has become awful; always inattentive and often bordering on rude.  We are taking Otro out of our regular restaurant rotation for now - but hope we hear from others that it has turned the corner and is worthy of another try.
