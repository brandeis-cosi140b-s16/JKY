It's good to know that the cuisine of the now defunct Gallo Blanco can still be experienced in this cafe. It's also a great place for happy hour. The atmosphere is casual and relaxed and the staff is friendly and efficient. I think my main grouse is that the tacos are made only with (wheat) flour tortillas - which is a shame because a lot of people, myself included, prefer street tacos with the traditional corn tortillas.
