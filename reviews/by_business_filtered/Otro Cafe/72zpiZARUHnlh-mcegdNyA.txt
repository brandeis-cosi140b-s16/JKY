Went here a few years ago when it was more tapas style for dinner and thought it was ok.  But now that ive relocated to phx went back to try the brunch. 

Let me start with - i really enjoy Gallo Blanco. Id say that spot is one of those restaurants you can always go to and be satisfied. So i like the pedigree that Otro comes from. 

Two words describes my experience: amateur hour. 

Went with a party of 8. Called ahead and when we got there the restaurant was maybe half full.  Server didnt seem with it.  For example. A majority of us ordered coffee. We would finish. Then one of us would ask for a refill. He would then refill the one cup, then disappear.  Why didnt he ask if anyone else needed more? Another example. One of our party oreered hot tea. Brought a dirty mug. Told him - honest mistake - came back with a copper mug for a moscow mule.  Welp. Hot drink. Copper cup. Not possible to hold. That information didnt really register with him when we tried to explain.  He was more focused on the fact that it was clean. 

Anyways. We ordered chilaquiles and tortas and pancakes and huevos rancheros. Literally took 45 minutes.  Pancake came out undercooked and room temp. Not to mention a sad spot where a pad of butter USED to be.  Huevos rancheros also room temp. Side of beans were hard crusted on top. Basically tells me it was sitting in the window for awhile. The chilaquiles were fine. Torta was ok. 

Overall a dissappointing experience. Server was more work for us. Food was a bummer. 

Oh well. I dont recommend this place.
