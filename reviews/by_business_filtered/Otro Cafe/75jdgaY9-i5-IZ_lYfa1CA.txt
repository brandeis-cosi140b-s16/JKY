I have been to Otro twice.  Upon arrival I am very clear with the server that I am vegan.  I ask for recommendations and I also read the menu very carefully before ordering.  On both visits I have been served dishes with cheese on top despite stating that I am vegan and making necessary modifications when ordering.  This is very frustrating and requires sending food back even though I am very precise with my order to avoid having to do so.  People with dietary needs should be accommodated with no problem
