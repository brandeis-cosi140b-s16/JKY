I'm glad that fellow Yelpers look out for each other because otherwise I probably wouldn't have ever found out about this awesome place. Appearently Otro Cafe is owned by the same person as the Gallio Blanco and for some reason (not complaining at all) this place serves their delicious tacos in home made flour tortillas. Big win for me as I so much loved the ingredients in the tacos at GB but absolutely cannot stand corn tortillas. I was so excited to find out about this place that I had to go almost right away and I'm glad I did. 
Love their carne sada tacos, they are officially my favorite tacos ever!! Bonus, our waiter was super friendly and they had cool rooster art on the walls. I now have a new food to crave while I'm sitting at home. Cannot wait to go back!
