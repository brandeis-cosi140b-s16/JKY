I love that more and more empty storefronts in strip malls are being re-purposed. And especially when a new eatery goes in, right? 

Otro is the brainchild of Doug Robson of Gallo Blanco fame (another awesome restaurant in Central Phoenix) and showcases his amazing talent for preparing Mexican cuisine; but don't expect Otro to be a clone of Gallo Blanco. The space has a lot of exposed brick, and lots of windows/skylights. The kitchen is open to the dining area and there is an atmosphere of urban energy, yet comfortable and unpretentious.

A friend and I met up at Otro for lunch, and we both ordered the Asado Chicken Salad. This is not your average greens with sliced chicken breast....boring. This salad was packed with flavor. The spices on the grilled chicken was so flavorful, but not overpowering. The greens included spinach, shredded cabbage and romaine. There were chunks of apples which added a great texture and complimented the chicken. The dressing was a peanut vinaigrette which added another layer of flavor.

This is definitely a place worth returning to, either for a weekend breakfast, happy hour or dinner!
