Solid contemporary cafe right off of 7st just north of Bethany home. This is my second time here for Sunday brunch. Both times I ordered the Ceviche to start and Huevos Rancheros for the main course. These Mexican style dishes were good both times. Definitely more of a modern style Mexican dish for both items. The customer service fro the hostess to the weigh-tress makes everything very pleasant. I highly recommend his spot for anyone in the area. As an added bonus kids eat free and the kids plate has plenty food for any child hungry. Don't forget to order the tea!!
