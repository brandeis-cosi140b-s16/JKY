We've specifically hit up Otro Cafe for breakfast/brunch on a few occasions simply because the wait was non-existent versus 40+ minutes elsewhere (even when we were driving to Otro, the line at Denny's was out the door! -- Come on, people!). Each time our visit has been a success. The chiliquiles are one of their more popular breakfast items and definitely worth a try, for my two cents. 

Also big ups to the service at Otro. They're always on the ball and right on time with everything from drink orders, to refills, to clearing the table. All in all, I just highly recommend this place if you are looking for a good breakfast experience but don't require the place to be on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives -- because Otro seems to be a little too good for that nonsense.
