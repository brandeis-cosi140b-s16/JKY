Mediocre at best. 

Came here for a late Mother's Day lunch with my husband and son. The place was fairly packed so we took it as a good sign. I ordered the trio enchiladas and my husband ordered a carne asada Torta. We were craving tacos as well so we decided to share 3 al pastor tacos. Service was incredibly slow. Yes it was Mother's Day but we had arrived at around 1:30, a time when most of the crowd was dying out and the place wasn't even really packed to begin with. 

We waited for about 30 minutes for our food to come out and were very disappointed. The black beans had no flavor whatsoever and the rice was also pretty bland. None of the dishes had enough meat. My husband said the torta was okay but did not taste like carne asada. It was mainly bread and hardly any meat. The same with my chicken enchiladas. They hardly had any cheese or chicken. I just kept cutting into tortillas soaked in sauce. When we tried the al pastor tacos. 

We saw they incorporated pineapple chunks into it. Again, hardly any meat and most of it was pineapple. They should have been called pineapple tacos. I didn't mind the pineapples in there, but my husband picked them out. 

I feel that sometimes, places like these try too hard to be different by changing something that really works into something totally different and disappointing. 

Over all, I would not come here again. It's overpriced, bland, Americanized food with not so great service.
