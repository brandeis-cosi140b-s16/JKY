This place was AMAZING! Our server Betsy was very helpful with the menu, was always smiling and energetic. I had the shrimp taco, carne a sad a and Al pastor taco. They were very good and super tasty. This place has a great urban, lofty atmosphere. Overall I had a great time and awesome food with great service!
