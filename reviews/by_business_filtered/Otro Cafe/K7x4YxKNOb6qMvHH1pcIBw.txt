This is an easy 5 stars! On my first visit ordered the carne asada torte; so delicious, flavorful with an amazingly good bun and very filling -  couldn't even finish (rare for me); a great sandwich to share with someone. On second visit,  I ordered the carne asada, vegetable and el pastor soft tacos.  All were excellent; the vegetable one absolutely divine; when your food arrives, the presentation alone makes you smile and fills you with confidence. This is a seriously good restaurant.  

The guacamole alone is worth the trip to Otro! 
Can't wait to go back!
