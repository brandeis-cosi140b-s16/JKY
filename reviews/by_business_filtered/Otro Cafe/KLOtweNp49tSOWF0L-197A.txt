We've been to Otro many times. Stick with the tacos or the chorizo and egg dishes.  They are consistently delicious. The margaritas are good.  The guacamole is good and sometimes excellent and the chips are crisp.  We have had one bad experience there but the situation was immediately addressed by a manager and the bill was graciously adjusted.  Service is usually excellent and the atmosphere is cool. Sit at the bar and watch the bartender make drinks - it will give you an appreciation for how hard thy work and what goes into some of their drinks.  Didn't care much for the paella but on the whole we like just about everything else.   (Sit away from the west facing windows in the late afternoon as it is hot!). This is a perfect place for a casual dinner. The background noise is low so you can enjoy conversation and the food.
