Fantastic margarita!! Seriously amazing and fresh...no crap ingredients like sweet & sour mix. 

The food though...meh. I had the Del Campo omelet and it was nothing to write home about. My husband had the breakfast burrito and said it was decent, but he wasn't overly impressed. The food took a while too...like a long while which was annoying b/c we had already waited so long for a table. It was around noon on a Saturday and we waited like 30 mins for a table. Funny thing is, no one was ahead of us. We were next to be seated, but no one was leaving the place. Not the restaurant's fault...just annoying. Overall we were at Otro Caf√© for like 90 mins. We just wanted brunch and to be on our way, but instead ended up hanging out way longer than we wanted to or planned on.
