Great service and food.  The only reason I did not give it five stars was I ordered the chicken soup to go, and the description on the menu says it has snow peas in the soup, but when I got it home no peas :(   But that is just one minor error.  Truthfully this place has REALLY good tacos, chips, guacamole, entrees, etc. that you can't help but love this place.  We are already planning on going there again soon.  And for anyone reading reviews of mexican food places on 7th street - all I can say is stay away from Gadzooks on 7th street and venture down the road a little to this gem of a restaurant.  It's worth the drive.
