I could eat every meal at Otro and never get tired of the food. Otro serves up big, unique flavors in a casual/comfy environment. Otro serves up especially good options for vegetarians. I've had:

- Otro Salad: Yum! Sort of like the kitchen sink of salads but everything tastes really good together and the large size is meal-worthy with a little something extra.
- Arugula & Quinoa Salad: Solid Mexican flavors rounded out by the bite of arugula and the creaminess of avocado. It's more quinoa than a lettuce type salad.
- Vegetable Tacos: One of the best tacos ever! The tortillas are soft & fresh. The filling is in-your-face-delicious - sort of like a mexican curry of flavors.
- Guacamole: Really good but a little on the spicy side.
