The food we had was very tasty and reasonably priced. We had in house specially cocktails that were delicious!  I did try the molè and I've had much better but everyone has different opinions on molè,  my wife liked it. We enjoy the food at the Clarendon downtown and I was glad to hear that this is owned by the same people! Definitely worth trying
