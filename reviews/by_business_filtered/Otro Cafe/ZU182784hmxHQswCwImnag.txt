I'd like to give them five stars, but the service the last time made me go down to 4. The waiter seemed in a hurry and rarely checked up on us. 

Other than that, their food is really good. I love their tortillas. Very much similar to Gallo Blanco. Gallo Blanco's guacamole is just much better. Last time I went, their michelada was watered down and warm. :( I love my micheladas and was very dissatisfied. 

Would go back! Please keep your glasses cold for the micheladas. And the chips! Please keep them warm. No one likes a warm beer and cold chips.
