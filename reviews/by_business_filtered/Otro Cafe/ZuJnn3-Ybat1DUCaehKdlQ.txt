It started brilliantly with a trio playing in the foyer while we had a short wait for our table. Great nachos and guacamole to start, followed by tasty mains and a yummy flourless chocolate cake. Friendly, attentive service, nice space and excellent pricing. A hidden gem and one our faves in Arizona.
