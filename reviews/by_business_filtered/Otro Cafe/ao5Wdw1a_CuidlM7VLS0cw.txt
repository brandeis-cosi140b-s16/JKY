Went here for brunch this past weekend. I really like this space and their menu looked amazing. I opted for their Chilaquiles. I am a HUGE fan of Chilaquiles and these did not disappoint. You can have Chicken or Veggies with this dish. I went with the Veggies. I got my eggs scrambled and they were light and fluffy and brought this dish together. I also got a coffee and I really liked that they serve their coffee with a french press. I did think the coffee could have been better, but this did not effect my review at all. It was just one piece of criticism I would offer up. I will definitely be back to try more dishes. I give this place two thumbs up.
