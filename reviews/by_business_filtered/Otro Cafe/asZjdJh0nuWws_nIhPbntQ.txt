Went in a second time and actually tried something different. I had the Guac (of course) and an, Al Pastor Taco. I always eat too much when I go here or Gallo so I just got the one taco. It was delicious and I am not usually a fan of pork. I then had to get the Coconut Pudding, which like my previous review noted, is outstanding. Funny thing is I still left stuffed. 

I also enjoyed the service. The waitress and I shared a history lesson and the background behind Al Pastor. Hmmm, Shawarma, who knew?  Thanks to Smart Phones everything called, "info" is at the touch of a button. lol 

I really think this is the best Mexican Restaurant in the valley. Note, I said Mexican, not what Americans think Mexican is.
