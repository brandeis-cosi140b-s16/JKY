I love the food here and normally the service is ok. Today for some reason it was not very good at all. The day I decide to bring my friend to try it out, she is left with a poor impression of the place. We walk in, restaurant is about half full, we see a couple of open tables on the patio so we request patio seating with the person that greeted us. They look outside and tell us it'll be 5 minutes for them to get something ready for us. Well within the 15 that we actually waited 3 other staff members asked if we had been helped, to them we replied that we were waiting for an outside table (that had been clear and open the whole time). Finally we are taken to our table. Our friendly server took our drink order and gave us a few minutes to look over the menu. She comes to take our order and we ask for some chips and salsa as well. Well the chips didn't come until our food arrived even though we stopped another staff member to check on our chip order. My friends coffee was served cold and the refill I asked for on my Arnold Palmer was never brought out. Even though the staff was friendly, they never once concerned themselves for our discontentment. I don't often come here but not sure I'll be back anytime soon sadly. My friend was less than pleased with her first experience here. My meal was delicious though!
