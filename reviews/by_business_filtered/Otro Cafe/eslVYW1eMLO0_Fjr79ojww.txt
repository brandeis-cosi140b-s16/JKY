We visited Gallo Blanco last time we were in Phx and were sad to hear it is temporarily closed, but found Otro instead.  We thought the Carne asada was very good (we got it without beans).  We also ordered the Mole Negro (half chicken) which was very tasty.  The salsa verde with the chips was excellent (and while you get charged for the chips, it was only $1).  Thought the price of the burritos was very good, but probably wouldn't order the chicken ago (a little pricey, I thought).  Had the AZ Margarita which was very good.  Our waitress was attentive; our burrito was incorrectly made with beans and she was back at the table to check in on us shortly after our lunches were served and then our new one came out very quickly.
