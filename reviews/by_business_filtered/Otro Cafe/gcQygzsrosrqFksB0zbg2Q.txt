Hit this place up last week with my boyfriend. First of all, I love that they're open until 10pm on weekdays. Most restaurants like this are closed by 9pm. First impression on menu items is that they're fairly cheap. Items are around $9 on average. Chips and salsa are free! Score. Since it's the same owner/chef as Gallo Blanco, the food is very similar. But I think the prices are much more reasonable. I had the asado chicken salad - portion size was good, I couldn't finish it. It was extremely tasty and I promptly inhaled it. Boyfriend had the pollo asado. Also quite tasty and he ate the entire thing like a fat kid. Our server was extremely pleasant and pretty funny too. Overall, we had a great evening and intend on returning!
