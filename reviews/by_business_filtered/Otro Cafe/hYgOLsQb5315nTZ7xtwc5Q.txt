This place is so delicious! It's such a chill environment dress up or don't it's totally up to you. And the food.... Well it's delicious south-Mexico style food. You must try The Espa√±ol for an appetizer but you can never go wrong with the guacamole either. And the paella is just delicious but be prepared for left-overs! Oh and don't forget the drinks, Bloody Michelada or a Margarita, both are great!
