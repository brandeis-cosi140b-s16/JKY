I went on a Saturday during Happy Hour and it was not busy at all. It is a quaint atmosphere and is very simple. The Happy Hour is awesome- $1.00 off specific food and drink items. We enjoyed the tacos and the corn, which were all very good and started with chips and salsa which was also yummy The sangria was a bit strong and way too much fruit. I had never heard of the place until I found out about Guillo Blanco and its location is kind of hidden in a strip mall. I would go back there again.
