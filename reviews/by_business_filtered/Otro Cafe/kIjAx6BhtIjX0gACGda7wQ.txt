I have only tried this once, and that was takeout at 4pm in the afternoon.  So, the jury's out on the service in the restaurant.  What I can tell you is, having had the carne asada burrito, I will be back.  The flavor was otherworldly!  That charred ribeye flavor, juiciness, heavenly, spicy red salsa...the food would make me come back alone.  But I also enjoyed the service of Katie at the front desk.  She was very pleasant and efficient.  Thank you!
