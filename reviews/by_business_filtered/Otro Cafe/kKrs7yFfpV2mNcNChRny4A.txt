We generally quite enjoy this local place and eat here regularly.  Tonight the food was good as usual however my husband was seated in a chair that was covered with water. We then found that the table had a leg problem and was so uneven we had to move to another table. This is probably how the water spilled in the first place. There was water all over the floor we found as we switched tables. Even after telling our server about these issues they did not clean up the floor, fix the table or offer any courtesy for my husbands pants now being soaked. I was sort of amazed they didn't offer any compensation as most restaurants would. A little later we watched as they sat another couple at the same table who started dealing with the broken table immediately. They also brought the entrees out too fast as we were just starting our appetizer.  I have to agree with others that there doesn't seem to be a manager overseeing things. Unfortunate for Otro, as there are so many other choices in the area.
