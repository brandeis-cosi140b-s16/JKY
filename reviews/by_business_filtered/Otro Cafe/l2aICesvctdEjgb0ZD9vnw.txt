I looked up the spanish word "cojeta" this morning because I read that Otro puts "cojeta" on their pancakes and I have been craving the flap jacks for weeks on end. Cojeta seems to be carmelized goat milk and in pictures, looks like one of the most delicious liquids on earth. So, I rushed over there to see for myself.   If you were to compare a pancake to fabric, these would be 100 % double ply cashmere and what a buy for $7.50.! I was worried when it said on the menu, 2 flap jacks, because while being a small female, I have an enormous appetite (so I'm told :)) But they filled the entire large plate and that glorious "cojeta" was crisscrossed all over the top and seemed to soak right into the pancake. There was a large dollop of creme fraiche on top with some cooked peanuts sprinkled about. Hands down, these were the BEST PANCAKES I have ever had! Melt in your mouth perfection!
