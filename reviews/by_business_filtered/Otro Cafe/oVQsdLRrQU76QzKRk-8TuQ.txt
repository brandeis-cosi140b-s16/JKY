The genius behind Gallo Blanco has opened up a new spot and we stopped by for Paella!  I had been looking for a good paella since my trip to Madrid and I have to admit I still miss my dish.. I will say that the mexican paella was pretty damn good! When you have great ingredients you have a shot at good food and when you marry that with this chef's touch you have success. They have similar dishes to Gallo Blanco but I appreciate the blend and uniqueness of plates like the Espa√±ol that change things up enough to make this another stop in my Mexican stops.  Try out the arroz con coco desert too, it was awesome!
