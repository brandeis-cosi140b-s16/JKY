This place is sweet and spicy, but had no idea it existed! Very close to the Biltmore area, this will be a new go to Mexican restaurant. Started with the chips, salsa and guacamole and everything was great - salsa comes in the squeeze bottles.

Ordered the fish tacos and the otro salad with Carne asada and both were delicious! The staff are extremely friendly and helpful when I was making my dinner entree decision. I will definitely be back shortly to discover the other dishes that people are raving about. Oh yeah, the margaritas are perfect - fresh and tasty!
