We ordered the guacamole...good taste but not mixed so there were bites that had too much hot spice.  The waiter recommended the goat tacos.  The tacos were dry and the meat likewise.  My friend ordered a salad with chicken.  It came with ham.   There was a discussion with the waiter about the fact that we ordered with chicken....and he huffed away.  We asked them to forget the salad order.   When the check came, would have expected there to be an accommodation for the fact that one member of the party had no dinner.  Instead, they said "we took off the salad".  Really?  
Overall...expensive....mediocre food.  Better restaurants in central Phoenix.
