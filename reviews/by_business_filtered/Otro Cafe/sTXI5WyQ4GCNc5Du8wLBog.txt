I really wanted to like this place... But there are so many things wrong with this place, as well as the ratings I saw here (which led me to visit the place and be disappointed). The service is so slow. The waiters left me sitting there for at least 15 minutes before they even came to ask if I needed anything. I get they're trying to do a modern take on Mexican food, but seriously the food isn't all that. The rice is too crunchy. Like extremely. But I guess that's what "modern Mexican" cuisine is. The mole is far from tasting good. I would say that the tortillas tasted very good and freshly made. I like the ambiance of the place, but I expect more bang for my buck. Sorry
