When I pulled up to this place, I broke my first rule of dining:

Never eat at a place with more wait staff than tables with customers. 

I found the food to be between 3.5 to 4.5 stars, depending on the dish, enough points to earn my revisit. However, the customer service was below 1 star. I read similar reviews stating the food is great but the service sucks, which couldn't be more true. My interaction was with one waitress in particular who forgot our drink order, then forgot our food order, then forgot to bring us chips and water (4 times she mentioned she would get the chips before they actually arrived). 

For food, I recommend the carne asada tacos which were delicious. I would pass on the nachos or anything that requires chips to eat since they are not freshly prepared. 

For service, I recommend not coming at all. Maybe.. Maybe get it to go if it is offered. But I can't stress enough how bad the service is to warrant a 1 star review  

Thank you for reading.
