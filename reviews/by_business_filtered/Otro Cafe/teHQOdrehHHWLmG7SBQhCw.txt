Liked it when I first walked in. Disclaimer: my wife gave it 3 1/2 and liked the food but didn't like the service. We went for lunch and it wasn't packed but still had to wait. We shared the Otro salad, split the carne asada burrito and split an al pastor taco. I thought they had cheap ingredients in the salad and they skimped on the kale...in place there was a ton of cabbage, which looked it came out of a frys bag...with corn nuts that were sparse and cubed avocado. They also skimped on the steak in the burrito and had a ton of beans...the steak that was there didn't have much flavor. Most of the food was bland, which my wife liked...she likes a little less flavor or punch. She thought the taco was ok... However, it greased out more than a New York slice and I would way rather have Americas taco shop al pastor. I didn't get the enchiladas because they were 14 for three and I wanted to try more options...all in all seems like a good decision now. I liked the tomatillo sauce for chips but the red salsa was all spice and no flavor. Maybe there are other items on the menu worth trying but with so many better options in the valley and the price tag here, I think I'll stay away.
