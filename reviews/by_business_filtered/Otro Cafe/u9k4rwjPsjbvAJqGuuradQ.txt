Okay, this place is high in hype, low in everything else. I've never liked the food much- everything is bland and overpriced. It's way too noisy inside- even in a place that's pretty low-key you can't hear across the table. Or be heard by the poor wait staff. On that note, I've experienced more than one slightly off waitress. They're just aloof enough to bug you. I guess the decor is nice. I like the paintings by local artists and the patio would be nice in cooler weather. Not that I'll go back to find out.
