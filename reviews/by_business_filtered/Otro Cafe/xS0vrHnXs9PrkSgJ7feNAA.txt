The service and food here is phenomenal! Typically I order the Posole and wash it down with a michelada. This place definitely has a fusion to it so it's not very traditional Mexican food. For example, the micheladas have dill in them. They are very tasty but it's different. 
The server informed us that this restaurant has no electrical/gas stoves so everything is wood fired. You can smell the amazing-ness the moment you walk in
