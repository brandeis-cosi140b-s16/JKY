YES!  

Very good...exactly what you expected (and needed, even if you didn't know you needed it!)

Cute little building just out of site of the street - quaint even.  Shared a shrimp burrito which was full of fresh cabbage and plump yummy shrimp...and a green chili pork burrito that was brimming with pork and beans and cheese.  The tortilla's had a  little crispy edge to them.  Delicious chips and salsa.  Topped off with a Pacifico for each of us.  

Definitely will be back!
