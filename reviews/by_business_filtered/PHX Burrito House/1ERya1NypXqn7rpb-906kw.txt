One of the best burritos I have ever had.  One thing that really stood out to me was that the rice was properly cooked and seasoned, which you do not find to often.  There are always some hard pieces due to being stale or being under cooked.  I got the grilled chicken burrito with black beans.  Everything came together very nicely and it has a unique flavor.  The only complaint I could see people having is that their salsa is really nothing special.  So if you ordered chips and salsa that might be a problem.  I did not find this to be a problem however since the burrito was flavorful enough that I did not need to drench it in salsa like I do at some other places.  Cool unique little dining area too and the employes were all very friendly.  I love places like this with simple menus, that do not do a whole lot, but what they do, they do very well.  I will be back often.
