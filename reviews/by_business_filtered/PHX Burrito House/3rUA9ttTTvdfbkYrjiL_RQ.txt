Margaritas were tasty & AWESOME--Right amount of flavor and punch!! Love that they carry Jarritos which doesn't use High Fructose Corn Syrup. CHIPS AND SALSA GOOD. QUESADILLA EXCELLENT! The burrito?--Well That is another story. I ordered the "House Favorite", which comes with eggs, grilled onions, potatoes, and cheese. While the cheese was melted nicely--The eggs were overcooked-- I asked for both pinto and black beans and I only received a small amount of pinto. The potatoes were soft enough but lacked flavor and were pilled in and overpowered all the other ingredients and my burrito didnt taste fresh---I am guessing they don't clean their grill regularly because it smelled like "other" ingredients and made my burrito taste "un-fresh" Overall it was one of those DRY burritos. I got through a whole saucer of salsa to make up for the dryness until I said enough is enough. I wouldnt come here for breakfast burritos but YES TO THE MARGARITAS! I honestly like Taquiera Los Yaquis WAY better!
