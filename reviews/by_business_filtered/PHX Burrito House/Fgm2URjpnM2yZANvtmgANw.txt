Happened on to this place because one of our favorite breakfast burrito places closed.  Omgoodness,  fabulous smothered green chile breakfast burrito!  The people are awesome.  Definitely,  a new favorite! ! The ingredients are very fresh,  the place is clean.  I loved that they used fresh jalape√±os . Just can't say enough about this little diamond in the rough. Love it.
