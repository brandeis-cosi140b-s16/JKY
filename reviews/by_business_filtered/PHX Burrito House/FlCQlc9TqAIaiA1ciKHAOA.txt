I've been hearing great things about this place and unfortunately, I was underwhelmed. I stopped by on Sunday and ordered 2 burritos to go. I was told it was going to be a 15 minute wait. I don't mind waiting for good food, so I placed my order and waited. My order was brought out to me and I raced home in extreme anticipation. Both burritos were wrong. My bf got chicken, beans, rice, sc, guac, cheese and lettuce. His was missing the guac, sour cream and cheese. I ordered a carne asada with everything. What I received was a carne burrito with only rice and beans. It was bland and some of the carne was gristly. The rice was overdone and the tortillas were made with waaay too much lard. Sorry, first impressions make a big difference to me and I will not be going back.
