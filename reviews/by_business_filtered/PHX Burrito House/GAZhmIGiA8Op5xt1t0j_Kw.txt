This was amazing. Oddly, it was far down the list on my mobile app, but I'll be forever grateful that I ran mutt search through the full site. There a few food items I've come across in my travels that I'll chase for my life: California figs, Belgian fries and now, Phoenix burritos. Ate the house special breakfast burrito,  awesome filings but the star of the meal was undoubtedly the actual tortilla.  Wow.  Excellent value and well worth the research!
