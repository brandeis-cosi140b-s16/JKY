I had the chicken burrito- very tasty with the perfect amount of sour cream and a good deal of meat.  Tortilla was a little undercooked but I was happy to know it was fresh!  Hubs had carne asada burrito and he liked it a lot.  Very flavorful meat but not tender enough for me.... Salsa had a good kick and the chips were good but not warm.  We'll definitely eat here again!  The service was really incredible.  The woman treated us like we were there every night for dinner.  She was incredibly attentive to everyone in there and was commenting on people's new hair styles and everything.  You could tell she knows the regulars and that was so refreshing... It's the kind of service you expect in melrose and being that the place hasn't been there forever it was great to see it!!   Big I could rate on service alone I would give 5 stars... But for a burrito place I'd say it was not incredible not worthy of revisiting.
