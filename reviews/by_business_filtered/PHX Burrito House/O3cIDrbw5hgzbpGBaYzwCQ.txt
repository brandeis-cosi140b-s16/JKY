I've grown up being spoiled with burritos from Arizona and Southern California. I like my burritos big, cheap, and a little bit dirty (like the rare type of females that are into me). What Arizona is missing over places like San Diego, though, is a signature burrito. Over there, it's the California burrito. I have yet to find a good Cali burrito out here in Phoenix. However, PHX Burrito House has the next best thing. Their PHX Especial is absolutely delicious. The potatoes are high quality, great in texture, and not overbearing. The grilled onions and jalepenos are nice and crunchy. Spice is low, but they have some good salsa and hot sauce available. The eggs add great flavor without making it too breakfast-y. There's also some cheese, but not too much. The burrito itself is NOT a drippy mess; it actually feels like you are eating something somewhat healthy, as far as burritos go. Don't forget to add carne asada. I crave this thing at least once a week. This should be our Arizona burrito.

The building itself is small and very clean. The menu is short and simple. The staff that I've encountered is very friendly. There's a parking lot with enough spaces. It's divey in all the right ways for a fast Mexican food place while still being immaculately clean, friendly, not greasy, and extremely tasty. 

I guess you could say I highly recommend it for their Arizona burrito alone. Enjoy!
