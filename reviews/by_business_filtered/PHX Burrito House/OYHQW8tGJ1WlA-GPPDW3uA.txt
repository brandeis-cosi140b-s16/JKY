Heard about this place the other day and had to try it out. Solid burrito spot that has a variety of burrito specials. It is a very small dining area so get there just before or just after lunch to find a spot to sit. I had the Carna Asada burrito and a quasadilla. The food was made fresh and was very good. One of those spots that you have to order at the counter and get served after you sit. Customer service was good for the type of place it is. I would go back when in the area and feel like a burrito.
