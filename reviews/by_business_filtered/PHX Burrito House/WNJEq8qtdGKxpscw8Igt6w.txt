This place is NOT FUCKING AROUND. Best mexican food Ive had in phoenix. Got a Carne Asada burrito with pinto beans(NOT RE-FRIED, also have black beans), the softest rices Ive ever had, monterey jack(HAVE TO ASK FOR JUST JACK if you dont want the mix), and onions/cilantro. 

It was absolutely AMAZING, didnt even need to use either of the salsas. That doesnt mean I didnt though. im a huge green salsa fan so I was floored by the tomatillo sauce. Fresh, flavorful, good kick, but not overwhelming. This place was like being back in ventura california  a couple blocks from the ocean at taquiera vallarta, best mexican food I ever had... They also have bottled pepsi and coke, huge selling point for me, albeit the smaller ones at 2.50 a piece. 

The only negative I could see is its on the upper echelon of cheap. It was only 10 bucks with a bottle of pepsi(cheaper with fountain drink), just not fast food cheap is all. But for the price, its worth EVERY PENNY. This isnt like some of these other burrito shop where they charge you 6.50 for a burrito with all that inside but its like the smallest thing ever. I always feel like I fucking asked to add those cause I wanted a big burrito damnit! NOT WITH THIS PLACE. I was full with like a 1/5th left and Im a big guy, like 280 big. I dont worry about my girlish figure in other words. This was more than enough for most people unless you just got done doing something extremely active(ie run a marathon).

I have no doubt everything else on the menu is good. Carne Asada is the gold standard at mexican places for me. If you can cook that, you can cook any other meat well. I was told the chile verde(pork) is even better. I bet seafood(shrimp) is as good, just not a seafood fan. They arent fucking around people, go there tomorrow, you will never be lead astray by a fat guy with 2 hands on his belly. Its the international sign language for someone with a stomach full of amazing food...
