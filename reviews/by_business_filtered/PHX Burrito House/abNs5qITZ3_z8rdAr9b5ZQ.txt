The place is ok and would probably be good enough for a 3 but this is being done to temper all the 5 star reviews.  If you live within a mile and don't have a car, then this place would be good enough for you to walk to.

We had their 1) infamous shrimp burrito, 2) carnita tacos, 3) asada tacos, and 4) a chicken burrito.   None had the WOW factor that people were talking about.  Actually, the meats were bordering on tasteless. 

 I am not Mexican nor am a native Phoenician, but I do love to eat, and have eaten more than my fair share of burritos from a variety of places, from holes in the wall to glorified holes in the wall, so I know what a tasty burrito is.   

The place is cute and clean and salsas were tasty.   

If you have never eaten a burrito or taco because you were too scared to drive through a Filiberto's, then this place will provide a safe and boring introduction.  But I would recommend going to Chipotle instead.  

Very disappointed with all the hype.
