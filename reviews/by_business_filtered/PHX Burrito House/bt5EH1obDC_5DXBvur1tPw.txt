My favorite burritos here are the breakfast burritos with bacon potato and eggs. The one with sausage is decent but I like the bacon one better. It was hot and fresh took about 15 minutes to prep...so expect that! I'd pass on the Carne Asada Burrito to be honest, you can get a better one in Phoenix at other places I'm sure and I compared it to the last one I had in Tempe. 

The owners are friendly, but its kinda pricey, I wish it came with chips. Overall, fat burritos, clean and a cool place to check if in the area!
