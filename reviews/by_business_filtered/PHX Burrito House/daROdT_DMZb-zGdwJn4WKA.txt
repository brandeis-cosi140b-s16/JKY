I can't actually comment on the food. I would rate the service as lousy. I waited 20+ minutes for a burrito i had already paid for. I got tired of waiting so I left. There were only two people in front of me and they each ordered a burrito to go. They left in 5-8 minutes so I thought mine should be read pretty soon. I waited another 10-12 minutes. Food never materialized so I split. Maybe I'm  just used to Chipotle
