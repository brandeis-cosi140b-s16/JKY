I had the carnitas burrito and Sis had the machaca special. The Machaca was good and tender, but not the best I've tasted. The machaca burrito was jam packed with potatoes and eggs which made it overwhelming. I'm talking Scooby and Shaggy overwhelming. Either share it or order while starving. The carnitas burrito had great flavor but the meat was a little dry. I suppose that's why you receive  the generous servings of salsa. I think this restaurant is very generous with the portions, has wonderful customer service and is has the bang for your buck. I don't mind returning to taste other menu items. There is a lot of potential here.
