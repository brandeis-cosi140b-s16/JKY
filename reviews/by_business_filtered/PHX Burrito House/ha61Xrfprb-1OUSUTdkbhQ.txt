They were pretty quiet for dinner.  The positive to this is that I got excellent attention/service and my food came out super fast.  The counter girl was exceptionally nice, offering me tiny samples of a few of the meat choices.  The green chile pork was HOT, while the beef in red chile and shredded beef were mild.

Ordered the two beef enchilada special.  Their red sauce is really good, not overly tomato-y or oily, with a nice spice level (I could taste the garlic).

The salt level for a forkful of enchilada and rice was perfect.  The cheese was really great (I loved how salty it was).  It actually tasted better as I continued to eat it.

The rice was plain, fluffy, and well-cooked.

I'll be back to check out their chorizo breakfast burrito.
