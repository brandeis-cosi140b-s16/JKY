Burrito House offers a very casual dining experience with a fairly simple menu, which is great. I ordered a Carne Asada burrito with everything. It was good, but could have been better if 'every thing' included more than just rice, beans, carne, sour cream and a little salsa. It was a little bit plain for my tastes and the salsa wasn't hot enough, but the tortillas they use are great. The food didn't really live up to the hype of a 4.5 star burrito joint though and the price was slightly higher than a great hole-in-the-wall type Mexican place.
