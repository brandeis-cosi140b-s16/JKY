Stopped by for lunch on a Friday. They certainly weren't packed but there were a lot of tables (3 out of 5 seated, 4 open) waiting for their food. I ordered a shrimp burrito to go ($8.50). It had shrimp, cabbage, pico, lemon juice, hot sauce, and avocado. I couldn't find the avocado and hardly any pico (see pic). Shrimps were good and I'm glad they threw in some additional hot sauces (and chips due to the wait) to help out the flavor on the burrito. 

I'd say their issue is turning food. If they were full, you'd be waiting 20 minutes for a three minute "Chipotle" type burrito. Lady behind the counter was very nice. Worth the try if you're in the neighborhood.
