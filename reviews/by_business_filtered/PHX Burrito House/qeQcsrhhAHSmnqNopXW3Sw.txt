Hungover hipsters hunched hungrily.

That appears to be the Sunday-morning crowd. I'm really torn on this review, as PHX Burrito House has some huge strengths but also some significant weaknesses.

On the strengths side: the ingredients are fresh, the tortillas are delicious, the bungalow is minimalist-cute, and there is Negra Modelo. The excellence of the tortillas cannot be overstated -- the tortilla was, if anything, better than the fillings. The salsa verde was also really nice, with a mild kick to it, not just pure veggie-ness.

On the weaknesses side, those were the second most off-putting carnitas I've ever had. Half the lumps were burnt, and the other half were nothing but fat. It says something positive for the workmanship of the chef that I found this edible at all, but I wouldn't do carnitas here again. I ended up being just as relieved that the burrito runs heavily to rice, as it's quite pleasant rice. I can make better carnitas at home, but I wish my rice was anywhere near as good.

Service is incredibly sweet-natured but also very, very leisurely. Do not count on rushing in to pick up a burrito -- the people waiting for to-go orders had fallen into a sullen, slumped stupor, and the whole pace really works better if you're doing a contemplative ramble around the neighborhood, maybe with a book of modern poetry to keep you occupied as you wait.
