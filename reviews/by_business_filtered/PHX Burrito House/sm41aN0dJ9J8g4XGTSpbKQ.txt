Great tasting Burritos ... you won't be disappointed.


PHX Burrito House is located off the beaten path in the Phoenix area.  I wanted a burrito for lunch and based on my fellow "yelpers" reviews I thought I would give the PHX Burrito House  a try and I was very glad I did. 

All I can say is don't judge a book by its cover.  From the outside this burrito joint looks like an old house and if you aren't paying attention you will miss it and you don't want to miss this place.

Service is order at the register, then they bring your entr√©e to you. Customer service was really good, friendly and pretty quick. 

There is a very good selection of burritos, tacos, and other popular dishes and all are reasonably priced and they taste great.  PHX Burrito house is not a fast food joint, so you get freshly made burritos that are a really good size and they are made with fresh tortillas that are absolutely delicious. The meat is tender and so flavorful. If your in the area you ha email to try this place you won't be dissapointed.
