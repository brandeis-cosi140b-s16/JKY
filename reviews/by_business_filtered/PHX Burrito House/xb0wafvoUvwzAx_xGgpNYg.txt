My co-worker suggested that i try out this wonderful place. After reading a few reviews i decided on the chorizo. The wait was a bit and the hostess offered me some chips to go. The chips were so fresh it reminded me of when me and my mom used to make them at home. Loved them.....The salsas are spicy to perfection. I will definitely make this a regular place for lunch. .....
