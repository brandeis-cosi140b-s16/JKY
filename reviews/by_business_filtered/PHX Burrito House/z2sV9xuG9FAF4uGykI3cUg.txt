Inexpensive, friendly, good food. I love their breakfast burritos- the bacon is always nice and crispy and the eggs taste fresh. The tortillas are delicious, and I'm not usually a fan of bread-y foods. The employees genuinely pay attention and start recognizing people after just a couple visits! A+!
