Had business lunch here today and I absolutely loved it. The place was tucked away and not super loud, decor was cool, staff was attentive and friendly.  Best of all the food was great, my turkey taco was amazing, the server recommended the brisket taco which was good...But I could have ate three more of the turkey taco's.  The guacamole was way better than average.  Think I find my new favorite Mexican place.
