YUM.  Paco's has been on my list for a very long time.  Got to check it out the other day and it lived up to my self-created hype about it!  Tried their queso which was steaming hot (it a good way!).....   went well with their chips and salsa.  Ordered a Calamari Taco and a Paco's Taco and both were delicious.  The tacos come with beans, rice and a slaw salad.  It was a lot of food for a decent price.  I'd like to come back to try their larger specials and margaritas.

Service was prompt and friendly.  Waters always refilled and chips and salsa kept coming!  A good experience.
