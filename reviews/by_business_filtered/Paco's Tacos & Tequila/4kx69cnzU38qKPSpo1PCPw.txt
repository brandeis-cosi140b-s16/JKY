David and I finally tried Paco's and I was really excited about checking it out. It was a-ok but didn't knock my socks off. 

I am not sure why I expected it to be a lot different from Cantina 1511, but on my visit, I didn't see a huge difference.  

In fact, I ended up getting the enchiladas de denis which I also order at Cantina. This comes served with red rice and your choice of beans - which for me is always black beans.  It was good, but nothing I haven't had before. 

If I lived in the neighborhood, this would probably be a place I would come to more often, but since we have a Cantina 1511 in the 28277 area, we'll probably stick to that instead.
