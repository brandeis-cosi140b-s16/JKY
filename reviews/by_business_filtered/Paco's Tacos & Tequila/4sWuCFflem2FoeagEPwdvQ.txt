Chips and salsa were the best part of the meal. And they kept filling the basket of chips! Had the shrimp and grilled fish tacos that were ok. The fried shrimp taco was a little too salty for my taste. 

It's your average Mexican food restaurant that serves the usual standards. I was hoping for something on the menu that would set them apart, but found nothing.
