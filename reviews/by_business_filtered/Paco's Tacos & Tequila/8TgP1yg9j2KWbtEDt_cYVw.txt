Love eating here! We have been a few times and have never been let down. I love the Enchiladas de Dennis, if you are looking for a recommendation.

Mostly, though, I love the knowledgeable staff. Each time I have gone I have tried a new drink and they have been able to offer a great break down of tequila varieties and what may suit my dish or my mood.  Very kind and attentive, every time.
