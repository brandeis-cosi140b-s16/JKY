Had 3 tacos: Al pastor - Paco taco - Smokey Brisket....Came with rice, slaw and ordered refried beans.  All 3 tacos were horrible...rice and slaw no flavor.  Salsa and chips were good.  Service was ok.  This is not a Mexican Restaurant by any means. $13 for 3 tacos? Not unless the cow or pig was brought from the Sahara desert.  First and last time for me.
