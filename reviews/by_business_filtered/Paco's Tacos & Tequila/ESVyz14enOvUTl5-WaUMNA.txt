I work nearby and LOVE this place! Service is quick and friendly and the food is always delicious. The unholy guacamole and queso is a must - they make the guac right in front of you exactly the way you like it!! Single taco + salad is a great deal for those that can't help but gorge themselves on the salsa and bottomless chips beforehand. This place rocks, I've never been disappointed!!!
