So we decided to venture out of our box and decide to give Paco's Tacos a try. We are very loyal to a certain Mexican joint in Indian Trail and we never cheat on them. However we had been given a gift card to Paco's Tacos and we couldn't allow it to go to waste. We showed up on a Saturday night at 7:30 and had to wait about 20 minutes. Not bad for a Saturday. The place was crowded and loud but the chips an salsa eased my pain. They were very tasty, almost to tasty if you know what I mean. The only disappointment was the Salsa was a bit to hot for my 2 little ones and they didn't have anything milder. Bummer for my kids and bummer for me because I had to listen to them complain. 

On the recommendation of our waiter, who looked like Dale Earnhardt JR. BTW, we should mix and match the tacos. I had the fried Fish Taco and the Beef Brisket Taco. The fried fish was very good, light , crispy and well seasoned. It gets an A+ in my book. The Beef Brisket was pretty bad. It tasted like Pot Roast. Even my Husband agreed with me and that NEVER happens. The taco had no Mexican flavors whatsoever unfortunately. It truly tasted like a bland Pot Roast. With the Tacos came rice (I've had better) and these beans that were called Churro Beans. OMG, they were very DELISH!!!! Pinto Beans with raw onion, bacon and some wonderful Latin spices. I could have eaten a HUGE bowl of them and left very happy. My Husband had the Calamari taco and the Shrimp taco. Both were good. I will probably stick with the Fish Tacos in the future. 

All in all ,Pacos Tacos is OK not great, IMO. I will most likely give it another try. Maybe for lunch next time around.
