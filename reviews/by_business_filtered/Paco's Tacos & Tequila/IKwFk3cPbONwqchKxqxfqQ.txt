It has been a while since we ate here, on a whim decided to give it another try and we were glad we did. We went at prime time Saturday night and they were BUSY, luckily we snagged two seats at the bar. I started with the "no name margarita" love they use fresh made sour instead of pre-made, you can really tell a difference. We started with the queso blaco which was very good.. creamy and had peppers in it which was a nice touch. For dinner I opted for the small chopped salad, BF ordered the two taco place with crunchy beef and soft brisket (for me!) with charro beans as the sside. The small chopped salad was HUGE... I had enough for the next day, nice and fresh with lots of veggies and chick peas (love them!). The ground beef was well seasoned and nice and juicy.. the brisket was a little salty, I will say we do not use a lot of salt so I would guess its at a "normal" restaurant food level... it was very tender and flavorful. BF said the charro beans were really good but I was too stuffed to try~
