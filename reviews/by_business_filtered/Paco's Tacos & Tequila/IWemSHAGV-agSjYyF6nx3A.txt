Another great restaurant from FS Food Group. The service staff is knowledgeable, helpful and caring about all aspects of service. The tacos are amazing of course but if you are looking for a real treat try the ambush shrimp or shrimp diablo. I pound of shrimp on one and bacon wrapped shrimp on the other how can you go wrong. They are starting to do daily specials on drinks and food always prepared by the well trained bartenders and chefs. So if you are looking for great tex- mex come try this little gem
