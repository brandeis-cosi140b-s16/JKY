Love this place. New go-to Mexican in the South Park area... 

If you are into spice, the Cucumber Jalapeno Margarita is amazing!! It is a little bit of spicy overload (even for me) with the chips and salsa but I LOVE IT.

The food is extremely fresh! I recommend getting the guacamole & fajitas and sharing with a friend :)
