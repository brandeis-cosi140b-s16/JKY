YIPEEEEE HALF-PRICED FAJITAS EVERYDAY 4-6! 

Whoops, I got carried away.  Shall we proceed with the review?  

I can't believe I've driven by this place so many times, and missed it's existence.  Tucked away in the back corner of the shopping center featuring William Sonoma and Bricktops, you almost have to know it's there or you could miss it. 

The service was really friendly, quick, unpretentious, and as soon as we sat down, a bowl of hot crispy chips appeared at our table, with two salsas.  

I was THRILLED with my steak and shrimp combo fajitas.  The tortillas are made fresh in house. LOTS of juicy, caramelized peppers and onions, and some kind of butter melted over it for extra decadence. Plenty of toppings and goodies (which is what I love about fajitas!) mean lots of ooey-gooey-drip-down-your-hand-and-arm goodness. 

Our server also recommended the Paco's Tacos and shrimp tacos, which were also super flavorful.  The brisket is smoked for 6 hours, and extra tender, perfectly seasoned...the shrimp, breaded and fried, and a bit sweet from the cabbage. If I weren't such a fajita fanatic, I would have downed both tacos. 

Notes: Lots of drink specials.  Manager walked around to check up on us several times. Nice dining room area with booths and TV's...another bar area with LOTS of tequila, and another side section of dark polished wood stools...and an outdoor seating area. Next time we have friends in town, this would be a good place to have a gathering. 

Bottom Line:  I'm not a connoisseur of Mexican or Tex Mex or whatever Paco Taco is associated with...but it's mighty tasty, and just feels like a comfortable restaurant I'd like to come back to again and again. 

PS:  Had the fried ice cream...which is good, but what I liked about it was the marshmallow fluff on the side!
