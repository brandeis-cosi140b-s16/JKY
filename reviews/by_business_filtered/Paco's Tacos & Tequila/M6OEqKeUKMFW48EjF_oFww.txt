Here's an update to my earlier review. 

As stated before, I really WANT to like this place. However, I lunched there the other day and, sadly, have decided I'm done. 

The chips and salsa are awesome and my toddler daughter was pleased with her chicken fingers. But my wife and I split the lunch chicken fajitas and they were, to say the least, the weirdest fajitas we've ever had. 

I'm no Tex-Mex expert, but my experience with fajitas is that they're strips of chicken, onions, and peppers served sizzling on a cast-iron platter.  The vegetables are typically cooked just past the point of tenderness.

The fajitas brought to our table consisted of chunks of what appeared to be a small baked breast atop a pile of what appeared to be an overdone pepper/onion mash which was bitter to the taste.  The sides (guac, pico, cheese, lettuce) were excellent though.

I'm still a big fan of Frank's Cantina 1511 and Mama Ricotta's but not crazy about Big (Bad) Daddy's though or now, Paco's.
