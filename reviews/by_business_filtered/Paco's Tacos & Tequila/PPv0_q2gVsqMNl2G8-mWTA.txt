I was in Charlotte for my family reunion. I had told my cousins that we had to try this place. It was good, but not is good as I expected.

We order calamari and queso for appetizers, both were delicious.

I ordered the combination platter where you choose 1 quesadilla, 1 taco and 1 enchilada. I had the chicken quesadilla. It was just okay. I chose the calamari taco. That was quite delicious. The enchilada I chose was the chicken and spinach. It would have been good if they didn't use american cheese. American cheese is absolutely disgusting.

The pomegranate margarita I chose for my drink was delicious.
