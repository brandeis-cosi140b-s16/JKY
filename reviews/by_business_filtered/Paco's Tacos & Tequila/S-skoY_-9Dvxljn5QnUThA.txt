Atmosphere: a little noisy but not unbearable. Fun decor. Good energy. 

Food: Chips and salsa solidly delicious. I had the combo plate - everything was pretty great, but didn't knock my socks off from a flavor perspective. 

Service: Tyler was awesome. Super friendly and took care of everything we needed 

Drink: I probably should have asked about what was in the Mexican Mule. It tasted pretty much like a margarita but pretty sweet and sour. Not my favorite!
