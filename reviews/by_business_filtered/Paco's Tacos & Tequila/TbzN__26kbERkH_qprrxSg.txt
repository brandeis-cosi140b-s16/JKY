You know when people rave about a place and then maybe your expectations are too high?  Maybe that's what happened here cuz I thought it was sorta average.  

Good food but not the wow factor I thought would happen.  The chili was beanless (yay) and came with sour cream, cheddar, and scallions.  The flavor was good, but would have liked more kick.  Also had a shrimp taco, and while it was also good, I wouldn't make a special trip for it.

Great service, ample seating, but it's the kind of place that I'd probably never argue if someone suggested going, but the suggestion wouldn't come from me.
