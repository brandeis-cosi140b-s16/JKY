The taco was a 5 but everything else was closer to a 3... so a 3 it is. 
There were complimentary chips and salsa but the chips had no salt on them and the salsa was rather flavorless and runny. 
I wasn't too hungry so I ordered a taco plate for $7 (decent price for the portion). I got the tanked up taco which is a fried (or grilled) fish filet which was really tasty. My friends all got generous portions in their tacos too so it was hard to eat them without the contents falling out (not a bad problem too have, really). You could choose to have a four, corn, or crispy tortilla which is nice. 
I got the charro beans which tasted like watery baked beans with shredded pork... not a fan. I'd probably go with refried next time. 
The rice was pretty flavorful but the slaw was average. Service was okay. I'll probably come back for their enchilada...eventually.
