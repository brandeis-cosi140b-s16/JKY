The manager Cory reached out to me today and apologized for the poor service I recieved.  She assured me that is not the standard at their restaurants (it's a part of a group), and explained the corrective action that was taken to ensure better service next time. 

She was very kind and ensured that we were happy with our experience otherwise. I look forward to trying it again in the near future and will hopefully enjoy good service to go along with the good food.
