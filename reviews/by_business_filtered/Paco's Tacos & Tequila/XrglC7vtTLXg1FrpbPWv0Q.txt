I was just not impressed at all by this restaurant. I went a few weeks ago and I'm not sure why I had such high hopes for it but meh.  I had the steak fajitas and they were average not bad, just not exciting, and the vegetables were mush. The person I was with got a chimichanga  and it was really dry and tasteless. The tortilla chips were good and the salsa was really good! It had a decent heat and flavor to it and the chips seemed fresh. 

The main reason I give it 2 and not 3 stars is because this place prides itself on it's tequila selection and it's "oh so delicious" margaritas.  I'm here to tell you they were not good.  The house margarita which was on special was pure sour mix and it wasn't a good sour mix either.  I had a different margarita (can't remember the name but it was the one with grand marnier), and again it just wasn't good.  My uncle makes an amazing margarita with grand marnier and this definitely did not compare (maybe I'm biased).  I was also disappointed not to see any real Sangria choices as I prefer that to margaritas when out and the wine prices are jacked up beyond belief  (I saw a few choices that they were charges by the glass the same price as you could get the entire bottle for at the store). I realize that some raising of the prices is needed to make a profit but $12 for a glass of wine that you can by the entire bottle for the same price?? Yeah I'm not buying that one!! 

Needless to say I will probably give this place a second shot and update my review but currently not a fan!
