The food was excellent. Salsa had great flavor. It was a little hot for my son, so he mixed it with the mild tomatillo salsa. Cheese dip was great too! I had some kind of turkey carnitas taco on a whole wheat tortilla with bacon and avocado on it, DELICIOUS! Top shelf margarita was $10 tonight (Thurs) and well worth it! We will definitely go back!! So nice it is just 3 miles from home too.
