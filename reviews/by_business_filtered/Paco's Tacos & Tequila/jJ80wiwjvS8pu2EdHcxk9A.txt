This is decent tex-mex. I had the "pacos taco's" and they were pretty good. Not a fan of the beans and I love beans. My margarita was ok but they are not generous with the tequila. We were there for lunch and it was not really busy. I could tell from the set up that they probably have a great happy hour.
