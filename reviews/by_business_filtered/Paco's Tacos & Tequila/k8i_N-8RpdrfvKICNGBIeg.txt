My husband and I were in the mood for Mexican . Thanks to google , we found Paco taco on Morrison blvd . The waitress was very nice . She was pleasant and attentive . We decided to skip the appetizers and go straight to the entrees . We ordered the shrimp fajitas and the roasted vegetables enchilada . The fajitas were good , the standard fajitas you find in any Mexican restaurant. However , we were very disappointed with the enchilada . It was very doughy, the roasted vegetables lack the taste and the beans overwhelmed the plate . The only good thing  on that plate were the empanadas . The good service made up for that enchilada . We might consider coming back .
