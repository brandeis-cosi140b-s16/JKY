Paco's does quite pack enough punch for my taste.  Due to location, it's incredibly popular, and there's usually a wait for tables.  No worries - you can put your name on the list and grab a seat at the bar while you wait to be called.  Oddly enough, when I asked for one of the buzzers to notify me when our table was ready, I was told that its range was really bad and it might not go off, even though the bar was 6 feet away.  Luckily, the anticipated 45-50 minute wait was cut to only ~30 minutes, and we grabbed the pitcher of blood orange margaritas to drink at our table.   

While our server and service was fine, I unfortunately found the food to be unremarkable, with the free chips & salsa being the best thing all night (although Ben mentions the tomatillo salsa, we only received the smokey red one).   We started with the table side guacamole, and while it was heartily devoured, it lacked much heat or flavor outside fresh avocado.  I ordered three tacos and tried the chicken, skirt steak, and ground beef options.  On the plus side, with three tacos, rice, and my choice of charro, refried, or black beans, there was more than enough food; on the con side, none of it was overly remarkable... in fact, there wasn't much to remember on any part of my plate.  

Of all the Frank Scibelli's restaurants, Paco's proves to be my least favorite.  I've tried it twice and have been underwhelmed both times.  Maybe third time's the charm, but with all the other great eateries around town, I don't know if I'll give Paco's a final chance to wow.
