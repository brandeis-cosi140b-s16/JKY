The place is a bit hard to find (look behind the Williams Sonoma!) but it's definitely worth a trip. The atmosphere is relaxed with a really nice large bar. We were easily able to get seats at the bar at 8:00 PM on a Tuesday.

The bartender was nice enough to create custom margaritas for us and they were DELICIOUS! (but expensive...$11 each!) I definitely recommend getting a margarita with their jalapeño infused tequila. 

The salsa was fantastic, but the queso was just OK. Chips were a little undercooked but the staff was great at refilling our basket! My fiancé and I shared the combo fajitas (chicken and steak) and it was more than enough food for the two of us. We subbed black beans for the standard charro beans and I was happy we did.

The staff was really friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable about their products so I would definitely go back again!
