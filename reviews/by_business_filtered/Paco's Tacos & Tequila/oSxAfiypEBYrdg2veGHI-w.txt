I can't believe that I didn't know this place existed. If it hadn't been for Angie setting up a UYE here, I'd have been living in blissful ignorance. Instead, I now have to feed Paco's Tacos to the giant taco-craving monkey on my back! Thanks, Angie. Thanks a lot! All kidding aside, these are amazingly good tacos.

I popped in for a late dinner and found all the tables filled and a half hour wait. I grabbed an empty seat at the bar instead. No worries, they have the full menu here as well and I think even better service than at tables. I started off with the day's special drink, an "Arctic Cadillac Margarita" that arrived in a bright blue color. Strange, but oh so yummy! While that was quenching my thirst, a basket of chips and two bowls of salsa arrived. Now I know that the chips are important and so many Mexican style places screw this up. Not Paco's. Crisp, slightly salty and not even a little bit stale. Excellent.

For dinner, I had the three taco plate. This was probably a mistake. Chips and salsa, rice,beans, a big Margarita and a Corona when the drink ran out didn't leave nearly enough room. Don't worry your pretty little head - I still managed to clean my plate but omg, my poor tummy.

First, the brisket taco. Five stars! Second, the calamari taco. Five stars. Third, the shredded chicken taco. Meh. The rice was nice and fluffy. The beans were plenty hot and tasty. But that last taco really let the side down. Not that there was anything wrong with it. I think the first two were just so totally Bueno that it let down the side.

So next time, I'll still have the Margarita and I'll still eat the chips and salsa. But I'll stop with just two tacos and I know I'll be perfectly happy!
