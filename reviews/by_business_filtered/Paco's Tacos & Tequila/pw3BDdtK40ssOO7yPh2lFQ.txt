I visited Paco's for the first time during Restaurant Week along with a lot of others! My friend made 7:00 p.m. reservations on a Tuesday night and the place was packed! The only sour note was that, even with reservations made, we still had to wait around 15 minutes to be seated. However, it was worth the wait....

The restaurant week menu offered A LOT of food plus a margarita for $30/person. The drink special was the No Name margarita (very good!) with offering of four other courses. First course was choice of queso (beef, white, or yellow) - my table ordered each one since there were three of us. ALL GOOD!

Second course offered choice of pork nachos or guacamole. Two of us ordered the guac, which is prepared table-side with choice of it being smooth/creamy or chunky and level of spice. I asked for chunky guac and for it to be made 'medium' but I didn't really taste much spice.

Third course was choice of tacos, various enchiladas, or fajitas. I went for the three tacos (get choice of tortilla): Shrimp, fish, and turkey club tacos. The shrimp taco was my favorite with choice of beans and rice.

For dessert, choice of tres leches cake or brownies with strawberries. I went for the brownies.

With all of the choices offered, you would think the portion sizes would suffer but they did not. Everything was delicious and generously sized. There was no way I could finish everything so I had my remaining guac (which I was able to snack on for three extra days) and tacos packed up to go.

I will DEFINITELY be going back to Paco's because I think I've found a new favorite Mexican spot.
