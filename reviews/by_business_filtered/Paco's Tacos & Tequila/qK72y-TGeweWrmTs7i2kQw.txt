I work in the Southpark area so Paco's Tacos & Tequila has become a restaurant I frequent weekly.  I'll grab lunch to go or dine in after work with friends or coworkers.  Since I've had the opportunity to eat there quite a bit, I've tried most of the entrees and appetizers. Some of my favorites include: the veggie quesadilla, chicken fajita salad, paco's tacos, and the sour cream chicken enchiladas.  
  
  The service is great, which is always a reason to come back.  The wait staff and managers are always attentive and prompt; I don't think I've ever seen the bottom of a glass without a new one being brought to the table first.  If you've eaten at some of Frank's other restaurants (Cantina 1511, Big Daddy's, Mama Ricottas..) you know that poor service is never an issue. 

  Because of the great food and mindful staff it is defiantly worth checking out.  It's family friendly but you can also enjoy a casual date without being overwhelmed. They also have started some really good drink specials throughout the week (try the Texas Rose with pear infused tequila). The price point in the right place as well.
