If you haven't yet discovered Paco's Tacos & Tequila in SouthPark run to the nearest mirror, take a good look, and then punch yourself in the face for missing out because seriously you are sucking at life. After your recovery jump in your car and get over there! Paco's Tacos is EVERYTHING. The rice, the beans, the enchiladas al denis, it's just too much for words right now as I'm having some sort of food flashback but trust me you need to get there. I like to go on a Sunday and sit outside with my shades on to complete my recovery from Saturday night.
