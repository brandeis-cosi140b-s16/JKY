Popped into this joint one afternoon to watch some of the world cup and eat tacos. We tried a variety of their offerings from cerviche to various types of tacos. No complaints there. Food was average and everyone seemed happy with what they ordered. 

My biggest complaint would be that I tried to order 3-4 different drinks off their drink menu, and each time the waiter returned a few minutes later to tell me their did not have the ingredients to make it. Not being able to make a mojito or margarita in a mexican restaurant seems kinda odd.. Especially during the world cup games when business should be booming.
