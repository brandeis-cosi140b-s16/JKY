Came in with a friend and had a little wait.  Almost missed our table because they text you to let you know the table is ready, even though we were sitting 3 feet from the hostess waiting. 

I had the turkey tacos and my friend had the taco salad.  We enjoyed our food but weren't blown away.  Overall the service and the food was average.
