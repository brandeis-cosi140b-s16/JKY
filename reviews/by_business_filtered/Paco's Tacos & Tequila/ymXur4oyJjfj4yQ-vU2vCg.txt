Came here to fulfill our margarita craving after having crappy margaritas at Vida uptown. My boyfriend and I have been to Paco's more than a dozen times, and it never disappoints. Great food, well worth the money, and the service is excellent as well. Flavor is always on point in the margaritas and the food. Our favorite taco is the turkey club carnitas, and favorite salad is the chopped salad. Fajitas are also good as well as the burritos. Don't have a bad thing to say about this place. We will keep recommending it to our friends!
