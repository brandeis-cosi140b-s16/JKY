I've been to Padre's about 4 times and it is always consistently delicious and the atmosphere is fun and lively. And you have to love the $0.01 margarita just for checking in! If you are a fan of Carne Adobada, you will absolutely love the way Padre's does theirs. Flavorful, hearty, but not so spicy you can't enjoy the depth of the flavors. The Tequilla Shrimp was awesome and if you really want something different, the West Coast Burrito is very tasty. Our server was great, attentive and checked back with us often enough to make sure everything was OK, but didn't hover. Great place, great location, great food, great margaritas!
