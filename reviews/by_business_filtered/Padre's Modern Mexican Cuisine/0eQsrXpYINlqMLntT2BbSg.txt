I recently collaborated with Denny and his son Cole on a special event for Get Your PHX.  They came up with a wonderful menu using two challenging ingredients, nopales and mesquite flour, that was very popular with the crowd.  Everything I've ever eaten there has been delicious and I'll surely send people there when asked about a good place for Mexican food!
