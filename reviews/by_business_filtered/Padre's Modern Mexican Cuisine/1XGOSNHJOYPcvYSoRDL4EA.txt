My boyfriend and I went for a drive looking for a place to eat late last night.  We busted a U-turn when we saw Padre's Modern Mexican.  We thought, "why not"...
We got inside.  The place was nothing special, kind of rustic and worn-out, but quaint.  We were greeted promptly and taken care of right away.  The wait staff was awesome all night...very attentive.  
We started with the cilantro mousse...sounded unique.  It was cilantro whipped into cream cheese, served with 2 salsas and chips.  It was good, but nothing extraordinary.
I went to order my dinner, a chicken taco, when my boyfriend stopped me and said, "you can get that anywhere".  So, I ordered the duck tacos.  Good choice! They were fantastic.  
I would definitely come back just for those duck tacos.
