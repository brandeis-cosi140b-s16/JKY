Went back a few ago and it was awesome. try the chicken nachos. Never really enthralled with chicken on my nachos but our waitress talked it up and I'm glad we got them..also a great deal during happy hour.

Still serving some awesome margs. I stick with the Obama burrito and my wife loves the lobster quesi we never really vary out that zone.
