I heard this place had duck tacos, so I had to check 'em out! Sure enough, they do, and they're awesome. My one gripe: I couldn't eat the tacos with my hands because either they were too full or the tortillas were too small. The duck was great, though. They let you pick how much you want the duck cooked. I picked Medium Well. The salsa was also very good.

It was a bit pricey -- $14.95 at dinnertime (which is when I went) and $12.95 at lunch time. Not outragous. Just pricey.

The service was good.
