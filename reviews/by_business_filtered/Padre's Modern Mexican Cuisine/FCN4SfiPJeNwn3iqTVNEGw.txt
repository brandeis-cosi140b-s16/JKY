Myself and 2 friends stopped in recently for the 1st time. They were visiting from San Francisco. We were seated right away and were greeted by a friendly waitress. We ordered Sangria which was made fresh and it was very good. I had the Obama burrito which is basically a medium spicy pork adobada burrito which was perfect for me as at some restaurants they make them over the top spicy. The meat was tender and lean and the sauce was delicious. One friend ordered the Arrachera steak which is a seasoned rib-eye with a chunky guacamole on top. The steak was tender and prepared med rare as my friend requested the guacamole was good. The best entree however was the Blackened Pork Tenderloin. The pork was lean and tender and was served medium, but what really made it was the apple-chile sauce. I will definitely go back for more.
