The food is just what the name implies - excellent mexican with a modern flare.  The place doesn't inspire confidence upon arrival... tight parking, more of a bar appearance than a restaurant.  The menu's don't look like much either and when we say that they charge for chips and salsa we almost left.  We were glad we didn't.

Their barteneder makes great drinks, the appitizers were excellent, my wife had chicken taco's that were "fine" (can't really do much with chicken tacos imo), I had the "Obama Burrito".  I hate the name but it was superb - pork with just the right combination of spice and sweetness... really excellent.  The food, combined with service that was far above par makes this a must return.
