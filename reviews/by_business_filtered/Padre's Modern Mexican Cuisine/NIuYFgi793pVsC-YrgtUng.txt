I just love their food and great mojitos!  
The lobster quesadilla is out of this world!  And the mango pico that comes with it is the perfect compliment for the seafood inside.
MY next fav is the mango chile duck breast.  Very rich and med rare is fantastic.
They just got a new chocolate cake in and I have definitely gone back for seconds.  It's not quite all chocolate but that's what I like.  It's surprising in each bite.
All in all, "modern mexican" is the right term for this place.  If you want a three dollar menudo hangover cure try the fillibertos down the st.  This is a twist on regular mexican, good quality, and well thought out.
