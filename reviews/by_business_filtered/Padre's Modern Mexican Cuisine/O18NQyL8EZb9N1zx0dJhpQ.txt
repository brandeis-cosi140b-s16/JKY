I've been coming here for over 6 years. First as single dude, then with my future wife and now with my kids (much less often). The bar is great, latin nights can get crazy and the food is really  good. If you're coming for food, come a little early. If you're coming for late night, it's loud and packed (and really fun). I highly recommend this joint over your usual Mexican fare.
