After driving by this place about a million times I finally remembered it when the old "Where shall we go to eat" question came up and I am now definitely a fan. I asked the server (Chico - he was great and seemed to really love working there) about his recommendations and tried the Salmon Spinach Enchilada which will be difficult to move on from when I go back. It was absolutely amazing and I tried my hardest to finish my plate. Only reason I did not give this place five stars is that the ambiance in the back room was a bit lacking. It was more cafeteria-styled and just not very warm and inviting.
Regardless, I know that I will be back and definitely introduce this place to out of town guests!
