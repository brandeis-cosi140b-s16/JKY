Padres you deserve another star! Every time I come in I have a great experience. The manager rocks. Like any restaurant you do not always get everything right, but the manager always takes care of it and makes it worth coming back. He gives personal attention to make sure each visit is memorable. Last time I was in  I ordered the sopa tarasca  black bean soup  with crema fresco and sides of diced tomato, bacon, queso and cilantro (see pics). It was delicious! I also tried the Tostadas de Tinga, the chipotle sauce and chicken combo was amazing. 

I love the food, the service and the atmosphere. How could you get any better? Hip hop Sundays, that's how! There is no place I'd rather be than sitting on the patio sipping on a sangria and nodding my head to awesome tracks laid down by Tricky T.
