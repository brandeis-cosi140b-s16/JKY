Why oh why did it take me so long to discover Padre's? 
Being a huge fan of modern Mexican cuisine, I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of food served at Padre's.  I found them to be in the same family as Dick's or Sierra Bonita, muy bueno!

The outside of the building is a bit deceiving and the parking is pretty tight. I wasn't quite prepared for what we stepped in to. Came on a Friday night and chose to sit in the dining area (my date tried to opt for the huge patio, but it was far to windy for that).  The band Cascabel was playing in the bar area, and the music and volume were the perfect enrichment to our dining pleasure. 

We started with the jalapeno-bacon wrapped scallops and they were to die for. The bacon was cooked in jalapenos wich gave it just the right bite at the end. The scallops surrounded a pesto risotto and sat in a roasted red pepper cream sauce . The pesto risotto was not only delicious, but a delightful surprise at a "Mexican Restaurant". 
For our meal we shared the modern cowboy steak, a 12oz. grilled rib eye, guajillo mashed potatoes, sauteed garlic spinach and again with the delicious roasted red pepper cream. I really loved the mashed potatoes, they were red from all the chili seasoning and absolutely perfect. 

I washed all this down with a sangria and although it was a bit tart (tasted like they used a sweet and sour mixer) it was still decent. 
The multiple rooms in the restaurant keep it intimate, while the bar area provides a more lively atmosphere.  The service was excellent, I can't wait to return for HH!
