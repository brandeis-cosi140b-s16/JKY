Very poor customer service. I had purchased a dealchicken for this restaurant to try it out and upon calling to see about using it for take out (which is not stipulated against in the fine print), they said they wouldn't honor it because they wouldn't make any money out of it. They told me I am supposed to come in to have alcohol (which I can't because I"m pregnant), and that if they are just going to break even then it's not worth it. Well actually I purchase these deals to try out new places that I could potentially be interested in, and by denying me because I don't want to come in by myself they are losing potential future business. Very poor attitude from the owner himself. In a down economy when you should be trying to get business in it isn't wise to be cheap and lose new customers because they don't want to break even.
