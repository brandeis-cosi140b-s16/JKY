Padres is a hidden gem in my opinion. Its a tiny spot that comes off like a hole in the wall mexican place. If it weren't for the large neon signs at night one could easily miss this place! We sat outside in the patio and enjoyed the breezy atmosphere. It felt like we weren't in Phoenix anymore! We got there for happy  hour and tried their house margaritas. For $3.50 they were quite delicious! My gf also liked the house mojito. We started with some chips and guacamole.  The guacamole was very good, nothing unique, but still tasted freshly made.The waiter was very helpful in describing the house specialties and his favorite dishes. I liked that the menu had a modern twist to all the basics. We ordered off the happy hour menu and split the fish tacos and the chicken pesto pizza on a crispy tortilla. The tacos were excellent but my favorite was the pizza! This thing was loaded and easily could have fed two people alone! I will definitely be back with friends for happy hour!
