Just can't get into this place... there are some really nice reviews about Padre's.  I've been 3 times and all 3 times have left me just like "whatever"-- not really good, not terrible but more just nothing. 

The service was odd, we were the ONLY ones in there one time (this may have been when they first opened) and nobody came to our table, I had to go get someone.

So that right off the bat left me unhappy but I tried it a couple more time after that and I still got the nothing feeling and the service was as I said before, odd.
