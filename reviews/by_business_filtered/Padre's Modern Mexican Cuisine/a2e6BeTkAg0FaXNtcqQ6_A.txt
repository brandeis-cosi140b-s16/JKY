So, I walked in to Padre's, looked around, and decided to take a seat at the bar. I asked the bartender for a menu and he told me that he couldn't serve me. Having never been to Padre's before, I inquired as to what on earth he was talking about. Apparently the rent-a-security gave some sort of secret service hand signal not to serve me. But why?

Then the gorilla at the door decided to pay me a personal visit, came over, and asked me to leave himself. I mean, I was dressed in an expensive jacket, slacks, a nice collared shirt, and I'm a clean-cut late 30-something guy. So, it wasn't as if I had stumbled in wearing a sequin-studded thong and nipple tassels with my junk hanging out. I asked to speak to the manager. The door guy left and returned a few seconds later. He simply said something to the bartender, then there was my menu. Apparently somebody earlier wearing the "same color jacket" was kicked out, for some reason.

No apology, nothing. I ordered a beer and left. With a simple apology from someone.. anyone.. I would have stayed for dinner.

My advice, if you go: do not wear a burgundy jacket.
