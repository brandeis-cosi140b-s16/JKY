I ate at Padre's for the first time last night and it was a wonderful surprise.

Although I was born and raised in Phoenix I'm not always a huge fan of Mexican food unless I'm really in the mood:  it can be so heavy and lack variety that it just doesn't always sound good.  Padre's really is different in that regard.  Even if you prefer healthy, "green" kinds of meals you'll do very well here.

Notable were the salmon spinach enchiladas, the chile verde soup, the Sedona salad (which won over a friend who "doesn't like" Mexican food) and the special plate of shrimp in tequila butter lime sauce.  These were all eaten either by me or my companions and well-loved.  Also notable were the Happy Hour margaritas which were still made with Sauza Gold (not top shelf but still way better than standard well tequila) and cost $3.50.

The staff was uber-friendly and the service was great.  Slight complaints were that the guacamole was virtually free of spice and heat--I mean not even a flavor of mild chiles--and the prices were a bit high.  All in all though, totally worth your trip.
