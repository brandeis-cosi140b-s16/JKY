I love this place!  Padres has a great happy hour I would recomend the house margarita however, they do have a fine line of tequilas.  The food is to die for my favorite is the Black Bean Soup and the Chicken Pesto Pasta.  Whether you are looking for a nice dinner or some appetizers at the bar you really can't go wrong.
