Don't really know what to say on this one. The food was good, but I don't feel inspired to go back. 

Started with queso  funded. Spinach, cheese, and spices. Quite tasty. Also came with two small ramekins of salsa. Red salsa was nondescript, green was yummy. 

Entrees were chicken relleno. Presented well with lots of sauce. Good, but not great. Carne adavado (sp?). The menu said spicy pork, but it was mild at best. Los Dos Molinos is a better choice for this dish.

Overall, nothing was great, but nothing was bad either. Just sort of in the middle.
