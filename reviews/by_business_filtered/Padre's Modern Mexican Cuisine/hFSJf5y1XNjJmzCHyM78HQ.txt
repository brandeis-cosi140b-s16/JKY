Padres was one of a kind and truly will be missed. Lunchtime was a mixture of mechanics on camelback to foreign counsel/government types and everyone between. Dinner customers were locals, out of town family, guests visiting from hotels on business or vacation. My favorite items were, Duck Tacos, Clams Corona, West Coast Burrito, Cuban Sliders, Carne Adobada, Beer battered fish tacos,  of course margaritas and beers with tequila shots to back it up!

Padres rocked for the following reasons,

1. Sit at the bar and enjoy company of the bartender and people around you while having a meal or happy hour food/drinks.
2. Bring a date/girlfriend and sit on the patio or dining room for a great meal.
3. Happy Hour on hi top tables with coworkers and friends sharing carne tacos, sliders, nachos, and having some margs!
4. Bring a big group and take over the patio (weather permitting)

Obviously I spent many nights at Padres and haven't found a place quite like it. There's nowhere in central that has the same energy or funky atmosphere. What a gem..... guess I have to hangout at the concrete, stainless steel, glass, shiny new places now.
