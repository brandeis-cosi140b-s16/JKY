When in Phoenix, one expects a lot of tacos, chile rellenos, burritos and the like.  Padre's puts an extra special spin on the standards and then some!

Starters -- chips and salsa?  Hell, no!  Granted, I had to talk my table into the Cilantro Mousse, but yes, the lil' serving bowl was licked clean by the time the Cazuela de Queso Fundido came.  Melted cheese is always fun.

Enchiladas.  Standard Mexican fare.  BUT at Padre's, they serve it up with salmon and spinach.  Tacos.  Standard.  BUT with Duck...amazing!  

Pedro's puts a spin on a standard favorite, but nobody was complaining one bit.
