So we went back again last night to eat some good Mexican food and listen to live music. What a nice meal we had, let me say. I had a few mojitos, wifey had a margarita and the food...well the food was just awesome. 

We started out with the clams corona. They were pretty good, that's a recipe I"m sooo stealing. They steamed the clams in corona, garlic and pico de gallo. They were served with crusty bread topped with jalapeno cilantro pesto, yummmm.

I tried to get the short rib tacos, but sadly they were out of teh short ribs. I opted for the duck breast tacos, cooked rare. My tacos were good, but they put too much of the juice from the pico on there so the tortialls ended up being soggy. No biggie, I used wifey's extra tortilla that she had with her combo platter. 

Her combo platter had a beef taco, cheese enchilada, rice, beans and a nice size piece of the best flavored most tender skirt steak I've ever had in my entire life. No joke, I was literally thinking about that carne asada the entire night!  (insert comical "he's dreaming about meat" joke here)

Overall, what a great meal and dining experience. Two thumbs up and two shots of tequila for the gang at Padres..
