This could be my new nouveau mexican in this city.
I went last night for my 1st time and was absolutely blown away.

Started out with the basic chips and guacamole. I think it may have been the best guacamole I have ever had.. Delicious !!

For my main course I had the POLLO RELLENO
( from menu: The house signature dish! chicken breast stuffed with poblano chiles, caramelized onion, corn and goat cheese finished with poblano cream sauce. paired with guajillo mashed potatoes, and vegetables)

IT WAS OUT OF THIS WORLD...  The chicken was cooked perfectly and the poblano cream sauce complimented everything on the plate. The veggies and potatoes were amazing too.

The crowd was mixed and there was a huge wedding party on the patio making it very lively.

the owner came over to the table a few times, and the waiter was top notch..

I will return and already know what I am gonna have !
