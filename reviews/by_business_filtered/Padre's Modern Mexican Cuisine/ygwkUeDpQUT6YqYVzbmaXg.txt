I played here on New Year's Eve and never knew the place existed before.  They have live music on Fridays, salsa in variety.  

I was eating off the New years menu and ordered the Duck.  In short it was gangster.  Cooked to perfection, just under medium, masterfully seasoned, artfully presented.  All the other things I saw were inline with my entree.  

After the New Year's festivities, the owner whooped up a smorgasbord of items for the band, Djs and employees to reconstitute themselves on.  Being New Years, and having stopped playing by 10, my memory of the specifics of the smorgasbord items is vague at best, but my memory of my tongue's and tummy's delight isn't fractured.  

I truly believe this place to be a nugget.  It's owned and operated by really cool people, the food is crazy good, it's cozy, great bands... what more do you want.

Oh and for those who worry about the parking, I have been informed that they own the lot diagonally across from their establishment.
