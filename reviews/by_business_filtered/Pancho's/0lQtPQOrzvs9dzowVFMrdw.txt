I'm giving Pancho's 5 stars for the overall experience. We enjoyed all of the food with just 2 exceptions. The complimentary corn chips were dense and hard. This could just be a matter of taste but I like them light and crispy. I asked for them to fry up some flower tortilla chips, which every other Mex restaurant I've asked to do that, does so with a smile. The waiter asked the kitchen and reported back that the flower tortillas were to thin. I had flower tortillas with my meal, they were normal tortillas, so, translation, I don't want to. And the guacamole was on the bland side. This is quite possibly the most expensive restaurant I've ever been to but when you read the last page of the menu, you discover why. I'm guessing a build out of well over a million. After dinner we went downstairs to have drinks and listen to a rock cover band, a much needed venue in DT Summerlin. We've said since DT Summerlin's opening that a music venue was sorely lacking. thanx Pancho's for filling the gap.
