Wow. Incredible design and amazing ambiance.
My wife and I were seated fast and next to a water fountain! Salsa was on point and tortilla soup was great to. My wife had ceviche and I am chimichanga, fish was fresh and the chicken seasoned well.
Best of all MR. Doug Was a wonderful host. 
I'll def be back.
