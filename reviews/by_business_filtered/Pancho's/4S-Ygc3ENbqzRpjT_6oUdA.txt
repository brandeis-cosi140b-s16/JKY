Nice new interior and attentive staff.  I agree with many of the other reviewers; the prices are a bit steep for just average Mexican food.  Our party of 2 had one Margarita, one soda,  a shared appetizer, a taco entree and a fajita entree.  The bill including tax and tip was over $90; a bit high for the type and quality of food.  It was not bad and we will probably return but just not a WOW.  Also, this is an aside and perhaps just an issue for that evening but the bus staff was constantly bringing rolling carts of bus trays, glasses and dishes thru the main restaurant.  Our table was right in their path so we were constantly looking at carts of serving and kitchen supplies as were dining.  Again, maybe this was temporary but kind of odd to have bus bins 2 feet from your entree.
