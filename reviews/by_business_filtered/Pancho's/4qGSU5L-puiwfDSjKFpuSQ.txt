Food was alright , able to digest. WORST EXPERIENCE in my life... I've work in the food industry and I've never seen something so disrespectful. After me and my family paid our bill and continued to enjoy conversation for a hour the manager came over telling us we had to leave . The reason was because they needed the table BUT yet the restaurant was empty, there was open tables, and it was only 3pm. You are never to tell the guest they have to leave for simply paying and enjoying company. #NEVERAGAIN... And the enchiladas had bones in it ..
