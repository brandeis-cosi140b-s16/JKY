New place! New vibes! Familiar tastes...

I've been watching this building come together for months so I was super excited to finally walk through the beautiful doors. 

When it comes to first impressions, it was love at first sight. A major wow factor! Whoever designed this place deserves 5 stars. They brought the beauty of Mexico to us in Vegas! It reminded me of the movie ~ Original Sin with Angelina Jolie. 

I do have one note about the design and that's the little room behind the beautiful staircase. I highly suggest that room is used for private parties & events only because customers don't get the true experience sitting there. We were guided over to it and I said no way, then we were sat in the lovely courtyard & I couldn't get enough of that space! Art, central fountain & greenery surrounded us and I loved it all. 

The service was fantastic & I'm even going to give a shoutout to Jason who took great care of us and was also very sweet & funny. 

The food was good, not amazing. I've definitely had better but everything also tasted better sitting in this space. We also only tried one thing but that's how it goes sometimes. We ordered the enchiladas de Langosta which were filled with lots of luscious lobster. Prices are high here but they definitely didn't gip us on the seafood. I also need to add that the portions are HUGE. We shared and couldn't even finish everything. 

The black beans lacked in flavor & were a tad undercooked. The green rice was perfect and the creamy chipotle sauce was super rich, a tad too rich for me. Overall it was good but not amazing. I needed bolder flavors but I'm still interested in going back & trying something else. The menu itself offered a lot of classics & a few unique dishes so it'll have something for everyone.
