Was there for a quick lunch Saturday after noon, the place was packed since the had just open a few days prior.
Sat at the bar and ordered a steak burrito that looked more like a quesadilla (flat) due to the lack of meat in it.
As I was eating my rice I saw what appeared to be a piece of chicken, bone included in my rice!!
How do you not see a whole piece of chicken going in the rice??
The GM came and had s full operations discussion with the owner sitting next to me 
Right over my shoulder, literally inches from ear.
Long story short the good was bad and expensive 
One burrito and one Arnold Palmer $25.00
Not dinner, lunch
