Great food! First time I was here the waiter was informative about their social nights. The following experience was not so great. The waitress (Ariana) dropped the ice cold water on me, apologized but left and didn't come back. Had to wait until I got another waitress attention in order to get help. Smh...didn't even bother to comped a drink or ask how she can make things better. Smh
