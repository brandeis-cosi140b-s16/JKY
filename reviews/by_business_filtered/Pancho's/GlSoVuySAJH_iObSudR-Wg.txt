Service was great.  We got to the restaurant and it was half empty. Told it was a 1 hour wait.  We we to the bar and was given a table in 15 minutes.  The guacamole was $ 17.00.   Queso Fundio was  $18.00. Way over priced 
The drinks in the restaurant were more expensive than in the bar.  Food was ok not great and very overpriced. This restaurant was so expensive to build and their overhead is so high they gouge the customer.  There is better in town for less money.
