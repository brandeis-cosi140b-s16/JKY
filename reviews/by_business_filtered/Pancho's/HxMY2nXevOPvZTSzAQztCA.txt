First time customer. My date and I only went to the bar for Happy Hour and found out it was Taco Tuesday , they were only $2.50 each which were very good. We each had a house Margarita and they was also very good. The other items on the menu looked to be a bit expensive, but didn't try any so I could not comment about them. The chips and salsa were excellent and the service was great. Our bar tender was Kelly and she was a lot of fun to chat with. I will go back again and try an entr√©e.
