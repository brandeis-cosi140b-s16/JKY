I have gone to Pancho's in Manhattan Beach for MANY YEARS,  and they "missed the boat" on the Summerlin Location,  the building is beautiful, but the food was not good,  tortilla's  were like rubber and cold, the spinach & mushroom Enchilada  was dry, had very little cheese.  The flan was also rubbery, with way to much sauce     $ 82 with out alcohol for 2 dinners that are not good
