I feel very happy with our visit to Pancho's today! The place is stunning inside and out! I was incredibly impressed with the service we received considering the place was incredibly busy!! I was very happy with quick service, our drinks were out in a flash! ( I had the strawberry margarita on the rocks and a Cadillac margarita on the rocks as well! Both were absolutely amazing) 
I was very happy that the kids food was brought out first since they kids are always fidgety and impatient. Kids ordered a quesadilla came with beans and our choice of fries and macaroni and cheese- the boys devoured their meal and they're usually quite picky when it comes to restaurants! I ordered the burrito ranchero de carnitas and it was worth every penny! Our waiter was very attentive to all our needs, definitely felt the place is family oriented as our kids greatly approved of this restaurant! Definitely making this a regular for Mexican!
