As the new Mexican restaurant on the block in Downtown Summerlin, I decided it was time to give Pancho's a try.  Upon our arrival at night the restaurant was loud with live rock music from singers on a stage, but the decor was lovely hacienda style.  Guacamole in a metate with a tortilla chip base was real spicy, but there was a ton of it.   We waited a substantial time before anyone appeared to take our order, and then were first contacted by the manager, followed by the hostess, and finally our waiter.  Not too many chips were in the basket provided, so we had to request more; they were quickly supplied.  

I enjoyed a good Shredded Beef Taco and an ultra-cheesy Burrito Ranchero with shredded beef, but the interior of Diane's Quesadilla Del Mar (with shrimp) was made wrong, and it seemed to take forever to correct the error.  The lights in the kitchen went off before arrival of the correct version, and we thought the entire kitchen staff had gone home.  But not to worry--the belated replacement entree arrived at our table shortly thereafter, and was accurately prepared to order.

3-1/2 stars overall, but as others have noted, one can find better Mexican fare elsewhere in the city at a much lower price point.  So, it seems dining patrons are being charged extra for the fine special authentic hacienda ambiance.
