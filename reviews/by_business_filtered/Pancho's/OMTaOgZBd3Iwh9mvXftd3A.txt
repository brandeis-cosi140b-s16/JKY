My wife and I were visiting Summerlin for family from Phoenix  Arizona. We we in absolutely shock when walking into this establishment, whoever designed this place deserves a bonus. Tiles, pictures, bricks, and plants were so authentic to Mexican culture (I say this from experience in different Mexican cities). The food was amazing and portion sizes were large. Still not quite sure why people are complaining about prices, they seem more then fair given the quality of food in such an amazing establishment. 

But anyways, We went two nights in a row, the first night in the garden for a romantic evening. And our second night in town we wanted a little more upbeat tempo, so we tried a couple  local bars nearby (lazy dogs and one other) and ultimately ended up back at Pancho's in the bar area. I wouldn't suggest going into the bar unless you want a lively and active environment like we did on this night, the garden and dining will give you the relaxing experiencing you are looking for. We didn't make it in for happy hour at the bar but were told t's from 2:30-6:30- half off appetizers and margaritas. Not sure if that is all days or not.  Also the mentions comedy nights and karaoke nights but not sure which nights those are either.

In conclusion this place is spectacular and will definitely be our go to spot for future visits.
