Way over-priced.  Took the fam there...I didn't know the hi$tory of this place so I was surprised by the prices.  As soon as I saw the menu, I felt guilty for wearing shorts and not a suit, but the staff were nice to us anyway.  It's beautiful inside; the decor is great, but I agree w/ another review that it seemed a bit cluttered w/ tables which took away from the aesthetics a bit.  The food was good.  Better than your typical Mexican restaurant, but still not worth the price they charge.  I'll be surprised if they make it w/out lowering prices, who knows though, maybe there's a niche of rich people who like overpaying for ok food and passing up better restaurants in the area.  Supply and demand I guess, so I'm probably wrong.  BTW while we were there, 2 different families came in, sat down looked at the menu (prices), and got up an left.
