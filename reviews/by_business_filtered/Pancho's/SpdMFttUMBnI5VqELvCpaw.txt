I like the food. It wasn't half bad and it was a huge portion. We sat in the bar because it was a 20 min wait on a table. Chips were good and so was the salsa. They had great food. Too many tables in bar area, and I wonder if they cut corners with this place. I saw a guy fall out of the bar stool because the top broke off. Kinda scared me because the stools make you sit high. And because of all the tables and stools it looked like he landed into some of the stuff. Over crowded.
They had many tvs playing all kinds of sports. Kinda quiet. Wish I had sat inside, it looked much more beautiful, and then maybe up stairs would be great.
