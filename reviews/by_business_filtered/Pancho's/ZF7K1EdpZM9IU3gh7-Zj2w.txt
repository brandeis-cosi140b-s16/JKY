I gave 2 stars because of the overall visit but I am willing to give it another shot being that this place is just a few months old. Our server was awesome and very pleasant and accommodating. The food selection was great and everyone else in our party had a great dinner. But what messed it up for me was when my food came out with rock-hard rice kernels, it just ruined it completely. I hope they learn to check their rice cooker for old and expired rice. It's just gross.

I asked for the manager and he was very understanding and offered a free dinner of my choice upon my return.
