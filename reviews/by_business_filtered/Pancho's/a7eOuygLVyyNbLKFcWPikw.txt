What a bummer! This place is so cute! The ambiance and service were great. The food was not. 

The restaurant is very cool. It's like a big open atrium inside with lots of trees, hanging birds, a fountain and so on. A huge negative - we were seated right next to the fountain and it smelled like mold/sewer. Every time some passed by it wafted towards our table. Very unappealing. They have a big menu with loads of options; the prices definitely run a little high. 

Unfortunately, we were very disappointed with our food. They serve complimentary chips and salsa And the salsa is tasty. We ordered the artichoke queso fundido. It was like no other queso fundido I've ever had. It was essentially a skillet of warm sour cream/cream cheese. The consistency was like a dip, not like ooey gooey cheese. No caramelization. No bueno. We also ordered the beef taquitos described as spicy. They were bland. No flavor. I had the sopa de albondigas (meatball soup); this did have nice flavor!! Others at the table were disappointed with enchiladas, chile rellano and a seafood entree. Everything lacked flavor and pizazz and seemed overpriced. 

I didn't have a cocktail or I might say to come for the surroundings and a drink.  

I likely won't return. Too many other tasty Mexican choices
