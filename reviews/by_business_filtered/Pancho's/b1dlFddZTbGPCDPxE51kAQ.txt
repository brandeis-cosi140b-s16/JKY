Came in to try this amazing looking Mexican restaurant . Walked in and was seated immediately. After we sat down , we all looked at each other in total shock . The prices here are way ! Over the top ! 19.99 for 2 tacos and rice and beans ? I looked over at the table next to us and asked them how they liked the food . They responded " Food was ok , small portions and they didn't realize how expensive the meals cost and said they will only come back for special occasions . So after the 4 of us looked at the menu .. We all decided to leave and go to macayos . The total bill at macayos was 65 bucks including 4 beers . We figured at "Panchos" the same meal would have been over 125 with out the tip . I really want to like "Panchos" but I can't see my self paying 19.99 for rice and beans and 2 tacos . Hopefully they will realize that there prices are not for the local budget and they are as much as the Las Vegas strip . This is only my opinion and I do hope to return some day . I give it 5 stars for the decor 
And the atmosphere . I'm pretty sure it cost a pretty penny to build this place . But that's not a reason to charge so much for Mexican food .
