Grossly overpriced, very small portions, and sub-standard ingredients.  I ordered a shrimp and crab chimichanga, which cost $21.95.  For that price, I expected large shrimp and chunks of crab meat, and a reasonably substantial menu item.  Instead, I was served the smallest chimichanga I've seen in any Mexican restaurant, filled with tiny bay shrimp and a miniscule portion of finely shredded crab meat.  My wife ordered nachos with no meat, at a cost of $15.95.  They were half the size of those served at Nacho Daddy for the same price.  My wife and I visit Mexican restaurants for dinner at least twice a month, and have patronized most of the Mexican restaurants in town.  If this wasn't the worst Mexican food experience we've encountered, it certainly comes close.  We will never again be a patron of Pancho's, and would not recommend that restaurant to anyone craving a good dining experience.
