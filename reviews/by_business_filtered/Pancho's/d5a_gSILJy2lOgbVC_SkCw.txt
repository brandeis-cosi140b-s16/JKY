Beautiful and welcoming atmosphere as soon as you walk in. 
GREAT customer service and wait staff. 
Have lived in Vegas 3 years and have not found - until today - a place that could make a chili verde that I actually loved. Today I found that place and its Panchos. 
Anyone complaining of price have obviously never been to a high quality Mexican restaurant as Panchos. 
They're prices are consistent with other restaurants and yet Panchos food is better. 
I highly recommend and will be bring my husband here for date night!!
