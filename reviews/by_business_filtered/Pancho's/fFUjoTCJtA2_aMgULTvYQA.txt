Here's the deal, if you grew up in LA and you like enchilada sauce and white style Mexican food, you'll like this place. Sure, there are places that are more rustic and more authentic, perhaps less cliche, but this place fills a void in the Las Vegas arena of Mexican fine dining. Everything was tasty! Bring your parents here! It has a place in my rotation for sure and I am a regular at the more authentic places. Great job on the decor too, it felt like a place that's been around a long time.

My only criticism is price. It's 10-15% more expensive than I'd like. Let's face it, that building wasn't cheap! Maybe when things settle they'll give us a break or some coupons or something.

As far as the negative reviews, most of them sound like what happens when you open a new place. It'll get better.

The fountain was clean by the way!
