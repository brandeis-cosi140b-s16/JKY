I highly recommend dining here! David was our server and he did a fantastic job!! They have been open for 3 days and I give them a tremendous amount of respect for the how efficient they were! The food was fantastic! Summerlin definitely needed this gem of a restaurant! A big shout out to David, Sam, Hugo, Abbott & Doug! They made the evening run so smoothly considering how packed they were!
