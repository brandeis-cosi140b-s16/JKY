Had dinner with the family. The food was good, but way overpriced. We wanted to get the guac appitizer but at $15 that would be a no. Sodas come out in what looks like a large shot glass. Two sips and you're done. For the three of us, with no alchocol, it was $85 with a tip. I'm not opposed to paying $20 + a person, just not for mexican.
