Beautifully themed restaurant but the prices are very expensive. I had a burrito, it was $18 and didn't include any rice and beans. The burrito was very small for the price. The drinks are very small and the salsa they give is too spicy. Food was great but not worth the price. For a special occasion, maybe. Loved that there were two stories. Staff constantly refilled our chips and drinks so that was great.
