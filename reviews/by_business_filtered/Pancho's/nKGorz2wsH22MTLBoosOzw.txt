I went here last weekend and was fairly unimpressed.  The building looks nice, but then we were sat at the first table upstairs, tucked into a corner with a bunch of bushes.  The table in front of us already had a family at it, and we were maybe two feet reaching distance from them.  It was just odd.  Food was decent; tacos pretty bland, but goodness was it EXPENSIVE.  It's twice the price of similar restaurants and maybe not as good.  It was decent to try, but I'm not going to be going back on the reg.
