I was soooooo looking forward to this place opening since being a SoCal native and been to the Manhattan Beach location! Beautiful interior nothing like it here in Las Vegas! I wanted to seriously love this place but $14.00 for plain nachos? Really? Hello? Wake up call- this is not SoCal and this is not Manhattan Beach! $18.00 for an enchilada? These prices are unrealistic even for Summerlin! This is Mexican Food! The cheapest food you can buy and make! I know you spent 3 million on the building and I can imagine your rent but with there prices I give you 6 months then Via Con Dios! Plenty of near by places cheaper with established service and food...lower your prices if you want to survive here in Las Vegas! I don't mind spending money on food but really? Expensive Mexican food is an oxy moron at this point!
