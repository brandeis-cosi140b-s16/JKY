Decor and atmosphere was very nice. I didn't like the tortilla chips they served bec they were too thick; made them hard to chew on. The food was good but overpriced. Considering the location, I guess they have to charge more to pay for rent. I don't know how long they can survive when appetizers start around $13 and main course is $18-20. I mean guacamole dip was $13..isn't that pricey for guacamole? I don't think I would go back just bec of the price.
