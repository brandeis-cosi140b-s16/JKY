So this place is super expensive.  If you want "blow your socks off" Mexican food then don't go to this place.  The restaurant does have a cool atmosphere, and I was super excited to try it but honestly I was disappointed in the food for the price.  Also guacamole for $15?! that better be made with avocados with gold in the center.  The margaritas were tasty but again I think I would rather stick to Macayos than frequent this place.
