We couldn't wait for this place to open..huge huge disappointed..ordered enchiladas and chx taco..the red enchilada sauce had no flavor..tasted like a can of tomato sauce..it was americanized mexican food..I know good mexican food..and this place is far from it..the place is beautiful inside..was crowded and we ate upstairs on 2nd flr..no bathroom upstairs..will never go back again..going to give El Dorado Cantina a try..heard great things about that place..
