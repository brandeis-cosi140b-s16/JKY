I read all of the negative reviews and came with a skeptical view. I have to say that it was really good! We had dinner at the bar, so I can't rate the table service but the bartenders are great! #chavonnerocks We had the taquitos with guacamole to start. Very good. Not the best I have ever had but very solid offering with good home made guac. Chips and Salsa also very good. Previous review of sub-standard salsa is BS. My wife had the Burrito Del Mar with shrimp. Flavor and quality were great but could have included more shrimp than rice (we mentioned that after the fact, because it was not so serious that we would send it back - they comped us tequila shots as an apology #niceform). I had the chicken mole enchiladas. Best Mole in LV! Seriously strong. Really good food, beautiful place, nice bar tenders. We will be back! Regularly! And all of the complaints about pricing? Really? Look at the menu. Read the prices. It is not cheap but given the quality and portion size, I think that it is fair. Not cheap, but not out of line with other high-end mex like Mercardito at Red Rock. Hope that this is helpful and you will give this place a chance. Cheers!
