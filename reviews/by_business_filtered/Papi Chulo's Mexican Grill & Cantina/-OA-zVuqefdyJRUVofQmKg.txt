This place was not good. Not terrible, but not up to my standards. The enchilada sauce is strangely sour tasting. The service was alright, although the hostesses were absorbed in their own conversations. In AZ there is no reason to go to an 'alright' Mexican food place, there are too many terrific places close by.
