We decided to try something new so Papi Chulos was it. This should be 2 1/2 stars but couldn't give it 3. Too many weird things happened. So we walk in,party of 3 @10:30 a.m. The sign on the door said open for breakfast and the hours, lunch and the hours ,dinner and the hours. There wasn't a soul to be found but the door was open. We had to walk into the kitchen to find someone. Weird. The server, Jayson, told us they close from 10:30-11:00. Weird. But...they would serve us. Nice. We had to request chips n salsa. He was prompt about taking our order. Food was mediocre but hot and timely. Jayson didnt impress nor offend. I had eggs benedict. Meh..I've had better. Huevos rancheros....same. Then....the bill came. Bloody Mary's are 8.00. Ok, if its good so yeah...not ok. He brought us back the wrong change to his  benefit but we caught it so no biggie. There just wasnt anything ti bring me back. We were the only table in there and in my opinion, that speaks volumes.
