Bought a Groupon for this place.  The food was just ok.  We ordered a bean and cheese burrito lunch plate, and a shredded beef burrito lunch plate.  It took a long time for the food to come out, and when it did, the inside was lukewarm.  It was not hot at all.  Our waitress seemed new, or just knew very little about the place.  It's a shame the food wasn't better as our office is very close and this would have been a convenient lunch place.
