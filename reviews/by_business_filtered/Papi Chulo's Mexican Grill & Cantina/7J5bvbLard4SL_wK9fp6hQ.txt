I was dissatisified upon picking up a to-go order to see that a 22 % gratuity had been added to it, it was an order of 10 and not only was I not informed while placing the order about the grat I was not even offered help to my car when picking it up.  

I called it in the day before for an 11:30 AM (before the lunch rush) pick-up and yes, I DO tip on to-go orders.

To me 22 % is PERFECT service while I am seated in the establishment not added onto a pick up order I am picking up and hauling to my car without help (they did not even open the door)

I think if they wish to continue having business they might want to re-think their position on take out orders and what they add to them.
