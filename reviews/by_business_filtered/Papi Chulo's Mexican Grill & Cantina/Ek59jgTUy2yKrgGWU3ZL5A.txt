fun spot, pretty good food-not crazy authentic but definitely still worthy of a meal or two here-and the service was good.  Very casual laid back but I loved the tortilla soup :) Don't come in looking to be wow'd by the service but they did fine in my book, it's so casual so I don't understand why everyone was so eerked about the service.
