After driving by countless times, me and my wife decided to give this place a try. We had high hopes. For her, a Mexican food crazy, it was rather a 'disappointment'. For me it was 'meh', below average. The ambience is good 4/5. The presentation of the food is very appealing. Ordered a queso-dip as an appetizer, very tasty! I ordered the combo #3, which is; 2 enchiladas and 1 taco. Well, it failed to mention it was a cheese only enchilada and holy cheese! I felt like I swallowed a pirelli tire for hours. The rice and refried beans were... stale, you could say. Server was very friendly and willing to explain. Hate to say it, but we're still desperately looking for that one great Mexican restaurant that could curb the mexifood craving of my wife.
