I checked this place out after it has been open for a couple of weeks, apparently not long enough to work out any kinks considering we were the only people in there. 
We went in to check out happy hour. They had a decent happy hour list. Small list of drinks and a list of appetizers for $5 a piece. I wanted a margarita (when in Rome) I figured since their drink menu had a frozen house margarita on happy hour it wouldn't be a problem to make the switch to a margarita rocks. Guess what?!! Margarita rocks is not on happy hour!!! What?!! Really? Besides children who drinks a frozen margarita? (sorry if I offended anyone) The bartender did make a pretty good margarita though. 
After reviewing the happy hour list of food, I asked to see a full menu. Needless to say, I was unimpressed with their menu! Awful, 90% of their menu was appetizers and salads, with a small amount of a la carte items in the bottom corner. Really? That's it? Food was bland, the salsa was ok, service was mediocre to bad. Can't imagine I will return for a retry unless it is still open next year. Feel bad for whomever dumped a lot of money into it's decor and location. Good luck papi chulo!!
