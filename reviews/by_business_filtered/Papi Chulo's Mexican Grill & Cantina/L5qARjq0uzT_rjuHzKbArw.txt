WORST SERVICE EVER!!!! My wife asked if I would stop by this restaurant on my way home from work and pick up some dinned.  She would order the food, pay for it with her CC and I would just swing by and pick it up as we had done on several previous occasions.  When I arrived I ordered a beer and asked if I could put it in the to go order I was there to get.  "No problem" I was told.  15 minutes later the bartender said he had no to go orders.

I called my wife and she said the restaurants phone must be down as she had not been able to get through at all. When I brought this to the attention of the bartender, his response was "we're just too busy to answer the phone."  At that point I just placed the order my self.  My wife gave me her CC # over the phone and asked the bartender to just process it this way.

He told me "how do I know this is your wife's card?"
My response was "well if she had been able to call the order in it wouldn't have been a problem, but your too busy to answer the phone!" 
He retorted with "show me an ID with the same last name!"
I responded with "my wife didn't take my last name."
"And the plot thickens" was his reply.
So I finally said "If this is the way you treat your customers, I don't want your shitty overpriced caned food.  By the way the so called comedy you run out of this place should on no way be called comedy.

What a DICK!
