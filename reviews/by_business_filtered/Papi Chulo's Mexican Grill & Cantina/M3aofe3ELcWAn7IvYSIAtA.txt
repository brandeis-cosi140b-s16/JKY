Purchased a $20 Groupon for $10 to use during breakfast or lunch. I regretted not going for breakfast since this was the 2nd time returning for lunch. This time I indulged in Combo #4. For about $11 you get 1 very salty cheese enchilada smothered in red sauce & 1 cheese and spinach stuffed chile relleno fried in a light batter and showered with a white sauce. That's both complimented with ordinary Spanish rice and bland beans. Thank goodness I already filled up on their complimentary firm tortilla chips (which I very much enjoy) and savorless salsa. I remorsefully strayed away from the shrimp fajita's (which is what I enjoyed the last time & left with a smile on my face) because I thought $18 was a bit too steep. I'm sure we'll be back since my other half enjoyed his meat filled burro. But maybe I could talk him in to take-out instead?

Service was friendly and observant (ensured our drinks were full & empty plates taken away). Place was deserted for a Sunday afternoon but that could be due to football being on. Which they did feature on one of four flat screens.
