Went here last Friday night with the girls. We had quite a few drinks before and after The Naughty Show at the bar. This is based solely on drinks. The bartender studied all of our IDs quite intently. I hope he wasn't studying my address it got a bit awkward. After we passed the ID test he asked us for drinks. We asked what kind of beer do you have he answered "we have sooo many" hinting there was too many to say. Me and my sis asked for some Guinness he said "no sorry we don't have that" Ummmm Kiltlifter??? "No we don't." Strike two!!! One of the girls asked for a Corona and the other a BL. Of course they got those beers. So I asked again "What beer do you have so we can possibly decide on one before the night ends?" Nothing great so we settled on Modelo Especial. Later after we got seated in the Comedy Club I ordered a Mojito and the rest of the girls ordered other mixed drinks. Their reviews of the drinks they got were not so great but the Mojitos were surprisingly good in a very tall glass!! Everyone started ordering them. I must of had like 10 that night until they closed the kitchen and they couldn't get any more mint. Yummm!
