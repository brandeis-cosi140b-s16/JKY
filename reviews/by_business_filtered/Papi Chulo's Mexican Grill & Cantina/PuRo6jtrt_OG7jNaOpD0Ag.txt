Went for lunch and was so happy with my visit!  We noticed the huge pi√±ata on the roof.  Walking in was a nice casual atmosphere with lots of natural lightening.  Being a vegetarian I was nervous I wouldn't have many options.  TOTALLY WRONG!  They have vegetarian beans that contain no lard! Yay!  They offered to make spinach con queso enchiladas but I went for a taco salad.  The house dressing was so delicious, and I admit to being picky about my dressings.  I had them put avocados instead of meat. The avocados were perfectly fresh, not brown and gross like many others Ive had while dining out! The server sold us on coming back this weekend for there two day Cinco De Mayo party.   Only suggestion would be to have the veggie options marked on the menu as it is a large menu with lots of options.  Looking forward to trying the spinach queso enchiladas and margarita this weekend!
