Great groupon deal 20$ for 40$ credit here.
The skinny 
After a nice walk around the mall me and my girl decided on Mexican food for lunch we quickly searched groupon for any deals and found papi chulos less than a mile away with a great deal. We got there the waitress super friendly sat us right away and a young gentleman served us chips and salsa and we had out drinks even before I could open menu what great service. We decided on our meals my girl the shrimp fajitas (16$) and me the arrachera (flank steak 15$) my girl was in love as she loves her veggies and she thought the shrimp was cooked just right. My plate was also great the steak was soft and cut just like butter and the marinate sauce was so good. We def got out money's worth I just wasn't to crazy about rice and beans. 
The bad 
Sticky tables and sticky menus clean that up for me please :-) 
Overall 
This place deserves the extra star for service but it is your typical Mexican joint but the arrechera seems to be there claim to fame prices are set a bit high but I do taste the freshness and quality.
