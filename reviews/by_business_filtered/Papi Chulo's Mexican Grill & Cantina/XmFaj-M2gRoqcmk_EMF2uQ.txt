I Like the street tacos at this place.  Overall its just your average Mexican restaurant.  Papi's not in my neighborhood so I probably won't be going back.  There are plenty of places on my list that I'm willing to take a trek to eat at once and a while (this place won't be one of them).  Try Frank and Lupes Old Mexico.  Its close by, and the food is much better (and more reasonably priced).
