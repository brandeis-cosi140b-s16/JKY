We stayed at the attached hotel and figured we'd give it a shot; totally worth it! Not sure it'd be our scene on the weekends, but on a Wednesday night and Thursday morning, our food was fresh and tasty and our drinks were great. Arrachera was out of this world, and the shredded beef tacos were delish. Guac didn't seem to have any mayo, which is always a plus in my book. Their margaritas were blended to a perfect creamy consistency, Lemon Drop Tini was sweet but subtle, and my mimosa in the morning was more than just orange juice with a splash of champagne. Best Eggs Benedict I've had in a long time, and the eggs and bacon special had great thick cut bacon. Super tasty. Both servers were perfectly sweet and attentive. As a bonus, they deliver room service and have some great gift card specials with the attached hotel that were an added perk.
