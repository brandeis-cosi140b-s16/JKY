This place is ok if you have low standards for food quality.  Drinks were just so- so and but cost full price.  The fish tacos came on flour tortillas instead of corn and tasted like thousand island dressing.  The rice and bean looked like they just opened a box of rice-a-roni.  Seriously low quality ingredients dressed up to be fine food.  This place lacked enthusiasm like corporate chains often do, but not always.  I was disappointed.  The decor was nice though.
Go somewhere else if you want a good meal.
