Not sure WHY this place doesn't have ALL 5 stars. We recently visited the Phoenix area from California and let me just say this is the best [BEST] mexican prepared food I have ever tasted. I love mexican food and have been to countless mexican restaurants - every thing from the spices, presentation, ambiance, and service (with TJ) was totally awesome. We even got a chance to speak with the GM Brad who was very approachable. It was a very good experience. I highly recommend this place. Ask for TJ, he will treat you right. If we ever go back to Phoenix, we will certainly visit this place again. 

Oh, also, they give you a lot of food - we had take out, refrigerated it at the hotel, and for the drive back microwaved it and it was just as good. I had the mixed fajitas, my hubby had the chicken enchiladas and our kids had the chicken quesadillas- good stuff!!
