Their chips and salsa were quite good. The chips were served warm and they provided 3 types of salsas.  I had the tostadas and they provided 3 full sized tostadas which were simply the best I've ever had in a restaurant.  My wife had a Vege Chimi which she loved.  It was light and crispy with a good mix of veges in it.  My daughter had the fish taco and beans which she enjoyed, although she didn't care for the dressing (1000 Island?) that came in it.  We finished the meal with some Sopapillas, which were wonderful as well. 
The service was warm, friendly and timely.  It's a pretty casual/comfortable place to go and we'll absolutely be back at Papi Chulo's the next time we're in Scottsdale. 
Not sure what's up with some of the negative reviews, but our experience was excellent all around and the food was very reasonably priced as well.
