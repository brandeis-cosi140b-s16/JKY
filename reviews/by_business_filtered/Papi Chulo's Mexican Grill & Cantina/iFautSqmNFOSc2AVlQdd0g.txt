This place is a joke.  The receipt conveniently suggests gratuity but instead of telling you the percent of gratuity it says "Good Service... Great Service... Stellar Service..."  When I did the math they were suggesting 19%, 22%, 24%, but unless people do the math you'd just assume you were choosing between 15%, 18% and 20%. I typically tip well (ive been a server and know how it is) but this is a sneaky way to trick customers into tipping 24% and it pisses me off.  Our server gave us our checks before we even received our food.  He was nice but was running back and forth doing one thing at a time rather than asking the entire table if we needed refills, etc.  As we were finishing up our meals we saw our server take off, so all that running around was just him trying to be done with his shift.  Food was good but I won't be back.
