This experience is almost too funny to believe. So I walk in to a nearly empty bar. I go to take a seat at the bar and the actually bar is dirty. I grab a cocktail napkin to wipe it up. The bartender does not get a rag to wipe it up he says oh did the other person make a mess? Then I order a beer and some chips and salsa. He uses the dirty cocktail napkin I used to clean up bar to place under my drink. He brings the chips and salsa no napkin nothing. He leaves and goes who knows where.  I wait and eventually take a rolled silverware off a nearby table. He doesn't come back until after I finish and then sets a rolled silverware in front of me and asks if I want a water. He then gets a phone call and leaves. Literally leaves the total bar for nearly 15 min to chat on the phone. I could see him leaning against a window in the restaurant. Hilarious. This really happened. No wonder there were only 10 people in the whole place. Skip it.
