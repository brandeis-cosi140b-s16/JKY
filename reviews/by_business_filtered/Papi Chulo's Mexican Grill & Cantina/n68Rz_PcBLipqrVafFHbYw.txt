We have been here 4 or 5 times and food is really great! Service has been just okay, but tonight we had Devin as our waiter and he was FANTASTIC! He was exactly the facelift the customer service experience was in need of!!! Request him-he made great suggestions and was really attentive. We'll be back!!
