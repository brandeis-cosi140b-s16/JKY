We have eaten here numerous times over the past year.  Always enjoyed it.  The food has been excellent.  Great service.  Until recently. 
There has been a change in the wait staff.  No one knows what they are doing. 
Chris is the only one with a clue. Always great service from him in the past, but he is seldom on the floor when we arrive now.
The quality of the food has slipped, for sure. 
The bartender, nor the manager have ever so much as said "hello"...."how is your  meal"...."can I get you anything"?.
From someone that has been in the hospitality business, I can tell you, a manager should be 'touching tables'....not, avoiding eye contact and ignoring the customers.
He should be replaced.
On our last visit...we had to ask for another beer...ask for the check...ask for the check to be picked up...etc. 
No one spoke to us or said 'thank you' as we got up to leave.
And they weren't even that busy.  Come on!!!!  You can do better.
Sorry...but our tip reflected the shoddy meal and service.
