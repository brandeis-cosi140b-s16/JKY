Stopped by here over a weekend when it started warming up and I didn't want to cook lunch one day. I love Mexican food, but with this place the salsa was the best part. It tasted fresh and was really good. The chips, however, weren't the kind I like...I like the super-thin, lightly salted chips that nearly break when you scoop the salsa. These chips were super-thick. 

The service was slow, but when I finally did order I got the chicken chimichanga. It comes with the standard rice and refried beans, neither of which I care for but okay...I can leave them on the plate. The chimi just didn't do anything for me -- too much of the tortilla, not enough inside, no cheese sauce, and basically no service for me to ask for extra guac and sour cream like I always like. I've definitely had better chimis at other restaurants. 

I've cleaned up my eating a lot, but allow myself one cheat meal a week. This meal was it for last week and geez, what a waste. 

There is a bar, but I didn't have any drinks so I can't vouch for those.
