Is the elder waitress racist or something? I hate to label people. But that was the experience I got. I went to the restaurant for breakfast. Was the only non-white. For a long time I didn't get a menu. I had to ask for it. While I observed the white customers after me got menu immediately. When the waitress went around asking refills on coffee, she just skipped right past me. In the end when I stepped out and said bye, she just stared at me. Ok for food, bad for service.
