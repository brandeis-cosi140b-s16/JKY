Paquime is the epicenter of the Sunnyslope Sunday Breakfast dilemma. Next door is the coffeehouse that has better coffee and the Blueberry Spiral Rolls of Delight. But Paquime has three weapons to suck a really hungry person in:

1. Breakfast tortas! The chorizo breakfast torta is pretty much the best breakfast idea in the universe, beating out now-familiar breakfast burritos. It has chorizo and maybe beans and definitely peppers, and it will make smoke come out your ears.

2. Full menu served at breakfast time. So if you need fish tacos at 9 a.m., you can have fish tacos at 9 a.m. (There is also menudo on Sundays.)

3. Best Mexican pastries I've ever had. I'd gotten a little jaded on the Mexican-pastry front, but these are fresh! And huge! 

Now, the reason you want to go here, rather than to the much divier -bertos across the parking lot is that both the food and the environment are rather more chi-chi (while still being quite affordable). All things -berto's are for when you want a honkin' big burrito on a foam plate, with a plastic fork, before you go to Lowe's (or after a long night at the bars). Such moments exist, and they are real.

Paquime is for when you want a quietly civilized meal, with quality ingredients, on real plates, but the prospect of hauling yourself to Gallo Blanco is too onerous, expensive, and precious to contemplate. They also do take-out, should you prefer your civility at home but not want to fire up the skillet.
