Came here on the recommendation of a coworker. We walked in and we were immediately greeted by a young lady who offered us a sample of the soup of the day. (How did she know that I LOVE soup!). The Lentil soup was delicious! I ordered a cup of that with the ribeye tacos. The order was delivered quickly. After devouring the soup I could hardly wait to tear in to the tacos. They did not disappoint! The ribeye was melt in your mouth tender. You guys have got to check this place out!
