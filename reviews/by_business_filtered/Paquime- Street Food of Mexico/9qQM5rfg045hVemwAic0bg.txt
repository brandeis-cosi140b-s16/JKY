There are some great Mexican restaurants in Sunnyslope but Paquime serves a good niche.  It's a great take out place but also a great place to dine in, with very modern and clean interior. It also serves up some high quality Mexican food: tortas, tacos, oh and the super nachos! Just too much good stuff to name in one review.  You really can't go wrong.  To finish it off, try one of the paletas or pan dulce for dessert.
