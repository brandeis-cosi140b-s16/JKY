Amazing the first time two days ago.  I'd given it a 5.  We loved the freshness, friendliness, and generosity.  

But today,  it's just alright.  We were not welcomed with joy.  The sweets and ice cream are obviously the same from the other day.  The aqua fresca is too sweet and not authentic.  Still like the barbacoa:)
