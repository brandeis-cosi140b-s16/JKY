One of my favorite places for street tacos!  Carne asada steak tacos and soup of the day are a great mix!  The flavor of the meat is outstanding and the salsas are excellent.  Not the quickest turnaround time, but then again, it's a restaurant that takes pride in their food and it's all made to order.  Well worth the wait!
