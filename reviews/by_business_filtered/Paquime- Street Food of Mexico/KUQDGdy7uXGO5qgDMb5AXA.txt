This was flat out amazing!

Hadn't heard of them before, but while hiking North Mountain I yelped tacos while at the top. This came up as close by and open. 

We went as a group of four. We tried the tacos(rib eye), burro(carne asade), torta and a burrito. Chips and salsa were ordered as well as a side of their corn.

Chips were among the best I've ever had in my life. Light, crispy and just salty enough. Salsas were really tasty and had varying degrees of heat to choose from.

I had the four tacos and they were ridiculously good. I was stuffed full but considered more just for the terrific flavor of them. 

They had menudo and I was given a sample. It too was  superb. I grilled the guy at the counter and found everything, including the baked goods, were done in house. Picked up some treats for the kids and while they look great, I'm guessing they'll taste even better.
