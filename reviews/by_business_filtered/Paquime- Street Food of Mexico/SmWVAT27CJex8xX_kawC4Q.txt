This place is better than awesome. Why I hear you ask, let me tell you.

Amazingly friendly staff - a chef that puts time and effort into presentation as well as fresh ingredients and made fresh daily tortillas and chips, lovely interior and did I mention the ice cream and cakes.

Better than 5 star
