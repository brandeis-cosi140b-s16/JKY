Nice small place, with a modern feel. Great service. 
Ordered Torta Paquimé ($5.49) and one Asada ($5.99) to go. Cashier was very nice and friendly. Explained to me all the details about Torta Paquimé, which turns out you can order hot or cold.
While I waited for my order I listened to her describe some of the menu items to other customers and it was kind of cute : P

Place looks very neat and the cooks wear uniforms and look very professional.

Tortas were delicious. I liked the Paquime a little better. Tortas were cut in half and neatly kept in place with a pick. There come with chips and were in a cardboard box. Overall I am very impressed with this place and will be back soon.
