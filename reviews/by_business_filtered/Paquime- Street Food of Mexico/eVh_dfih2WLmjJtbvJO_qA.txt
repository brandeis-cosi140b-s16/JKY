Driven past this place a few times with intentions of stopping in one day. Today was that day and my taste buds and tummy were glad that I did!

The restaurant is small but super clean and nicely decorated. Definitely not your typical taco place.

I had the ribeye tacos and they ask you how you want your steak cooked when you order. The order comes with four tacos garnished with a slice of avocado and finely chopped cabbage on a flour tortilla. Aside from the really nice presentation which I'm totally a sucker for, the tacos were ah-maze-ing!! They obviously use quality ingredients and it was totally worth the $7.50! I will most definitely be back to try out some other menu items!
