This place is just wonderful.  I grew up in Phoenix and visit my parents and friends often.  My wife found this place on Yelp and we took my parents to it on our last night in town for our last trip, and boy was it good.

My wife and I got two different kinds of tacos so we could sample more items, including swapping between us.  They were excellent.  My parents got the same burritos and not only did they love them, but my wife and I finished my mom's and we also loved them.  And boy, do they do Tres Leches cake right!

We're definitely returning here the next time we're in town.
