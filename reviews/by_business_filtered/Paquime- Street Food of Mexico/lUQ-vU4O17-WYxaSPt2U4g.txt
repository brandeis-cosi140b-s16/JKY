Wow! Had to come try after the great reviews. Its all everyone had raved about. Hard to find a good and authentic Mexican restaurant that's both clean and delicious. This hits it out of the ball park

My wife had the flautas that were made to order, not from a freezer. I had the well reviewed rib-eye tacos, excellent! 

We also had a couple cups of esquities, shaved corn in a coup with cheese and hot sauce. If you never have tried it, live a little - it won't disappoint!
