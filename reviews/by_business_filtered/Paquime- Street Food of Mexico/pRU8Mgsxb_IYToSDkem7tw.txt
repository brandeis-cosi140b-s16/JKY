Possibly the best $4 sandwich I've ever had I've been trying to think of a better one. Lentil soup was terrific as well. The place is clean staff is nice and friendly prices are reasonable and food is very good. Drip coffee is surprisingly good too I think they get it from the coffee shop next door.
