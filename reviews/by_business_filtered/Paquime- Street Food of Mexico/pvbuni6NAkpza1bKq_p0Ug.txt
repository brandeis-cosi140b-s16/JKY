This place is awesome.  My wife and myself drove past the restaurant for several months, until my wife decided to stop in to buy some Mexican bread.  The Mexican Bread was fresh, tasted very good, and was cheaply priced.  

A few days later, we decided to stop by for dinner.  My wife ordered the Vegetable Tacos made with a gluten-free shell from Jicama.  I ordered the Pescado (Fish) Tacos.  I must say, the food was AWESOME!  It was seasoned very well and the presentation was great.  My wife also tasted the Agua Fresca (Hibiscus) drink and loved it.  

I ordered a slice of Cheesecake.  It was very different from the normal, American Cheesecake and is now my favorite!  We will definitely be back for more great food.
