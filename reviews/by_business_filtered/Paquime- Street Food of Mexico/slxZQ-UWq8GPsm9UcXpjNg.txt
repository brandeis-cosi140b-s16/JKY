Amazing Mexican food! I wanted to try something new on my visit to my hometown and this isn't your typical fried Sonoran-style food. 
I got three rib eye tacos that were topped with onions, white cheese, and chunks of avocado with a strawberry lemonade. The tacos were really good, fresh, and fairly priced and the lemonade was amazing. I wasn't sure what to do with the large grilled green onion that came as garnish.
There were a lot of bakery and frozen items available for dessert but I was too full to try anything.
I would definitely frequent this place (especially since it's right next door to a coffee roaster!) if I still lived in town. I'll be craving this place until I visit again!
