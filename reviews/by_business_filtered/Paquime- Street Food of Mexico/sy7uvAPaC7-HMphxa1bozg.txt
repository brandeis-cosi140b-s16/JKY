Not bad, good variety of different traditional items, very modern and clean. However, big disappointment with the elote en vaso. It tastes sweet, like canned corn. It's a bit of a slap in the face to the traditional elote carts in the streets of Mexico. They would never serve this crap. My girlfriend and I drove all the way down just for this and we couldn't even finish it. Literally left a bad taste in our mouths. I hope the owner/manager reads this and makes the necessary adjustment to this particular item. Just imagine eating sweet corn with mayo and little salsa Valentina. Just doesn't do it justice.
