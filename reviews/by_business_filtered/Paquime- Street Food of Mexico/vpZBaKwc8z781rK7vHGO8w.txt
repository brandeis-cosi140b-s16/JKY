Holy shiiii-take mushrooms this place was good. 

I had the RIBEYE TACOS. Generous portion of steak topped with cabbage and avocado. It comes with a side of liquid quacamole (probably more traditional), chipotle (think smoky flavor) salsa, a roasted poblano pepper, and a roasted shallot.  

There is a salsa/pickled vegetable bar where you can grab different toppings for your food. I especially loved the pickled carrots and onions. The cucumbers were not pickled, but they were well marinated with oregano and vinegar.  

We also started with some CHIPS AND GUAC/SALSA.Guac was filled with delicious ingredients (very chunky, like Chipotle's, but better).  I wasn't a huge fan of the salsa but it was certainly flavorful.  

We took a generous portion of chocolate strawberry tres leches cake home. I'll dive into that after I run a few miles. :)

My only complaint?  I asked for my meat mediumand it came well done.  Can I please just have this every day for the rest of my life?
