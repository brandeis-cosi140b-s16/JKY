This place is da bomb and with it pretty much being right around the corner from me a much better alternative than Fillintheblankaberto's. 

I'm not really much of a fan of Mexican food to begin with but this place is getting a decent amount of my business. As one reviewer alluded to in an earlier post the ribeye tacos are just crazy good. That same poster mentioned something about the cucumber drink so I sampled that to see for myself. Now I have visions of ribeye tacos and that cucumber drink dancing in my head. To me this place is fairly new. It took me over a month to force myself to stop ordering those damn ribeye tacos so I could sample some other stuff. I'm still testing but I tell you what. Between all the different food choices and desserts, I could probably eat here every single day for a good month and be cool with it.

Oh, yeah. The staff there is hella cool. I hope they continue to stay on their A game. 

Big ups "place around the corner that I can't pronounce the name of" keep doin' the do!
