The food is good, but I feel that it is over priced. The tortas are tiny and not too impressive. The price you pay for a torta is a lot, especially considering los reyes is up the street from them and have tortas thrice the size of theirs. 

the burrito and other food looked fine, i didn't get to try anything else, but my torta and I was not impressed.
