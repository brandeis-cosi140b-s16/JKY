Yeah..... no!
Went there to get a fast margarita and some food in me before heading to Crazy Horse 3 for work and honestly.... I thought I was in crook town. My bf happened to be a pretty good bartender and flair bartender in this town and we sat, as usual, at the bar. 
We ordered a margarita (happy hourse buy one get one single shot, great deal one may think) well, the guy who started the order was good. 
He did the two shots and started pouring the drinks in 2 glasses when this other spike haired dude, who acted like he owned the bar (? manager maybe?) asked him if he had a glass left in the blender....

I was like wtf? There wasnt a full glass left for spike hairs customer order so he just took the 2 drinks already pourded (remind you, 2!! shots for 2 glasses as in single shot order for 2) and put it in another mixer, added tons of ice and did 3!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! drinks with 2 shots we ordered and charged us the full price and the other customer.

My bf didnt say anything, since it was buy one get one. BUT if this happens once it is more common I would think.

I am NOT going back there. The burrito was fast and delicous though, but its WAY overpriced. I get it, its LV and tourists pay too much.

Go to Dona Maria's on Las Vegas Blvd and Charleston corner. The margaritas there are HUGE, STRONG and not 3 out of 2. And its WAY cheaper, with $8.50 for a really large margarita, frozen.
