Came here for happy hour and so glad we did. We came here on the advice of one of our friends. We all had drinks and they were huge and loaded with alcohol. We had a server named Heidi and not only was she pretty she was super sweet. Now I'm big on drinks and service but the food was so authentic. We only had the nachos, tortilla soup, and black bean soup but all of it was tasty. Can't wait to come back on our next trip.
