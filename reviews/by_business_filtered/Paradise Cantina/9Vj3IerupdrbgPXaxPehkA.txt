I came here with my family because my sister mentioned that she liked their tacos. So of course we ordered tacos (chicken) and it came with 3. The chicken was dry and blend, and the sauce that came with it was flavorless. We had to add hot sauce to it. I was worried that our chicken taquitos would be disappointing too, but it was great. Not too greasy, soft, flavorful, and juicy. Our shrimp fajita was good as well, it came with a lot of grilled bell peppers and onions. The rice was a little bland, but with the guacamole, pico, and the vegetables/shrimp, it was yummy. Our waiter, Carrie, was super attentive and friendly, coming over more than once to check up on us. 
The interior had dim lighting, and there was extremely loud music playing, making it hard to have a conversation. The walls and ceiling are covered with various beer brand items (posters, flags, inflatable bottles). They have a really good happy hour deal/weekend deal for margaritas, 2 for 1!
