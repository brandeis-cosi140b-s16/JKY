Ok, I know lots of locals like Paradise Cantina, but I have to say I wasn't too thrilled when I went. We were with a group of friends on a Friday night and the restaurant had a fun, dive bar atmosphere, but the food just was 'meh'. I got the chicken tacos and dry doesn't even begin to cover the flavorless chicken that was crumbling in my hands along with the tortilla.

That said, the happy hour special was awesome - buy one drink, get the second drink free. I would definitely head here for your pregame, but don't make it your main event.
