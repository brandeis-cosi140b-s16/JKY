Nice surprise. Noticed on Yelp they were a good place to watch the game so while I snuck in for a quick burrito I could also keep my eye on the football game.  Food was good and the service was fast and friendly.  I am sure I will visit again when in town and I highly recommend this place for groups that want to hang, talk, get loud, have some fun and not pay Strip prices.
