Good times! Been here quite a few times but the last one was fairly memorable. UNM was in town to play UNLV and there was plenty of liquored up sports fans! Crazy drunk broads brawling and knuckleheads wanting to pound each other too!

Our group had a good time pounding beers and watching the festivities :)
