I wasn't looking for anything special when I came here, just some decent food and good drinks. What I got was much worse. Waiter was very kind and knowledgeable but the food was awful! We got the paradise roll as an app and it was served with pasty Guac and RANCH! Who serves ranch with a Mexican roll. Then they charged an extra buck for everything (even to add jalape√±os even though they were terrible pickled ones). Everything was straight out the can and flavor lacked big time... I'm not a picky eater but this was beyond fake Mexican food. Wouldn't recommend unless your drunk and come during happy hour when you can taste the liquor anymore.
