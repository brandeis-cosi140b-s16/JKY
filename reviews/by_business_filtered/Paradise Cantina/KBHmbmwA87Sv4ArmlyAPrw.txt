I have been to Paradise Cantina on my own a couple of times for food. It is okay food. The Paradise stlye burrito is good. If you order a dinner platter you get rice, beans and chips on the side otherwise the burrito is a la carte. My rice had good flavor but was room temp at best. The beans were good. The chips were pre-salted and overly so. I never salt my chips any how. I found myself brushing off the salt on each chip. On the plus side, service was friendly and quick.

Now if you go to Paradise Cantina with a group after work for, say, a going away party for a departing co-worker as I have several times in the past, it is another story. Order a bucket of beers, a couple margaritas and some shareable appetizers and you are set for a fun evening. It is great place to just hang out and share some laughs.

This place is small and gets crowded quickly so show up early or send out a scout to reserve a table for everybody in advance.
