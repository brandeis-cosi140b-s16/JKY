Omg where to start.
Original margarita: so this tasted weird.  Had a weird taste at the end.  Well it has fresh lime juice, you know when you drink ok and it's going bad, you get that tang.  This has that taste.  Yuck.  So I went to a mojito instead, this was good.
Chips and salsa costs here, guess I'm spoiled.  Chips are "fresh". Yet we had a bunch that were stale, from the previous night?
Rice and beans were good but their blue corn tortillas for cheese enchiladas were very hard.  Wasn't a fan at all.
Service was ok but this place was very over priced and weird.
Please don't think this is Mexican food people.
