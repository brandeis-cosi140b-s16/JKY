What a great surprise. Just minuets off the strip, a bunch of Sports TVs and great Latin - Mexican food. We ordered chips and salsa, plus guacamole. The guac was over the top in taste & texture.  

We shared large servings of  chicken enchiladas on blue tortillas. An explosion of taste.  Great beans and rice with a home cooked flavor. Large servings.  Good drinks  - several selections of beer and drinks.
