At first I was very pleased. 2 for 1 margaritas for happy hour and they actually had alcohol in them. It's the fist decent margarita I have had in Las Vegas. Now coming from California we are used to strong margaritas, free chips, free salsa and very good Mexican food. 

No free chips and salsa here...We look on the menu and it is $8.99 for chips, salsa and guac. Of course, we pass! One of us was having a dish that included chips & salsa and he offered to give it to me. A couple of us ordered tacos and one ordered the hamburger, all of which was pretty good (my husband loved the hamburger) and nice sized portions. 

The dish that came with salsa came with a miniature plastic cup (about an ounce-the kind that are in little mexican places for salsa to go) of salsa. When I commented on the size the waitress said she could bring more if we wanted. Naturally I wanted more, I call the waitress over and she informs me another wee ounce of salsa is $1.00 more. I was shocked and she didn't seem apologetic at all. Her mood changed immediately after that and we realized this is what you get in a tourist town. I visit Vegas frequently because my son lives here so I am used to seeing how short sighted these restaurants are.

To the owners, after spending time on your empty patio during happy hour...you really are missing it. You need to cater to the locals...the cost of chips and salsa is minimal and I can guarantee the minute you start putting free chips and salsa on your tables your restaurant will always be full!! GUARANTEED!

Final word...definitely stop for a margarita during happy hour but be careful what you order as there are hidden extra charges. It's also off the strip which makes parking handy.
