This place was not one that I would recommend to anybody. First off when you walk in to the restaurant the only lights they have are red lights and then rest was black. I've never been to a Mexican restaurant that make their customers pay for chips and salsa, and then they have the nerve to charge you 7$, the margaritas are over priced and not worth it AT ALL! They charge 2.50 for everything, an the worst part about this place... I brought the rest of my Taquitos  home when I went to eat one there was a long blond hair INSIDE!! Save your money and go somewhere else but not this place totally not worth it.
