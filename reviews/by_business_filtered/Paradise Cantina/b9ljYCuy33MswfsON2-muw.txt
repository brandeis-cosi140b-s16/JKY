Dive bar to beat all dive bars!  This place needs to move closer to my house!!!  

On our way to drop off some family at the airport we were a little early so we decided to stop in for a drink of 2.  It was happy hour and ALL drinks are buy one get one.  No matter what the drink is!  Considering I drink Grey Goose or Kettle I was a little surprised.  All drinks we ordered tasted great and they did not skimp on the booze.  Not to much and not to little.

Great vibe serving up mexican food and great tasting drinks.  Our total bill for a total of 12 drinks in total was $54.  Where in Las Vegas can you get drinks this cheap??  Service was great.  She was pleasant and very friendly.

This is a UNLV bar so it's near and dear to my heart!  We will be back, rest assured!
