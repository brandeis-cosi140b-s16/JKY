Well, here I go again in Vegas with Mexican Food. This place was recommended by a friend but it might have been go there and drink and I missed that part. As a bar it was happening but the food was unimpressive. I got fajitas and it was tasteless and totally forgettable. I knew I had to review it fast before I forgot the entire experience lol. It looks like as a bar this place might be cool. Its across from the Hard Rock so it seems to fill up. However, it felt like locals in there so I am not sure who is filling it up. I will have to hit it on the way home some night and check it out as a bar not a restaurant.

One thing I found annoying as well, as they charge $1 for chips and salsa?? So I thought wow it must be good, uh.. no.. It was nothing to even recall, in fact I cant remember what it tasted like. So no freebies in this joint.
