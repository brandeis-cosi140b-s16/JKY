This place sucks. My gripe last time was the cost. I ordered a specialty drink called the Paradise Passion (or something like that) and it didn't taste super good or anything. I also ordered a couple of taquitos that were okay, not very good. I got the bill and almost had a heart attack -- it was like $18!!! For one drink and taquitos!! I was so mad and vow to not spend my money there again!

Also, the place seems kinda grimy.
