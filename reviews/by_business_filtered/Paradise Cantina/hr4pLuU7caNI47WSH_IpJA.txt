I am basing this review from a combination of atleast 5 visits to this place.  I only go this place for a Rebel Game pre-funk or a post Rebel game party.  It is about a 5-10 minute walk to the T & M (of course that depends on how fast you walk).

I stopped there once for a pre-funk and it was pretty much full.  It was evening game and the bar was having happy hour so it worked out perfetcly.  All beers were 2 for 1!  I got 2 dos equis for like $4!

Now... if you stop by here on a post Rebel game night the place will be packed with Rebel fans!  I think the bar gives you a free drink if you show them your stub... ticket stub.  It turns out to be a lively place with cheap drinks!

As far as the food goes... it's more of a drinking place instead of a restaurant, but it serves ok mexican food.  

This is a funb place before and or after the Rebel games!
