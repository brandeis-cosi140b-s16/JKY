So me and my friend crashed a Zappos event here a couple weeks back. So even though my homie Tony picked up the tab, I'm surprised still at how painfully average I found the food to be. Now usually I find free food to always taste a bit better than when I have to pay,  So I couldn't imagine being happy if I had actually bought the food. We tried a couple things but nothing was particularly impressive. The rolled tacos were pretty dry, they kind of reminded me of the taquitos you get in the freezers at Costco. The guac? Go to chipotle, the boneless wings were chewy and had a rubbery texture, and interestingly Paradise does not serve desert. 

Being the only real, "cantina" (which I guess is Spanish for douchy bar) around UNLV, its my sad duty to report that they have almost no beers on tap beyond the standard domestics. The tequila selection was alright but I expected more from the place. If your looking for a real cantina check out Diablo's or Hussong's on the strip.

Fortunately the bar has a good TV set-up to catch the game. TVs everywhere along with the big patio out front makes it a good spot together for friends. Our server told us about the happy hour on the drinks and food which along with the TVs makes Paradise a good spot to catch a game. Keep your expectations in check and you will enjoy the place more than I did.
