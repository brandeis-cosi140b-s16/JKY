Went to get some food before the airport at this little Mexican spot. The bartender was friendly and greeted us. 
Our waitress came out and asked if we wanted drinks but wasn't listening to us as we ordered. She had a really bad attitude when my friend said she'd like her soup first (sounded like fast) so the waitress goes, "we'll try as fast as possible but i can't rush anything, what else do you want?"

After the food that came, the beans smelled like sweaty old shoes, the burrito was cold, the fajitas had two pieces of chicken. Yes we counted, and took a picture but lost the phone before I could post. Our bill came out as soon as our food came out. Repulsive service and equally repulsive food!
