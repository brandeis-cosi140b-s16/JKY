Happy hour here I come! How can you not love 2 for 1 drinks and fattening bar food?!

I enjoy the pretzel with spicy cheese sauce as my food du jour. Don't expect haute cuisine, it's just a fun place to meet up with your friends after work to drink and chat.

Keep your expectations low and have fun!
