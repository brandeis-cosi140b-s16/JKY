There is really only one reason to go to Paradise Cantina - HAPPY HOUR!!!!  2 for 1 drinks from 4 - 7 pm...(check me on that time, tho).  Double fisted Patron shots?  I'm there!  Chase it with double fisted Crown and Cokes?  I'm TOTALLY there!!!

There is outside seating, the food is ok (typical Ameri-Mexican food), and the ambiance is fun.  The music is a little loud so don't plan on having that quiet heart to heart with you're honey.  But if you wanna hang out with friends, and get drunk enough to make new friends, this is the place to do it!!!!
