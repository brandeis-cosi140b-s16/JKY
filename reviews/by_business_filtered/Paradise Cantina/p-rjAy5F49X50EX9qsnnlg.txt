Who drives from LA to Vegas for a 21 hour stay???? This girl, that's who! So, during my whirlwind Friday night in Sin City this weekend, you can bet I made the most of those 21 hours! And when my local friend and I were on hour 7 of drinking and at least one of us (it was clearly me) had made it all the way through an amazing Foo Fighters show at the Joint, it was time to find a bar because, well,  you always need more drinks! 

Now, if you read my reviews, you can probably guess that I am much more of a bar type gal rather than a lounge lizard. And Vegas dance clubs get old real quick, so with only those 21 precious hours and months of stuff to catch up on with my friend, we wandered out of the Hard Rock in a quest for a sweet-ass bar, within walking distance of course. My friend knew about a hoffbrau across the street but it was closing so we just happened to wander into this strip mall instead and the word cantina was all we needed to make our way inside. 

Standard crazy mexican bar decor greeted us on the inside along with 2 great bartender brothers who, in true Vegas transplant fashion were from Ohio. Those boys kept us entertained and kept the delicious drinks flowing. Sean even let me play dj with his ipod after already playing every song I requested - even better than the best jukebox if you ask me! My friend ordered a bowl of tortilla soup at one point and that was delicious as well. Even a regular at the bar who just so happened to be from our home town here in Cali (but many years older than us) was there... so surreal he could have been planted there just to add familiarity! Soon, our one drink to tide us over until we figured out where else to go became about 8 drinks and 3 1/2 hours so Paradise Cantina will definitely hold a fond place in my liver and I will surely be back for chill, fun, but still very very drunken nights in Vegas!
