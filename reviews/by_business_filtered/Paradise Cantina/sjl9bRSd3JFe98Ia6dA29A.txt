A group of us went to the Paradise Cantina when we had a little extra free time for lunch. This restaurant has a great location and when the weather is nice it's great to sit out on the patio.

I would give the food a "schme" rating. That's a step above "bleck" and a notch below "ohmagaw." It's very Americanized Mexican food. The chicken is unseasoned and all white meat. I'm pretty sure it's a plain chicken breasteses. Not too shabby inside a quesadilla, but kind of odd for a taco or tostada. The chips and salsa were probably the best part of the meal. Salsa had great flavor and came with guacamole. I was a little perturbed that they actually charged for chips and salsa - they must not have gotten the memo that these sorts of things are generally free when you dine-in. 

It looks like they have some pretty awesome Happy Hour deals. I'd definitely be inclined to go back for Happy Hour or have lunch there again.

Great stop on a nice day, just don't expect a superb Mexican cuisine.
