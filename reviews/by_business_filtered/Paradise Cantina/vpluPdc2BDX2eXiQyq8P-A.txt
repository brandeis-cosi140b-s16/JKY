I've been coming here since 2009; it couldn't be located in a more convenient spot just one block away from UNLV. This has definitely served as the go-to spot to get hammered after all of our study sessions and final exams, and to watch our favorite sports teams. They buy the entire package, and they have like 37 TVs in the place so you definitely can't miss a down. Food is a little better than average bar food, but if you're coming here only for the food then you might have a couple issues. Come here to get hammered and sing karaoke. Just make sure you take a cab home and you're solid.
