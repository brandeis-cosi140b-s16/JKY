I've been coming in here for years and have always had great service. The two for one happy hour is a great deal although the regular price on the drinks is already a little high although still cheap for "strip" standards. The food menu needs to be completely overhauled. Stick to the basic appetizers like wings and taquitos and you will be fine. The mexican food however is poor quality and way overpriced. There's lots of televisions for sports although some of them are in hard to watch locations. There is almost always some good classic rock on the stereo.It's not much of a gaming bar with only a few video poker machines located at a small bar.Most of the crowd doesnt go here to gamble anyway.The bartenders are all fast and efficient. Its more of a local college/working class hangout with some stragglers from the various nearby hotels mixed in.
