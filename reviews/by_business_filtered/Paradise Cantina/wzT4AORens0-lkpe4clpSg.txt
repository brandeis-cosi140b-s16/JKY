This bar is the perfect blend of what I look for in my type of watering hole.  Start off with strong large volume drinks add a shot of good tex-mex bar food a splash of several TVs tuned to sports, shake and serve over cheap prices!  On a recent trip up to Vegas, my wife and I were in search for great spots the locals approve of.  Paradise did not disappoint!  I have added this place to the must do list when in Sin City, and you should too!
