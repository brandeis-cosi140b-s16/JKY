This little gem is located in the corner of a strip mall right across the street from the Hard Rock hotel. Happy hour is 2 for 1 drinks...and the drinks are good! Our wonderful bartender Aaron made amazing margaritas and bloody marys for us...and they were potent! We enjoyed some guac, chips, queso, and salsa. The chips and guac are made fresh everyday and were delicious! The queso was velveeta heaven!

All of the staff were upbeat and awesome! This is one of my new favorite Vegas watering holes!
