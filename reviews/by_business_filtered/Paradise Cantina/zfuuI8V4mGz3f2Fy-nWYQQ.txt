Happy hour here I come! How can you not love 2 for 1 drinks and fattening bar food?!

I enjoy the pretzel with spicy cheese sauce as my food du jour. Don't expect haute cuisine, it's just a fun place to meet up with your friends after work to drink and chat. The food isn't amazing, but you're probably just here for the drinks. Stick to pub grub. Wings and queso dip are some good options too.

Keep your expectations low and have fun!
