SO good! We went for the first time about a month ago and we've been back 3 times since! It's a tiny little place with really nice people and REALLY great food! It's fresh and delicious. My (current) favorite is the Sloppy Joe. If I wasn't already a tad on the fatty fat-fat-fat side I'd be eating there every day.
Also, if you get fries (which are amazing) and they offer you ranch on the side- TAKE IT, IT IS THE BEST RANCH OF ALL TIME.
