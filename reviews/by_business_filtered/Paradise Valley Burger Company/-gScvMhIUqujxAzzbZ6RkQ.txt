Great Burgers! I had the Burger Brûlée & my husband had the Booze Burger (not on the menu), both were wonderful. The Brûlée was an excellent combination & not something I would have thought to put together. The little kick of crunchy sweetness was fantastic! The fries were also wonderfully seasoned & crispy, and the peanut butter shake was super tasty. Great service & they get people through the line very quickly. Lunch on Saturday was packed!
