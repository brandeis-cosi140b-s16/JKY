Our adventurous selves found a quick googling of this place associated with Guy Fieri so we have it a go. If you're not getting a a burger skip this joint. The girlfriend ordered a chicken sandwich, it was pretty awful. Just poor quality chicken and built poorly. The staff was mediocre, seemed disinterested. I got a green chili burger and although greasy and messy. I loved it. I wouldn't do it on the regular but occasionally it's a fun little joint. Infant are a scrambled egg and he would give that 5stars as per usual with this kid. 

Don't come with too many expectations and you'll do just fine.
