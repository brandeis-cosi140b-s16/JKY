Delicious!!! Worth the drive to Paradise Valley! The burgers are delicious. I love how light the bun is as to not distract from the wonderful taste of the burger. The addition of cucumbers and pickled onions add a nice cool touch. Try the sweet potato tots and the French toast fries. 
The service is amazing, and everyone there was very friendly. Don't be distracted by the strip mall location, the food does all the talking!
