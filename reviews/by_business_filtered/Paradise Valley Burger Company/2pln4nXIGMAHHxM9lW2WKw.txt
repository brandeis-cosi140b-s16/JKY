this burger place is amazing. I got the brûlée burger and it was so delicious and their french fries are good as well! went on a Saturday at 12:30pm and waiting about ten minutes in a long line and about 10-15 minutes after ordering so not too bad for the long line. not good for large groups as the seating is mostly for 2-4 people. small patio as well for the beautiful days.
