Family Owned and Operated hole in the wall restaurant that makes Tasty Burgers, Sandwiches, Tacos, and Taco Salads. Inside is clean and tidy with cool pictures of some of his specialties on the wall. Service is Friendly and Fast. They were in Phoenix Magazine back in July 2012 for Cheap Eats for $12 or less.

Specialty Burgers include: Country fried burger smothered in gravy topped with crispy onions. The Beach House burger with roasted green chili, smoked mozzarella and pico de gallo. The Burger Brulee with a fried egg, bacon, onion, burnt sugar and havarti cheese. The Burger Parmesana with marinara, mozzarella, parmesan and basil. They also have your basic versions as well as a Grilled Portabella. You can substitute chicken breast on any burger if you like.

Sandwiches include: Grilled cheese, Breakfast club, B.L.T, Sloppy joe, Pulled Pork, Chicken club, Pulled vegetarian, and a Shrimp club on a choice of white, 9 grain, or a brioche bun.

Today I went with the Paradise Bacon CHZ with an extra patty and a side of seasoned fries. It was very good. The wife had the Chicken Club on 9 grain with a side of sweet potato tater tots which I got to help finish.

Definitely going back to try some of the other menu choices like the tacos, some carnival corn grilled on the cob and maybe some DEEP FRIED Ice Cream with honey, strawberry and whipped cream.

Keep it Local when you can. ENJOY!
