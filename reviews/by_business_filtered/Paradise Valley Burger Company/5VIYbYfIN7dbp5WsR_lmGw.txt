Traveled from Texas to find a little bit of Paradise at Paradise Valley Burger. Had a very juicy Beach Burger loaded down with flavor. My daughter stepped out and explored the Brulee' Burger. For one who is not prone to hyperbole, she proclaimed it the best burger of her sixteen years on earth. Tasty seasoned fries to top it off.  Took some time but that seems to be the standard here in Phoenix. It's okay. I'm on vacation.
