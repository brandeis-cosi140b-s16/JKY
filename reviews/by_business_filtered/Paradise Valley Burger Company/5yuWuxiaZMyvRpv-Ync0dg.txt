Pickled Onions.....WOW!!!! If you're craving a delicious burger and you want it now you have got to go to Paradise Valley Burger Company.  I ordered the Burger Brulee and it did not disappoint.  The pickled onions were amazing with the egg, bacon, toasted bun, & seasoned burger.  I've had plenty of burgers with egg and they all start to taste similar, this one DID NOT!  My father-n-law had the Paradise Bacon CHZ and he really enjoyed it, so much so that he wanted to come back the next day just to make sure if was actually that good....lol.  Service is good, burger is better, and they are quick. Must try if you're pressed for time and want a delicious burger or if you just want a good bite.
