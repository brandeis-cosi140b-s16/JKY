The layout of this place is nice and simple. Food pictures on the wall made it helpful to choose what to eat on the menu. 

Staff members were nice, welcoming, and helpful. So i would say good service. 

Menu was small, but there is soo much you can do to customize your order. Thats what i liked about it. 

Food was tasteful! Flavors were good! I was happy with my order. 

I recommend this to people who love food and presentation and taste! 

Would i eat here again? Hell yea!
