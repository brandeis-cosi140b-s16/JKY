For a hole In The wall burger joint this is place is fabulous.  We arrived on a Friday night with a bus load of out of town college volleyball players and we found seats, ordered and enjoyed our dinners. All the orders were correct, came out quickly and were delicious.  Prices are reasonable, food was plentiful and the menu has a good variety of options. I didn't care for the sweet seasoning on the fries but others in our group loved it. If I was a local, this place would be a regular destination for us.
