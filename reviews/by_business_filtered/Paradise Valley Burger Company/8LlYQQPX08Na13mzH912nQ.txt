This place is unreal. If you watch the show "Bob's Burgers" I feel this is like the real life equivalent. The restaurant is nothing impressive to look at--a simple counter, a few tables inside, and a whiteboard with changing specials that have fun names.

But man, the food that comes out of that kitchen is next level. I discovered and tried it for the first time on a Tuesday and by Sunday I had eaten there 3 times. Every burger or specialty sandwich I've had is outrageously good. The toppings/fixins pair so well with the style of burger or sandwich you order. Cucumbers on a cheeseburger? It's the best thing you never knew you wanted. The food you get will be far more of a culinary experience than you were expecting.

Oh, and do yourself a favor and get a milkshake too, like the Bacon Maple Pecan shake, it tastes like breakfast and dessert in the same cup.
