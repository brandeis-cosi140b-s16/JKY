Paradise Valley Burger has tasty burgers so I was exited to see them at Chase Field. Unfortunately, their operation is HORRIBLE! There was no wait to order, then you realize there are close to 50 people waiting for their food. I spent 40 minutes waiting for my food. Skip this place and head to others who have figured out who to run their operation.

Update: Manager comes out and informs crowd there are no more burgers and offers refunds. Seriously?

Final update: Bret, the owner, contacted me. I posted an updated review capturing the awesome job he did in responding to the situation. I changed my rating from a 1 to a 5 because the situation was partly out of his control and because he totally owned up to the experience. Great turnaround!
