Now, I have an update for the previous issue I had and my unfortunate experience.  The owner, Bret actually reached out to me and after speaking I came in and BAM! Back to the old ways. GREAT FOOD, GREAT SERVICE, GREAT IDEAS. Texas BBQ burger was seasoned well, complemented with slaw, sauce and cheese. Sweet and salty fries and home made jalape√±o ranch....perfect. I must say nowadays its very difficult to find an owner of a business who actually listens to his customers and practices that age-old business model that the customer is your greatest asset. Again, thank you for making a one of a kind burger with a one of a kind experience! 

Gotta say, I've had a lot of rhe food on the menu. Everything was great, creative and filling. I had to post something on here though abiut the guy at the counter that was bald and had a beard. By far one of the most rude individuals I have ever had the displeasure of interacting with. Friday afternoon, somewhat busy, and just gave off a horrible impression like he hated his job. Get over it and move on, otherwise, suck it up, smile and treat your customers with a little respect and gratitude, and some dang appreciation. Ordered a chocolate malt and 3 customers later, all treated with the same attitude hadn't even started it. Come on now, pure profit and customrrs and all you can do is sulk and ruin whatever business you have coming in by treating them and myself with such disregard? Hopefully this gets to someone who notices a common denominator with this guy and the reviews aimed at him.
