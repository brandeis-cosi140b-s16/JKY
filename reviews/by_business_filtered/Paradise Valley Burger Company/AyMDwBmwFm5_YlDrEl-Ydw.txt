This review is long overdue. PV Burg (as my boyfriend and I so affectionately call it), is really the best burger in town. My standard order is the Brulee and I haven't been disappointed once. I love the crazy combinations these guys come up with and that we can support a local joint instead of the same chain burger places time and again. Guys behind the counter are always friendly and fun to joke with, they play the best tunes, and the sweet potato tots are top notch. I'd be lost without them.
