This is LITERALLY the best place in phoenix to get a burger. The owner is active in the restaurant and always happy to help. It is also vegetarian friendly, you can replace the patty with a Portobello mushroom. I always feel welcomed and at home when I come in to eat here. I take all my friends and family here. I will always return and I will always recommend. Thank you guys!
