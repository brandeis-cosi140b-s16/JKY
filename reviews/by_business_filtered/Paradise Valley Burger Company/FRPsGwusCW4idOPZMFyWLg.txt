The burgers are really flavorful! They have plenty of great combinations you can chose from. This is a great place you can go and sit down with friends. And get a quick jucy burger. I'm a chief and I know good food. The French frys are sweet and salty and I think about them all the time. If you plan on going there around lunch time. Be prepared to wait in a line out the door.
