I've really wanted to try this place and today was my lucky day. The outside is so unassuming and a shopping center that I probably would never go to except for PVBC. Anyways, we walked in and I wasn't expecting too much on the inside but it was very cool. Little round wooden tables and very clean. Very interesting that they use clothes dryer tubes for their lighting. Very unusual. Never seen this before. 

The guy at the counter was very nice and friendly. The menu was on a board but he handed us a paper menu for all the details. I decided to try their special burger of the week which as a melanzane. It had two burgers, fried egg plant, and cheese. Oh my gosh. So good. I also order the sweet potato tots. Wow. Crispy but not over cooked. We all loved them and we were fighting over them. My daughter had the Fresno chicken tacos. Comes with three. Had a bite and they were really tasty with a little kick to it. Excellent. But then my wife ordered the taco salad. It was okay. Nothing  special but she enjoyed. 

I was very impressed that our food came out really fast after we ordered. They both came to our table a few time to ask us about the food and even took away our basket after we finished eating. Very cool. 

I was not disappointed. This is a great place for a burger. I would say they don't  have huge portions and right in line with the cost of a great burger. I'm glad it's close to where I live so I will be back for sure. Eat up....
