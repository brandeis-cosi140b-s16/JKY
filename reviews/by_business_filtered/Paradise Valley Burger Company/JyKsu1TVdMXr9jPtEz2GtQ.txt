I've been here a couple times, and found Paradise Valley Burger to be a consistent 4-star experience.

For a burger joint, the food ranks between a 4 to 5 star. They offer a huge assortment of toppings for the burgers, chicken sandwiches and portabello mushroom sandwich.  I have enjoyed the Paradise Bacon Cheeseburger, and have stolen a few bites of my dining companion's food as well. The Country Fried Burger is a decadent as it sounds- country fried, smothered in gravy with crispy fried onions- no, I didn't order it, but I sure did sneak a taste!  And while I don't understand ordering a chicken sandwich at a burger joint, I did get to sample a bit of a chicken sandwich, and it was flavorful and juicy, very hot and fresh off the grill.

The sides are good as well- sweet potato tater tots were another item I personally did not order but stole a few before they quickly disappeared. 

Service time was inconsistent, rating it a 3 to 4 star. Seems when they get a full house, output noticeably slows. If I was in a hurry to get back to an office, I might find this a dealbreaker. But maybe people coming from a work site could phone in an order so it's ready when they arrive. 

Also, they have fresh brewed Iced Tea. They have a bunch of sodas in a cooler case, but since I am not a soda drinker, I cannot give you much more info on that.

Now of course I COULD point out that they are making your food fresh and that does take a little more time. Well, guess I just pointed that fact out. Still, if there's one thing that PV Burger Co. might work on, it would be workflow / consistent timing of orders during particularly busy hours.

Casual/comfortable indoor environment, good place to meet up w/ friends, or grab a quick bite by yourself even. Definitely on the "Yes" list of places for a return visit
