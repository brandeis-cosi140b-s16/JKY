Pretty decent burger joint. Like most people, we decided to stop by after we watched an episode of Triple D from Food Network. The Bacon and Cheese Burger was pretty darn tasty. I'm not a fan of pickles but even my boyfriend wasn't a fan of the pickled onions. Some people seem to LOVE it though. 

I would've opted for the sweet potato tots over the fries if I had known they add sugar to the seasoning. Might as well have sweet potato fries on the menu if you're gong to add sugar to the regular french fries. Or maybe have homemade spicy ketchup.. mmmm

The staff was friendly and service was pretty fast even though the place is jam packed. (Thanks Food Network)
