This place is an awesome departure from the usual suspects (In-N-Out, Chuckbox, Deluxe Burger).  They have some really creative burgers and some awesome touches (pickled turnips on the burger was amazing...reminded me of Shawarma places in Montreal) and of course their amazing sweet potato tater tots.  The space is a little small, and because it's good it gets packed but the turnover is also pretty quick so the wait to be seated isn't too bad.  It's well worth the wait.  I came here when they first opened and came back just recently with some family who had never been here, and they loved it.  I'm glad to see it doing well.
