Based on the reviews we were excited to try this spot. Unfortunately,  we were disappointed.  Definitely not a fan of the seasonings on the French fries. "All the fixins" that came on my burger was too much...too many things were pickled and the flavors did not mix well for my taste buds. Nice place, but not for us.
