Found out this place is one of the top 10 burgers in Phoenix, so of course my BF wanted to check it out. I don't eat red meat and he noticed they had a few veggie options too.  The place is small and "divish" and we had trouble finding a seat but once we ordered we were able to move to a bigger table. He had a burger with bacon, egg and cheese on a brioche bun. He said it was a very good burger, just wished it was a little bigger (he's 6'10"). I had the pulled veggie sandwich and oh my! They smoked the vegetables and had a tangy bbq sauce that pulled all the flavors together. They also have French toast fries which we regretted not ordering, but will definitely get them next time.
