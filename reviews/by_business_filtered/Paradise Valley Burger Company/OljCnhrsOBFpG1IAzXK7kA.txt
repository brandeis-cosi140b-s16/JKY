I didn't realize I ate here and didn't review it.  Very good.  I had the Brulee Burger.  It was great.  Perfectly cooked and very delicious included the sugared bun.  I also had the sweet potato tots, which I loved and my only complaint would be watch the fryer a little closer ;).  Still awesome though.  So why four stars??  Because, this place is great but I wanted something other than a milkshake if you get my drift.  I would and plan on going back a 100 times, but I would really love if I could go for a dinner option and have a glass of wine.  It was also a little small for a stay in option as well.  Great burger.  I would place it higher than other highly acclaimed places, like Rehab, Habit or Smashburger.  It was WAY better.
