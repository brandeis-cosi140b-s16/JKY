I had the Beach Burger today and my husband had the Parmaseanna Burger. Best burgers we've ever had for $7.00. They were seriously yummy! 

We also tried the french toast fries... more like a dessert than like fries. Still really interesting and tasty, but I'd only recommend them for someone who has a serious sweet tooth.
