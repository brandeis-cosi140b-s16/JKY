I have been here twice now and was not disappointed, I loved both the burgers I've had. But my favorite of the 2 was the brûlée burger. The service is fast and good. My only compliant would be that they had a wasabi burger on special and it was a massive glob of wasabi on it. Made it too intense. But other thank that I loved it!
