First time here. Came on a whim and I'm glad we did. Food was great. I was skeptical when they said all the burgers came with 2 patties but they aren't huge so it made sense. The sweet potato tots are AMAZING!  I had the booze burger and it was so tasty. Well worth the price and definitely would come back.
