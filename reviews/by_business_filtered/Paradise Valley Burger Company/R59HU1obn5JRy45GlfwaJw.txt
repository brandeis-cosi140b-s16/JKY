I give this guy credit.  It takes guts to open a burger joint in a town with a bajillion other ones.  They all try to stand out from one another which is the one thing that makes them all similar to me.  Applying some type of schtick to over-priced meat is not all it takes to win my patronage.  Anyway....

My wife and I went here for dinner on Friday night.  It was about 7pm and the place was pretty dead which was nice.  It was us, a few workers and 2-3 other diners.  I didn't think so by looking at the place, but it really is a neighborhood joint.  Everybody seemed to know each other and there was friendly banter between some of the diners and owner/workers.  I got a real nice friendly neighborhood vibe from the place.

The food....

* Ceasar salad - Very good - a bit too much dressing but that's the way I like it
* Burger Brulee - Interesting and pretty good - I give them credit for trying something different, but it really wasn't my thing.  The burnt sugar on the bun gave it a crunchy texture but having a sweetness to a burger is weird to me.
* Beach house burger - This was a good burger.  I originally wanted to order this but my wife said she was getting it so I had to order a different one.  From the bite that she gave me I could tell that it was very good.  All the ingredients seemed to work together on this one.
* Sweet potato tots - These were excellent.  The only thing that would have made them better is some type of aioli.
* Seasoned fries - Very good - They were perfectly cooked and seasoned.

The people here are what really stand out in my mind about this place.  The owner and all the other workers were very friendly and passionate about their restaurant.  I can't wait to return to try about 17 other things on their menu that look good.
