This place was great! My favorite part, hands down, was the seasoned fries. Yes, I know this is a burger place known for burgers, but the fries were the part I enjoyed the most. The price was a little high to get a burger, fries and a drink, but the meal was well worth it. I had the Bruleé Burger and season fries. The burger was great. Everything worked so well together, and the bruleé on the bun was a great touch and not overpowering. The fries though were the star. No need for any sauce, the seasoned fries by themselves were perfect - sweet, salty, delicious. Only rating 4 stars because the price was a little higher than I feel it should have been.

We will definitely be coming back.
