Frys waaaay over seasoned with not so good seasoning salt, otherwise would probably be delicious.  I really wanted to like them, but meh... Didn't realize I needed to request plain but that's what I'll do next time.
Hold the Hershey's chocolate syrup in the shake.  Yuk. 
Burger was ok...not convinced they're making patties fresh, tasted frozen.  Bun was great, toppings yummy.  Better than fast food as my husband said, but by no means 5 star.  
Overall with a little effort into improving the ambiance and some little tweaks to the food it could be really good.  Just wasn't ths time.
