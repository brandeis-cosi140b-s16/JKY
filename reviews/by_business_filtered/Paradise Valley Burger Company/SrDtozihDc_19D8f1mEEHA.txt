Wow! After watching them on guy's show, we had to try! Walking in you can smell the goodness! They asked how we heard "food network!" And then ordered our yummy food! Honestly- one of the best burgers- only thing missing is gluten free bun (I have celiac) - but even with lettuce- amazing- cole slaw was yummmmmmy and my hubby said the fries were killer! We will go back!! #supportlocal
