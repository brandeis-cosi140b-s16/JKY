I am not a burger snob I just like a simple burger that is fresh and has some good beef flavor.  And that is what I got for my money. The bun was fresh and toasted. The burger juicy and cooked just right.  
You can get a burger pretty much any way you want but it will cost you for each additional item
The service was okay, the ambiance was okay nothing special.  I wish they served beer and wine but oh well.  A few sports TV's would be nice too

I will be back to try a few other tempting items on the menu!
