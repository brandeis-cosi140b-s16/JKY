Cool guys running the joint, have a nice convo pretty much every time I come in there, but most importantly, the Burger Brulee is seriously the GREATEST BURGER I HAVE EVER HAD!!!!!!!! And trust me, I've eaten literally THOUSANDS OF BURGERS in my life. It really does give you a Foodgasm. The flavors explode in your mouth. The Caramelized sugar on the light, fluffy brioche bun gives a dessert quality to  it, combing with the yolk of the egg & creamy Havarti, it makes it almost like a custard, but then the bacon comes in & so its like a crazy, gourmet french toast breakfast sandwich, but then you're like "wait I thought this was a burger?" And then the delicious, juicy, perfectly cooked burger patty hits your taste buds & then you hear the Angle's Harps & a warm, golden light casts over you.
