My first impression after eating here is that it is a little over-hyped. Maybe it was just my particular burger. Not sure. There is a definite sense of creativity in their menu and there is good amount of unique variations.

       I ordered the weekly special which sounded pretty good (The Chipoodle: smoked mozzarella, chipotle aioli, candied bacon, and fried onions). The fried onions were awesome, the candied bacon was lost and only noticed in a few bites, and the aioli was on the slim side as well.) I also ordered the Sweet Potato Tater Tots but was less than impressed. 

       I didn't feel that anything I ate was over the top (flavor wise). I will come here and try something else since the menu is so promising. The Beach House looks pretty good.

       My bill came out to over $12 for a burger, fries, and soda. For that I want something better than what the chains offer. I hate to say that I would have been happier with a Five Guys Burger. One more try may change my mind. We'll see.
