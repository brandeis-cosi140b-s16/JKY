This is by far my favorite burger joint in the valley.  They not only have a nice selection of everyday burgers, every week they have a special to keep the regulars happy.  If you are not in the mood for a burger their tacos are incredible, I recommend the beef fresno tacos.  Have yet to try something I haven't liked.
