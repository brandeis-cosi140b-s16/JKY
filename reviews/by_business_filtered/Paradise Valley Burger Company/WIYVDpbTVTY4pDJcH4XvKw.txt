The wife and i were trying to decide where and what to eat for lunch when we decided on this burger place.  We were very happy at we tried it.  I had the  country steak sandwich with sweet potato tots.  The wife had bacon cheese burger with fries.  We event treated ourselves to shakes.  I had peanut butter and she had the Lucky Charms shake. Absolutely worth trying! If you want a choice of unique burgers and delicious shakes-try this place!
