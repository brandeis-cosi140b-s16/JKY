This was my first time eating here.  I had a Paradise Burger with cheddar plus fries with a side of their 1000 Island blend. The meal was fairly good but also pretty surprising.  In my every day diet I tend to stay away from sugar.  I have it once in a while as a cheat treat.  Because of not eating it often,  I can tell without a doubt when I taste it,  and I tasted plenty in this meal.  Apparently they like to use sugar to put a different spin on their items.  The fries were liberally sprinkled with a sugar salt blend,  and either the cucumber or onion (maybe both!) had been soaked in sugar water.  It seems like there was sugar in the bun, too,  but I can't be sure,  it may have been from something else.  Today happened to be a cheat day for me,  (hence burger and fries) so this meal wasn't really a problem for me,  but I won't eat here on any kind of a regular basis because of it. This must be their trademark taste and if you love sugar,  this may end up being a favorite of yours. The 1000 Island blend is tasty,  I recommend it. Since I didn't try the Taco Salad or any other items,  I can't say if they have sugar. 

So,  all in all it was ok,  just know what you're ordering if you go there.
