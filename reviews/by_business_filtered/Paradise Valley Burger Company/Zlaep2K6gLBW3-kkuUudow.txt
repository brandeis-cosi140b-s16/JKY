I've been here about 5 or 6 times and have enjoyed every visit. The Burger Brulee is still my favorite next to the portabella mushroom burger they sometimes offer (Where the mushrooms substitute for the buns.)Messy but fun.
The marshmallow shake is one of the best shakes I've had anywhere, let alone AZ.

I've really glad this place has been building a name for itself and I'm a fan. I hope to visit again soon.

My only wish is that the owner would update their website or Facebook page more often to reflect the weekly specials.
