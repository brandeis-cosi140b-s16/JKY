Easily one of my favorite burger places in Phoenix.  I have been here at least a dozen times and it as consistent as it gets.  Ive only done the Paradise burger and a side of fries as well as a  chicken club sandwich so I cant speak about the rest of the menu but have no doubt its amazing.  The burger is juicy, flavorful and the seasoning on the fries are exactly what I want my fries to be like.  I actually order the fries with extra seasoning because they are that delicious.  

The complex its in is not particularly nice, even borderline shady (had a few weird encounters due to the liquor store next to the place)  but its well worth going inside.  The staff have always been friendly and know their customers.  Its borderline a five star for me because the food is really that good, but the actual establishment inside is pretty tiny and cramped. I almost wish they could buy out one of the places beside them just to expand the seating because I most certainly do not want them to move locations since its so close.  Its unpretentious, values its customers, and overall a gem.  Another well deserved highly rated restaurant in phoenix and for good reason.
