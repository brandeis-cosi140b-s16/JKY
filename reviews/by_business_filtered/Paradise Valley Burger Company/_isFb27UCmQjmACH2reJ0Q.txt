I seldom dream about burgers but when I do, the Brûlée Burger is definitely one that comes to mind. Combining savory and sweet is often a daunting task because the result ends up with one of the two extremes dominating. It reminds me of those days I lay victim to endless handfuls of kettle corn popped fresh at a stand and the sweet smell paraded through the air like some jerk, "Buy me! Eat me!" The taste was and is still both salty and sweet and satisfying. 

     Well hello again friend. Except this time, you are disguised as an incredible rich tasting burger. Thank goodness I took pictures of you dear Brûlée Burger because I ate you all too quickly. Fried egg, bacon, onion, burned sugar, and havarti.. Ugh! Your buddies, the sweet potato tots, did their fare share of damage as well, since they too quickly disappeared in my tummy along with the chipotle ketchup!

     My hubby ate a special called New Year's Burger, which was crazy spicy but delicious as well. How could you go wrong with a deep fried bun? The caramelized onions, peppers, and cheese were an unlikely but welcome trio with the burger hugged by deep fried goodness. 

     Don't expect a fancy pants trendy burger joint here. The food speaks for itself and will leave you smiling and very happy!
