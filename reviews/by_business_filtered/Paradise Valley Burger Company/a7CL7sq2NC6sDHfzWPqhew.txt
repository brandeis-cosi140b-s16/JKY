Solid, but not my favorite.  Maybe I'm more of a burger traditionalist.  I had two of their specialty burgers (St Patty's day and Southern).  SPD was solid with unique flavors.  Southern was bland to my taste.  I'd give them another try and go with one of their more traditional offerings.

Service was a little slow, but they were busy and I did not feel ignored, etc.  Owner was working the counter and did a good job representing his business.  

My favorite burger out there is from Modern Burger.  There is now one in the Sky Harbor.
