Fantastic menu. Bf and I have tried almost everything they serve at this point! 
I'm a vegetarian so I love their veggie options, definitely no run-of-mill stuff. I like the pulled veggie sandwich, yummy Smokey flavor. My kids love the French toast bites and I'm a huge fan of the veggie tacos, competition style. My boyfriend is obsessed with the brulee burger. 
Only thing is there aren't a lot of tables and the word is out about how good the place is so it can get packed!
