We decided to eat here on a whim. My husband got the burger brûlée and I got the beach house burger. Both were fantastic. The buns were perfect and we both agreed these were the best burgers we had had in a really long time. The sweet potato tater tots and French fries were also amazing. For $27 it fed our family of five. I'm definitely going back. Friendly service, casual atmosphere, and clean. Thumbs up all the way!
