Short Version: Great friendly service. Kinda random location. Tasty and unique burgers. We got the Beach House (pretty plain), The Special (tasty), Burger Brûlée (best of the three). Also got the French Toast Fries (unique and tastes just as it sounds)

Long version: it was our first time here and it was kind of difficult to find the place because the sign wasn't lit up. It's also not in the best area of town but it definitely adds character to the place. We were immediately greeted by a friendly guy. He knew all about the menu and happily helped us with our order making suggestions for us. Great service. I got the special (11/11/13) which was ham, patty in an English muffin with a tasty sauce. It was definitely unique and tasty. It reminded me of a breakfast sandwich. It looked small but the burgers are all filling. My wife got the Beach House which was simple and rather plain compared to the others. My friend got the Burger Brûlée which was our favorite of the three. I'm a sucker for burgers with eggs though. Lastly we got the French toast fries which tastes exactly as it's described. It's very state fair-y as a friend perfectly described it. I didn't know if it would work but it absolutely does. However, I'd suggest only ordering one and sharing since it's rich. I would imagine I'd get sick of it if I tried to go it alone.
