Wasn't what I thought it would be?  I ordered the Beach House but subbed in chicken instead of the burger. Maybe this was the problem? The chicken was not a breast, but instead it was diced and made the sandwich tremendously difficult to eat. My bun completely fell apart and I had to eat it with a fork! A fork! This just made it taste wrong. I tried my husband's paradise bacon chz and it was okay, but the burger patties were a bit greasy. The fries were really good, they had some sort of chili spice on them. The sweet potato tots were also good, but I'm not sure if they are homemade or store bought. Pretty sure they are store bought :(
