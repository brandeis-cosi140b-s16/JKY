If I could, the rating would be 4 and 1/2 stars. The food and the service was great.

A friend of ours told us about the Paradise Valley Burger Company. I honestly thought that 2 Hippies was still there (even though PVBC has been there since June or so). We went at 7pm on a Saturday and were the only ones there but from what I understand, they do a pretty brisk lunch business. 

When he hasn't eaten somewhere, my husband always asks the employees what he should order. The guy behind the counter said without a doubt -- the Brulee Burger. Being a boring burger gal, I got a plain cheeseburger. We also got the sweet potato tots, chips and he got a milkshake.

The burgers were excellent. The buns were fluffy and so delicious! The brulee burger was so flavorful. and at $6.50, the prices were very reasonable. We both were very pleasantly surprised. Truthfully, from the location, we weren't expecting the level of food we got. You could take the same food and serve it in Old Town Scottsdale for twice the price! 

We are certainly going to go back and try more of their menu. I'm looking forward to the french toast fries and I think that the Country Fried burger is next for my husband.

The only negative would be the physical space. It is sparse and a bit kitchey. I feel there is a disconnect between the space and the food.
