I love PVBC.... Best burger in-town is easily the Brulee.

I was so hesitant when it came to ordering this. It sounds odd and scary, but it is mouth-gasmic.

They layer the burger so beautifully and hats off to making not only a mouth watering burger, but an appealing mouth watering burger.

The brulee activated all my tastebuds (except the sour and bitter). I had the sweet, the salty/savory, a smokey flavor from bacon, a delicious fried egg bursting all over the burger patty, Sweet onions...and wait..yes the SWEET SWEET and CRUNCHY brulee'd bun...

So i thought that was soo delicious then i spotted it...spiracha sauce...yes...I then decided to add this flavor to my burger...so imagine all that i mentioned before then a kick of hot spiciness. Low and behold i thought i knew what a mouth-gasm was before this time, but i truly mouth-gasm'ed from this burger. 

My favorite burger place in town..YES it is true. PVBC has become that for me.

I've tried their other burgers since that fateful day, they are equally delicious, but not the mouth-gasmic powers of the brulee. I even tried the brulee with chicken breast...it was delicious and totally a different beast with that...but nothing compares to the orginal brulee burger...
