My first time going was Saturday morning. We got there before lunch which was the best time since we quickly realized the seating is limited and boy this place gets freaking packed. It's good food and people are willing to wait for it. If you do come during lunch maybe get it to go in case ya can't find a seat. Or sit on the side walk and enjoy the damn thing already.
I ordered the special Margarita burger with avocado, pomegranate seeds and a delicious deep fried jalapeno. Heck yeah it was delicious.
I saw this place on tv and I was not disappointed. Local, hole in the wall, great food, people are nice.
One tip for customers do not complain about not getting a seat, figure something out and enjoy the food.
