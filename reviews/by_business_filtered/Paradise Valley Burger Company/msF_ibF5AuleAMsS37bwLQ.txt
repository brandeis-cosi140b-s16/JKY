Best burger I have ever had!  We have lots of burgers in Portland, but nothing even compares to the Brulee burger I had at your place. Luckily for me I dropped my daughter off for college there so I will be back. 
I also ordered the sweet potato tots that were really good. Tender and slightly sweet!  You had a special that looked amazing and most of all creative. That's what sets you apart. Very creative!!
