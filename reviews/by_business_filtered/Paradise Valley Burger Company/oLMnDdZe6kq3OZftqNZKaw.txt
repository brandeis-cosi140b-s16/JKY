I just realized I had another fantastic burger here today and have never taken the time to review them on Yelp. This place has got fantastic food, friendly staff and a nice atmosphere. Nothing special about the interior but the quality and quantity of food more than makes up for the lack of things to look at while you're eating. I have not had anything here burger wise that I did not think was fantastic and the other sandwiches are excellent as well. For freshly made food they get your order in and the food out pretty quickly. No complaints about anything.
