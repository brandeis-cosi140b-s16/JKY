I saw this place on the Food Network and since my wife and I were nearby, heck yeah we were going to stop in. 
This place is no frills, simple menu. Burgers and a handful of other options. 
They are known for the Brulee Burger. The concept is interesting. 
The place was filthy though. 
Staff was nice and patient. 
Burgers were overhyped but a fun stop. 
Less than desirable area.
