Stopped by here for lunch today... I saw the Burger sign outside and thought I would try it out. WOW!! This place is amazing. The owner/chef was taking the orders and was super helpful and friendly. I had a Paradise CHZ which came with 2 patties, smoked mozzarella lettuce, tomato, caramelized onion as well as cucumber. I also ordered  Sweet Potato Tater Tots I was blown away! BEST BURGERS IN PHOENIX!  Our bill came to $18 for 2 cheese burgers, 2 sides and a soda. 
It was so amazing I went back for dinner. I bragged to much when I got home that my boyfriend just had to try it. I had the special which was a Roasted Duck Burger (2 beef patties, topped with roasted duck, caramelized onions, bacon, fried egg over easy served with duck au jus) By far the best burger of my life. My boyfriend got the Beach House (2 beef patties. roasted green chili, smoked mozzarella, pico de gallo and jalapeno ranch) He also ordered the seasoned fries. I don't care for fires and I think I could eat 3 orders they were so good. His was so good he ordered another burger. 
For Desert we shared a Maple Pecan Bacon Milkshake, also to die for. I really think I need one of these every night.
From the atmosphere, the music, the staff to the food every thing about PV Burgers was a hit.
This is a must go!
