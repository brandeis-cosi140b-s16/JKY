PV Burger is the best burger in town.  They are true burger innovators.  I have tried all the burgers on the menu.  My favorite is the Country style burger.  I like to add an egg to mine.  Soooo good.  I get their home made chips with every burger I order.  The seasoning is something special.
  
The true greatness of PV Burger is not on the regular menu.  It is the weekly special.  Like some kind of creative master mind or maybe evil genius.  The chief (yes I said chef, this is no regular cook in the kitchen)  makes a completely unique burger every week.  You never know what he will come up with next.  This is no bacon and BBQ burger.  This is beer battered hamburger patties or roasted duck maybe  fried mozzarella.  They are just incredible.

But that is not all.  They have taco's and sandwiches.  I really like the sloppy Joe's.  They are a bit spicy and perfect for waking up your taste buds.  They also have a monthly milkshake.  Oh and don't forget to get the French Toast Fries.
