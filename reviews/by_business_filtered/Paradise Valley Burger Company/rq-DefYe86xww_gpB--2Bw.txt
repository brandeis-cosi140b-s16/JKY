I love a really good grilled burger and PV Burger Co. did not disappoint! I am in love with this place and will continue to go back for my "fix"! I wasn't a huge fan of what they put on the burgers, (Thousand Island dressing, pickled onions, just to name a few) but I was able to have them add/take off whatever I wanted. Another plus, they have harvarti cheese, cheddar and smoked swiss (nice options for cheese). The french fries were real good too. And everything is nice and hot, fresh off the grill. I recommend this place to everbody and can't wait to take my mother. She too has been looking for a good burger joint. For the PV Chz burger I ordered (that came with fries) and the diet coke it came up to about $8. Worth every penny!  Now, if only they would deliver!!
