Small burger restaurant with no frills but good food.

Was previously a two hippies place that just did not take off.

Shared the Brulee Burger,  homemade chips and french toast fries. All were excellent,  the Brulee Burger comes on a brioche bun with bacon and eggs along with pink onions and burnt sugar and havarti. Great taste of all mixed together. Not a giant burger but good enough in size, quality not quantity. 

The pleasant surprise was the french toast fries with syrup. Fried Egg Bread looks like a fresh cut fries but are perfectly cooked.

The homemade chips are also very good and only $1.

Great price for your meal and quality food.

Located on 40th Street and Bell Road, if I worked at PV Hospital or attended PV High School I would be there way too much.

Will certainly come back and bring the rest of the family.
