I thought I reviewed this places eons ago and just realized I hadn't, so here goes.  This review is much deserved and long overdue.  I've been here about 10 times in the past year or so.  The owners are both there all the time and very cool.  They care about their customers and putting out a great tasting burger.  I always opt for the Paradise Bacon burger and it's never been anything but great.  The fries are also very good.
