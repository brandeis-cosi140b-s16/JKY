Staff was friendly.

My burger was horrible. I was excited for this for two weeks. My burger was the country fried. I checked the patties twice (which i upgraded to a triple) and I'm certain they were not fried. The gravy they put on the side was so light tasting it was waste of time to put on the burger. 

I got a fry and chip. Both covered in two much seasoning. 

My wife's burger was underdone and very greasy. The fried onions were a bit old oil tasting. The burger being underdone ruined it for her and me. They get so busy that there's no way to return food with mistakes. 

I had a seat where I could see the kitchen. I know its not a requirement for restaurants to use gloves in AZ but it was gross to see the staff touch their clothes which were not clean every time they put something on a tray. The bare food fondling ruined it for me also. 

Bottom line its not a good burger. The best thing was the sweet potato tots. Everything else was gross. Not to mention when it was all said and done it was 25$.
