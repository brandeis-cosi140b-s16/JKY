I am just going to echo what everyone else have said about this place. I love Guy and diners drive in and dives and I am in Phoenix for vacation and wanted to try something local and came across this place. I was not disappointed. 

Everyone was saying to get the brûlée and even the cash register told me so I had to try it out with the sweet potato tots. It was such a good burger one of the best burgers I have had. The flavor was amazing. Definitely recommend it to people if they ask.
