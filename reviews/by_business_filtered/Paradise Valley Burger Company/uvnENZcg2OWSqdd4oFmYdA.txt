I loved this little hole in the wall strip mall restaurant.  The place was so unappealing and coming from LA, the strip mall vibe just turns me off.  But I came here because the menu looked so unique.  And it was!!!  I was so impressed by the options and taste level.  

I ordered:

grilled cheese with Havarti on whole wheat. - you can never go wrong with Havarti and at 6 dollars I was in heaven. 

The Cali burger - was very juicy and the flavor a were good.  The burger was a little too over done, I like my meat to still be mooing, this was brown all the way through. 

French toast fries - one of the best things I've ever had. Take the best part of French toast and make a side dish out of it. Perfect. 

Lucky charms shake. -  I thought I'd hate it, but one of the best shakes I've ever eaten.
