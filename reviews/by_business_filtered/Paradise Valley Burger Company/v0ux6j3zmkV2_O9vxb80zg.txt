Preggo cravings called for a burger and fries tonight! Hubby allowed me to pick a new place (he's not a fan of branching out...) and this place had so many great reviews... MEH. It was OK. The guy at the counter seemed nice and helpful...at first. As we sat there and watched others come in, he looked like he was bored and counting down the minutes til they could close up. He and the 2 other guys I saw there seemed like the typical fraternity Bros...ready to start their cinco de mayo festivities instead of interacting with customers. We both had the burger with bacon and cheese. It was good...at first...then super salty. Fries were ok. Just not really impressed at all. Guess I should've stuck with my FIVE GUYS.
