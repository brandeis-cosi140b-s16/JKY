Are you kidding?? There should be six stars for the food! 
I ordered to go and good thing I did. It was 1.30pm and no tables available. That speaks volumes.
I had the veggie sandwich best described as shredded veggies with BBQ sauce. Awesome! And the sweet potato tots Great!
I highly recommend Paradise Valley Burger!!
