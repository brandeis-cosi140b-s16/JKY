There is a reason why this little hole in the wall restaurant has 5 stars on yelp.  The food is ridiculous!!   Best burger I have ever had in my life.  The fries were perfectly cooked.  The gentleman who took out order was very pleasant.  It was a little warm inside the shop but I think it is because of the kitchen being so close?  
This is my new favorite place!
