Great burgers and great service.  Really small restaurant where you order at the front and they bring it out. Decent selection of canned sodas and bottled water in the cooler next to the register. Food came out quickly and was hot. The only thing to be aware of is they have no healthy options. The burgers themselves probably have more cheese, grease etc. compared to most others.
