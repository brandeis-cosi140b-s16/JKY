I've been to this place several times since they opened. I was excited to try it for the first time because I love a good burger! Inside it's a small take out type of place with several seats.   

They have a rather eclectic menu - it's not just burgers. They have sandwhiches, tacos, and salads as well. The key to this place is creativity. Each item has a tasty spin on it. In fact they have a Facebook page that they regularly post specials on and each special seems a challenge to top the previous special as most unique. 

This visit I did a simple grilled cheese which always hits the spot along with another special, the pretzel fries. Those were really good but don't get too excited as it may not be available if you stop in. My son got the bistro burger and fries. Looked amazing.

Here is why I give it 4 and not 5 stars though: I would give them them a 5 for creativity alone but I feel the bang for your buck isn't there. I would go more often but I feel it's a little too pricey for what you get. Portions are rather small. For example, the special this week...which don't get me wrong sounds impressive, is $8.50 just for the burger. Sides are seperate. My son ordered a milkshake which comes in one size and with a $5 price tag. Pricey! So for us we come here every once in a while when we need something different and are willing to pay for it...and aren't ravenous.
