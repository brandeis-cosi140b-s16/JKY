The food is good, some of the drinks are a little "non-authentic" but all of that is fine. The real problem was he ONE waitress they had for the entire place. It's a Friday night, the place is 80-85% full and although she's doing her best to cover it all, one more server would really come in handy to avoid the long wait times.
