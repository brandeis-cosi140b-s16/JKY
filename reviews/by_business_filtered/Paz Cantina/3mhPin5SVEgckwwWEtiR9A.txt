Posted on behalf of my husband: "This review *would* be an amazing 5 stars. I used to frequent this location, and as a matter of fact I came and had the tacos earlier this week. So honestly I give the food service 5 stars. The staff is USUALLY professional, nice, and they serve great food." 

"The only reason why this place gets 1 star from me tonight is because Yelp does not let reviewers give zero stars."

"The outside bartender was over-the-top rude. I'm not talking about Mike who came over from Sochu House (who is great), I'm talking about the bald A-hole working with Mike tonight. Is was ridiculous.  I know they were busy, but when does asking a bartender for a drink turn into a crazy, unreasonable inconvenience? It was a BAR. Where you get, you know, DRINKS. Paz, please do your great reputation a favor and can that clown. Thanks."
