My first impression of the place was positive.  I thought the ambience of the place was cool and my server was definitely friendly and attentive throughout the meal.

As far as the food, it was just ok.  I had two tacos-the chicken tinga taco was tasty but also very spicy.  There was nothing wrong with it- I personally don't like tacos that spicy but I know some people do.  

The carnitas taco was a bit bland to me and too chewy.  It needed a more tasty and creamy sauce to complement the meat.  The  chips and salsa were good but not great.

I will probably return to try some of their other tacos.
