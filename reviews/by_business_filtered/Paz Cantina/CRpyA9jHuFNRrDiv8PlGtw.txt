Oh my! Being Hispanic, I hold these types of restaurants to a higher standard and this restaurant surpassed all other taco venders in the valley! From the perfectly spiced salsa and homemade chips to the fish and tasty carne asada tacos, it was simply amazing! We also tried the corn which we asked to be taken off of the husk and served as a side, was mouth watering at the very least. This has to be my new favorite restaurant. Simple menu but packed with fabulous choices. Great job Michael!
