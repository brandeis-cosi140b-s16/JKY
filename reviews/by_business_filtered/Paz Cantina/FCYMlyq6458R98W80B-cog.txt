Came here for the ambience, which had actually attracted me from a different restaurant/bar on Roosevelt Row. Looked over, saw a new spot (opened last week I think?), and noticed the ambience. Everything urban, artsy, upbeat. Outside games, comfortable (posh but wholesome?) synergy inside. Place felt amazing when we came in!! 

Ordered drinks, expecting the average, but they nailed it here as well! Craft cocktails, my Margarita Popper, amazing! Fresh squeezed lemon and limes (they said in every cocktail!!?) And there's a $3 house Margarita, all the time, that's made this way as well, pretty bomb! 

Ok, so the food is where I'm lost for words of wonderfulness! Craft cocktails with great atmosphere can standard for us in AZ, but Paz's food takes it to another level.!.!!!!! Ordered taco sampler...blown away! Pork belly was over the top delicious, calamari taco was an absolute stand out, and apparently they have a new carne asado which blew my mind.

I'm back! Pretty sweet for one place to nail drinks, ambience, and authentic high end street tacos!!!! And everything, in my opinion, was underpriced. Thanks Paz for the new Go-to.!!!!! 
~love peace and taco grease ((stolen btw, but love it!!)
