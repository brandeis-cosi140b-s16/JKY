Had dinner here for the second time in a week. First experience was great because the server was great. Something changed last night, a Thursday night. First, the music was blaring and inside patrons and the staff could not communicate with one another. I suspect the same thing was happening with the front and back of the house. I ordered a kale and quinoa salad and pork belly tacos. When I say ordered I  mean screamed directly into the ear of my server. In a reasonable amount of time a runner brought my tacos. I thought it strange to bring the tacos before the salad, but whatever, I was hungry. Good so far and tacos down. They were good. A half hour later still no salad and no server to be found. Ten minutes later my server walked through the room, spotted my salad in the service window, looked at me, looked at my salad, looked at me, picked it up and set it down in front of me mumbling something about "sorry nobody brought this to you." I pushed the salad aside and told her I was ready for my check. She brought the check straight away, and yep, salad was on the check. So basically I paid seventeen bucks for two pork belly tacos. 

Way to go PAZ, you got my $17 bucks last night, but they are the last of my dollars that you will see. A bit of advice. One, turn the music down, it's a restaurant not a night club. Two, servers belong in the front 100% of the time, not in the back ignoring their tables.

I'll be interested to see who opens this place next when you're gone.
