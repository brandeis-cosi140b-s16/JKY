I'm friends with the chefs so I have to say my opinion is biased.

That being said it warms my Nopalista heart to see the many people I don't know, in the short time this restaurant has been open, saying such great things about the nopales (cactus) taco!

They're doing our local veggie (plus a lot of other things) proud!

I just KNEW this venue would flourish with the right business! Kudos!
