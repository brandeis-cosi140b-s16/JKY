I can't think of a single negative thing about this place.  The food, the drinks, the service, the ambiance - all perfect in the coolest way.  We started with a frozen mango margarita with a spicy syrup on top.  It was a beautiful color,  and the sweet mango mingled beautifully with the heat of the syrup.  The chips were served warm and came with a fresh salsa.  The guacamole was piled high in the bowl and was chunky and fresh with a generous amount of cilantro.  I had a veggie burrito, which had a variety of roasted vegetables and spanish rice.  I loved that I could taste a slight char on the vegetables.  My lunch companion had a trio of tacos, which included barbacoa and a shrimp taco that had marinated onions on top.  I'm not sure what the third taco was because I was too busy falling in love with my burrito.  Our servers were friendly and one of them showed us the colorful local artwork that adorned the walls, as well as the art studio where local artists bring their artwork, play ping pong, and hang out in this unique and delicious Phoenix cantina.  Paz Cantina was recommended to us by a bellman at the Sheridan in downtown Phoenix.  We asked if he could suggest a place for Mexican food that wasn't touristy.  Mission accomplished.  Whether you live in Phoenix, or just passing through, check Paz out.  Really.  Do it.
