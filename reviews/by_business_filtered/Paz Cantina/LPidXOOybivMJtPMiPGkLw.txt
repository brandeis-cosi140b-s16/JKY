DO NOT order the fish tacos. 
We waited 2.5 hours to sit down and get our food. 

We sat down and ordered our drinks. 
Waited another 20 minutes. Drinks never came. 
I tracked down the waiter to order food. 

We ordered our meal for 7 people. 
The table of 15 next to us was fully fed and drinks served- even though they sat after us. 

The food came out An HOUR and a HALF later. 
Two orders were under cooked. 

They comped %50 of the meal for the shit Service. 
I will never come back. 
DONT order the fish tacos.
