looking for a cool and casual spot to relax with friends, grab a taco or five, and drink yummy and affordable margaritas? PAZ is where it's at on roosevelt row. 

great laid back vibe, so don't be in a rush... but when you're talking $3 house margaritas, who's in a hurry?

make sure to try the delicious carne asada tacos, ya know, if you're into good eats and such.
