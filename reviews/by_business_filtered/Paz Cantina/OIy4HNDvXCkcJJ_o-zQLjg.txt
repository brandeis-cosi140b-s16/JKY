Very expensive, especially for what you get.  $5 for a street taco?  You mean the ones that are $1 everywhere in this state and are all delicious?

They use canned ingredients instead of fresh produce.  So their $5 taco is worse than a $1 taco.  Congrats on making sub par Mexican food in Arizona and charging a premium for it.

Looking around, I understand.  Hipsters and rich people.  If that's you, this place is for you.  Personally, I'm a guy that will drop $6 for a craft beer because I'm fat and gluttony.  But I'm not dropping $8 for a domestic and $5 for a taco.  The place is very open though, so you can get a lot of "look at me" points while making it rain.

They don't have parking.  But you wouldn't know that, because there is a lot.  You can get fined heavily for parking there with no warning.  Beware.
