I didn't know what to expect from this little place, and made the mistake of ordering a dish -- chilaquiles -- that I thought I knew. Paz made it differently than I was used to, and I was disappointed. On the positive side, when I told our server that I didn't think the food had any taste, one of the chefs came out to talk to us. Michael was very sweet and we discussed just how variable "Mexican" food can be, in that every region makes their stuff differently. We got to talking and he told us about his favorite item, the pork belly. It sounded so good: slow roasted for 15 hours using Filipino style seasoning. He brought us a generous sample out to try, and it was WONDERFUL!

I will definitely go back for the pork.

Other positives: the menu is limited because they want everything to be as fresh as possible. You could definitely tats that in the salsa, which was fresh and bursting with green chili goodness.

My beloved got a breakfast burrito that was tasty.

I'll be back, and you should try it out.
