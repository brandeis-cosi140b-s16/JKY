OK. Here's the deal. This place is absolutely amazing!  Everything about it.  Between the four of us in our party we had:  Carne Asada tacos, carne Asada Tortas, flautas, fish tacos, guacamole and the house margaritas. Everything was crazy good!  Everything is made fresh. Chips came out hot!  They make a fresh batch every 10 minutes. Salsa was ridiculous!  And to top it all off, our server, Noelle, was as good as it gets. Friendly, informative, and all over it. Portions are small and inexpensive. But consider it al a carte and order plenty to share.  You can't go wrong.  The owners cook everything themselves with pride. Enjoy!!
