My girl was dancing in her seat while savoring the depth of the pork belly taco. I leaned back enjoying the carne asada taco that was infused with flavors rather than the flavors coming from a sauce on top. This place takes Mexican favorites to an upper eschelon.  It was a pleasure speaking with the chef and hearing his passion and heart in the menu.
