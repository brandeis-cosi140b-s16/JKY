Was part of a private event here last week, and it was great! It took a little while to get the event area set up, and it seemed as though they were a bit disorganized, but once everything was settled this was a great place. $3 margaritas were good and cheap, and they set up a taco bar for us with rice and beans, which was very delicious. There was also a live band playing and the whole place has a very chill vibe, which is nice compared to some restaurant/bars in Tempe and Scottsdale. I would definitely go back to try their normal menu.
