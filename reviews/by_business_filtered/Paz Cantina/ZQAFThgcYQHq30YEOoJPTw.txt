Well the owner just won me over. My wife and I had an incident there a few months ago with a unruly bartender who gave me a hard time because I "asked for a drink".  So She posted a one star rating and so did I. 
MICHAEL just emailed me and let me know that the situation was handled, and he (bartender dude) did not represent the spirit of the business.  So business owners,  Even if your food rocks, your abeyance is perfect and you serve your food on platinum forks, without good people your place is worth ****. 
With that said, I'll be back at PAZ very soon. Great tacos, Tasty affordable Margaritas!
