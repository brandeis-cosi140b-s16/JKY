Offered the UFC fight said open at 5pm and first come first serve.  We got here before 5pm with a party of 8.  All the tables were reserved.  We were directed to a section of the restaurant that was not even open yet.  Once it opened we were informed that it also was reserved.  Get organized people.  We took our expensive drinking habits elsewhere.
