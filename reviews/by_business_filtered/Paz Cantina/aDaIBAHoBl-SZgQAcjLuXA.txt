Got to the hotel after a long flight from the east coast, and stumbled upon Paz Cantina.  The pork belly tacos were excellent.  I also was able to chat with the owner, Michael, and he was very welcoming, and explained the history of that dish and its Filipino roots. Great spot for local Phoenix cuisine.
