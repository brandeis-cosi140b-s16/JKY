The TORTA and the Hare
This is a story about Paz Cantina's torta, which is unTORTAbelievable. Just like the story, slow and steady wins the race. This night started off like any other. I was craving Mexican food because, well, reasons, and I wanted to try out the new place on Roosevelt Row. Off I went. As soon as I got there, I was sat and given some delish chips and salsa. Ordered a drink, but it took a bit to get it. It's ok, I've got chips and salsa, I'm very content. I placed my order for the carnita torta and prepared myself mentally. I'm not a torta expert and, I'll be honest, pretty new to Mexican food because I just moved here from Maine. There was a little delay in relaying my food, but I waited patiently. When it came, I was happy and anxious and maybe low on blood sugar. It was time. I took my first bite and fell in love. This was it, my dreams had come true. Seriously the best thing I had since I moved here. Anyways, that concludes my short story that I am writing while sitting in the restaurant. TL;DR Paz Cantina = GOOD
