Came here last weekend with my girlfriend and will not be coming back. I have never experienced such piss poor service in a restaurant. As we enter, I walk up to the hostess and ask if we can grab a table for 2.

Hostess: There is a wait right now
Me: Okay no problem. How long will the wait be?
Hostess: Sigh...I'm not sure. You will just have to wait
Me: Okay....

Right, because it is totally unreasonable to ask for an estimated wait time... Anyways, we are eventually seated and I thought to myself "Okay, that hostess was pretty terrible but maybe our server will be good"

NOPE!

It took 20 minutes just to take our drink order. Our server wasn't attentive at all. Every time we asked for a refill, our server would roll her eyes at us. It seriously felt like we were inconveniencing her. And then in the corner of my eye, I see our server talking to another worker and pointing at us. It was clear they were saying something negative about us and it made us feel very uncomfortable and confused.

As far as the food goes...it was just okay. We ordered some tacos and they were pretty bland. I've had bad service in restaurants before but this was the first time I legitimately left pissed off.

I award you 1 star Paz Cantina and may God have mercy on your soul.
