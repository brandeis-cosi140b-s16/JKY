Wow what an great cantina! My first time here and I will be returning for sure! I love the chill atmosphere here! They have some awesome art work and I just got great vibes from the whole place! I'm amazed they weren't busier its that great! The food was delicious (shrimp taco, calamari taco which I forget what it's called, and flautas) they also make the quacamole to order yummmmmmm ! The staff was friendly and make you feel welcome! Also I had a sangria which to b honest I could do better it was just eh! But the second drink was soooooo good! So it made the sangria better! My overall experience was just overall great! I'm going home with a full stomach and happy to spend my money here!
