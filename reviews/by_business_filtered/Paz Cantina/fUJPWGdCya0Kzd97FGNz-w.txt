Stopped in for some food and drink with friends tonight and Paz was awesome.. Stand outs were the Pork Belly Tacos (omg, yum) and a drink called 'Dangerous Liason.' Service was fantastic and everyone was SO friendly.. Patio is dog friendly, prices are really reasonable and it's going on our short list of spots to hang out at in downtown Phoenix.. Great evening, guys - Thanks so much!!!
