This place was recommended to us so we checked it out.  The salsas are good (not spicy though).  After an entire one hour wait for 3 tacos and French toast, we were more than disappointed.  The frustrating part is the service is horrific.  If you like good prompt service don't even stop.  It took 20 minutes to get our drink order.  I had high expectations and want to support local but we won't be back.  Too bad Phoenix needs a good taco place!  We will eventually run into one.  They need to hire staff and get some servers to run the food and perhaps even more people in the kitchen.  The food was seriously a D- as there was no flavor at all except in the salsas.  Definitely if you don't want breakfast or lunch to turn into 3-4 hours PASS.  The steak taco was made of steak but it was chopped up like it looked like it belonged in a dog food can!
