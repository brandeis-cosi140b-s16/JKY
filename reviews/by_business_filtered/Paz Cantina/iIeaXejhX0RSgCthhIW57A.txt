First Friday grand opening perhaps not the best idea. Surely for those of us who live downtown can relate that all restaurants even the longer opened ones can have bad service. The service was great regardless of the kaos. The environment was great and I felt relaxed even on a 1st Friday restaurant madness. The tacos were good too they are small but perhaps with a larger menu it won't take too many.
