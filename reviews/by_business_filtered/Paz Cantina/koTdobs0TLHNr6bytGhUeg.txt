I had a $3.50 steak taco and it was terrific! 
Equally I have had the chicken taco and it was also fantastic. 
Excellent patio with a nice view of Roosevelt Row with a great mix of fun tropical music. 
Seriously, chips and salsa and a $3.50 taco, how can you beat that!?!?
I love it. 

Side Note: at the beginning they did have an issue with the chips not being crisp, that issue has since been resolved.
