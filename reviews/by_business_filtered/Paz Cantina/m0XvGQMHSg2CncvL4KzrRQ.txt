I would have to say this was the best meal I've eaten in at least the last year. The chips and salsa were above average. Negra Modelo on tap and the most incredible torta I've ever had. It was the Che Torta, just like a Cubano sandwich but made with a torta instead of a roll. The roasted pork was super tender and the ham grilled to perfection. I was in Phoenix on business, but I will most definately go there every time I go to Phoenix from now on. Just plain awesome.
