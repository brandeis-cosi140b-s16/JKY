I went on a Friday night with high expectations after reading some of the Yelp reviews. When we arrived we had to wait 10-15min for a table (not a long wait) and the staff kept apologizing for the long wait time, which I thought was nice. We sat down and the waitress looked like she was in a huge rush to take our orders so we ordered the house marg and some guacamole. I was excited that the marg was only $3 but came to figure it was probably due to the undetectable amount of alcohol content... Overall the waitress was rude,didn't give us napkins after asking twice, and then food was meh. Would not be eager to return.
