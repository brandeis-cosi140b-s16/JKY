as a guy that eats out on business travel 4 nights/ week, it is rare for me to hit the same place twice unless it is worthy.. this place is worthy!.    on taco tuesday every taco is a buck off and the margaritas are just two bucks.. i was in for 3 tacos and 2 margs and out for less then  $15.

i then returned night two and the owner recognized me (thanks Mike) and he recommended the calamari taco and tinga taco.  

This place will now become my tuesday go to and has diverted me from my hamburger quest that is usually my tuesday. p.s it is just a 10 minute walk from downtown hotels
