Sadly, I will not be adding Paz to the list of restaurants that I frequent. We were on our way to Phoenix Theater to see a play. Decided to stop at Paz for dinner prior to the show. Luckily, we gave ourselves plenty of time. 

The service was down right horrible. The hostess sat us at our table and we were basically ignored for 15 minutes. After that, it took another 15 minutes to get the drinks we ordered. So, 30 minutes into this affair and we had managed to get some cocktails.

I would comment on the quality of the food or post photos of it, but sadly after almost 90 minutes mine had not arrived. Lucky me, it did arrive just as we were leaving. I took it to go and lovingly placed it in the trash can at home.

The owner was kind enough to comp out meal (or at the parts of it we got). 

Without question, there are better places to find Mexican fare in Phoenix. I suggest you try them.

N*Joy...
