Finally! A fusion of my dream street tacos! The ambiance is casual and the staff def make you feel at home. I came twice, once on first Friday with the Fayuca concert and again to watch Thursday night football. This is a great place for everyone, depending on the night and the occasion it caters to every palate. First off-the Pork Belly! It is PHENOMENAL, by far one of the best pork belly dishes I've ever had. The Fish taco is also up there in taste. The calamari and shrimp were good but were nothing out of this world. Then the drinks.... I had the Margarita Popper, which is the margarita with jalapeños, sounds insane but the sweetness, tartness, mixed with citrus and jalapeño heat was Amazing! If you aren't into spicy drinks, the margarita bramble was sweet and on point. Make sure you ask for Vanessa as the drinks were perfectly made. On first Friday they also had a special on house margaritas for like $3 bucks! Make sure to stop by and order the margarita popper and the pork belly tacos!
