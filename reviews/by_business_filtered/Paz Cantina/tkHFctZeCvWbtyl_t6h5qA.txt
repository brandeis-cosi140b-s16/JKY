First off, everybody should know there's lots of free parking available just north of the restaurant, off of 3rd Street.  There are both paved and unpaved lots.  So, do not be deterred by the dismal parking situation on and around Roosevelt St.  Venture forth and try Paz Catina.  For dinner, for brunch, for drinks and light bites...you won't regret it!

I've been to Paz 4 times now, and on my 2nd visit I was greeted like a regular, with high-fives from the host.  I've had tacos and margaritas for dinner, and chilaquiles and bloody Mary for brunch.  I had no complaints with anything I was served.  I have tried the pork belly, carnitas, and shrimp tacos, and all are delicious and unique.  The pork belly is hands-down my favorite.

On my 3rd visit, I asked my server about the street corn, which had been recently added to the menu.  He went back to the kitchen to get the answer, then returned and told me they didn't have it ready yet.  No big deal; I ordered tacos!  As I finished my meal, the owner slid a gorgeous ear of street corn, dressed to the nines, in front of me.  It was FANTASTIC!  We had a brief conversation about his approach to the menu (quality, in a nutshell).  

The ambiance is, as others have mentioned, wonderful.  Very urban, with interesting art and interesting people.  There's a family-size table for large groups, and a room off to the side that, I assume, could accommodate a private gathering.  There's an inviting, dog-friendly patio.  I love the open kitchen, and actually saw a staff person photographing a plate on the counter before it went out to a table!  The music is good, and the TV is unobtrusive.  I am a huge fan of this place, and can't wait to go back and try the dulce de leche french toast!!!
