Decent beers on tap, excellent craft cocktails all of which are very fresh and original. The staff is attentive and knowledgeable. The tacos are great! Amazing fresh tortillas and nice spicy salsa. I would have to say the cactus was a good surprise, I've never eaten it before and it was tasty but the calamari taco is my favorite so far. The vibe and art are really chill and cool, definitely my new spot downtown.
