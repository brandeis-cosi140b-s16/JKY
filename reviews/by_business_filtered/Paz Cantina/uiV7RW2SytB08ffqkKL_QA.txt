Really nice place with a cool vibe. The outdoor seating was great for warm Spring day in the Valley. They provide a lot of space for cyclists. I ordered the guacamole and the "Tinga Torta" along with the strawberry lemonade. The pulled marinated chicken on my torta was very flavorful. The guacamole was very fresh...made to order. Their complimentary chips and salsa was also very good. Next time, I'll pass on their lemonade...it didn't have much strawberry flavor and wasn't sweet. My waitress quickly gave me a Sprite instead.
