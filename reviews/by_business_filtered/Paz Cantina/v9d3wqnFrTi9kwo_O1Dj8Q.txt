Great downtown location with plenty of outdoor seating and Live music. I started with chips
And salsa and a Margarita. The Salsa was perfect blend of spice that tingled your tongue just right. The Margarita was decent.  For the main course I ordered three tacos. The fish, Pork and Carnitas. All were perfection. The service was friendly and fast. Walked out under 20 bucks.
