Decor and atmosphere was pretty cool. Love the concept. We tried few items: nachos (good, would repeat); streets tacos (unimpressed); kale Salad (great potential, except for the dressing). We went on a week day around 5. Not too busy, about 1/2 full. Waitress was friendly and polite. Gentlemen who brought out the food, surly, and unhelpful. The music way too loud, made it so hard to talk. Overall wanted to like the place,  Would like to try again when the weather is cooler and we can sit outside, perhaps it would be more enjoyable. By the time we left we had headache from trying to communicate over the loud music.  Will give another try. But definitely not a "relaxing" environment.
