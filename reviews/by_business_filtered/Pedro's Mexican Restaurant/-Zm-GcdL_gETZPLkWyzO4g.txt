The service was good, the tacos (beef) were great, the meat had great flavor,  the food came fast, pace was pretty full but we didn't wait to seat ourselves at 1pn on a Friday.  The chips and salsa were good too as were the enchiladas.  The rice and beans ok to average. Would come back if in the area, but for a long dRive like this,  mAybe not make a special trip. ..overall was a nice impression for a first visit.  A small old school house style Mexican restaurant.
