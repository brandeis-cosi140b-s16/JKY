Pedro's - went there 27 years ago, and still continue to go there - the big thing for us is the consistency of the food.  It is good, and filling, and when I order my Chile Relleno dinner, it is exactly like it was 27 years ago.

I always order a beer - it is always ice cold - my husband gets iced-tea, and they always bring out a small pitcher for refills.

Good chips and salsa, and make sure you ask for the chunky one (pico de gallo), as it is a bit hotter (spicier) than the others.  

You can always count on Pedro's - it is a comfortable place, we like the blankets hanging in between booths, and that they just focus on good food and good service.
