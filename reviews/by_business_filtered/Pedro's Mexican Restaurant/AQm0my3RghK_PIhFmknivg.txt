Great Food, Great Prices  I live in east mesa and drive here at least 2 times a month  it is about 45 miles one way.   The Nachos are expensive but are worth every cent.  If you ask they will bring you their HOT salsa  it is excellent.   Other than Meguiels in San Diego, It is definitely my favorite Mexican restaurant.  6 hours is just to far to go for my Mexican fix.  Do your self a favor and try this place out.  But be prepared  sometime there is a wait it is a pretty small place inside.  Top notch service also.
