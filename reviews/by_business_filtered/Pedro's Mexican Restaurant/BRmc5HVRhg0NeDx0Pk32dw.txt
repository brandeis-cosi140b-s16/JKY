I was going to take my Mom to Pedro's today...Closed on Sundays:(
I have been to La Perla down the street before..Not my first choice but...we ended up there...WORST FOOD AND WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!  I will never make the same mistake...Pedros...You guy's are awesome and really take care of your customers...Thank you
