I've been coming here for years. They have good food, and really good salsa. I love their chimichanges (for years I've evaluated mexican food restaurants by their chimis). The place is clean and well maintaineed, and the staff very courteous. This place is very popular, and can be busy, but I've always been able to get a table, and they are fast with the food.
