This place was pretty good. I would not say it was authentic Mexican, it seemed to cater to American tastes (like olives in the dishes). I felt like I was visiting my family in Michigan and having Mexican there. I still enjoyed it, but its just a different flavor. The service was great, very friendly.

Now the food- I had the shrimp tacos. They were tasty, but I wish the fillings stayed in the tortila better. The shrimp had a nice flavor. My baby ate all the beans and rice, so she was happy. My husband had shredded beef tacos. He thought they were good, but the beans and rice were average. The chips and salsa were tasty, I just wish the "hot salsa" was hotter. The price was good- we even had a groupon which made it better. I would go again since it is close to hubbys work or if I had another groupon.
