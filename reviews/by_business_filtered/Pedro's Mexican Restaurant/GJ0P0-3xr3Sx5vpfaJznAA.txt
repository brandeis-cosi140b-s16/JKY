I grew up on the west side of town and Pedro's has been a favorite for over 20 years. The food is consistently good, always hot and they are fast regardless of how busy they are. The chips and salsa are crave worthy as well as the San Marcos sauce. I almost hate to review Pedro's because I don't want others to know, but considering its been around for about 60 years, if you don't know- I'm ok with that.
