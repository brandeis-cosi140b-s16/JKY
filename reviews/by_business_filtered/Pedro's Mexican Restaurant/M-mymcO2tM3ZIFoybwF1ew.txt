I prefer the shredded beef way over the chicken, let me say. Theyre tacos, taco salads, and beans are just so good. The taco salad is ginormous, definitely a share item. Its loaded with beans, meat, cheese, guacamole, sour cream, and lettuce. I absolutely love it. Their salsa is quite good, especially with their fresh chips. The servers here all assist with every table, so you will never wait long for anything. There is always someone coming by checking on you and giving you what you need, which is not common. It's a little dark and very dated in here, but the food is good and decently priced for the large portions.
