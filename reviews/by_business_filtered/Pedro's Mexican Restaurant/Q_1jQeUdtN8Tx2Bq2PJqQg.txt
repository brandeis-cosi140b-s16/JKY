I have been eating at Pedro's since I was just a little girl, well over 30 years now, we would go at least once a week with the whole family...kids got to sit at a table alone!! Only because the adults couldn't stand us when we were all together!! ;)

The food is great! I have never had a bad meal there! The establishment has always been very small, so if you are planning on eating there with a large party, I suggest you call ahead and make reservations!! The prices are reasonable and service is quick.  You can also just call in your order and get it to go if you are not interested in dealing with the small environment and being elbow to elbow.  They do get busy on Fridays and Saturdays.  I would love to see them do some updating inside, it is very dated and dark.

The food is always consistent in looks and taste.  I always order iced tea and they bring a glass already filled and a little pitcher of iced tea as well!!  The chips and salsa are very good, one of my favorite salsas out there!! A must try!
