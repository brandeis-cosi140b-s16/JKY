We used to go to Pedro's all the time when we lived in Phoenix. About 18 years ago we moved to Tucson. We always try to eat here when we are in town. Unfortunately It had been about 3 years since we'd been back. On Friday my husband suggested we drive the 2 hours up, have dinner at Pedro's, and spend the night. Even after 3 years the service and food was amazing!!! We love the San Marco's sauce. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great meal.
