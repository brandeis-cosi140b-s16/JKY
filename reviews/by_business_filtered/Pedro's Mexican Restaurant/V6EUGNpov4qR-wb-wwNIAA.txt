Went here for lunch.  Kind of cramped.  Not a good place to take young kids.  My beer mug was dirty, and I never notice things like that.  Service was slow and not the friendliest.    

No music was playing.  I felt that people were too quiet because they felt everyone was listening to them, and there was that one loud jackass that talks too much in the restaurant annoying everyone.  

Play some Mexican music Pedro's.

Food was average Mexican food- I tried tacos, enchiladas, beans, rice.  

Prices were very reasonable.

Maybe it was a bad day for them.  I'd be willing to give it another try if hungry for Mexican food and in the area.
