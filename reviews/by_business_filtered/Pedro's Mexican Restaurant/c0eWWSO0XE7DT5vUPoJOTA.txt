If you want a great BIG plate of nachos piled high with meat/chicken, beans, real cheese, guacamole, sour cream and jalepenos...Pedros is the place.  The price may seem steep for the mini-nacho, but it easily feeds my family of 3.  It is a mountain of good food served in a fun environment.  Try it for yourself.
