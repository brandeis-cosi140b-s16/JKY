Excellent business model - prompt, polite service from the moment you sit down.  Straightforward menu.  HOT chips are on the table quickly with chunky mild salsa & hot sauce.  Entrees at lunch time come out in a flash.  Check is on table so I can pay at the door and be on my way.  I loved their process here, and the food was fairly good too.  Old school Mexican food, atmosphere, etc.
