My family has been going to this restaurant for years.  I wouldn't classify it as traditional Mexican food, but the food and service is always good and the chips and salsa are excellent!  I tend to order the San Marcos Burrito which is like a chimichanga cover in a spicy cream sauce. The tamales are also very good, they have the standard red and sweet green corn versions, plus a unique Vegi one that has broccoli, carrots, and other things you wouldn't normally expect in tamales.  The also offer a "Mini Menu" that will save on the wallet, but is still plenty of food and have lunch specials (which are actually served till closing on Mondays)
