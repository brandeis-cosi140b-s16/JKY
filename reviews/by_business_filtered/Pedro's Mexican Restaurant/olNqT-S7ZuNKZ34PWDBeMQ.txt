Stopped in for lunch just after 11 today.  The parking was already almost full even though there were plenty of empty tables inside.  The sign, that I didn't see for a couple of minutes, said to seat myself so I picked a table.  Just by myself I would have like a two top but all of the seating arrangements seemed to be 4-6.  The restaurant never filled up so I didn't feel bad for taking a space away.  

I got a two item lunch special ($7.25) of a beef taco and a cheese enchilada with beans (I could have had rice rather than beans).  I also got a root beer ($2.05).  Most of their drinks have an extra charge for refills but this was not a small glass and was plenty.  Right after I seated myself a bowl of warm chips, a small mixing bowl, a carafe of mild salsa and a bottle of hot sauce were on the table.  It was neat being able to adjust the heat of my salsa.  The shredded beef was very tasty and the shell was thin and crisp without being hard to bit through.  I would suggest eating the tacos quickly before the shell gets soggy. The enchilada and the beans were ok.  The sauce was a bit different than some other places.

The service was quick and attentive.  You can tell they are used to getting the lunch crowd in and out in a reasonable amount of time.

They have a couple of other weekday lunch specials as well as some smaller appetite options of  their regular menu items that can be ordered anytime.
