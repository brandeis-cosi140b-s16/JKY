My girlfriend and I ate here last night. We used a Groupon for $20 worth of food for $10. The food was good and even though they were crazy busy they were still very friendly and attentive. You have to put your name on the list when you walk in, literally- you have to write your name on their list that's kept on a clip board by the register. The only snag was that we were waiting outside and when they called our name inside first someone else took our table. We went in to check to see how much longer it was going to be and saw our name had been crossed off. When we brought this to the attention of the hostess she apologized and made it right by seating us immediately. We will definitely be going back.
