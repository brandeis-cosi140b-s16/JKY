Pedro's may look like a hole in the wall that you should drive by and just keep going, but it isn't. They have the best salsa of any place I've ever been. Try my secret concoction of hot chunky, mild chunky, and hot sauce!  I have been coming here for about 20 years and always get nachos (with extra cheese in the middle) and beef tacos or green corn tamales. Everything looks good that I have seen, but I always stick with my favorites. The restaurant is clean, the staff is nice, and the food is the best Mexican food in the valley.
