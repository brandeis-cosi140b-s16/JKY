Finally found a great Mexican food restaurant in the west valley! Being a California transplant I didn't realize finding good Mexican food would be so impossible. But this place nailed it! Amazing fresh thin crispy chips. Two salsas to dip. Ordered the three shredded beef taco plate and my husband ordered the shredded beef chimichanga. Rice was fluffy and fresh. Beans were great. We will definitely be back.
