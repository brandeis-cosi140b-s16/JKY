I live in CA now, but every time I'm back in AZ I eat at Pedro's. And I am usually there with my family within the hour of touching down from the plane or drive. We have all been going there for about 20 years. 

It is the absolute BEST Mexican Food. While other places in CA here are good too, I haven't been able to find one comparable to Pedro's. There's just a different, Sonoran taste to theirs that I can't find out here. 

Gotta get the Pedro's Special and  a Chimichanga! And the staff is wonderful and friendly.

GO TO PEDRO'S! 

(the only gripe I have is that they are closed on Sunday)
