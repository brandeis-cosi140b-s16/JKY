Finally I found REAL tacos in Vegas. I moved from San Francisco and was spoiled with having real authentic Mexican food and couldnt find anything in Vegas but Robertos...
But not anymore! I always get three carne asada tacos, a pineapple drink and a scoop of their carrots and onions on the side to nibble on.
