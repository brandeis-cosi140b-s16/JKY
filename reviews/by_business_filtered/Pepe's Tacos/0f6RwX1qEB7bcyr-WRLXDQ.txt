Best taqueria in las vegas, hands down. True to  Las Vegas, it's open 24 hours, bomb al pastor off the rotisserie right behind the counter.

If you are like some people on yelp, and you see a rotisserie of al pastor in front of you, but instead order carne asada french fries, enchiladas and nachos, you should probably be at roberto's with the rest of the people leaving the club at 3AM who aren't getting laid.

Their tortas, tacos, burritos are great. Meat-wise, the carne asada, pollo, carnitas, lengua are all average. The al pastor is the best outside of mexico.

Unlike california, where the health-code over-regulation makes it illegal to leave meat out unrefridgerated.........here in vegas they can do it just like the lebanese immigrants to mexico did when they invented al pastor. it's right in front of you on a spit with a pineapple on top dripping juices down marinating it while it cooks

so i dont want to hear any more how much better the taqueria's are in california.  i'm from there. only food trucks are open past 2:30AM

and one more thing, how can people complain about this place being dirty, and the next review complains because someone was cleaning the place......... retarded.

so..... five stars for having all of the above.
there are better tacos, but not open 24 hours, with friendly staff, real al- pastor, and the red sauce here is actually hot.
