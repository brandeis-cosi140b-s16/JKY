Decent tacos - especially the al pastor, but overall not a fan of this pepe's. I remember the other charleston location being worth the drive across town, but this new one kind of sucks. Super nachos were crap compared to what I've become used to from similar places like Roberto's. This was a little bit of chips w velveeta and chopped up chicken, not fall apart tender chicken tinga like you usually get. 

Getting drinks near the general area of the bathroom reeks of sewage. Positives are good horchata and really great refried beans. That's about it - I'll stick to my tried and true Roberto's
