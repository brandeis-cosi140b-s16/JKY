So it usually bothers me when someone puts they have the best fill in the blank in town.. However, Pepe's Taco can do it. They have my seal of approval. In their establishment they have a sign that reads best carne asada nachos in town. They aren't wrong. They have great food for a great price. I came here for some late night ratchetness and brought along a friend to fatten him up. First thing I notice when I walk in is all the seating. Usually places only have a couple seat for you to wait or a couple tables on the side for people dining in. This location had seats on either side and some cool benches. On Yelp it says they close at 2, but they are actually open 24 hours which I was thankful for. Who knew you could sit and talk in a taco shop for almost 2 hours. I of course had to be fat and order the nachos. My friend ordered some pork tacos. We sat down and waited for our food. I see them all the time and it makes me laugh but they have the posted signs for no refills or there will be an additional charge. I think we refilled our drink like 5 times and nothing was said.. I know they are trying to watch their costs and whatnot but it's like cents per cup. They also have a jukebox that randomly plays music and stares the pee out of you. After getting my food I hit the salsa bar and grab green salsa, my favorite, and some limes. I know it was late but everything seemed kind of empty. I think grabbed the last limes.. oh well. They i opened my box and went in on my nachos. They had everything a little separated which I liked. All in all I had a fun time being ratchet at 1 in the morning.
