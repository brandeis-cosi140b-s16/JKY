Over a quality is good. Never had an issue or complaint because of the taste. Its always fresh and juicy. I'm a huge fan of the asada fries and get them all the time but with al pastor meat (pork) way batter in my opinion. Recently their a sad a fries keep going up and up. Use to come here when there were under 6, last time I went they were over 8. Same quantity and quality, must supply and demand change in meat. 
Their always quite fast on the speed aspect, although I come really late most of the time. In and out in about 10-15 minutes. Burritos and great, not super greasy as other places, even though that's where the flavor is at lol. Always consistent cool and flavors which is a plus. Would keep coming here till I see them as ad a fries linger around 10 a box which might be eminent.
