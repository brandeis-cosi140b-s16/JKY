Came here late night, a local friend of mine suggested it. He's mexican, so he should know what's good! 

Carne Asada Burrito: Got it with the typical beans, rice, onions, cilantro.. However, the meat here was pretty darn good! Definitely better than half the places I've tried here in Vegas. They also got the lime, red, green hot sauces at the usual, salsa/condiment bar. A little squeeze of citrus and some heat always does a burrito good!

Carnitas Taco: Great flavor, not explosive but did the job.

Lemonade: They had this on tap/fountain drinks. So light and refreshing, haven't seen this drink option at any other mexican joints..

I'd come back, if I'm ever around the neighborhood
