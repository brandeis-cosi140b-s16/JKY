First time ever eating here. The inside of the restaurant is pretty similar to Roberto's. Wasn't sure what to get but I realized the menu is like Tacos El Gordo. Now I've only been there twice so with the menu in front of me, I still was a bit unfamiliar with what most of the choices were so I got those little soft shell tacos instead. I had Carne Asada tacos, Carnitas tacos, and Al Pastor tacos; two of each but my coworker and I shared them. It tasted just like what I had eaten at Tacos El Gordo but here at Pepe's Tacos, it lacked sour cream, onions, etc. It was an extra charge for it but I think at Tacos El Gordo it comes on it.
