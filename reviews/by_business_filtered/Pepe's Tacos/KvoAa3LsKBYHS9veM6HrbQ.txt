Ok, it's getting 2 stars because they screwed up my order, even after explicitly telling them what I wanted (it was a simple request - NO ONIONS) 
That's the quickest way for a place to drop in ratings for me...

Aside from that, the food was, uh, ok. I got the carne asada burrito, which was mostly grisly chunks of beef with some rice and beans.

As I stated, I'm a no onion eating mofo, and as luck would have it, the jalapeno/carrots/onions mix was, you guessed it, 99% onions. No thanks. Picky you say? Why yes i am.

Other than that, it was a good place to cool off from the sun
