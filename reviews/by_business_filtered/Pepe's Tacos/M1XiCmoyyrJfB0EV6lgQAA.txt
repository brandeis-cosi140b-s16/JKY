I make the trip from Henderson to the Decatur location as well. It's worth the drive if you want a good meal. I love the beef tortas. They come with sour cream, lettuce, tomato and I top it off with the salsa verde from the condiment bar. 
The Chili rellenos are yummy as well. The burritos are huge! 
The best part of this joint to me is that it does offer a selection that hasn't been adapted to the American view of how Mexican food should be. Also this is a far south flavor of Ecuador more than that of Mexico. 

The tables are picnic style and the benches wiggle around and most of the signs are in Spanish. So if like me you are limited to asking for a couple beers in Spanish be prepared to enjoy a meal of immersion.  The juke box pours out lively music, I love this place!

It's not uptown, but it's damn good!
