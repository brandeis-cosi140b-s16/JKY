So today 7-16-15 my boss brought us all lunch from here. 

The first thing that impressed me was hot hot everyone's food was.  Usually when you get takeout and you get it home it's all cold and soggy but everything was still piping hot. 

I got the double cheeseburger with fries and a medium drink ($5.99). 

I gotta tell ya...their fries are bomb.  They are the thick-cut kind and they fry them up real crispy and then toss them in salt and seasoning.  Absolutely wonderful.  

The burger was actually pretty good, too.  It had two patties, lettuce, "special sauce" (like thousand island), cheese, and tomato.  It was hot and gooey and really great.  I know what you're thinking...why the heck did you get a burger at a mexican place?? Well, I am la guera. 

Minus one star cuz' both of my co-workers ordered chicken burritos and one of them was given chicken and the other got carne asada.  She couldn't eat it and would have went hungry if it weren't for my other co-worker who very kindly switched with her.
