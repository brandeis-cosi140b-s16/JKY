Consider me a huge fan of this local joint that reminds me so much of Oregon's Muchas Gracias.  The food is cheap, the service was great, and  being that its open for 24 hours it makes for a good meal outside of the casino cafes around the city.  This is one of two Pepe's Taco's and while it caters to a largely gringo clientele, I've seen plenty of latin customers during lunch time.

The most simple items such as the picaditas de chorizo, tacos dorados, and carnitas burrito are enough to make any Mexican food lover salivate.  Most items are within the $4-7 range and combinations usually don't exceed $10.  This particular location is not nearly as popular as the sister joint in downtown and the best one to avoid the crowds.
