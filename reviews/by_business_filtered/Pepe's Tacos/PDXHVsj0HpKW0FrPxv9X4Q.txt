If you've read Ryan G's Yelp! about this place, that about sums it up. I'd like to build on that. 

First of all, the food here is pretty good. I've had the burritos, tacos, asada fries, carne asada plate, and probably other things I don't recall. Most of the time, I end up there mid-week and get the "Taco Special": you get four tacos, a drink, some chips and beans for 6.50! It's a pretty good deal, and it fills me up pretty good. I also sometimes get the Super Burrito, which is pretty good, too. The food, overall, is good. (It's good, but not as good as Los Tacos or Tacos El Gordo)

The place is kinda rundown and isn't in the best part of town. There are definitely some characters there at times, but it's never a situation where I feel "Oh, crap, I'm gonna get beat up." The actual restaurant seems like it's slowly being upgraded (new LCD tv's), but that may just be a false impression. 

I've gone to Pepe's Tacos a billion times, mostly late at night, and it's usually got a number of people. Whether that's a testament to the food, value, or the fact that it's open 24 hours... I don't know... or probably all three.

Go to Pepe's, get some food, then let me know how you feel about it.
