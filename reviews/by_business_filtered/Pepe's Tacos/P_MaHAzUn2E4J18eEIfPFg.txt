I am definitely a fan of Pepe's Tacos, I come here quite often, It's fresh, delicious and cheap! what else is there to say....OH well there is one thing, I come to their newest location on the corner of Rainbow and Flamingo, it's clean, spacious and well lit. Except for one thing, they do not have a diaper changing station in their bathroom's and how many Hispanics do you really see with no kids?? Just saying..... Install one please! :-)
