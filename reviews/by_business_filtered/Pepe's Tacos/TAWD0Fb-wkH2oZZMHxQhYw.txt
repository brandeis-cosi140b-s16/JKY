Nasty! Nasty! Nasty! I hate giving bad reviews but this place had roaches! I wish I could give them a zero. I order a burger, my burger was burned, my chips were stale and roaches were running around the floor.  Made me sick to my stomach. The food was disgusting. I told the cashier named Esmeralda and she was extremely rude. I'm calling the health department on them. I asked for the manager and Esmeralda would not even give me my money back or his number.
