Ok so I came here the night before Christmas.... I had a stomach ache after... I gave it three stars because I'm still not sure if it was because of the tacos or because I had too much to drink the night before. 

The food was ok. I might go back. But the thing I didn't like was that I asked for a side of cheese and they charged me $1.99... Crooks!!!!!


The tacos I ordered were a $1.79 and a side of cheese was $1.99!!!!!????? Anyhow, I know what not to order. Along with the chicken tacos I ordered a crane asada burrito that was pretty good. Not too spicy. It was perfect! That I would order again.

My little cousins ordered the fries and they topped them off with spice which actually tasted pretty good. 

The parking out front was good. The place had a lot of seating. 

Like I said I may go back buy ask them to "hold the cheese".
