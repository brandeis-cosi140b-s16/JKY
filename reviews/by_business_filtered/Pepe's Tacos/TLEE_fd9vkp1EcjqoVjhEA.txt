The service here is terrible! The ladies at the front are rude and act like 5 chips (literally 5 chips) is going to cost a fortune and come out of their pay checks if you ask for some. I ordered a taco plate and asked for some chips on the side. Not a side order but just 5 chips and she acted like it was huge thing. 5 chips which probably will cost the restaurant less than 1 penny will now lose me a customer. I wish I knew the ladies name. She was wearing purple polo, is fairly skinny and was working on 5/7/15 at 12:30p

Horrible service. And food was average. I'm never coming back here again because of this cheap woman! Food was aight!
