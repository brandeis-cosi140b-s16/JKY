Mexican food is one of my prime food groups, so I'm a tough nut to crack when it comes to it. Pepe's Tacos would be considered a mallet on my scale of mexican restaurants. 

I ordered a Super Burrito. The carne asada scent alone is mouth watering. Very interesting and vast menu options. You could order anything from menudo to a simple quite delicious cheese burger. Pepe's truly is an excellent choice to pick for a midnight snack
