I know been while since reviewed this Pepe Tacos but it reminded me why same chain places one place can vary from another one. I gone too the newer location closer too the house on rainbow. I felt after going too my old stomping grounds so too speak the newest location some things not done as well. The refried beans much more depth flavor then other location. The refried beans cooked out more or sure not see as many whole beans random. Felt like the portion size is slightly larger then the newer location. The tacos always go with my favorite lengua felt like have better flavor at this location. Still newer one being closer too the house not stop me because fan of Pepe Tacos!
