My mistake for checking this place out before checking their Yelp rating. I had it bookmarked when they first opened and never thought to check back to see their reviews. We came here today for lunch and was hoping to make Pepe's a new regular spot on our food rotation in the area. 

I ordered the carne asada gordita and it was ok but the gordita was really doughy and not as crisp as I would have liked. My fella got the huevos rancheros and they didn't look too appealing. We also tried a taco al pastor just to check it out and it was dry and not flavorful at all. Definitely a lackluster experience and I don't think I'll be back. 

The salsa bar wasn't great and most of the food didn't look or taste as fresh as you hope for. This was a disappointing dining experience compared to so many other options.
