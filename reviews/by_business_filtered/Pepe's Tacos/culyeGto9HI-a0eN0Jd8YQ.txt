Been passing this place up for a very long time and finally we decided to give it a try. I'm from Los angles so I'm really big on Mexican food and things like asada fries. I ended up getting a regular chicken burrito
With no cilantro and no onions. It was pretty good.  Next time I want to see what their asada fries are looking like !
