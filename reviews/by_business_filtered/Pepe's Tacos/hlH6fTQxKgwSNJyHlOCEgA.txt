After my poor experience at the Rainbow location, it made me appreciate the N. Decatur location that much more. Yes I have complaints about the Decatur location, but it has nothing to do with the actual restaurant. The neighborhood is scary and the customers that come out after dark are even scarier. I've been there at 2am when a fight broke out between intoxicated customers that were waiting on their food. Not a pleasant environment at all. But hey, comes with the territory. The food however is amazing. I always order the carne asada burrito and cheese enchilada. I'm not sure what makes that meat so seasoned but I've never had a bad batch. The enchilada sauce is wonderful, just perfect...I always wanted a location closer to where I live, but now I know that only N. Decatur knows how to get it right. I will continue to travel to the other side of the world (during the daytime) to get the best Mexican food in Vegas. This is a true hole in the wall spot that doesn't disappoint!
