Seriously some of the best tacos you will find in vegas. I personally always get the carne asada tacos and lengua. The carne asada is never dry tasting like other places so flavorful & delicious!  The lengua so tender and the flavor is wow! If you eat there they will give you beans and chips the beans are no bland at all. I've been coming for 5 years and I will continue to. Oh yeah the red salsa is so good!!!!
