This place is disgusting. No offense but I don't think Las Vegas knows the difference between what good tacos taste like even if it hit them in the face. Come to Los Angeles and go to King Taco. They'll show you how it's done and what a legit "street taco" should taste like.

I ordered 2 carne asada tacos and both of them had fat all over the meat. A proper carne asada taco should have nothing but tender juicy meat that is EDIBLE. I had to spit out half the meat that were in my tacos. Perhaps I caught them on a bad night but it is not likely I will be returning to this place. "Best Tacos in Las Vegas 2010" my a**. Whoever was a food critic for this place should be fired.

Honestly, Tacos Mexico (they have multiple locations in this city; ie. Tropicana or the street close by Stratosphere Hotel) is wayy better than this place. With Tacos Mexico, I've been here 10+ times and all 10+ times everything was satisfying.

The only reason why I gave them 2 stars instead of 1 was because of the carne asada fries. They put nacho cheese all over the fries...a good addition in my opinion.
