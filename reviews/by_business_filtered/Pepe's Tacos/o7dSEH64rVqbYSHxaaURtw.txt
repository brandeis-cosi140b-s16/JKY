Horrible taco place.  Do not eat here.  We ordered pastor and asada tacos, asada fries and some chicken taquitos.

The pastor was flavorless, just tasted like pork.  The asada was also flavorless and had a lot of gristle in it, it was actually hard to eat.  Which made the asada fries suck.  The fries had cheese sauce instead of shredded cheese.  I like a combination of both.  Chicken taquitos were the best part of the meal and that's not saying much.  How can u screw up a taquito, it's just stuffed and fried. 

Will never be back and I will steer people away.
