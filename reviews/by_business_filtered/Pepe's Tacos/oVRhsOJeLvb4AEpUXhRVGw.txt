Meh, was craving Mexican food after being out in Vegas for more than a month.  Growing up in Texas, and now living in California, I have pretty high standards when it comes to good Mexican food.

Menu items of note:

Machaca plate - the shredded beef was just OK, pretty plain tasting

Chips and Salsa - a rip-off, chips were a bit stale, and of course they don't mention that the 'salsa' that they give you is the same stuff that is free at the bar.  Didn't even have pico de gallo to give me instead.

Service:
Hard to gauge, cause I went there at 6:30 in the morning and was the only customer.

Reasons why I come here:
Needed a Mexican food fix, but instead left unsatisfied.  Found out a week later that Ricardo's was near me and is a much better option.
