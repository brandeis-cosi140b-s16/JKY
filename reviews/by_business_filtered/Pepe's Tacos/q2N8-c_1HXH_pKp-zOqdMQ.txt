The owner of this place  should  pay more attention  to  their customers. The bad customer service  his employees  are giving to his clients.  His staff  are  rude, specially  cashiers.   I don't  agree  the charge implemented for us customers  for paying with  ATM  or credit card, we get charged  a dolar!   The quality  of  their products  have been   deteriorating.  The food  doesn't  taste  the same.  The place  it's  durty, and the restroom  doesn't  even  work  some  times.  When  they serve  the wrong  order, instead  of fixing  the problem,  they make get the customer upset, and they argue with  them.  It's  very hard to park there.  Not enough  space  available.
