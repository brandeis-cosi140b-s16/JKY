This has been hands down my favorite taco place for years. I usually get carne asada tacos but since they have chorizo tacos, I usually get two of those and one carne asada taco and it is just perfect. I will got across town to get this since basically I am.

The horchata is always good, and never feels to watery or unflavored like some other taco places. Beans are always fresh and never tastes processed, and the salsas are delicious. The carne asada nachos are also worth trying. Never had a bad meal here and always well worth the reasonable price.
