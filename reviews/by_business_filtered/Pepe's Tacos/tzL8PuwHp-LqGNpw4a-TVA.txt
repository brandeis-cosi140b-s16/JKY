I remember when this was originally "Miller's Steakhouse". That place was no good but, Pepe's took over years ago and it seems to have stuck. Being a fan of Pepe's in Cali I was always hesitant about trying this place. I didn't know if it was the same or completely different. With only one way to find out I headed on my way. 

The parking lot was packed. I was lucky to nab the last spot. It was busy inside. I placed my order and waited maybe 8-10 minutes for my food. I saw others waiting too so I knew it might be a minute and they were cooking it fresh. I ordered the "Carne Asada Burrito" and the "Cheese Quesadilla". The tortillas are yummy. The burrito was good in size and tasted decent but wasn't spectacular. The real winner was the quesadilla. It was cheeeeeesy! 

I noticed a sign inside that said they only accepted cash however the cashier asked me if I wanted to pay with cash or debit. 

Pepe's is open 24 hours.
