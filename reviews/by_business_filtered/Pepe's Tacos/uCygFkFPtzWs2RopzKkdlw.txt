Don't waste your money here. The food is average, and there's a Roberto's right across the street, so go to them. This place has forgotten my Jarritos soda three times when I order to go, and when I go back to get it, they give me the hardest time for a freaking $2 soda. The orders have been incomplete a couple of times also. Their customer skills are almost nonexistent.
