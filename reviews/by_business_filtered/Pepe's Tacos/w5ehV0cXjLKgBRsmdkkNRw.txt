Not sure why all the low ratings. I thought the beef tacos were almost as good as El Taurinos on Hoover in LA. Almost! Although on the pricier side. Plus I had to wait 10 minutes to get 6 tacos to go. But as long as food is good, I'm ok with it. My new favorite toco place in town. Another restaurant reminding me of LA.
