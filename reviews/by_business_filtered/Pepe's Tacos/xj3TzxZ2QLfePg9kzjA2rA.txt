You haven't had carne asada fries until you've tried here. I will never go back to Roberto's ever since I've had the ones they serve here. They hold their title of best carne asada fries in Las Vegas.

Anyways, moving on with the review.. This location is open 24 hours. The perfect place to sober up after a long night of drinking. The dining area is pretty spacious and resembles Roberto's. They're pretty quick on prepping your food so don't fret if you want food in your system asap.

I can't really judge much off the other items on their menu since I literally get carne asada fries each and every time. Trust me, you will too once you've had it.
