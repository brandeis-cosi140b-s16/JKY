Heads up that the asada fries here are like crack- horrible for you but oh so good in the moment. They use liquid nacho cheese sauce rather than shredded. Not everyone appreciates this, but I actually prefer it for this dish. The asada is flavorful and despite other reviews, it didn't seem any greasier than asada I've had elsewhere.

The tacos are fine: lengua, cabeza, and asada with cilantro and onions are all hot and fresh. Corn tortillas aren't too thick or too thin, didn't have much flavor either but didn't fall apart which is  most important.

Not sure why there are so many negative reviews- location is in the parking lot of a mexican market, maybe clientele are more discerning? Has been clean with friendly staff whenever I've gone.
