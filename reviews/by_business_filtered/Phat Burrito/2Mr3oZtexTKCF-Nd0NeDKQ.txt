Eight years ago I frequented Phat Burrito. The last time I was there, my daughter was 6 years old. She is now 14 and about to turn 15. We were in NC visiting her great-grandmother who is now passed and her Aunt Jennifer was with us. Jennifer now lives in Dubai. We sat outside on the patio at Phat and took pictures, but I never took a picture of the sign. One of those pictures sits in my daughters room, so I often reminiscence about your burritos. 

Much has changed in that time and we have made many more trips to Charlotte were I have tried to figure out what burrito place that was.

I didn't travel to Charlotte for a year then and lost sight of Phat. I didn't use yelp then; it took me til today to figure it out again. I won't forget this time. You were a strong memory to me and I have driven all over town on various trips to figure out where you were. My daughter said she wanted a burrito so yelp helped me find you today. 

She had the Phat Steak Burrito and I had the Veggie. Huge. Delicious. And we took half away with us. The queso and beer were and added bonus and my daughter is rocking the shirt she bought! 

Sooooo glad we found you again. I have not had a burrito quite like this since way back in the day off a food truck in Athens, OH.

Keep rockin' it. The store looks great and quite bigger! 

Five stars to me.
