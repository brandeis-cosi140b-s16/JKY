I can see what's awesome about Phat Burrito. Burritos come in seven varieties and look like an awesome alternative to the commandeering Chipotle. The location is also pretty sweet: a yellowy concrete block with a nice patio that's right off of the Lynx. It'd be nice on sunny Saturdays (which Charlotte has been having a burrito-sized amount of). With all of this, I was pretty excited to try out this joint.

When I went, the inside just didn't seem very welcoming. There was a little bit of natural daylight, but without a whole lot of other lighting. Add some metal fixtures and low ceilings, and the place didn't feel "phunky," it felt "phfeeling-less."

As far as the massive (7"x3") burritos. Ever notice how burrito fillings seem to be compartmentalized, where one bite is just a glob of sour cream, where the next is beans, and the next is a bit of guacamole with a spare bean? This is not the case at PB, where the fillings are incorporated well. The sour cream is the base, not a section of the burrito, which I thought was great. The flavor itself is all right: a bean-rich San Fran-style burrito, but not something I'd pack my bags for. Add that chips aren't included (did John Locke include "free chips" in his list of basic human rights?), making for a satisfactory experience, but not one for repeats.

While I'm curious if it's any different a night-time, I'm not sure if I'd go back to find out. It wasn't a bad time, just an A-OK time.
