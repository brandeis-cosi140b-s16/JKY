I went here with a small group for a birthday lunch. I usually just walk to eat but this a little too long for a lunch time walk from downtown. I am glad we got there at 11:30 or we would not have been able to sit together. 
The food was pretty good (better than Cabo fish taco, don't shoot me). I had a bean burrito that was about 3 lbs (half is in the work fridge) and super delicious! The others at the table got BBQ steak and BBQ chicken quesadillas, they also enjoyed their lunch. 
The food was made fresh to order, subway style. It was definitely good enough to throw it into my lunch rotation, when I am willing to drive.
