I really wanted to like this place b/c I heard so much about it- and I gave it 3 go arounds....but I just get can't. The burritos are ok and I would have agree with the other reviewer on the amount of rice I received during all 3 visits. And given the prices, just the salsa bar won't be bringing me back. I'd have to say that I like Moe's Southwestern better, and you get chips. Place and location are cool, but that was about it for me.
