The best burrito place ever!!  I have been coming to Phat Burrito for the past 9 years religiously!  The BBQ chicken burrito and tacos are amazing, as well as the chips and queso.  Now that I live in Raleigh, there are times when I have heavy withdrawls.  So every time I am in Charlotte, there is no doubt I have to make a stop here, even if its to get it to-go with some extra to take home with me!  You will not be disappointed, the atmosphere is fantastic and so is the crew.
