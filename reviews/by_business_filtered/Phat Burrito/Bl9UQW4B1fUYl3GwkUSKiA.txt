I mean the folks there are pretty cool as well as the atmosphere. I ordered a steak burrito with all the trimmings and honestly it lacked flavor. I'm used to that Mexican flavor or some sort of seasoning. I had to add a little salt to it. So it was aight. Location is dope as I was people watching with all the peoples gallivanting around the food trucks.
