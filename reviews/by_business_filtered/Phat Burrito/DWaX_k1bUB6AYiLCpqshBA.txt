Great cheap spot to eat with huge portions. I am big dude and I couldn't put down all of my steak burrito. Service was fast and friendly and there is a pretty good variety of items to add to your burrito or whatever it is that you order. I prefer this spot much more than Moe's. Midday there may not be enough seating so be prepared to eat in your car.
