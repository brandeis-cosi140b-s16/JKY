My boyfriend says, "Phat Burrito is just a local Chipotle."

1. There is nothing wrong with that

2. It's better than that because,
 A. They have a salsa bar
 B. They also serve refried beans. I really like refried beans.
 C. Their salads come with a toasted tortilla, seriously the salads are great here
 D. They serve fish
 E. I'm sure other reasons too but this list should have sold you by now.
