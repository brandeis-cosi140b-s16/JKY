Since Phat Burrito isn't too far from campus I've been here a few times. I've tried the steak, chicken and fish burritos there. While I like the area that it's in on Camden and since I frequent BlackSheep a lot, I can't say that I love it. 

The location is really cool and it's not a bad hang out spot if you want to sit outside. It's actually preferable to sit outside, since it's either super crowded or just rather uncomfortable. 

The food wasn't bad. I'm not an especially picky person, but it's not something that I would be very openly recommend. I just wasn't blown away. It was also a bit pricey for what it was, in my opinion. For a little less you could get a comparable burrito at Chipotle or Moe's

I wouldn't rule out coming by again. My experiences weren't bad, but I do hope that it gets better.
