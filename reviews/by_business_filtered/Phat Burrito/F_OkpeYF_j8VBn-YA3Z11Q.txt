So I ordered a black bean veggie burrito, chips, and a drink and paid extra for a side of sour cream.  I was told sour cream was on the burrito.  It was not.  Service was slow, it was lunch, and the table I sat at had not be bused.  The burrito and ingredients and cheese tasted great, but there was a lack of any veggies except for a couple of table spoons of saut√©ed veggies.  When I am paying $11.00 for a burrito combo I expect more.  Am I paying extra for the hipster atmosphere here? I can get a much better burrito at any of the mexican restaurants around.  Parking sucks here.
