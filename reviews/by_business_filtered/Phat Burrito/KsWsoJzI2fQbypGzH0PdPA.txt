I do not live in the area so when I found myself getting my hair done right up the road, I was unsure where to go. One of the girls at the salon suggested Phat Burrito and being the burrito lover that I am, was really excited. I walked in and was not too impressed. The menu was poorly displayed and I really didn't like the fact that I couldn't see what came on each burrito. I ordered the fish burrito with tallapia. I got my burrito, which was huge and took a bite. I was starving so I was excited to eat something that I usually get a lot of satisfaction out of. I immediately tasted this disgusting sweet mango salsa. I was really confused because when the person who took my order went through the toppings, he never mentioned this concoction. I really do not like mangos and tried to open the burrito up and eat it with a fork, that didn't help. Overall, I was not satisfied with my $10 purchase. I was really disappointed and my lunch date who ordered a chicken burrito shared my sentiments. I might go back and try something else but probably not by choice.
