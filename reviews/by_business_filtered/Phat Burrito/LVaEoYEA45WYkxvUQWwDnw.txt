Phat Burrito is a cool place to go to right next to Common Market.  The staff is always very friendly and the decor is perfect for this establishment.  Unfortunately, I find their food mediocre.  There just isn't a seasoning or anything special.  The queso is pretty good and has a little heat to it which I like. If you are in a rush and just want an ok burrito this is your place.
