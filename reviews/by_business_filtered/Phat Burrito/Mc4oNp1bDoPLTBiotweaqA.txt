I work within walking distance, and those fish tacos call my name every day around lunch time.  My coworker's say the rest of the menu is awesome, too but I have always stuck to the fish tacos and burritos because they are so good.  One thing to note is that the indoor seating is limited so there is sort of an unspoken rule about not lingering too long after you finish your food if there is a crowd waiting to sit down.
