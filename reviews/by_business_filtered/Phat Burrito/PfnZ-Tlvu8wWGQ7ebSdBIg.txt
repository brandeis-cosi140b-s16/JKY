I've been going here for years and for all the people who say "don't let the outside scare you" - that's after a renovation, haha. it used to be MUCH scarier. The owner put in decent patio furniture, lights, music, flowers, and fresh paint. If you sit at just the right spot on the patio you have a great view of downtown and the wonderfully ugly pink building. The inside isn't much to look at but at least now they have central heat/air and not a window unit that leaks on you. And the art you see on the walls is up for grabs, normally.
As for the food - not authentic mexican - not meant to be. They're burritos, quesadillas, nachos, tacos.... and the most delicious salsa EVER! I don't like quesadillas but I like them here. But whenever I come back to town I get a chicken burrito, black beans, rice, hold the cheese, lettuce, tomatos, sour cream and guac.... lots of guac :-) I eat half there and visit with the staff (V & Kelly are AMAZING) and take the rest for the trip home. 
It's within walking distance of some other kewl shops and even Amos' so hit up Phat Burriito before going to a show or out for drinks! 
Oh! And the brownies they buy from local bakers are out of this world!
