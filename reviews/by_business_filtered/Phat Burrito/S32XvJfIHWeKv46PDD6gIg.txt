Very bohemian with awesome mexican food!!!  Burritos, tacos, whatever...it's definitely the best in town and worth the struggle for both a parking spot and a seat.  Their salsa bar is a huge win for me...love the tangy green chilli.  I've been a loyal follower for about six years now and can honestly say, this is the place is where I take anyone new or visiting Charlotte every time.
