Loved this place. Between the laid back people and atmosphere and the bomb-diggity fish burrito I had, this will definitely be my go to joint for any type of fish tacos/burritos. The mango salsa on top was awesome and the fish within my burrito was super fresh. There was a place in NoDa that was my go to fish taco place which I will not name but this place beats the heck out of them. It's been around in Charlotte for awhile and now I know why. Will definitely come back!  If you are in the South End area of Charlotte check it out yo! You won't be disappointed!
