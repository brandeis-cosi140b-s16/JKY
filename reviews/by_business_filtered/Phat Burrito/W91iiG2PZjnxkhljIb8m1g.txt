Cheap and cheerful, Phat Burrito's food is a really tasty example of California burritos. The giant burritos and quesadillas are worth a drive across town. The barbecue steak and chicken are stand-outs on the menu, but a simple bean burrito with red beans is just as satisfying. And the veggie burrito is full of squash and zucchini as well as the standard sauteed peppers and onions. Stop at the salsa bar, but skip the chips--they're obviously out of a bag (and not that good of one, either).
