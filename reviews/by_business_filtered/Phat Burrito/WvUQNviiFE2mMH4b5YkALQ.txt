Mehh... not the best, not even in the top 10. 

Phat Burrito?? It should be called Rice Burrito. I got the chicken and it was at least 75% rice - they totally skimped on the chicken and added hardly any veggies. 

I will give them props for having various salsas... but lets be honest, what mexican burrito place wouldn't??

*Best tip about this place: the atmosphere is cool.
