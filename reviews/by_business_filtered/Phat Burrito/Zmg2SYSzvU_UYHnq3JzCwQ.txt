Phat Burrito doesn't look like much from the outside, just a rundown, brightly colored cinder block building. But this place has some of the best burritos in Charlotte.

These burritos are not only massive, but filled with fresh ingredients you can't get at the franchise burrito joints. There are several options of burritos, but their menu isn't that extensive. Don't go here looking for a Mexican restaurant, go here only if you want burritos or quesadillas. From black to pinto, chicken to beef to fish, & several other options, Phat Burrito provides enough of an option for the whole group to enjoy the kind of burrito each person likes. The salsa bar also has some different options to top your burrito with, & you can try as many as you wish.

This place is pretty tiny, with not much room for indoor eating. When the weather is nice, the patio is a good option & is right next to the light rail. The lunch crowd is always huge & most people take their food as takeout, so expect to wait a good while to order, & wait for seating as well if you plan to stay. The parking lot can sometimes be a hassle as well.

Phat Burrito is so much better than your normal Qdoba, Chipotle, etc. types. Phat Burrito gives you a much better tasting burrito, without a high price, & will have you going back again & again to this unique little joint.
