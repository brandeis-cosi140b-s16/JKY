Cashier was very friendly. The food tasted fresh. I had the BBQ Steak burrito (great choice) The bbq chicken and steak was the same price so I chose the beef, of course! The burrito size was similar to a Chipotle burrito. Burrito a little dry, but they provide unlimited salsa...Worth every cent to me!
