Three words: BBQ Chicken burrito.  This bad boy is a monster packed with flavor.  I always rate my burrito experience as compared to Chipotle.  This is  the baseline to which everyone can understand.  Their prices are marginally higher than Chipotle, but their burritos are slightly bigger as well.  They had wheat tortillas which I think is a plus.  Their salsa bar had a bunch of different options, but it wasn't fully stocked.  It could have used a little service.  
 
I ordered a beer to keep me company, but I was turned off by the fact that it was served just colder than lukewarm.  That was disappointing.  I also noticed that their back half of the restaurant was closed for seating as one of the employees was cleaning up.  This forced me into sitting right by the front door, which would have been real frustrating had it been busier.  They have tacos, quesadillas, and vegetarian options as well.  Phat burrito was a welcome surprise when I took a stab in the dark at a local joint in Charlotte.
