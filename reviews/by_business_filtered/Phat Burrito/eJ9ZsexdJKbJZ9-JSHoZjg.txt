New to the neighborhood and asked everyone, "Where can I get a good taco salad around here".  Everyone replied that we should try out Phat Burrito.  We got to Phat Burrito around 2:00 and it looked like the rush was over.  We waited at the counter for over a minute before someone greeted us.  Once she did greet us, she was helpful in narrowing down from a burrito to a salad.  I LOVE taco salads so I was hoping that this would be the new place.  We got our taco salads to go, I tried steak and my boyfriend got chicken.  The chicken had no flavor and my steak was okay...just very chewy. Their pico-de-gallo was good as was their mild salsa.  My biggest complaint would be the meat and the taco-salad, even though it was a salad was ALL lettuce with a few pieces of meat and nasty cheese on it.

Sorry, Phat Burrito you won't be my favorite taco-salad place.
