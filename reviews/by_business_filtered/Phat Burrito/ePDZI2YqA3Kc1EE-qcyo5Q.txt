They have a salsa bar. EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE A SALSA BAR!

I took my roomie to lunch here Friday because she was kind enough to help me setup for a festival. She's the best. 

I ordered my usual: one veggie taco, one fish taco, chips and queso. I love the mango on the fish tacos. Roomie said wanna share queso? The answer is always no. I need my own. File this under fat girl review.

The roomie went with a burrito. She thought it was a little bland, so she loaded it up with salsas and hot sauce. Problem solved.

What else do you need to know? Phat Burrito is small and can get packed during lunchtime. I try to go after the lunch rush. Workers are super nice. Beer available. Tofu options on the menu.
