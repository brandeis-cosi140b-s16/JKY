Do not eat here!!! I've been up all night sick. 
The decor was cool, food was bland, the steak tasted like pot roast and the beans were sort of runny I normally am a mom and popper but in this case stick with chipotle or go to any authentic place down S.blvd. Didn't seem to clean 
I repeat up all night sick!!!!!! But enjoy if you are daring.
