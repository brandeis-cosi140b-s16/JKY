Phat burrito is a staple in SouthEnd. They have incredible hours! After drinking at local breweries, walk to Phat Burrito for the best queso in town and other late night sinful noshes. Early morning heading to work or awful hangover? Walk to Phat Burrito for the Ranchero burrito, with chorizo, and Enderly coffee. Whatever the reason or time of day, a visit to Phat Burrito is always the right choice.
