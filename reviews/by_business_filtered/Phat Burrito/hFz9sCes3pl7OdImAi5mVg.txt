I've loved Phat Burrito for a big, philling (see what I did there?!) lunch for years now. I typically get a chicken burrito with the fruity salsa they put in the fish burrito with chips and queso. That cheese is heaven and really black peppery. Love it. 
They offer quesadillas and beer too. Don't forget the salsa bar in the side area. 
This past weekend my husband and I wanted to grab a bite of breakfast outside with our pup. Phat Burrito it was. They are open for breakfast until 1030, at least on Saturday. They offer smaller versions of their burrito and they are filled with meat, potatoes, eggs, veggies, you name it. There are a few to choose from and we also shared the grits and cheese with chorizo on top. Man, the flavor a were right in. A but runny to eat with a fork but still yummy. 
It's a great, fast and satisfying meal. We didn't get hungry again until about 4 pm.
