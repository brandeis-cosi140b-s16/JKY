Hanging in Charlotte for the weekend and this was the first place we ate.  Well...ain't we lucky?!  We ordered a BBQ chicken burrito and a steak burrito.  Both were great.  Fun atmosphere and quirky hipster crowd.  We ate there on a warm spring night when the food trucks were across the way and had smiles all around.

Pre-conceived ideal burrito folk:  This place is not Chipotle.  Not worse or better...just a totally different meal and (especially) experience.  Enjoy a phatty burrito and spend your money locally.
