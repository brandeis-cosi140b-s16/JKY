I'll start of by saying that Phat Burrito's food is nothing to write home about.  I'm not saying that it's bad; I'm just saying that it's not exceptional. I'm always happy with the food and like to grab a couple fish tacos or a black bean quesadilla when I'm in the mood for one of those things.  So why do I give Phat 4 stars?  

I can't help but love this place.  I loved it when it was half the size and the area was a slight bit shadier than it is now.  I love the skater punks and the hemp hippies that work there.  Sometimes they miss an order and sometimes you have to wait while they make up for their mistake, but you just keep on loving it.  And while you're sitting and waiting for the missed order to be made you think "damn, I wish I didn't work for Wells Fargo and could get stoned and ride a skateboard to work."  And that's why Phat Burrito gets 4 stars.  They are what the rest of us wish we could be:  cool.
