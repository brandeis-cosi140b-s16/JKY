The food is about what you'd find at any burrito place. I didn't think the food was head and shoulders above Moe's or Chipotle. I'm going with 4 stars for a few reasons. First is that it's a local establishment, and I enjoy supporting those. The service was quick and friendly. The "Hot Mama" salsa is better than the regular hot sauce found at most. Lastly, on a warm day, I enjoyed sitting out on the patio with the Lynx gliding by and people watching in South End. That is more enjoyable than overlooking a strip mall parking lot at the chain burrito places. Overall, I recommend Phat Burrito and would go here more often if I didn't live so far from South End.
