A friend raved about this place on my last trip to Charlotte.  We stopped in for a late lunch on NYE. Now that the scene is set, onto the review...

I'm just going to say it... it's a hipster burrito restaurant. The food was fine. Nothing to call my mama about, nothing I wouldn't eat again, but just fine.  I've eaten at several of these burrito places lately and they're all just kinda the same to me as far as taste and quality.  Everything seemed fresh, the salsa was unique, the seating adequate.

If I lived in the area, I'd probably stop in on occasion. It's definitely better and healthier than the chains.
