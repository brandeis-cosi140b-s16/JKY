My son and I are huge fans of Phat Burrito! We would eat there twice a week probably if I was comfortable allowing us to eat out that often. We particularly love riding our bikes up on a nice day and enjoying our food on the patio. 

I typically order two black bean tacos with everything and my son orders both cheese quesadillas and steak quesadillas. My tacos are always so full that they really could have been made into three. I like to top them with the delicious tomatillo salsa and the hot salsa, which admittedly could be a little hotter. But, luckily they offer fresh (not pickled) jalapenos! 

I have seen that some other reviewers felt that they received poor or unfriendly service and I hate to see that. In my experience, the employees have always been extremely nice and helpful, it is one of the draws for us. Not to mention, they always get our food to us quickly! The prices are very reasonable and they are locally owned! 

And to top it all off, they grow some of the items on location, definitely the cabbage for the fish tacos and maybe other things (it was cold weather when I noticed.) Now that the weather is warming up, I can update this if I see that they grow other veggies.
