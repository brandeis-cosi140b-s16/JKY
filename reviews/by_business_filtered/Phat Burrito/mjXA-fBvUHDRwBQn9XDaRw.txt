Update!  I tried it again last night because I WANT it to work.  There have been some improvements:  the small claustrophobic space has expanded to include a new and improved seating area.  The chips still look like tostitos but they are no longer tri-colored and the guac (which I did not try) looked much better this time around.  The steak was still a bit dry but in a pinch I would go here again.

This is what goes for authentic Mexican around here?  Sorry, but coming from Chicago I've had my share of tacos, sometimes eating them three or four times a week.  Love 'em.  The burrito I got at Phat Burrito is the only reason there are three stars.  That and the staff seemed pretty nice.  However, no way are tri-colored tostitos real nacho chips.  And I've never had more watery guacamole.  Really not very good and definitely disappointing.  I may try this place again, but it's not at the top of my list.  I'd rather spend the extra $$ and get great tacos at Cantina.
