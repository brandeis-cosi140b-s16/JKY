Wow... I reviewed this place 5 years ago... But the great thing is that Phat Burrito still deserves its 5 stars (and some).  Now that I live, literally, next door to it, I could not be happier since I don't have a 30min drive to get my burrito fix.  But for those of you that don't live next door, it's worth a trip.

In southend, parking is becoming a rarity with all the apartment buildings shooting up everywhere, but Phat Burrito has its own little parking lot.  They made the most of the small lot and can fit about 8 cars depending on their sizes.  There is also street parking too.  The best thing is that you can also take the light rail!  It's located on the Bland Street Station stop so park at the park and ride and have a leisurely Lynx ride to burrito haven.

Once you walk in, your senses are inundated with quickly action figures in the window, the hard-working and welcoming staff, and the exciting smells of the food that is put out here.  Walk up to the counter and order from an array of choices: burritos, quesadillas, tortilla salads, and soft tacos.  Sides: beans, rice, spinach, chips, quest, guac, and sometimes they have soup.  Don't forget the salsa bar around the order counter!!!!

You really can't go wrong with any choice here.  They also wrap their burritos in a way that you can take the top half wrapper off and leave the bottom to help hold all the goodness in your hands.

Beers and soft drinks are here... And there is also a King of Pops cooler if you want to get something sweet after enjoying your meal.
