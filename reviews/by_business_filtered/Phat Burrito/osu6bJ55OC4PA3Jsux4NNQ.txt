I got excited the first time i saw this place when i moved to charlotte from wilmington, nc. i wanted to love it and thought it would be a good substitute since flaming amy's burrito barn was no longer right around the corner. I was a little disappointed. It wasn't a bad burrito, but it was a very basic burrito. Salsa was pretty good. i'll probably be back, but won't go out of my way to do so.
