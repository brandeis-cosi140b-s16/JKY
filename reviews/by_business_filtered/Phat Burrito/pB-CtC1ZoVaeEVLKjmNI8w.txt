The "tornado" (as I'm affectionately using to reference my 11 and 13 year old nieces) "hit" here first!  Today is my first time to eat here!

1:05 pm and there is still a lunch crowd!  Half are about ready to leave the other half ordering and waiting!  Staff is very friendly!  The guy taking my order made sure he knew, I knew what I wanted!  One Burrito, Steak and Cilantro!  He asked, and I confirmed: No beans, No rice, No guac, No cheese, nothing but Steak, cilantro wrapped in a Tortilla, wisely wrapped in foil!  Lil' Ricky and I drove all the Burrito Bars Crazy ordering like this "just Steak" - "OK what would you like" _ Next person "JUST Steak!"  He got it right, the kitchen got it right - It was very good!  I had a couple of bites of my nieces Chicken Burrito with everything, just so I could tell you... It was also good.  I did not get the spicey Steak (they may call it Barbecue Steak?) mine was the plain steak!

For the volume of lunch business they are doing they are FAST!!!
