My boyfriend lives in DC and comes down to visit and the first place he hits is Phat Burrito.  I think he dreams of this place in his sleep.  And he was a former Chipotle lover.  I would never turn down Phat Burrito, but it's not the world's best burrito. But, since that's not in Charlotte, I'm going to say this is the best place.  I do love their chips and salsa though.  The medium salsa and pico is yummy!  It's quick, the servings are big, the ingredients are fresh, and the decor is cool.  The employees are a little blah though.  Slow and on the unfriendly side.  And kind of creepy looking if you ask me....
I wish they weren't such a pain on using their Groupon.  Most stores just let me use it off my Iphone app with the confirmation number.  Not them.  I have to print it and bring it in. Pain in the ass because I always forget.  By the time I get to a printer, I'm pretty sure it'll be expired.
