Not overly impressed with food. Service was great for a take out order. Very nice people to few customers strolling in. I like the bbq steak taco (size & General flavor) more than the chicken burrito. Chicken has no flavor and rice was dry brittle not cooked right.

Expected better than Moe's but less than actual Mexican place and it fell short.
