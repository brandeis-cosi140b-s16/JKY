I agree with previous reviews about the food and atmosphere. Tacos are delicious and the salsa selection is fabu. I was starving this morning and came in for a quick bite. The guys prepared fish tacos for me even though the restaurant wasn't opening for another 20 minutes. I love supporting this place . . . and the other wonderful non-franchise/non-establishment businesses in South End. Charlotte, be proud!
