I had the BBQ chicken burrito, and it was surprisingly good.  The BBQ sauce goes really well with the chicken, and the chicken is cooked with a nice char on the edges.

I tried some of my friend's steak burrito, and they also make the steak really well - it's almost like pulled meat - fall-off-the-bone tender.  

I'm imagining that the BBQ steak burrito would be a home run for me.  I want that next.

Portion size is HUGE, which somewhat justifies its pricey menu.  And the salsa bar has a great selection with some serious flavor.

Good option for something quick and delicious.
