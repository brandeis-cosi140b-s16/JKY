I've never had the burritos but what a great spot for a couple tacos. I stroll over from a neighboring residential building weekly for a fish taco and/or one of the others on the menu. It is quick and delicious. 

As for the parking people mention, I walk, but there is the small lot connected to the building, a lot across the street with plenty of space (I think it is shared with Common Market) and plenty of street parking within a block or two in either direction. You can even park in the South BLVD street spots and walk across the light rail tracks and be here in no time.
