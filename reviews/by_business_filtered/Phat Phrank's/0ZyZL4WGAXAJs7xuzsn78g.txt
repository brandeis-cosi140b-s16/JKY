Went back w a friend/colleague. Got the chic salad. It was better than my last visit w the burrito escapade but still darn expensive for what you get. I understand they are close to the corporate parks so can get away with lack of taste and overpricing themselves than in other possible locations, but maybe they are taking it a bit too far.
