We arrived in Vegas, sicker than either of us had ever been and beyond exhausted.  We woke up late, having not eaten a real meal in days.  So we relied on Yelp (thank you Yelp!) to find a restaurant close by.  All the reviews of Phat Phrank's are right on -- you will not be disappointed.

First, Frank greets you as if he just saw you yesterday and has known you for years.  He is so friendly, and funny, and welcoming.  As we told him at the end of our meal... we felt as though we were dinner guests in his home.

The food was just great!  We were both really hungry because we had been too sick to eat for days.  Phat Phranks was the place to be!  Portions were large, everything was homemade, and we left feeling full (but not painfully full) and energized.  

Wonderful... thank you Frank & family!
