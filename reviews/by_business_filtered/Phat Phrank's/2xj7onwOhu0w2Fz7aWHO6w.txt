Meeting new yelp friends is a great way of finding out about new places to eat. A friend came back to town, from Reno, to prep for his wedding and had some time to kill. He asked for Mexican food, I thought this was the perfect opportunity to try this place out.

After a few days of eating poorly; I was in much need of a salad, but still wanted to try something more traditional, and got a taco as well. The trainer's salad contained huge, moist chunks of white chicken breast. The two generous scoops of guacamole, a mound of cabbage, cilantro, and beans makes for a filling meal. The green salsa dressing was not too flavorful, but the pile of limes can fix that. The carnitas taco was the size of two tacos. It was like a mini salad to accompany my entree. The hot red salsa did not deliver. The thing about Pat Phrank's is that it is not your typical Mexican joint. It is not super greasy and is not overly seasoned. My two friends got burritos and they both were unimpressed. The lack of contrasting textures and temperatures does not help. Each burrito comes with your choice of meat, then beans and rice. All of the ingredients are hot and soft, the addition of guac, sour cream, or lettuce would give it the additional omph. 

The service is the main reason this place gets four stars. The staff are stellar. The food comes out fast and they are attentive. During our meal, we had someone checking up on us for refills and if we needed anything more. After we finished we lingered around for 45 minutes and no one made us feel uncomfortable or rushed us out.
