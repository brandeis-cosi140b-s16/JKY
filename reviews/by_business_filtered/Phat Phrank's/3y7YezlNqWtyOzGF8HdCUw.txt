Yes, they have the perfect fish taco and that's why they get a 5 star. Absolutely wonderful. These are the fish tacos I've been searching for....lightly battered with the white cream sauce and they are big. The owner is super nice, but even if he was a jerk, I'd still go back for the damn fish tacos.
