Just ate their for the second time. I've never been a fan of fish tacos in the past, but these are actually worth it. Portions aren't big, but that's probably for the best. 

The two times I've been, the staff manning the counter haven't been too personable, but that's often the way it goes and it wasn't so bad as to majorly affect my rating. This time either the manager or the owner took the time to chat with me as I was heading out the door, so that customer service did a good job counterbalancing anything else. 

Definitely try the fish tacos, you'd be surprised!
