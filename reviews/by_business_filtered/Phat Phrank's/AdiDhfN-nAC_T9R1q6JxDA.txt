My boyfriend and I were searching for some authentic Mexican food in the south west area....came across phat phranks, and although it's not so much a "restaurant" the food was still delicious. They have yummy home made salsa and a pretty big selection of food to pick from. We will definitely be back!!! The desserts also looked really good, but we didn't get to try them.
