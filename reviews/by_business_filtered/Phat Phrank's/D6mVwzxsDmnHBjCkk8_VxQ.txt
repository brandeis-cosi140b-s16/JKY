In all honesty, I stopped into this place only after learning the deli next door was no longer in business. So, I was expecting just an average Mexican joint and play it safe with a couple of a la cart tacos.

It was early in the lunch hour, so it looked a little quiet from the outside. As soon as I walked through the door, I was greeted by the entire staff! Nice! With this being my first visit, the friendly gentlemen behind the counter (who I connect the dots as Phrank) was quick to suggest some of their best dishes. I notice out of the corner of my eye a sign advertising their daily special as fish tacos with rice and beans. Done and done. 

I have a seat and in no time one of their servers brings me out my drink and asks me if this was my first visit. "We hope you enjoy the food!" he says mentions that my lunch will be right out. 

Meanwhile, the place is really starting to pick up! Construction workers, business men and a couple of families all seem to be regulars and strike up conversations with Phrank and even recognize each other as loyal fans of the food.

The fish tacos were incredible!  Good portion size and yummy, well seasoned rice (although still not as good as my mom's)!  I was in a bit of a hurry so I was in and out of there in no time, but it was probably a good thing as people were literally lined up for the next available table.

All in all, great experience, good food, terrific staff and close enough to the office it's a shame not to visit at least a few times a month.
