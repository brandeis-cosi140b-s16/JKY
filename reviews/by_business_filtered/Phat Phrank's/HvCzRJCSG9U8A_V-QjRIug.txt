I've been reading about Phat Phrank's in several local newspapers and magazines and finally decided to give it a try. It's in a small strip mall off Decatur and the 215, down the street from Rhythm Kitchen and owned by a Cali transplant named (you guessed it...) Frank. While they do have some traditional Mexican dishes, this restaurant isn't your typical 'authentic' taco shop. It's a more modern take on Mexican/Southern Cali food.

Their tacos are a little larger than some street tacos elsewhere, using 6-inch tortillas instead of the 4-inch ones. The two tacos I had (carne asada and adobada) came with a good sized portion of steak and pork, respectively, with a little cabbage and cilantro on top, with your choice of 4 salsas on the side. While the carne asada taco wasn't the best I've had, it was still very good and the adobada was so tender, but crispy around the edges and packed with intense flavors.

And the churros... mmmmm... the churros. They are reason enough to stop by Phat Phrank's. Four of them stacked on a plate and drizzled with caramel, chocolate and vanilla. Big enough to share, but I refuse to.

The customer service here is second to none, with the staff bringing your food out when it's ready and Frank walking around chatting up all the patrons and checking to make sure everything's ok. He even brought out a sample of his ceviche for me to try. Tomatoes, cilantro, onions, and chopped fish cooked in citrus juices. It also had a good bit of heat to it.

They also have a breakfast menu (which I haven't tried) with breakfast burritos, huevos rancheros, and spam+chile, among other things.
