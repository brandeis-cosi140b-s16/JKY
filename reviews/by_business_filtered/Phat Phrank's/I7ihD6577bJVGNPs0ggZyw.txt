This was an upscale version of a taco shop. For the most part same taco shop fare but higher prices and more adjectives in their menu, such as, "flawless" and "delectable".  The owner took our order. I asked him what he recommended and he said people like the fish taco and the tortas. I then asked him what his favorite was and he replied "I like them all it is like picking a favorite granchild" to which I said "but everyone has a favorite." He eventually told me until the article last week (which I have no idea of) barbacoa was the most popular. So I tried the two taco plate, one fish and one barbacoa.  The barbacoa was a little dry and not a lot of flavor, also the portion of barbacoa for the price in the taco was pretty small.  The fish taco was pretty good, fried cod I think, it was a pretty big piece of fish and it was fried well, a little greasy, but crispy. The plate also came with a small portion of rice and beans.  I got the hot salsa - owner said not as hot as habaneros, but it still had a pretty good kick.  Also, a medium Jamaica drink (free refills) - I paid a little under $12 - which I think is expensive for a taco shop.  The food came on paper plates, which I would expect, but again for the price it seems like you should get more.  It just didn't seem that authentic - but I am more of a Tacos El Gordo type of girl personally.
