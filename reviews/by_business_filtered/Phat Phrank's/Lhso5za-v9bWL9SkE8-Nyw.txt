After reading all the rave reviews here on Yelp my husband and I just had to check this place out! It definitely didn't disappoint!  We had the fish tacos which by far were the best I'd ever had! The fish was fresh and the "secret sauce" they put on it was delish! As we were about to leave we were asked how everything was from who we believe was the owner - he was friendly and suggested other items for when we return - great customer service! If you're looking for traditional Mexican food, definitely check this place out!
