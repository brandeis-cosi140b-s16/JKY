Worst customer service at the place with the best breakfast burritos.. I come once a week and tip them and I never even get a thank you... I always get over quoted on the time and they constantly change their hours..it's sad that I probably won't go back to one of my favorite vegas restaurants..  Oh and don't bother calling for pick up they'll just hang up on you or tell you it'll take 2 hours
