Phat Phrank's has quickly become my go-to place to tasty Mexican here in Vegas. It's a family owned place where the food is made with a lot of care and I love that! "Phrank" is always around and smiling and his staff will do all that they can to ensure your satisfaction. At this point I've tried quite a few things... my favorites:

*Nachos - I'm actually not a nachos person, but his are done the way nachos should be! Tons of delicious shredded pork... an order is definitely a meal for 2 people!
*Breakfast Burrito - the best breakfast burrito I've had in Vegas, by far! It comes with eggs, yummy crispy potatoes, cheese, and your choice of meat. He mixes everything to ensure every bite is perfect. When I'm having a bad day, I call ahead and pick one up on my way to work!
*Fajitas - I have FINALLY found delicious fajitas in Vegas! I had the chicken ones for lunch today and really enjoyed them. The chicken was shredded (as opposed to the creepy pre-cut strips with faux-grill marks you find at say Chili's) and had 3 colors of peppers and onions mixed in. I'm not usually a fan of chicken, but this had an amazing amount of flavor. 
*Churros - caramel and chocolate sauce.. mmmmmmm

I can also highly recommend their catering services ! "Phrank" helped us pick out a freaking feast for well under $10 a person. We had platters of enchiladas and tacos, guacamole, and ceviche. Everything was delicious and was ready right on time. We picked it up ourselves, but it was well packaged and transport -ready. 

Overall, don't let the strip mall exterior fool you - this is Mexican (albeit heavily Americanized) at its best ! It's affordable, fast, and delicious. It's basically like  Roberto's that isn't a chain that serves food that tastes good! The only sad thing is they aren't open on weekends...
