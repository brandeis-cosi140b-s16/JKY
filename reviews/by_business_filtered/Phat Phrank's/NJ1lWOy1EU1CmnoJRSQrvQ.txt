Phranks was the best food we had this weekend in Vegas.   FYI, the meal before Phrank's was at Mesa Grill....Bobby could learn a lot from Phrank. 

Phrank himself was behind the counter.  Cheerful and genuinely interested in his customer's input, Phrank really wants you to enjoy his food.  

I had a fish taco plate that rocked.  The fish was super-crispy on the outside and perfect on the inside.  The cabbage and creamy cilantro sauce were awesome.  Phrank let us try all his salsas and I would say his regular red was my fave...you must order the roasted jalapenos...he marinates them in some sort of lime concoction so they have a tasty spicy tang to them.

My wife had a torta adobada that I would say was a cross of a torta and a pulled pork sammie...different than tortas I have had in the past, but really good.
