5 stars might seem way too much for a small strip mall restraint, but it is not the quality of the food, which is excellent, it is not the price, which is really low, it is the incredible customer service. Any moron can open a restraint and resell Sysco boxed crap and make a go of it, but this place is on a whole different level. Frank, his wife, daughter, grand sons, and other family members make nearly all the food items fresh. You always hear someone say that "this is the best whatever it is they are eating", but at Phat Phranks you really want to say it about everything you put in your mouth. They are open till 6 PM on every night but Thursday. 
Go there on a Thursday night after 6 PM and see what the car clubs bring to his special late hours event.

Be sure to try the Churro.
