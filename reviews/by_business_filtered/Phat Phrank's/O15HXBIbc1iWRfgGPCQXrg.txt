I am a phan of Phat Phrank's. Sorry--couldn't resist! 

I have been hearing about this place for a few months now and decided to give it a try thanks to my fellow yelpers. What I liked most about it was that it was different from the norm. For example, it is not a traditional sit down restaurant nor is it your average taqueria. There are a handful of tables and chairs that we were able to move around to accommodate our party of 4. However, the best thing about this place was the friendly environment Phrank creates in his restaurant. He is welcoming, and constantly checks on you to make sure your visit is going smoothly. I like that!

As far as the food in concerned, it was pretty good for the most part. My wife and I decided to share a variety of dishes, so we could sample the different flavors that were on the menu. We started off with the nachos, which came loaded with tender Chile Verde and cheese over the top of crispy tortilla chips. Good, but I forgot that I don't like cheese with pork. Something weird happens when the cheese mixes with the sauce from the meat. The result is a gelatin mixture of wet, sloppy, cheesy goo. Next time - no cheese please. 

We also tried the carne asada burrito with rice inside. Tasty, but I had better versions in town -Los Tacos for example. The fish tacos I kept hearing so much about were "fishy", and disappointing. But hey- we are in Las Vegas! How fresh can the fish be? The star of the meal was the adobada taco that was seasoned well and went perfectly with the cabbage and hot sauce. Next time, I would order a handful of those and be just fine. 

Prices are reasonable, as we spent 23.00 for all that food and a large soft drink. We will be back to visit Phrank and support his restaurant that he obviously cares so much about.
