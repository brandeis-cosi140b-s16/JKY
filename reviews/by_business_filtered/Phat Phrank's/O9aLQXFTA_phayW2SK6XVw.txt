I was visiting a client down the street and found this on my Yelp App. Located in a odd spot and smaller I was greeting by Phrank the owner who is from Redlands CA. Phrank took the took the time taking orders personally and even came out to the dinning area and made sure everyone was happy! Now that's service. 

After placing my order with Phrank at the counter my food arrived within minutes is seemed like. I saw good reviews for the fish tacos and went with the fish taco combo plate. Tacos were yummy, sizable pieces of deep fried fish with cabbage and a light white sauce. I added some salsa which gave my tacos a nice kick. The beans and rice were also good. 

Phat Phank's has been here two years and it's nice to see a non big box place chain do well. I'm looking forward to coming back and trying the tacos and burritos - prices are reasonable and service is great.
