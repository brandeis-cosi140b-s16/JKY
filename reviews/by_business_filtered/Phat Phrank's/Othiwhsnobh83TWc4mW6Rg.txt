I went to lunch with some coworkers. We weren't sure about this place since it was new. Wow! We were pleasantly surprised. I had the Chile Verde burrito and it was yummy. It had just enough spice to it. It came enchilada style with the Chile Verde sauce (just how I like it). They have 3 salsas (mild, med, hot). The hot is pretty hot just like it should be.

I highly recommend this place. But go early. We got there at 11:30 and our food came really fast. We were leaving at 12:15 and the line was out the door.
