This place is amazingly good. Kind of mom and pop place. Very small. There are only very few tables and they are packed usually during lunch hours. Come early or a bit later will usually do the trick :) but you have to try their Adobada Torta. It's amazing. So good! And their churros. YUM! Mr. Phrank also very nice and gave a free dessert to my friend when I took her there for her birthday lunch. The dessert given was like cream cheese filled tortilla, deep fried, and drizzled with caramel sauce. Wow.
