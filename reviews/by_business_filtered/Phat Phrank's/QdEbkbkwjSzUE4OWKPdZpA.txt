This is another place I did not know was here. I found it by driving by. 
As soon as you walk in you are welcomed. Who does that anymore. It was really nice. Frank is a nice person. Makes you feel at home. He explained the menu to us.
The food is amazing. Fresh and clean. You can taste every flavor. I had the slow pit beef tacos. The beef very tender. I love the cabbage and cilantro.   
Our server was attentive.   
Can't wait to go back and try more dishes.
