I had the adobada torta and it was damn good.  The bread was really thin and crispy.  It had something tasting like bleu cheese on it which I have never had on Mexican food but I liked the taste.  

You order at the counter then get a number and they bring your food out.  The portions aren't gigantic but filling enough.
