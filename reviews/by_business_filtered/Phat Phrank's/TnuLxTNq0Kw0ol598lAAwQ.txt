I'm from Southern Cali so I know good Mexican when I taste it. I came here not expecting much but then I had their salsa with my tostada and I was confused. I thought I was in Vegas, not back home in Cali. I have to give credit to taco shops that have not just salsa that has good heat, but salsa that actually had good flavor. You can taste the garlic and onions magically hidden and blended so well.
