We stopped in a little after 6pm and were the only ones in the place (it's more of a breakfast and lunch spot from what I gather).  The owner greeted us and was very friendly to my wife and I, explaining some menu items and pointing us to some of the more popular items.  My wife got the fish tacos and was very pleased with them.  I got the Chile Verde Pork burrito, which was massive, had plenty of meat inside and tons of flavor.  Each dish comes with his three salsas, a mild and hot red and a verde.  I'm a big fan of verde (green) salsa, and his was excellent.  We're from out of town, but if I am ever in Las Vegas again, I would definitely come back.
