I pass this place on the way to work and wanted to give it a try. I walked in to a small crowded room with no seating available. With no one at the counter I looked over the menu. I went with the special, a Carne asada torta with fries and a drink for just over $10 with tax. With a few people behind me I stood by the door to be out of the way. I wasn't given a number so I waited until a girl who was walking around finally came to me and asked what I ordered. The food was ok but not that outstanding. Not planning a return anytime soon.
