IF you like great Mexican food you need to make your way here.  The place is small but the hospitality is only surpassed by the amazing food that has so much flavor it is crazy.  My coworker and I went for lunch yesterday and I am so glad we tried it.  Frank actually was the one who took our order.  My coworker and I are in Sales which means we are NOT shy people and love to talk so we asked Frank "What's the most popular items?"  He gave us a few things that are the biggest sellers and elected to finally choose a green burrito with some of the most flavorful pork ever.  As we were eating Frank came out and brought us a sample of his barbacoa.  OMG, off the hook.  We get to chatting and Frank asks where I am from to which I say "San Diego".  He then proceeds to tell me that the fish tacos are out of this world.  Crap, should I have ordered that?  (as I continue to devoure the best frigging burrioto I have had in town since moving back here.).  Ok, no worries, next trip its fish tacos.  
All I can say is that I am not going anywhere else for Mexican.  This place rocks the house.  Robertos, Albertos, Don Juan DeMarco or whoever, has nothing on Phat Franks.  And to top it off, the prices for food are great.  I am so happy that it is a quick trip from the office for lunch.  
THANK YOU Frank!  You are awesome and your food is equal to your hospitality.
