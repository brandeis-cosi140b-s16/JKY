Phat Phrank's serves high-quality, consistent Mexican food. It's a wonderful place for lunch, but expect to be weighed down a bit afterwards :)

Their nachos are a smokin' deal, although they lack all the 'fixin's'. But man, they don't skimp on the shredded pork - so good.
Their tortas are delish. I was skeptical at first b/c I feel like I'm usually less impressed with sandwiches, but this isn't a boring sandwich at all.  So much flavor.
The breakfast burritos have excellent texture with the addition of the crispy potato bits. Way better than Roberto's IMHO.

And Phrank is a sweetheart. You can tell he's proud when you come back again and again.
