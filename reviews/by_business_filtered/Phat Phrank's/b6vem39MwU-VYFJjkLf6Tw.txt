If you've had Phranks, you get it. There's something about walking into the place and seeing the owner behind the counter taking your order every time. This place is Frank's passion and it shows. He has a tattoo of "Phat Phranks" for sobbing out loud. He loves it and he loves everyone that comes in. 

As far as food. Get the Adobada Torta. It's no secret. You've heard about it for a reason and that's why you're reading these reviews. 

Infamous "one-sentence review"?
I wish Frank DIDN'T work so much in the place he takes so much pride in, so he'd be able to have a Harley ride with me.
