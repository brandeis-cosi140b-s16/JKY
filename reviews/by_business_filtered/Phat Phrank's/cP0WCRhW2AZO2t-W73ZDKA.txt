Another Phan of Phat Phrank's!
In Vegas on and off for a while, working at the House of Blues with Santana.
I rely on fellow Yelpers when traveling to steer me right and you did not fail.
Met Phrank, great guy, had the adobada and asada tacos, terrific!
Only eight minutes from the HOB, definitely will be seeing Phrank again soon!
