Love this place!  Best chicken burrito I've had in Las Vegas.  I haven't tried anything else yet because I can't steer myself away.  Did have the chips and salsa, which were very good.  Love the medium salsa.  Place is small and packed during lunch, so go early.  Service has always been great.  Only thing I don't like is, that the fountain machine is behind the counter, so you have to ask for refills, but they've always been quick.
