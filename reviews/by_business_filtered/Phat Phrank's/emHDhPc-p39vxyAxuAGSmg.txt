I actually had received an email from Yelp yesterday with Phat Phrank's highlighted in it and so thought I would try it out for the first time since the ratings were so good.

Somewhat disappointed.....I don't think it is a 4.5 star rating, but if I was in the neighborhood and was hungry for Mexican Food I would stop. Certainly not worth a trip of about 6 miles from my home.

I ordered a chicken burrito.  Thought I would compare it to the chicken burrito I had the previous day at "Roberto's Tacos."

It was good, but not fabulous.  I had asked if they put cheese on their chicken burritos and I was told yes, but after eating the whole thing, I hadn't seen a sign of any cheese.  They do add rice and beans, which to me then makes it a combination burrito and I wanted chicken.  The chicken was all white meat, but not enough chicken for me and to much rice and beans.  It was bland tasting without adding any salsa or hot sauce.  The portion size was good, and the salsa was good, but would have tasted better on chips rather than the burrito.

The chicken burrito I had eaten at the "Roberto's" the day before was all chicken, no rice and beans and very tasty.  It was seasoned with some chiles and peppers and very good to eat without adding anything to it if you didn't want to.  Roberto's was definitely better when it came to the chicken burrito.

Phat Phrank's does not have a menu board and so you have to wait until you get up to the counter to look at the one menu they had available to order off of.  It didn't give you much time to make up your mind when there were people waiting in line behind you.

The employees were all very friendly and the facility was clean.

I will probably go back and try some other items, but not at the top of my list to run right back tomorrow.
