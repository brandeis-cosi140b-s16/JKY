Very disappointed--not sure how this place gets such high ratings. I'm used to the yummy Mexican food from SoCal and this place is now added to my list of blah Mexican food in Vegas.  I ordered the chili verde burrito (because I love tomatillo), but unfortunately the whole thing just tasted like rice and beans. I barely tasted the pork and chili verde. The older lady who took my order was nice, but the younger lady who packed and gave it to me obviously doesn't care about customer service. I specifically asked for hot sauce, good thing I checked my bag before leaving because they didn't pack any. Anyways, hot sauce aside, I didn't enjoy my chili verde because I didn't taste any chili verde, it just tasted like a bean and rice burrito.
