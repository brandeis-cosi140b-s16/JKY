Not quite sure how this place has received such high reviews? I work nearby and was in need for an early lunch. Ordered a beef burrito but believe it was carnitas. Extremely bland and that was with the jalape√±os I had to pay for as a side. Also was greasy. I could not finish based on taste and texture. maybe I caught them on an off day. May try them again, not because of quality but location.
