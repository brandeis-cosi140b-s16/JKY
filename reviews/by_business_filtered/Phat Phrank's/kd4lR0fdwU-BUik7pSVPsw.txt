Came here for a brunch with friends!

I love trying everyone's Adobada / Al Pastor, so when I saw it in Torta form here, I had to have it!

Adobada Torta ($7.39): Braised Pork, Cheese, Cabbage, Lettuce, Tomato, Onion, Cilantro & Secret Sauce. This was GREAT! The bread is very thin, crispy and has a butter toast like flavor!  The adobada is thin, has lots of flavor and is cooked right.  This is one of the better tortas I've had in town actually!  

Eva went with the Carne Asada Breakfast Burrito ($5.99): Grilled Steak, Eggs, Potatoes & Cheese. Good breakfast burrito here! Price and portion is fair too.

I'd come back for the Torta alone!  But chances are, I will try something new to see if there are any other surprises to be had :)
