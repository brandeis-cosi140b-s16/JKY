When reading one of Vegas's local magazine, I happened across a food review that touted Phat Phrank's as having the best Mexican food in Las Vegas.

In my youth, consumption of Mexican food in Vegas was usually only done after indulging of some non-alcoholic Roy Rogers and Shirley Temples on the Strip (extra grenadine of course :P ). In those days, I would be willing to wager that you could have fried a shoe and it probably would have tasted good to me. 

But this article indicated that Phat Phrank's was pretty darn good and I was craving some carne asada so... 

I arrived at about 12 pm on a Thursday and the place was hopping. A line of about 7 people quickly formed, which gave me some time to peruse a laminated menu for what I wanted to eat. I settled on a carne asada burrito with a drink for about 7 dollars. Frank gave me a number, and told me to pick a seat and they would bring my food out to me. About 3-4 minutes passed and a reasonable sized carne asada burrito was delivered to me. 

Stand by for carne asada burrito dissection...

Tortilla - This was ok - had the consistency of a whole wheat tortilla (a bit harder).  

Carne Asada - While this was seasoned appropriately, I was a bit disappointed at how much of the Carne was too fat to eat...I'm used to a little bit here and there, but about a 1/4 of my burrito was annoyingly fatty. 

Beans - Beans were flavor-fully non-offensive and didn't take away from the meat thankfully. 

So all in all, Phat Phranks's was Phrankly ok. The reviews on Yelp make me think that maybe that was just a bad burrito day for Frank and his family. Unfortunately, I have yet to try Mexican food outside of California that is worth a repeat trip, but I'm willing to go back to Phrank's and try something else next time I am in Vegas to see if I feel any differently.
