Below average Mexican food. Food tasted rushed and bland. Lacked traditional mexican culture in the food. Honestly felt like I could make there food myself. Even down the the coffee I ordered tasted real cheap. First time here. Maybe ordered the wrong food on menu. But dont see myself going here again especially with it out of the way location.
