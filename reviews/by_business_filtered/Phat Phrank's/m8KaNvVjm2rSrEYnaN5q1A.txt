Phrank and his family make this place amazing!! Not only is the service awesome, the food is amazing as well. The Mama Marias enchiladas with an egg are a must have if you're eating at Phat Phranks!! Also, the Carne Asada breakfast burrito, Fish tacos and barbacoa plates are also to die for!! I have had pretty much everything on this menu and still come back for more!!
