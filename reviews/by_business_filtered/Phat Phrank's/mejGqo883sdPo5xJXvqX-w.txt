Drove a long time to get here because of the super high yelp rating. But I don't think it should be that high review, at least for my first time experience. 
We got the Carne asada plate, taste just average and the size is small. The inside is small and very simple but seems very busy during lunch time.  I don't think I will drive back here for lunch. Maybe it is good for ppl live near by.
