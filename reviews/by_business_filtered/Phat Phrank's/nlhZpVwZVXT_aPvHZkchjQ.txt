Fresh.  This is honestly some of the best Mexican style food I have had around here.  It isn't greasy, you don't feel 500lbs after eating it; unless of course you eat more than your stomach can handle.  

I got the chicken burrito, and Frank recommended I get the green sauce to go with it.  It was great! 

I like that the owner works in the store, I think that shows hard work and dedication.  Not to mention he is really nice, and that was how I knew he was the owner.  

The location is in an awkward, but smart, spot.  However, do not let that veer you from this delicious place!  

If you go once, I can assure you, you will go back again.
