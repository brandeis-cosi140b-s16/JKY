My coworker and I stopped in today for lunch. The service was exceptional! Not only did they help us figure out what we should try, they came back throughout the meal to make sure that we were enjoying our food., which we did. We got the adobada torta and the fish tacos, both were so delicious that I could sit there and eat them all day. Both had such great flavors and every sauce (we tried them all) was awesome. The best part was, after we ate (way more than we should've) I didn't feel overfull or fat like I do after most of my Mexican food meals :) The ingredients were all super fresh and light. I will most definitely be back with friends. I only wish I had one closer to my house so that I could take my husband back for dinner tonight! I'll have to bring him soon! Thank you to everyone. I will most definitely be a phattie :)
