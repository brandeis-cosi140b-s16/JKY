Been coming here for a few years now whenever I'm in town. Service is excellent every time. I have eaten just about everything on the menu over the years and haven't found anything that wasn't delicious. Highly recommend to anyone craving good ol mom and pop mexican food. Compares to my favorites in SoCal anyday!
