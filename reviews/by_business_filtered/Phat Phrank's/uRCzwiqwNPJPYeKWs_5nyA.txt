Whoa...........who knew about this?   Unassuming little place on a side street behind a Popeye's Chicken.   The owner is a great guy running one very little Mexican restaurant that is cranking out some top notch food.   

I had the Chile Verde burrito and it was fabulous.  A pile of tender pork inside with rice/beans then covered with even more pork on the outside.  Another in my party enjoyed the torta and would order it again.  Fresh food made with love and passion.   Everyone working there is hustling but with a smile on their face.   Great to see a locally owned place doing well and the food is definitely first on the priority list here.   We will be back!
