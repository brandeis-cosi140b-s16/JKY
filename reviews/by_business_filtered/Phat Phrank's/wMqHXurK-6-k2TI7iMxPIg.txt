Phat Franks definitely deserves 5 stars for service and the food isn't too bad itself. I tried the carne asada breakfast burrito and I have to say I really like how they cooked the breakfast potatoes in the burrito, definitely a nice change of pace. The carne asada meat was seasoned to perfection and tasted like most fresh carne asada meats. The tortilla wasn't as good as Fausto's but the breakfast filling inside could give any any Fausto's/Robertos burrito a run for their money if not better.
     
    My only complaint with this place is that I have actually been here several times only to realize they were closed. They're only open from 6am-6pm, which means its never open for dinnertime, or at least my dinnertime. 2nd they're not open weekends which is primetime burrito hour. That means no love from Phat Frank's on picnic Saturdays or hangover Sundays for some people. Ah well, all in all a good place.
