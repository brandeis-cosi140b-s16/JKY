Made my way over to this little Mexican restaurant for lunch with the hubby and my 2 year old son. Where to start....the service was awesome and the food was amazing. Phrank was behind the counter and he took our order. He was very friendly and walked us through the menu. I ordered the fish tacos, hubby ordered a chicken and carnitas taco, and Phrank made a special order for our little guy: a cheese quesadilla with chicken. All the food was fresh, flavorful, and you get to pick from several different house made salsas. After the food came out, Phrank came over to our table to see how we were enjoying our food. Looking around, there were many regulars that Phrank knew by their first name. Overall, we had a wonderful lunch and will be back again to support Phrank and his family business. Phrank also asked us for our first names, which I found to be very gracious. Phat Phrank's rocks!!!
