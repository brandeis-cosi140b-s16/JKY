Phat Phranks treats you like family...or maybe I should say Phamily!  They provide friendly service, great home cooking, and good prices.  Frank makes it a point to know your name and remembers you; not too many places can do that after one visit. I had one of the best pork tacos I have ever tasted.  The salsas are wonderful, my favorite is the verde salsa. Everything I have tried has been very good (fish tacos, enchiladas, burrito, chips, and tostados.)  I can't wait to go back and try the breakfast burrito and green chile burrito.  Give it a try, you will be glad you did.
