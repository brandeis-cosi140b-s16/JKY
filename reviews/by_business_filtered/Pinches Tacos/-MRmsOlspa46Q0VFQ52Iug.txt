This place is amazing!! We stumbled upon it in Container Park and my fianc√©, who is Mexican, loved their slogan, real mexican food made by real mexicans. They have a huge menu and the majority of my family got burritos, either al pastor or pollo and my sister got the vegetarian tacos. The burritos are BOMB! I will be going back to container park just for the burrito. I've eaten a ton of burritos over the years as they are my favorite but this is by far the best burrito I have ever had! Definitely worth it....you won't regret it!
