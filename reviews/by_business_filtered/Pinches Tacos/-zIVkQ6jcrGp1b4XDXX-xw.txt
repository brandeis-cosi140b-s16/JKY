Located in the Container Park in Downtown Las Vegas, this very authentic taco shop has the best margaritas in the downtown are, they even serve them in a to go cup (hey this is Las Vegas after all) I didn't have anything to eat but it looked and smelled great so what could possibly go wrong if you give it a try? Nothing, that's what. Live It Up You Are In Las Vegas For Cryin' Out Loud!
