Firstly, let me say that I support the business name and theme.  It's got a great vibe to it for a small shop and it isn't afraid to have a little bit of personality.  

It's tucked into Container Park near Downtown East Fremont, and I do mean tucked - it's almost hidden in a back corner.  I didn't see a title outside, which is probably thanks to its personality-filled name.  I can dig it.

The service was spot on, friendly and fast.  Everyone on staff delivered full smiles and plenty of help to this gringo as needed.  I ordered the taco combo - three tacos of any choice and rice and beans.  Asada.  Al pastor.  And lenga.  Both the carne asada and the pastor were great, simple with a nice flavor and satisfying.  The lenga was a bit of a disappointment, but it was late in the evening and they did say they were running low.  So I'll cut it a bit of a break.

Overall though, for a quick taco spot in downtown, I think it accomplishes what its after.  And hey, it's all in the name.
