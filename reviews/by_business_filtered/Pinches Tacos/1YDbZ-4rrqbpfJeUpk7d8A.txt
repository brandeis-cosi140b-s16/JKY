New favorite - carne asada fries. Why didn't someone think of these before?   Extra crispy tasty fries, plenty of carne asada, beans, pico de gallo, guacamole...sorry if I left anything out but in my defense I was in a race with friends for portion size.  The staff were super nice, prices were low and the menu looks fantastic.  Later one of the vendors in another container said we have to go back and try the green sauce that's not on the menu...next time, definitely.
