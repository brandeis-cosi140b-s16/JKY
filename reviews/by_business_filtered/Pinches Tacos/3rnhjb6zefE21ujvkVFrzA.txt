So good I came back! Some of the best mole in town. It's inside the Container Park, so it's fun too. They have fresh brewed tea, the traditional Mexican fruit beverages (horchata, etc), beer & wine, and soda fountain. Everything is made fresh and it's simply delicious. They do deliver and you can call in ahead. When it's not too hot, there is seating out on the patio over looking the park. Must try at least once.
