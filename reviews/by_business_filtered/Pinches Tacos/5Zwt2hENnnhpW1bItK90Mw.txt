I feel like having been ripped off somewhat also. Came with my daughter and ordered her two tacos with fries, for myself a combo plate with 3 tacos/rice/beans and two small drinks. Tacos were like $2.50+ each but total Cost was 33+. Should have ate at Perch or the BBQ place. The tacos were okay, nothing to shout about even if it was made by real Mexicans, as their signs proudly  proclaimed "Mexican food by real Mexicans". Cashier did not offer a receipt n I didn't want to hold up people behind us.
