I've been wanting to hit this spot up since I caught a shot of their breakfast torta on social media- it looked incredible! But I'm rarely on this side of town when the sun's coming up, so the b-fast menu wasn't available when I stopped by.

Opted for a couple of different menu items with different meats- the sopes were  little underwhelming, but the tacos were large and meaty for the price. I appreciated that they had lengua available, despite it not being listed with the other meats on the menu. Maybe it's only around as a trial, as the texture was wonderfully soft and tender but it just wasn't that great. The carnitas were a little better, but again, not a great version. Food was comfortingly homestyle though.

I dig the location, the art on the walls, and the table cards. I've heard good things about this place but I guess I didn't order well. I'll have to come for breakfast next time.
