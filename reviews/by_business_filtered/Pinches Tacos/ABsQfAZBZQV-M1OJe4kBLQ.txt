First time here, I enjoyed this place. Any place that serves Nopales tacos which is cactus, is rad. They have a great variety of options for tacos and burritos. If you're vegetarian it's okay cause they have stuff for everyone. They also have fresh water drinks like Watermelon water and Horchata. The staff was friendly and the service was pretty fast. It's also not pricey and they make their tortillas FRESH.
