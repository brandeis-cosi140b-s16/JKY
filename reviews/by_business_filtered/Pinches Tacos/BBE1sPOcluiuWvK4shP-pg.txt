I love the fact that Pinches Tacos has Elote ( Mexican Corn ) . It's a corn on the cob smothered with mayo, cheese , and hot spices. It doesn't sound like the healthiest thing in the world but It is a favorite of mine that isn't sold at a lot of Mexican restaurants. Whenever a place carries this dish I automatically add an extra star...(if it is good.) The Elote is wonderful here!. 

I ordered the beef flautas as my main entree . These were also delicious! They were a good size and it was filling. 

They have a nice patio for dining but we were lucky enough to find seats inside. The reason I say that is because there isn't a lot of  tables inside so I felt lucky to get one. It's a nice place to grab a bite to eat and people watch.
