Friend and I got the 3 taco combo plate, they offer so much but I stuck with pollo, pescado, and al pastor. Saw the corn in a pic on here and got that too and boy was I glad I did. Believe it was about $16 with drink (taco combo comes with rice beans and chips) The tacos were very good like the ones back home. Least favorite was the fish but it was still good. The corn however I absolutely loved. I don't know what it was, the type of cream, butter or chile, whatever they used was amazing! I want more!
