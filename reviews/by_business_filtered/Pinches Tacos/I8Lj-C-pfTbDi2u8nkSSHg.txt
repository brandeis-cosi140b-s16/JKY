Love, love, love this place. 

I have class at the downtown learning village every week and get dinner here every time. I'm a particular fan of the quesadillas de asada and the lote, always with a cold horchata. Pinches does offer an Americanized menu (for "pinches gringos," the chalkboard notes), so I hesitate to rank it my favorite Mexican restaurant, but it is in my top three. If you find yourself downtown, it's definitely worth a try.
