Probably the best Mexican food I've ever had. I got the Vegetarian tacos, they were fresh, flavorful and amazingly refreshing. However, I don't recommend walking all the way to Container Park 5 min before they close at 11pm. We had to sit in the park waiting for our takeout, with all the security guards hovering around us waiting for us to leave. Our food was finally ready at quarter after 11, and security quickly ushered us out onto the empty street. Walking back a few blocks to the more populated area of Fremont street was a bit creepy. Where was everyone? Weird. Next question was, where are we going to eat our takeout? We ended up sitting at a bunch of slot machines in the divey Fremont Street Casino while scarfing down our Pinches Tacos. Not the classiest atmosphere, but so worth it. I will definitely come back next time I'm in Vegas!
