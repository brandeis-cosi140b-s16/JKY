We tried the Pinche plate with guacamole and a side of corn... All I can say is wow the food was absolutely amazing, I mean amazing! I just moved to Las Vegas from San Diego and in San Diego we have some of the BEST mexican food ever as a result of being so close to the border and this place feels a lot like home. It feels good to get some non fakexican food in my new home!
