Me and my family went all the way down to eat there, expecting good Mexican food ... very good actually because we know before hand each taco it's almost 4 dollars.. We always look  for yelp reviews looking for the best and we go no matter price or distance, (we live on SW).

They are located inside container park, and that's maybe why when u enter there's space just for 2 tables inside, and about 5 tables out and a few more on a second level. 

When we enter nobody greet, just silence, we didn't even know if we were supposed to sit or make the order on the cashier first, there's no sign. We order about 14 tacos for 3 adults and 1 kid, 2 cokes , 2 corn on the cob and chips with salsa for about 65 dollars... 

Taste was bad, and my son who was hungry didn't even finish them cause the taste..!, neither the little one,  I decide to take the rest of the tacos on a to go container, on the way home the car start to smell so bad because of the meat I had to stop and put them on the trash. Gross..

Overall super overpriced, bad service and bad food.
