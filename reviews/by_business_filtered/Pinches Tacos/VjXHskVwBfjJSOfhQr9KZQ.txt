This is a laid back Mexican fast food restaurant located at the container park. We ordered the carne Asada and alpastor burrito. They were both very good. However, the alpastor is good for people that enjoy spicy food.  While the carne Asada had less flavor and it was less spice. The burritos come with rice, beans and a good quantity of guacamole. The dish also comes with chips and fresh salsa on the side. The food was good, the only problem is that you dont always get a table as they have a very limited patio space. The menu was also a bit overwhelming and hard to read.  Overall, a very good place to eat Mexican food without breaking your bank.
