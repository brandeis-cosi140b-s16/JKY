First time here. I really liked the food! Tried the 3 taco plate, with rice and beans. Ordered pescado, asada, and carnitas. Wasn't wowed by the carnitas, but the fish and steak were very good. The steak was a bit on the spicy side, but in my case that's a good thing. I'd try a burrito next time. They looked really good. I'd also get one of their margaritas. Have to say that's about the only thing missing from my meal, but I'll save that for another time when I'm not out with my kids.
