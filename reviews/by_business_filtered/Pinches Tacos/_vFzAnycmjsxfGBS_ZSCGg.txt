WHAT TO GET? Pinches Combination Plate, of course!

You get 3 tacos (add $0.50 for asada and/or seafood tacos) along with rice and beans. Chips.

I got Carnitas, Al Pastor, and Fish Tacos.

Of the 3, I'd probably only get the al pastor ones again. The other two were good, but I can do without them next time.

They've got a bunch of other stuff on their menu so check them out but this is a sweet deal! And around this time, it's nice to sit out there in the day with the sun shining on you. Perfect sweater weather with some nice Mexican food.
