Oof. Much like Natalie Imbruglia in '97, I'm torn. This taqueria is a solid 3.5 for me, but considering it was a beautiful day outside and there was a live bass player doing his thing, I'll round up.  

Why a 3.5? Price. Size. Taste (1/2 star off). 

Picked up the three taco combo ($9 w/ sides of rice, beans and chips), but it's nowhere close to enough food if you eat like a normal human. I'm not asking for Hash House style meals here, but these 'cos are tiny. Mentioning this so you get an extra side or some of that corn, bc you WILL be heading back on line for a few more tacos if you're hungry and only get the special. I suggest going down burrito road if you're looking to fill up. Any who, so yea, I spent $31 on five tacos, 2 beers and an order of chips and guac. Bleh. 

Of the 5 tacos eaten, my favorites were the adobada and al pastor. Each were paired with the perfect amount of toppings and the meat was moist and flavorful. A fun 4 bites for each of those tacos. Least fave? The asada. A bit boring for me here. 

Looking for the best tacos in Vegas? They're not here. Looking for a good taco downtown? It's here and you might enjoy some live music while you dine.

Side note: a friend mentioned that the pollo mole was the best mole he's ever had. 
Sider note: he's from Philly, so he probably hasn't had much mole sauce
Sidest note: whomever calls the container park a 'hipster' area is a dolt... it's a total yuppie zone.
