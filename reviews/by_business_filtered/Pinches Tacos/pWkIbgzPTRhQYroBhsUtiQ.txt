My experience with the staff was phenomenal, everyone there is very friendly and attitude free. The food is great. Only go in there for their tacos. Home made tortillas... That definitely drew me in to visit. For dine in guests... They have table cards (Lotteria) instead of "numbers" its so authentic, I love it.
