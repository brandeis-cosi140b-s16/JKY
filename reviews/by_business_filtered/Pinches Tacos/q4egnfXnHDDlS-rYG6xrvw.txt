Pros: These tacos are AMAZING. The flavors are very tasty but not overpowering... just right! I got the usual carne asada, el pastor, and pollo and every single one was delicious! The best deal is their combination plate of 3 tacos that comes with rice and beans so you'll definitely be full! Coupled with watermelon juice and it will quench your thirst on a hot summer day in Vegas! Just hitting this place up is worth your trip to Container Park (in which the restaurant is made up of a freight container). The staff is very friendly and had us say enchilada before taking our picture... funny guy!

Cons: Nothing off the top of my head. The price, quality, quantity, service, and atmosphere was good!

Overall: For some authentic Mexican food goodness, you got to eat here!
