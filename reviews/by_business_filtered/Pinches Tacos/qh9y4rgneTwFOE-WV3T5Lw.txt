"Real Mexican Food made by Real Mexicans"

These people must not know about Roberto's.

Food is meh. The rice was very bland. Refried beans left a lot to be desired. Tacos were definitely not worth the price. The chicken one wasn't even seasoned very well. The chicken Flautas, however, were actually pretty good. And the shrimp for the tacos were good, just not enough.

The place is okay but only certain things are worth the price. Best bet: Stick to Roberto's.
