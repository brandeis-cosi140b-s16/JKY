Sad to say I thought it was just okay.  I had three street tacos carnitas (pork)pescado (fish) and asada (steak) neither had any flavor. I get trying to apese the masses but this tasted like nothing.  Even with their salsa I was surprised at how lack lust they were. I gave this an ok rating because I have faith they will make changes. Also their staff was very friendly. I will give them a second chance.
