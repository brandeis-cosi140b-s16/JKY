This place is more than I expected it to be. Service was great, and the place has a great selection. If you are a first timer I would suggest trying the Pinche Combo Plate which has 3 tacos of your choice, rice, beans with tortilla chips. 
If you want to play it safe like I did, chose the Pollo, Al Pastor, and Asada tacos. They were excellent, and their habanero hot sauce was very spicy, but the heat does not linger.  

Ambiance is very settle and relaxing. Prices are fair for the amount you get, and I would say that you wont regret spending your time and money at this place.

If you haven't been there, I would suggest trying it out.
