I heard about this place from a co-worker and she had me when she said tacos. I like to try tacos from different spot and this spot have really good tacos. Not only they serve tacos, they offer others choice like burritos, sopes, tortas, enchiladas, taquitos and breakfast during the weekend before 2 p.m.

 Wasn't too hungry so I ordered two tacos: 1 Adobada (California chili marinated pork) & 1 asada (grilled grass-fed beef). The tacos were tasty, the asada tacos was one of the best asada tacos I had in a long time and the pork were in chunks which I really enjoy. The prices are higher than the average taco spot but they  use high quality meat and fresh vegetables. Next time I will definitely try something than tacos because everything on the menu sounds delicious.
