we ordered the pastor tacos, a carnitas taco and a margarita.  I didn't notice the Margaritas came from a fountain, right next to the register.  If I would've paid more attention, I probably wouldn't have ordered it but oh well, I gotta have something to drink with my Pinches Tacos right?  The Pastor tacos were ok but I've had better at hole in the wall taco shops around Vegas.  Didn't get to try the Carnitas tacos since we only ordered one and my +1 ate it before I could try.  I like the huge menu they had inside.  I wouldn't mind trying the other items on their menu, they also have a "Gringo" menu for those who like Ground Beef in their tacos etc...they will bring out the food to your table which is nicer than having to wait around for your name/# to be called.
