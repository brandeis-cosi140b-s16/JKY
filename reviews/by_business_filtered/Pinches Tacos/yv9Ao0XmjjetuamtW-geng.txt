Love the atmosphere and vibe from this little taco joint. Definitely has that street taco feel to go with the street food. The mini chimis are awesome. They would be better with a different meat other than ground beef. The shrimp tacos are street style and authentic. Definitely will be revisiting and exploring the menu!
