Hubby & I had burritos from Pinches.  I had the carne asada burrito which was yummy & hubby had the shrimp burrito which was not all that great.  The carne asada had lots of flavor & the meat quality was good.  The shrimp was fried and the burrito was mostly filled w/ cabbage.  I had to knock off one star for inadequate serving sizes (way too small) & another star taken off for stale tortilla chips.  The chips tasted a day late & a dollar short.  Customer service was good.  

Just a side note:  Its awful stuffy inside Pinches, the AC would be nice while ordering your food, and probably much appreciated by the employees who are sweating bullets over the hot grill.
