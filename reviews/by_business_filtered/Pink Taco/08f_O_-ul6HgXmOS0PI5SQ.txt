SUNDAY BRUNCH - all you can eat for $25 

I really enjoyed:
Bread basket
Blue corn pancakes!!!  
Oysters 
Brisket wrap (if you like fat, which I do)
Deviled eggs 


I didn't care for:
The shrimp ceviche - not enough lime, should have been served with chips 
Lobster quesadilla - too soggy with all the sauce on top, I want a crunch to my tortilla 
Clams - strange after taste

There is plenty on the menu. It's nice to sit outside and enjoy the sun.  Looking forward to trying other items on the menu.
