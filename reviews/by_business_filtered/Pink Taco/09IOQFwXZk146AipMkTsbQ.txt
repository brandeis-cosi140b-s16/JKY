I loved Pink Taco, and I can't wait to go back there soon!

So Hard Rock Casino recently went gluten free friendly, and almost all of their restaurants offer clearly listed gluten free options. We stayed there recently (family was in town), and I was able to eat plenty of food at each of their restaurants.

Pink Taco's service is great, and I love their outdoor patio seating at the pool. Yes, it's loud because Rehab is a noisy mess of fun, but that's to be expected at one of the best pools in Las Vegas. 

Even though I could have eaten everything on their menu, I decided to try their carnitas platter with corn tortillas. Now, carnitas can easily become greasy and overcooked, but the platter at Pink Taco was superb. The portion size was perfect, but I probably could have eaten another half portion because it was so good. Everyone at my table who ordered the carnitas (4 out of 6 people)ate every little last morsel of their carnitas platter and continually said, "That was the best carnitas I've ever eaten before in my life." I agree with them in every way.

What's even better is that they have a huge gluten free friendly menu complete with lobster tacos. ahi tuna and shrimp tacos, salad, nachos and queso fundido. There is nothing on that gluten free menu that I would not want to devour quickly, and we will surely be back to Pink Taco soon.
