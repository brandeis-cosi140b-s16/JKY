Muy Bueno!

Pink Taco fits the Hard Rock perfectly.  Think of it as a rock and roll Mexican food joint.  Great bar and selection of drinks with amazing margaritas, good food, service is always top notch.  I've been here several time and will continue to go back.

Atmosphere:
Great theme throughout the restaurant.  Not a quiet place, but what do you expect from the Hard Rock.  It's more of a party spot where you can mingle at the bar or just enjoy good food.  There also always swarms of eye candy here as well...so enjoy.

Service:
I've never had bad service here.  Everyone is always on point.

Food:
My most favorite item is the sweet corn enchiladas.  These are muy delicioso!  You are served unlimited chips and dip, which is always a plus especially if you're just enjoying a few cocktails.  The tacos are great as well!
