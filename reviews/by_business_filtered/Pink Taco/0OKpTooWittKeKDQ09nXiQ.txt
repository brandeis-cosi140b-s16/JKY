Man, Pink Taco really dropped the ball last Saturday. I was here with a huge party of friends, expecting to have a wild night of margaritas followed by some serious fun at the slot machines. I even gave up my romantic reservation for two at the Paris to share some laughs with the group. Sadly, we all left this craptastic place tired and angry and headed back to our hotels. Thanks for ruining my night, Pink Taco.

My friends asked me to make up some terrible puns to express how horrendous our experience was at this place. Here goes...

*Hairful* what you order. Need I say more?

It was no *enlightening* experience. In fact, we were left *in the dark* about the whole thing. Literally. In the dark on the patio. We had to use the light of our phones to aim our forks in the right direction. Nothing more intimate than eating to the light of an iPhone.

The darkness was a real *buzz*kill. The useless battery-operated candles they gave us lasted about 3 minutes before they set off a high-pitched buzzing noise and then died (except for the ones we threw into the bushes first).

We got a *flush*, but not playing poker... In the bushes next to us, a sudden loud sound of water running was very suspicious. Since we couldn't see anything, theories ranged from someone peeing a heavy stream in the trees to a toilet flushing nearby.

We were the *butt* of someone's joke when they dropped their lit cigarette onto our table from above.

In conclusion, my puns may be awful, but our dining experience was even worse. 

They gave us a couple of pitchers of margaritas we didn't ask for and then claimed they "comped our drinks." Uh-huh.

I forgot to mention the food was meh. I didn't get halfway into my chile relleno before a friend pulled a long hair out of his mouth. Aaaaand I'm done.
