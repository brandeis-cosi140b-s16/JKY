Was here for Halloween 2012. My girlfriend and I loved this place. 
The food was more expensive than it would be if it weren't in a hotel in Vegas. But I expected that when I came in here. Its Vegas after all. 

Anyways. It was midday and we were here for "breakfast" It wasn't crowded. Got seated almost immediately. 
It is VERY pink in there. Pink tinted lights and what not. 

Had the Queso Fundido. My mouth still waters thinking about this stuff. Its like a super creamy cheesy bean dip. 

I had the burrito and it was good. I liked it. I do not remember what my girlfriend had. I think it was the Nachos. I am pretty sure that it is the Nachos. They were good I seem to remember. 

Chips and salsa were good as well. 

Overall we were very pleased with our experience here. 

Oh and the selection of Tequila was very good. I didn't have a drink here, but I saw that they did have a good selection.  

Every time we talk about Vegas, we talk about the Pink Taco and how we cant wait to go back the next time we are there.
