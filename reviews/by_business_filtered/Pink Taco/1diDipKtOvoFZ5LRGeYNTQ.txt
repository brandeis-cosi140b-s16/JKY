During a night on the strip, a friend and I sought out Pink Taco because we had a coupon (that included 18% gratuity). I liked Pink Taco's style, especially the lanterns.  We order thee odd mashed potato filled taquitos...ended up being a confusing combo. Not sure if those things are meant to go together.  I ordered chicken fajitas for my meal; not the easiest drunk food choice, but still tasty.  Service was very bland and unimpressive. Although it was just fine, there wasn't anything here that would make me want to return.
