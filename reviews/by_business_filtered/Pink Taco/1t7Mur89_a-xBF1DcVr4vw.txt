I don't know if this would be actual dinning option since there are many better ones inside the Hard Rock. But if you want a spring break style munchies meal, this is It. $.99 tacos after 10pm on Sunday nights was a good way to start your night at Body English. I came here and got 3 tacos, and a margarita for about $10 a person.  I think you can't beat this deal if you have the munchies. At least they don't serve margaritas at the drive thru.  I gotta give the Pink Taco some props for their quality service as well.  Great bar tender, and prompt service.
