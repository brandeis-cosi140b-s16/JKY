We had dinner here in May. The enchiladas were sooooo delicious. The staff is fabulous--shining personalities and they totally paid attention to us...and our near empty glasses. The place has lively, fun, flirty atmosphere. It's definitely a refreshing change from the strip. The margaritas are very tasty. Nice variety of salsas with the chips. Now I have Pink Taco cravings. It'll definitely be on my to-do list next time I visit Vegas.
