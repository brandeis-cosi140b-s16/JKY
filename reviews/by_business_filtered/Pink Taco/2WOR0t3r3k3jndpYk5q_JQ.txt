Checked in with a group that had a reservation. When we arrived they were not prepared for us and we still waited for 5 minutes to be seated, even though they were not busy and most of the tables were empty. 

Never received 2nd cocktail that was ordered. They couldn't break up the tickets for our group (less than 12 people) and that created an entire new set of issues when trying to check out. Couldn't see our own tickets to check for accuracy. Basically I ended up doubling the tip without knowing it because I NEVER SAW the actual ticket and didn't realize the gratuity was already added on. 

Waitress asked if we wanted both rice and beans and everyone ordered them, however it did NOT come with the tacos so it was actually an extra charge. I have never been to a place where rice and or beans did not come with a taco platter so I was a bit disappointed that we would be offered something that it typical comes with and then charged for it. (And no, I don't know how much they were as I couldn't see my ticket at the register) 

The chips that were provided and the chips in the Nachos were the stalest chips I have ever had a restaurant in my entire life. There is honestly NO excuse for stale chips. None. I had fried shrimp tacos and they were OK. Nothing special or memorable and the tamale was the same way. 

Side note about the restroom and this does not effect the review (in the hotel - but right by the restaurant). Ladies...beware. There is a reflection on the floor and you can see any neighboring person in their stall via the the reflection on the floor. It was a little shocking to say the least..... 

All in all, a total disappointment.
