I've been here a few times now and each time has been great! They have absolutely delicious bean & cheese chile rellenos and fyi their salmon....M-A-R-V-E-L-O-U-S (to be sung in your head)! They make you smile and gives you the happy peppermint patty sensations like on TV LOL. 

Have had the pink tacos before too and now also their wet burrito. All wonderful as the other. I've had margaritas there too (in the Century City, CA one) and they are quite tasty my friends! I can't wait to stop by here again on my next visit to Vegas :)
