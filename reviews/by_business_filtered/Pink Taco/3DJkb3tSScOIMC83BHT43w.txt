For being a restaurant inside a hotel, this spot is worth checking out.  It's almost 4 stars but the food is just too damn expensive for what it is.

Cool points for being inside the Hard Rock Hotel and maintaining the rocker vibe while still having a mexican restaurant feel.  I love the open air patio that overlooks the pool, and how the doors are open so there is a breeze inside the restaurant. More cool points for making fresh tortillas for everyone to see.

The chips and salsa comes with 3 types of salsa ... and they are all pretty good.  My chicken fajitas were very good at $15, but the portion was kinda small.

But hey, lets face it...  don't we all want to try out a place called "pink taco" ?  Good job with the name, marketing people.  Their pink taco clothing is pretty popular too - I noticed a lot of people coming in to purchase their apparel.

*final cool points for seeing Carey Hart and Joel Madden while we were there*

If I say "cool" one more time in this review I am going to make myself sick.  I need a thesaurus.
