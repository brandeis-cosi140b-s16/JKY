Honestly, I came here purely due to their sexually suggestive name. Pink Taco...hehe hehe hehe. The food was alright- I mean, it's not authentic Mexican and don't be fooled into thinking such either. Of course I ordered the "Pink Tacos" but I was kinda bummed the shells weren't hard shells- it would have totally fit the name. Props to the handmade tortillas though...

Come here just so you can say I ate at the Pink Taco...buy an inappropriate tank top while you're there too!
