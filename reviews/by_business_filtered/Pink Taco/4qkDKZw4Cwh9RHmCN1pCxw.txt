While I am a huge fan of Mexican and am always down to eat out, this place was a fun little dirty Brett Michaels meets Cancun Spring Break-nuanced experience. 
We ordered chicken tacos, enchiladas and fajitas. The food was good, nothing spectacular, but good. The margaritas were pretty strong and sugary at the same time, but I think that's what they are going for. 
Service was good, fast and accommodating. 
Cons were I could smell the cig smoke bellowing in from the open doors to the patio and pool area. It's the Hard Rock though, it's no preschool. 
There are other Mexican restaurants I prefer over Pink Taco, even if it's name is so demure.
