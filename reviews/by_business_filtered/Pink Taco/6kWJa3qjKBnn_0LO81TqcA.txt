I don't have many complaints about this place but a-ok is the feeling I left with. Myself and 4 friends arrived on Friday night for dinner and only waited about 10 minutes. The atmosphere is really loud and lively. Our waitress was quite friendly but it seemed like she was super busy so we weren't always attended to. 

The Rock Hard margarita was reallllllly sweet, a little too sweet for me but probably good if you're into that. It even came with a garnish of rock candy. My friends and I ordered the pitcher and it definitely could have been stronger. The chips and salsa were good. I ordered the Pink Tacos and although this place is pricy, I left full. It came with 3 tacos, rice and beans. The chicken had a nice flavor to it but the tortillas were a little soggy. One of my friends swears by the shrimp tacos here and another ordered the steak and shrimp fajitas which were tasty and flavorful but did not come out sizzling as fajitas should. 

Overall I'm not sure I would make this a regular stop on my Vegas trips because of the prices but I'm glad I tried it.
