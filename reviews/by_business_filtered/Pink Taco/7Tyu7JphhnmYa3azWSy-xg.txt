We ate here just before our flight and had a great experience.

Am a huge ceviche fan so we ordered ceviche, I had shrimp tacos and my BF had fish tacos. Our waitress was knowledgeable, friendly and efficient and we loved the vibe of the place. The ceviche was great, really tender and full of flavour. My shrimp tacos were amazing, I loved the avocado and the sauce in them - I would have finished them but there was just too much.

Overall great time here, perfect last supper in Vegas!
