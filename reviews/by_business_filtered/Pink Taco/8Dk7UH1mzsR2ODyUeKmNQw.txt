07/04/08 - When I first walked in I was like WTF??? A taqueria inside of the HardRock Casino??? but I gotta say the atmosphere and the vibe was awsome! Lots of hot ladies getting their buzz on and decent music makes a good combo. The Talent was HOT also!!! The hostess was looking mighty proper! On top of great service the "Panuchos" (chicken tacos with pink onions) definetely hit the spot after all the beer!  They were really good! I would definetly eat here again.
