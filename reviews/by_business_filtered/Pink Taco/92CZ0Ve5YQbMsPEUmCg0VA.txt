The appy nachos are huge and amazing. Half chicken half steak :) Love them because the chips are delicious, beans, sauce, sour cream, guacamole, meat, cheese.... so yummy!!!  The atmosphere is great - but quite noisy.  I wish the happy hour drink specials wouldn't just be in the "bar" side... considering it is the center of the whole restaurant.  Would be nice to eat at the table with guests but still get the same price for the drinks :) AND they need a little better air conditioning.. aside from that - I would go back all the time for those nachos.  Cannot wait to try the fajitas or a burrito.
