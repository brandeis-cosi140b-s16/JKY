I ate here at the Pink Taco while hanging out at the Hard Rock Hotel with friends.  Met a couple of friends of mine and we had lunch.  Service was pretty good.  I had the pink taco with a corona. My friend picked up the tab, since I was visiting Las Vegas.  Thought that was pretty cool.  The pink taco was average. Should have gotten it spicer.  The salsa was pretty good, although it could have been better.  No so disappointing was the ambiance of the restaurant.
