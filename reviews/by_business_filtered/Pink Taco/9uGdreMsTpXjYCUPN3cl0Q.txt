Really? You can't go wrong with this place. I love the atmosphere, with the big high top booths. They are not wood chairs, they are soft and squishy, so that makes you want to stay longer, and hang out. The servers were friendly. I ordered the chicken nachos, but unfortunately for me, they were a bit too spicy. I did send them back, and ordered a simple chicken caesar salad, which happened to be the best chic. caesar salad I've ever eaten. No lie. I loved the way that the grilled chic. tasted, it was amazing. So, although I didn't have a traditional mexican entree there, I did enjoy my meal very much.
