Really?  $10 for a drink, $12 for tacos......and you want to charge my table 50 cents for some more salsa for my chips?  Good example of pissing off a long time cutomer because my table seemed to like one of the salsas a little better than another........very short sighted.....food was good as always, service so so as always
