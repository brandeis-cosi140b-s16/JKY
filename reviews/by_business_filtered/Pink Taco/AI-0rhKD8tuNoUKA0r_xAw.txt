YUM! The fish tacos are so good! I ate here every day that I stayed at the Hard Rock. Then I moved to Planet Hollywood and missed it bigtime. They have a great beer selection and good cocktails too. The bartenders are friendly and helpful. The only thing I didn't like was that they close way too early for a place inside a casino in Vegas. I think they lock the doors at 11:00p, which is when most people are just starting to go out for a night of gambling and boozing. Food mixes well with both of those, so I wish they were open late like most other casino restaurants. There is another place in The Hard Rock that stays open 24 hours, but it's not nearly as good as the Pink Taco.
