Two words: Chicken Nachos. Try it & you won't regret it. I'll admit, I have noticed that the portion size of the chicken nachos has gotten smaller over the years, but it still tastes great. Don't forget dessert... deep fried ice cream, enough said.

Service here is also good. There has been one instance when I ordered to-go & the order was done wrong, so we took it right back. Overall, Pink Taco is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas.
