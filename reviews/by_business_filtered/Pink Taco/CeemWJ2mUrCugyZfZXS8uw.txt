Cool location and atmosphere.  I wasn't too impressed with my food however.  Guacamole with veggies was rockstar however my chicken burrito wet was the opposite and the chicken inside was quite dry.  I think with a little more marinading the chicken could have been great.  The margarita selection is good as well as many great tequilas.  I would return but order something else.
