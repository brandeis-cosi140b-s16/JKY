Admittedly, I was completely plastered when I came to eat here but I have to say my tacos were AMAZING!!! After chugging down 30 oz. of pure alcohol at Rehab, Pink Taco seriously hits the spot. Their chips and salsa is also so delicious! i couldn't pick out a favorite salsa, they all have their own unique taste. Though it's far from the strip, I think I would definitely come back to eat here. Mexican food always hits the spot after drinking.
