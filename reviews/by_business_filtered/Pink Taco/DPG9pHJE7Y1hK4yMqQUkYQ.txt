I ate at a lot of places during vacation but this was one of the worst! Service was okay which is the ONLY reason this is getting two stars. 
The food is worth maybe 1 1/2 stars. 
Started with nachos which were okay.. Nothing to write home about. Standard. Greasy. Needed heat.
For my drink I chose a horchata which tasted like a cheap premade mix which was disappointing for a $15 drink. It was also supposed to be rimmed with cinnamon sugar.. It came out without the rimmed glass so I asked about it and the waitress said it was on the glass.. Which is wasn't at all. 
Then the horrible meal- breakfast burrito. Was supposed to have beans and peppers and onions.. When it came out it was a mush burrito with eggs and beans only. Literally felt like I was having baby food. Again with the inconsistency in the menu. Two ingredients were just missing from my burrito. Unfortunately, it was inedible and I sent it back. Manager was pretty friendly about it and explained that they were going through a menu change so maybe that's why all the variations from the menu? I don't know. There are WAY better places than here! Take the time to look and save yourself some aggravation.. Unless you like ordering one thing and getting something different!
