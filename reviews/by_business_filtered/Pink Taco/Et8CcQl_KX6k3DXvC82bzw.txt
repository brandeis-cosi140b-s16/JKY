A client in Vegas asked if I could meet again for lunch.  Given my dislike of the first experience at dinner, I was really hesitant to come back.  Maybe the second time was the charm, as the tortilla soup and sweet corn tamales hit all the right notes this trip, and the guacamole was very fresh, striking the right balance between creamy and chunky.
