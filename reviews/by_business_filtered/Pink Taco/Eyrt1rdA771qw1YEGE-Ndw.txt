It was my first time to Pink Taco and it was pretty good.

The carne asada tasted great.  A bit more pricey than your usual Mexican Restaurant but the service and atmosphere was good.  

It was cool that they give us chips and four different salsas.  and the best thing is...once you're done you can go to the casino and gamble.
