I love this place! We spent a week at the HRH/C in October and ended up inside the Pink Taco everyday for one reason or another. Great margaritas, perfect atmosphere, and being so close to the pool the people watching is as delicious as the nachos. In my hometown there is a mexican joint every half block and for what you get for the price it is in my top two of all time.
