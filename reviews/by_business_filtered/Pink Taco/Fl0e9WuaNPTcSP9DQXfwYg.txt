My husband and I always make a trip to Pink Taco when we come to Vegas. We love this place! The food is great -- we have never had a bad meal! My husband gets the carne asada with beans and I usually get the chicken enchiladas or chile rellano. The steak nachos are to die for and we sometimes eat that as a meal alone. And the bean dip is excellent if you like black beans!
