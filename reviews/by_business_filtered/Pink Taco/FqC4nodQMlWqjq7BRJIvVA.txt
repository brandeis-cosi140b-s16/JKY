I've eaten here a number of times over the years, and it seems to me to have gone down hill lately.  My buddy and I ate here today on the way to the airport.  

The food:

The chips and salsa were a waste of time.  The chips tasted stale.

The dinner salads were pretty forgettable, too.  They arrived smothered in vinaigrette dressing.

Well before we had a chance to finish the salads, the entrees hit the table.  If the salads had been worth finishing, that would have meant cold entrees.  We both ordered carne asada tacos.  I've had better tacos at Del Taco (fast food for those unfamiliar with the chain).  The tacos were served with rice and beans, neither of which tasted all that great.  

The service:  

The service was clumsy in my opinion.  The wait staff seemed far to eager to remove plates from the table.  For example, a member of the wait staff reached over me to snatch my unfinished salad off the table.  If a shortage of plates is the problem, buy some more plates for God's sake.    

Our waitress didn't seem to be a good listener.  We told her at the outset we were finished with our trip and on our way to the airport.  Nevertheless, at the conclusion of our meal she offered desert and when we declined bid us an enjoyable vacation.
