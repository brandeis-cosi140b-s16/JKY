I stayed at the Hard Rock for my bday and ended up eating here everyday of my stay! The first day me and the bf shared appetizers and the last day there I ordered the pink taco dish, which was the bomb! The meat was tender and the pickled...(iforget) was pretty tasty too. 

The chips ans salsa were great and I love the different varities of salsas :) We sat at the outside patio, so we had a lil view of the pool area where Rehab is. Overall the service was pretty good ( better the 2nd time) and the food was great :)
