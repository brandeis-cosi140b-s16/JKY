Got there in time for happy hour, buy one get one beers/margharitas and 1/2 priced apps. Enjoyed some Dos Equis and some munchies. I had the app sampler which consisted of
2 tamales- small little tamales with corn inside- not bad
2 taquitos filles with cheese- pretty tasty
2 Chicken skewers that had some tastyness to them
cheese quesadilla which is basic but a spread some quacamole on and they were pretty killer
2 carne asada skewers that were my favorite had some kick ass flavors..
can't wait to go back for some tacos...
