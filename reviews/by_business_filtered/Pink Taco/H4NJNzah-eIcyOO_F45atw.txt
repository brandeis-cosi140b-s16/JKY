The food here is great. The service "not so much". Their salsa is weak, but if you ask, they have a habanero salsa that will satisfy the chile head in you. Huge portions. This place is good. But only rates 3 stars due to lack of service. They don't take reservations either. If you're staying at HR & want Mexican, it's a no brainer.
