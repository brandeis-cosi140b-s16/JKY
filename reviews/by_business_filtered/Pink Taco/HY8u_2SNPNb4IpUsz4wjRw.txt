For as long as i remember, I've always made it a point to stop and grab a meal here when I'm in Vegas. The location isn't too hard to find as it is in the Hard Rock Hotel. Atmosphere of the place is on the hip, rocker side. Some attractive guests and hostesses. 

The selection of tequila and speciality drinks are really good. If you wanna try a particular tequila, this is a good place to try ones you may not of heard of. My particular favs would be Tequila Corralejo and Casa Noble. The Mi Casa margarita on the rocks is a great starter. 

My main food order is usually the tacos. Either the carne asada, carnitas or the fish. The salsa is really good to with tortialla chips which are a bit on the thicker side so it has a nice crunch to it.
