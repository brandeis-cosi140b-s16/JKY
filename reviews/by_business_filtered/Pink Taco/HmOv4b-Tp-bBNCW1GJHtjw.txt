I jst went there today with my friend for dinner.  The salsa for the chips and the coke was good.  The service was the absolute worse.  Someone other than the server delivered our food and when my friend wanted salsa for his tacos because they were dry, she never came by at all. He had to eat them dry because they were gettin cold.  I had the burrito and it was jst average.  I started out with the tortilla soup which was disgusting.  it tasted like red pepper which it did have inside but ewww i ordered tortilla soup not red pepper soup.  i sent that back.  My friend and I were jst very mad because our server ruined his meal by never ever coming to check on us so we could ask for salsa.  We were especially mad when we realized she was busy texting by the hostess stand the whole time.  Obviously this place does not have a supervisor around.  Oh and the music was horrible.  so bad. it was demonic or sumtin.  Needless to say me and friend decided we were never ever coming back again. like ever.
