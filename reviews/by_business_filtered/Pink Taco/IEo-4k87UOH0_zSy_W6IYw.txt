I wasn't overly impressed. I wasn't disgusted. I was, however, hung over and grateful for the immediate arrival of chips and salsa and the water. Thre rest of the meal was unremarkable, except I remember thinking that the portions were pretty hefty (maybe it was also the fact that I had gone to Hash House A Go Go for breakfast and was still semi-comatose from that). Service was attentive... I never had to chase anyone down for more water (which was obviously desperately needed by that point). OH, and we saw the cast of the Real World LV walk in while we were paying the bill (we were there last November).
I'll definitely have to try it when we head back in May... and not already be ridiculously full when I go!
