It is what is.. I am for sure a fan of the sweet corn tamales, and I have had them many times at Pink Taco over the years. Drinks are descent and happy hour is a good time to check it all out. It's one of the only spots at the Hard Rock that has any draw for me. I'd put it just above MR. Luckys 24/7 but far below Culinary Dropout or Nobu. (and I'd rather go CDO than Nobu anytime :) 

Given the limited choices at HRH it's usually between Pink Taco or Culinary Dropout. I only go to Mr. Luckys for their Fire Roasted Nachos.. Things have changed over there... 

Anyway, drop into Pink Taco if you need a "Mexican" style food fix :) Happy Eating!
