OK, my step mom has been going here for years, and she has said on numerous occasions that she will never go back. First of all, the waitress very rude and barely came to our table. This may be because we had a larger party, but there was no reason for the way we were treated. When we walked out we heard one of the hostesses whisper "bi***" to my Stepmother. Not ok. I guess i would have understood a little bit if my Stepmother was actually being rude, but that just wasn't the case. 

Another thing is the food. I got chicken skewers, which were supposed to be really good, but apparently they had changed the recipe or something. They tasted like something i had never tasted before, and that is not a good thing. The mashed potato taquitos could maybe feed a mouse, if it was small. not worth the money by any means at all. The only good things about this place were the chips, and the tortillas. 

there are so many other places in Vegas that will treat you the way you should be treated, and have food that actually tastes good. Don't waste your time or money, and go somewhere else. We would  have had a better Mexican food experience by going to Taco Bell.
