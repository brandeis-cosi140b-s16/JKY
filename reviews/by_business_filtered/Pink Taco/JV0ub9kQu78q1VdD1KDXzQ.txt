Alright, enough political crap that I had to get off my chest.  Let's talk Vegas.

Only been to the Pick Taco once, but it was really good.  The Hard Rock has a fun presence and I'm looking forward to checking out their new poker room/lounge on my next visit.  The Pink Taco is worth the trip alone though.
