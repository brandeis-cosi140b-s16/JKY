Yummy. I love Mexican food, so I knew this place would be right up my alley. Fun atmosphere, friendly servers, and strong margaritas! How can you go wrong?! We ordered the app sampler - I only had the tamale, but it was awesome. It also came with quesadillas, chicken and carne asada skewers and a couple other items. Loved all three of the salsas that were served. With so many great options I had a hard time deciding what to order, but landed on the chicken enchiladas and was not disappointed. Cleaned my plate and left feeling like a complete fatty, but thoroughly satisfied!
