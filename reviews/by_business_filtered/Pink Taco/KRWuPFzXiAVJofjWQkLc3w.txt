B+ for drinks; B- for food; A for great looking girls

Now, let it be known - I am a big fan of Pink Taco. But, as the locations have slowly closed around the western US, this location is my least favorite.  Not sure why they don't carry the best thing: BRISKET TACOS -- the other locations had it, and the Century City location still carries it.  OMG - it's the best!

I've been 5-6 times to this location at the Hard Rock.  The food is just okay, nothing great.  They do have great chips & salsa, delicious margaritas, but food - eh.  This is a great hangout, though.  Always good to pop into before/after a concert or a night out with friends.

Rumor has it, their website states, that a sunset strip location in Hollywood is coming soon!  Bring it, and bring it soon with the Brisket tacos!  Other locations may be San Diego and Miami.
