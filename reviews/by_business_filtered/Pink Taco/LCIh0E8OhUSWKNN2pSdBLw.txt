After hearing everyone and their brother go on about how excellent Pink Taco is, I have to say that there must be another one somewhere else in town that's good.

The food wasn't bad, but it wasn't that good, either. It was average. The waitstaff was okay. The mediocre food came out quickly.

There are much better places in town.
