love, love, love this place.  The food is amazing and the service is even better.  I opted for the pink taco plate with chicken tacos.  The deep fried shells along with the grilled chicken, pickled onions, and avocado make for a great combination.  The chips are fresh and non-greasy and the salsa has just the right amount of spiciness.  Service wise, the staff was constantly checking to make sure I had everything I needed and that my food was to my liking.  I dine often but rarely get this attentiveness of service.
