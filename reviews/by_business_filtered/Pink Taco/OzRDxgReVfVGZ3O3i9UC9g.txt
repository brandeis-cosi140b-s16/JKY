i tried the chips and salsa they give u before you get your meal. The Guacemole Salsa was amazing.

then my food came out
The Tortilla was good. The Meat was bland...to put it simple...it sucked. My drunk brother even thought it was awful.

Sorry Pink Taco, better luck next time
look on the bright side
the salsa is good?

I gave 2 stars cause the Salsa was that damn  good
