First things first: The diablo salsa is AWESOME!!  It doesn't come with the regular chips and salsa, you have to ask for it.  If you are a chili head, this is the only way to go!!

Their Happy Hour (4-7pm) is fantastic!  I'd be hard pressed to find another place where two people can eat and drink (even if our beer is NA) for $12.  The specials are only available at the bar but get there early so you get a seat.
