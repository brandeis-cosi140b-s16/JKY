Chips were not fresh very stale! Salsa was okay! Our waiter Dominique was very nice and helpful. Me and my girlfriend ordered tacos steak was okay, pastor was like chicken but okay. Now the shrimp tacos Were the best! Fish taco was alright! Then we had this couple that couldn't stop staring it was annoying!!! Thanks hard rock for the coupon! overall it was okay.
