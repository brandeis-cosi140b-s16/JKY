What kind of shitty food is this?

Steak fajitas - chewy tough pieces of steak weren't what I wanted for dinner but that was what I was served. Bummer. As I'm not a fan of tortillas, I only tasted it and thought it was as bland and tasteless as can be. 

Ceviche - dry, overly acidic, bland. Tasted like old fish. Cutting back on the lime juice on this item would do it some good. 

Baja fish tacos - once again, way to go Pink Tacos. You're awesome at serving smelly dry tasting fish. 

The only good item throughout the whole night was the guacamole. 

Don't waste your money eating here.
