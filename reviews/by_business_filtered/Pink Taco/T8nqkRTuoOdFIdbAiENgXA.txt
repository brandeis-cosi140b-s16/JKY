It helps to actually be hungry when you come in. Or drunk. (Usually, with me, the two go hand-in-hand)
Since we were staying at the Hard Rock, we ended up here a couple times for the 4-7 happy hour. Half off select apps and 2 for 1 margaritas (rocks, not blended, hollerrrr!)... after sight-seeing all day with a couple drinks in hand, nibbles and tequila ALWAYS sound like a hit to me. The love and I shared things like the appetizer platter (sweet corn tamales, chicken and steak skewers, cheese quesadilla and taquitos), the chicken nachos (my absolute fave) and the queso bean dip (don't judge us, we were drunk and starving!). The chips and three different types of salsa were always welcomed with open arms... I could probably be happy eating just those. The bartenders were friendly and on it with the refills (which is a MUST for happy hour, otherwise that's a not-so-happy hour for me).
Is this somewhere I would pick to eat while sober or not staying at the hotel? Probably not. Was it a lifesaver while staying at the Hard Rock? Undeniably. Hence, four stars. Should I stay at the Hard Rock again, I can see me sitting up at the bar, playing that video blackjack with a margarita in hand and chips sticking out of my mouth. (there may or may not be a picture in existence that holds true to that imagery....)
