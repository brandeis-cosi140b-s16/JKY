We shared an order of chicken tamales and got a basket of chips with 3 different salsas. 

The total: $3.78. 

Service was okay, but we had to wait 20 minutes to get our check. 

Be warned - this place is super loud, so if you aren't a fan of screaming to talk to your dining companion across the table, you might want to avoid. 

However, if you're looking for a cheap HH place and you happen to be staying at the HRH, this is the place to go.
