I was going to rate them with two stars till I went back to my hotel at the Embassy Suites and got a better free margarita than what I just paid top dollar at Pink Taco.  The food was half a step above Chili's. I hate Chili's!  Hard rock is supposed to be a cool place to visit.  One really cool thing is good food.  They missed the mark big time.  Stale corn chips with salsa is a crime.  We may need to get Gordon Ramsey to do an emergency kitchen nightmares.  It's all about the basics.  Bacon wrapped jalape√±os sounded great but missed the mark.  Chili  reallano was a big chunk of greasy cheese.  Not good. Will never go back.
