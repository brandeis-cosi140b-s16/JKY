This is my favorite Mexican restaurant by far. Whenever I'm in Vegas I always make sure to eat here, and buy a souvenir tank top. Love the decor and murals painted on the walls outside. Waitresses are always friendly,  and food is always prepared quickly. I have typically always eaten lunch or dinner here and have loved everything I've ever ordered, however,  my latest visit was for brunch and although my chilaquiles were good, they weren't quite as delicious as expected. I was a bit let down with that dish. But their cocktails are always good,  the bloody maria and the horchata colada don't disapoint.
