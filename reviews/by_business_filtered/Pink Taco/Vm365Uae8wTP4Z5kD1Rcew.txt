I came here on a lunch date with one of my friends. I really loved the ambiance, it was so Earthy and pretty. The hot pink sign in the front made it all the more better.

We got chips and salsa. They didn't have pico de gallo, but they did have 3 different sauces to try. It was mediocre, would've been better with pico de gallo though. 

We wanted to have room left over for dessert so we decided to split the appetizer platter which included sweet corn tamales, cheese quesadillas, chicken skewers, carne asada skewers, taquitos and guacamole. It was more than enough for both of us and it was all really tasty. 

After our food, we ordered fried ice cream and Churros  dusted with cinnamon sugar and served with chocolate cream. Both were to die for!

I had a nice time here. I'd love to come back.
