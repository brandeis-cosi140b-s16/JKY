Pink Taco at the Hard Rock is a fun place to go to for Mexican food.  They had a great selection to choose from, the atmosphere is just what you would expect from Hard Rock and the food is great!

Pros: I like to go there when I am friends or on a date.  The chips are made fresh there and served hot with 3 different salsas to choose from.  The service has been good every time we go...not amazing but nothing to complain about.

Cons: This is not a place I would take kids to.  Although I have seen kids in there, I probably wouldn't take my kids only because the music is so loud and the environment is made more for the adults.
