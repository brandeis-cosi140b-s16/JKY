After I got over being a 14 year-old and laughing at the name, I really enjoyed my food here.

The portion size was VERY big (wasn't able to finish my rice and beans), and I probably could have avoided the chips (which are pink) and salsa before had to save room...  But either way, I was happy.

The service was friendly and prompt, and the atmosphere was OK as well.

The tables were a little awkward for me (the height of the seats in relation to the floor and the table was weird), and the environment was extremely dark, so I'm giving it a 4/5 this time around.
