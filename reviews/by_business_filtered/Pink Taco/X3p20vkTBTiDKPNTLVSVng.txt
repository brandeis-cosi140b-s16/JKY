Good, fresh, mexican in a fun environment. Staff is always pleasant even when dealing with tons of drunks. The food can be kind of heavy but that comes with the territory. It's also a bit expensive to standard mexican restaurants but I think you're paying more for the experience in which case I think the price is worth it.
