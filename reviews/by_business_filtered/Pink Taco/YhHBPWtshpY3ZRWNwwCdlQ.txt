Pink taco used to be one of my favorite restaurants to come to , when I came this last week for lunch I was disappointed because our server only gave us one (red salsa )when usually they bring you three different kinds, the green avocado was the best ! He told us they don't make them anymore .  Um okay ,Bummer . That was one of the main reasons I loved this place . Service was okay , and I wasn't impressed by the food . The portions were small for the price and the quality of our meals were just subpar .
