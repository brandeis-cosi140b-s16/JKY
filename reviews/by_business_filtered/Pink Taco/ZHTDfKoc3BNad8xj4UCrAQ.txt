What can I say? I Heart Pink Taco!!

While staying at the Hard Rock, I stumbled upon Pink Taco while feeling ravenous after an awesome day at the pool. 

I scanned the menu full of enticing entrees and finally settled on the Pink Taco Entree. I wanted something solid and an entree with the same name as the restaurant is most likely the best meal on the menu. 

I was not disappointed.  

it comes with three delicious soft shell tacos, beans, and rice. The tacos were full of flavor and so juicy. I dabbed some hot sauce over it and I was in absolute heaven. 

We all loved it so much, my group and I ate there four more times during our trip!!
