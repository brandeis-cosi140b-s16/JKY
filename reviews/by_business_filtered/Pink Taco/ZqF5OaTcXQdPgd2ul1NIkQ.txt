Let's face it.... the name is the only good thing about this place.  I was pretty disappointed in the hype for this place and it honestly wasn't much better than a Chili' restaurant.
They did have fresh baked chips and dip.  There were three kinds of dip which was nice.  But the food was really just average.
Maybe if I had more to drink I would have enjoyed it more.  I don't really have any desire to go back
