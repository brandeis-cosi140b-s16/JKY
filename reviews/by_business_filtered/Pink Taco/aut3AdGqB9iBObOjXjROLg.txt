This was a nice place to have lunch after a long night out.  The food was better than I expected and the service was good! Recommendation for bachelorette parties: throw a lingerie bridal shower here - it's the perfect (appropriately named) place! That's what we did and it was awesome (although maybe a little embarrassing for the bride)!
