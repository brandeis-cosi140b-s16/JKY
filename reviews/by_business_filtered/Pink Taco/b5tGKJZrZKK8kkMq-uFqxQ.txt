This is just a phenomenal place and the service is super. This place is on fire. Great decor. The bar tenders and wait staff are literally running to make sure the food reach your table warm and fresh.They make all the tortillas and tortillas chips in house. Comes to your table warm. Totally delish was the lobster taco served with the lobster cooked and served in its shell and the Bacon wrapped stuffed jalape√±os. Can't say enough about the Diablo Nachos made with Scorpion chili cheese sauce and habanero beans. It will set you on fire but the burn it great. Make sure to order with cold beer. Big shout out to the bar tender Brian who was doing an amazing job.
