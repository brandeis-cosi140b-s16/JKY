I don't exactly go to Vegas for tacos/chips-and-salsa, but I had a yearning for crunch, dips, and tacos.  So we drove out in the 115-degree weather, and landed at the Hard Rock Hotel's Pink Taco.  

Upon entering the restaurant, you're not only greeted with the retro-looking swinging bulbs (made of empty half-beer bottles), but smothered by a whif of fresh corn tortillas on a hot-grill.  Thank goodness there was a piece of glass between myself and the lady making the fresh corn tortillas, because I would have been the first to reach over and grab a freshly made tortilla from the grill.  

Once seated, the server brings this trio of salsas.  I was not properly introduced to this trio by names, so I created my own: Smokey, Green one, and Spicy.  All three had their unique flavors that targeted all different levels of heat on my flavor-chart.  My only complaint: they should have buckets instead of ramekins.  Perhaps a straw too? 

It was like speed-dating, when the next item decided to steal my attention - why hello, carne asada tacos.  The chopped onions and bits of cilantro nestled so cozily in between the chunks of steak, all basking with such glory on the fresh corn tortillas.  I almost didn't see the rice blending-in with the orange fiesta-style plate, perhaps because the creamy black beans were crowding their space.  Everything had so much flavor and presence, one fork was not utensil-enough to assist in this meal.  But really, please bring a bucket of the salsa trio, as I would like each of the three tacos to be accompanied by even more flavor-goodness. 

Four stars for the flavor, price, and speed of service.  When you're in Vegas, you want good food (that booze from last night isn't sitting so well right now is it?), at a good price (because the rest of the money was left at the tables), and fast service (so you can get back to the tables and claim what's yours to begin with!)
