This is one of my favorite places in Vegas and a place I try to visit whenever I'm in town.  The food was awesome (as it always is) but the normally excellent service was lacking this time.  

It was very clear that our server, Jessica, had better places to be than be at work doing her job.  She was rude and I will make sure that she never serves me again.
