After landing in Vegas for a little getaway with my boyfriend.. and getting settled into our room.. we decided we wanted a beer and lunch... and then a nap so we could stay up and party all night.. Vegas style. We got to Pink Taco just in time for Happy Hour. They have a very good happy hour menu. We did order off the regular menu. I had been to the Pink Taco  in Scottsdale, AZ, prior to it's closing, a few times, so I knew the menu a bit, and love the pink tacos. We ordered those , the queso and a sampler appetizer plate. The appetizer plate was full of appetizer...a quesadilla, carne asada skewers, chicken tikki skewers, taquitos (which are so different here I LOVE!!).. the queso bean dip was too much and lacking in spice for us.. We kept adding hot sauce to it.. as well as the salsa that comes with the chips. BUT this is a great happy hour with 2 for 1 beers.. we even came back again during our stay. Be ready for that nap after your Mexican carb overload!
