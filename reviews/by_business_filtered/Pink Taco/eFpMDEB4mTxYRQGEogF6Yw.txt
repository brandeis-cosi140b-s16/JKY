I recently had my first experience at Pink Taco and I was completely satisfied.  The Mexican-American restaurant is located inside the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino.  The restaurant is within walking distance from the famous Rehab pool and gives you an opportunity to get away from loud party and get a bite to eat.

The dimly lit cantina has a nice Mexican aesthetic to it and is very warm and welcoming.  I needed to get away from the XFANZ Expo and was wanting a bite to eat, so I headed towards the restaurant and bar.  I opted to try an appetizer and I went for the house made guacamole and chips.  I accompanied the guacamole with an ice cold Corona, which only seemed appropriate.  Within a few minutes, my fresh guacamole and chips were delivered. 

My initial reaction was that the guacamole was good, but not great.  However, I added a splash of their house salsa into the guac and it really kicked it up a notch and made it much more flavorful and delicious. The three house salsas were mouthwatering and varied from a non-spicy salsa to a lightly spiced salsa and lastly a spicy salsa.  Two Coronas later and the guacamole in my stomach and I was a happy customer.  I highly suggest checking out Pink Taco if you're at the Hard Rock; I'll definitely be back to try other items from their menu.
