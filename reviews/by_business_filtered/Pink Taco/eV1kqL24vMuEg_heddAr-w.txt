I'll give it 3/5 because the bar is cool and the waitstaff attentive.  It is what you would expect at the HR.  Way over priced food and drinks.  I had the "Pink Taco" al carte.  About the size of a coaster; maybe three bites - 5 dollars.  OK, but you will get more taste at On the Border, or your local Tex Mex eatery.  5 dollar bottle beers; domestic; no draft beer - at a rock joint?  Good for younger tatted hipsters with money to burn.
