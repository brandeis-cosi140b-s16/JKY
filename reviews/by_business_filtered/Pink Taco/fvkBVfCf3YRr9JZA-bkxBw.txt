Good service is hard to find these days. 6 minutes waiting to be seated, 20 minutes waiting for chips and salsa (26 min so far), 10 minutes to get water to put fire out in my mouth (36 min into dinner we finally got water), 20 minutes after that the waitress takes order of people sitting next to us who got there 20 minutes after us (56 min now). believe me or not, finally got food an hour and a half after being there.
When we finally ate, the food was ok, little bland, but ok.
