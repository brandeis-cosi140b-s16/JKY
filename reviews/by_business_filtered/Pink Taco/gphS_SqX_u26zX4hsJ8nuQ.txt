Pretty darn good. Fresh, fun and delicious.

The tortillas are all homemade in the front of the restaurant and are awesome! The chips are also fresh and very good.

The pink tacos are pretty original with pink onions (pickled?) beans and grilled chicken. They come with rice and beans. I didn't care for the rice  - it was pretty tasteless and boring.
