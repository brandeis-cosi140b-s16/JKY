Great ambience! Delicious food! Margarita... Ehh not so good. Margaritas are my go to drink and I couldn't quite put my finger on what was wrong here but it was not very good. The food on the other hand was delicious which bumps my rating up to 4 stars. The Carne Asada Fries were delicious and you can't beat $6 at happy hour.  We also had the Chicken Taquitos and I give them a thumbs up as well.
