Enjoyed happy hour here, since I saw they had fantastic deals online and we were staying at the hotel. It was pretty empty when we came in but service was fast and friendly. We ordered waaayyyy too much, 2 for 1 beers, nachos and their sampler along with the delicious chips & salsa. We had dinner reservations a few hours later and we totally spoiled our appetite. Nice flavors as far as the items we tried.
