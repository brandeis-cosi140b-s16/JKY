LOVED this place.
Amazing food, and a fantastic name--how could you go wrong??
The guacamole was so bomb-tastic that it made up for the lack of prickly pear taste in my prickly pear margarita.

If you're thinking "I don't know, let's just got to Rare 120..." DON'T! Or "maybe we should just got to Mr. Lucky's..." Unless it's 4am and you're plastered, NO WAY!

Pink Taco all the way.
It''s good for the food, the strong margaritas and the jokes later about how you ate Pink Taco for dinner.
