This place was OK... i hadn't eaten all day so I decided to come down here and sit at the bar by myself at around 6:00 PM to get some food in me.  Mexican food I guess... I ordered the grilled salmon dish... came with some grilled veggies and some potatoey mash and some kind of glaze... it was good.  not great, not bad.. just OK... overpriced I guess, but everything in Vegas is...the salsa that comes w/ the free chips was really weak.. they give you 3 salsas and they were all weak.  Nothing really special about this place.... kinda what you expect from a Vegas-hotel mexican place.
