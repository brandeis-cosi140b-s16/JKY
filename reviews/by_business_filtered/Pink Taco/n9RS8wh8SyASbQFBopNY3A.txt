I had wanted to eat here for the longest time!! We finally did it! first, let me just tell you I love the decor here! It is bright and full of mexican folk art. they even have a mini zonkey at the door to take pics with! The patio has awesome murals all over it. it also has an amazing view of the pool area because in case you don't know this restaurant is located in the hard rock hotel. the souvenirs here at pink taco are super cool, too. Unfortunately, the food and service are just mediocre. The chips were stale the beverages were not refilled. my husbands carnitas were just a small portion though flavorful. props on the homemade tortillas, however. My chile relleno was large and fresh, not canned chile pepper wrapped in breading. in conclusion folks come here for a tank or a magnet skip the so- so food.
