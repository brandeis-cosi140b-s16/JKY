This is one of my favourite places to eat at ever!

The food is so amazing with lots of flavour and they give you good portions as well. They are super generous with their meat portions too like their steak nachos (my go-to order always!). 
My mum isn't a fan of Mexican food much, but she can't get enough of this place! That says A LOT to me!!


Staff is super friendly as well! This place is great to go to especially after a concert at the casino. It's not super close to the gambling machines so you don't have to worry about cigarette smoke nearby.

Regardless, it's worth the drive!
