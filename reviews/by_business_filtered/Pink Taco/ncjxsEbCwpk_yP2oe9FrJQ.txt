Was in town for a visit, and my brother said we had to stop at this Mexican restaurant before the Linkin Park concert. Holy cow, what a nice joint! Awesome Guacamole, and the most thirst quenching Margaritas! They make a lot of stuff from scratch. The memorabilia and decor is cool! While we were there we met Hollywood Actor and Director Kevin Smith. Nice place!
