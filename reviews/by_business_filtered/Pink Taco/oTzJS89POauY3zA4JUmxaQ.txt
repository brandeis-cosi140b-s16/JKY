I would give this a 4.5 star rating, but they're still a tad bit pricey. But we've been coming here from the beginning and this is my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. The fish tacos are perfect!!! They offer lots of different options of food and how it's prepared.  
We've always had great service every time we come here. But we had awesome service from our waitress, Lahaina. She was able to answer questions about the menu and was very attentive. 

The best part about PT are the drinks. They jazzed up their menu, but I love the make it pink option with chambord. I got the vanilla pineapple infused margarita.  

We will definitely be back!
