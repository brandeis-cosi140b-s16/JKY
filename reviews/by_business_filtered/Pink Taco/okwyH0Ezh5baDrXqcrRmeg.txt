OMG, where do I start? The atmosphere is sooo cool; it fits nicely in the Hard Rock Hotel. It doesn't get any more rock and roll meets cool mexican restaurant.

The service is fantastic! The food is amazing! You have to try the sweet corn tamales! When we travel, I don't like to eat at the same places because I want to experience more, but we ate here 3 times on our last trip to vegas! It can get expensive, especially with cocktails, but overall, awesome and worth the money!
