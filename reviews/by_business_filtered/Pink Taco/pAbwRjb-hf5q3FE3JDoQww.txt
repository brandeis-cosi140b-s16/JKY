Yeah, the name is "clever" in that dickhead, frat boy way... but the place is merely a somewhat cooler version of Hooters.  Since I was in Vegas for work and didn't have time to f*ck around getting grub, I ate here twice during my Vegas work week since I was staying at the Hard Rock Hotel (where this PT is located).

On my first visit the service sucked... I had to wait forever to get a menu and I was only able to order because a waitress who wasn't assigned to my area was nice enough to deal with me.  I ordered the Baja fish tacos (natch) and they were rather light on the fish.  Pink Taco ain't no Rubio's, but at least even they couldn't f*ck up a Corona.

The second time I ate there the service was better.. My co-workers and I happened to venture in during Happy Hour, which meant 2-for-1 beers and appetizers.  Not bad... I once again ordered the Baja fish tacos and they were still rather light on the fish.. but since we were paying via an expense account they did the job.

Pink Taco is like the chicks you see in Vegas:  Attractive in that slutty, tramp stamp way that makes a Motley Crue song relevant, but not something I'd pay for with my own money at home.
