The Pink Taco was pretty good.  I had the panuchos which are their signature dish.  I wasn't expecting the flavor to be so good.  My first bite of rice was sort of bland, but when I started eating the beans and the tacos the rice was perfect.  It complemented the rest of the food.  The tacos are "pink" tacos because of the pickled onions added to the top.

I had a pomegranate margarita martini.  It was very good!

I would go back if I happened to be staying at the Hard Rock again.  It was quick, easy, and tasty.  I'll have to check the Happy Hour specials next time.
