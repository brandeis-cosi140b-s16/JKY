My buddy and I tend to eat here on our Vegas outbound travel days.  We do this because it's a convenient stop on the way to the airport.  We don't do this because the food is great (it isn't) and we don't do this because the service is great (it isn't).  I think the food is meh and the prices are high for what they serve.  We need to find a better place to eat on the way to the airport.
