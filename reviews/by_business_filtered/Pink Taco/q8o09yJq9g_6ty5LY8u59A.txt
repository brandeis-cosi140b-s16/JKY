If you are staying at the Hard Rock Hotel, this is a great place to grab a seat at the bar and have some chips and salsa.

The food is pretty good too for Mexican Food in a Casino Hotel.  Nothing like a shot of tequila, a cerveza and some tacos to start or end your night in Vegas.  This hotel has some great food places inside.

I love going solo here, so I do not have to wait for a table.  I just want to sneak into the bar and get my food.
