Something about the corn tortillas at Pink Taco has me hooked! There is someone making them fresh in the front of the Restaurant and it always makes me so hungry watching them! 

When I eat here, I order the three small corn tortilla chicken tacos with cheese, and a chipotle chicken tamale. The tamales are to die for and I CRAVE them from time to time! 
The chips and salsa are also really yummy. 

Sometimes the service is a little slow when it's not busy, and we had to ask for silverware last time. But that's understandable from time to time as long as the food is delicious. We also came in with a stroller and the hostess tried seating us at t high top table, which I assumed since she was a younger girl she didn't understand that we would need a regular table and chairs. 

We will certainly come back!
