I was so disappointed by this place. First, the decor is pretty cool. A very laid back atmosphere with picnic table type tables in part of the restaurant. 

I ordered the bean and queso dip, some chicken skewers and the fried ice cream. The food was fairly flavor-less. The fried ice cream was a complete let down. The service was extremely average. Add all of these things together and I would probably swing by for a late night if I had to soak up some alcohol...but that would be it. It just was nott that good.
