Food -  average. Pink Taco dish was decent, greasy like a TJ Taco Truck, also small in size, but with the slow service, drinks, rice and beans you'll likely be ready to move onto the pool

Service -  below average, slow like watching paint dry
Drinks - below average. We had to send back a bloody mary or two because she tasted funny. And the shots of Brandy(to fix my cold, of course), took forever!
