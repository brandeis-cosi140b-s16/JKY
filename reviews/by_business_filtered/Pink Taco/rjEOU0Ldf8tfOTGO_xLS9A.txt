I completely forgot to add my review for this place after coming back from my recent Vegas trip...  Anyways it is super delicious, they definitely meet the mark for taste and quality.  They make their own tortillas!!  It's awesome and they are fluffy and off the hook.  Right when you walk in you see the lady behind the counter whippin' up some fresh tortillas.  They bring you chips with 3 different salsas to try... the avocado one is the best!  The corn tamales are a must; the cream that comes with it is OMG sooo goood!...  I think it's sour cream and butter mixed together.   OH, and if you add the two together... the avocado salsa and the cream...  OH WOW!!  I put on everything I ate...mmmmmm.  Yes it was good, very good!
