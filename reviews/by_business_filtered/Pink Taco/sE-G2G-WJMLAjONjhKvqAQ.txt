We got there for lunch because our hotel stay let us choose one of the restaurants to eat at Pink Taco was the only one that was opened for lunch and it was packed in there, no surprise to me because I bet half the people their had the same deal as us! 

Anyways when we finally got seat the food took forever to arrive and wasn't that great just average, the service was extremely slow though I understand it was busy but the waitstaff could have kept on checking back to make sure everything was going fine instead of disappearing until our bill arrived (which we had to wait and ask for).


Btw my boyfriend and I ordered fish tacos, guacamole, and salmon 
My boyfriend mentioned the salmon was bland and overcooked while I though the tacos should have been better because the name is Pink Taco in the first place. Guac was the only highlight of our lunch.


Next time I'm in town or staying at the HRH again  I won't be eating here instead going to mr.lucky 24/7 located in the hotel for a better deal and time.
