***UPDATE: 6/23***

Again, GREAT pink tacos (chicken, etc.).  Tried the app platter this time..split between 4 ladies.  YUMMY!  Had the guac...also yummy!  Great service, SUPER FAST...server didn't mind us walking to the bar in order to take advantage of two for one margarita happy hour until 7pm.  Left incredibly stuffed. 

Found out that for parties of ten or more reservations are not usually allowed unless the whole party wants to eat from a set menu for a minimum price of $30 per person, not including drinks.  We happened to speak to a great gal who was able to help us out a bit after a few days. 

********************************

Happy hour margaritas are the best....friday until around 6 I think.  
Tacos are yummy. 
All food is yummy actually. 
Fun crowd.
