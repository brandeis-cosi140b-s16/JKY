I only came here during happy hour. Let me make this easy:

- Sit at the bar. Bartenders are awesome and you can play some touch screen poker. We came up! bout $1.50 ;) lol
- 2 for 1 Margaritas, yup.
- Guacamole is so good. And chips and 3 different kinds of salsa right away? Why, thank you, don't mind if I do.

That's all I experienced, and that's all I needed.
