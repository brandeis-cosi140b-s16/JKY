It was a type of taco I've never had before, so of course, I had to check it out.  I didn't like how dark the place is, I want to see what I'm eating!  The Pink Tacos were impressive and the excellent black beans put the dish over the top.  I'm glad I went with their namesake because I tried the carnitas and was disappointed.  The salsas were so bland  we asked for their spiciest one.  I don't know what their spice is but it was NASTY so I just avoided the salsa all together.  Washing it down with habanero infused tequila made for a decent meal.
