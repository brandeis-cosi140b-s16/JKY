This is a good stop if your tired of the overprice, under delivering food typically found on the strip or other tourist traps.  I like their queso and the waitress gave good service.  I had the chicken quesadillas and I must say, coming from Texas, their tortillas were top notch.  They are the thin wide variety, but rather, the thick variety. (I actually like both equally.)
