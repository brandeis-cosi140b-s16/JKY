I can't believe I am giving this four stars considering the service.  Maybe it's because It was pretty good and pretty reasonable as far as hotel restaurants go.  It is definitely one of those places where you're not going to be really attentive service but what can you do.  We had the stuffed tacos with avocado and a pickled red onion slaw.  Great place for groups where you don't want to shell out too much.  Plus, it's a mexican restaurant so it's a guaranteed good time.
