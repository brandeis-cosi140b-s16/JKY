The Pink Taco is a mediocre place with a clever name.  The clever name suits the Hard Rock clientele perfectly so the place is always bustling.

I came here for lunch once and had to get a seat at the bar because there was a lunch wait for a table - that's definitely different.  Unfortunately, the wait is more a reflection of the 'hey, who wants to eat at Pink Taco (giggle, giggle)' mentality than of the food.  I've had better Mexican food at a Chevy's for chrissake.  There's just nothing fun or different about it.

The restaurant itself is visually interesting and there's balcony seating by the pool, so that's nice.

Nice just kinda sums up the entire place.  And who wants to be called 'nice?'
