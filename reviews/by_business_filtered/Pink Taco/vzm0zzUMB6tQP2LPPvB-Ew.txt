The best thing about The Pink Taco is the Hard Rock Hotel scene & vibe. 
The food is good & fresh and the portions are large, but nothing you would not find in many other mexican restaurants.  The bar drinks are excellent with great margaritas 
The servers are attentive and attractive. If you are looking for a casual diner  of tacos, nachos, & burritos   before hitting the the Hard Rock then this is a good choice
