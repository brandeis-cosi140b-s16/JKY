I wanted to give this place 4 stars because overall I liked the atmosphere and the selection of food, but paying $5 for one street taco (no rice, beans, sides) is just ridiculous! I know prices are like this for all restaurant hotels in Vegas but that was just way too expensive for me. We paid $50 for 3 drinks and 2 ala carte tacos. Aside from that, the food was good!
