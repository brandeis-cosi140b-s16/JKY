The food is average.  But if your making a reservation for 10 or more, they make you put a credit card down for the reservation and do prix fix menus.  We made a reservation for 14 but one got sick and only 13 showed up.  We got the bill and they charged us for 14 dinners (at $45 a pop).  Manager said we were contracted for 14 and it doesnt matter how many actually showed up and would not fix the bill.  We ended up splitting the extra dinner and with 2 beers/person our total was $75 each for average mexican food!  Ended up making them give us the entree to go and found a homeless person across the street to give the food to.
