Pink Taco has all the hype of a great Tex Mex restaurant. But the food was sub par. I would've been better off going to a local joint such as Fausto's for a more authentic dish and for a great price.

I had a chicken dish with chimchurri sauce. It was supposed to be the best  pick off the menu.
The chicken beaten to a thin strip was ok. The rice was stale.
The salsa was a bit too salty if you can believe.

This place may be better if you're drunk and don;t notice the taste is the bottom line.
