I have to agree with the other reviews, it's a bit pricey for what it is.  I've always wanted to try this place and happy it was so convenient in our hotel.  We had the tacos and they were amazing.  The Pink Taco was so yummy.  Just the right combination of flavor.  I loved the deco - random and rustic.  The service was fast and friendly.  Very dim lighting - gave me a slight headache.
