Hmmmm...naming a restaurant with an obscure anatomical reference is a bit distasteful. It is like naming a a pet store " The one eyed snake" or a seafood joint "The bearded clam". Maybe It is just my mind being in the gutter at all times. As for the food. I am not really a huge fan of Mexican food, so my review may already be biased. I had the asada burrito and it was nothing great. The meat was not any better than any other Mexican joint that I have experienced. Being located in the Hard Rock hotel, it definitely has a party like atmosphere This place is more about the social scene than the food.Party like a Mexican rock star!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
