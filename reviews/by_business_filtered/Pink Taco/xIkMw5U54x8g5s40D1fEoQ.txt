A fun place to start out your night, perhaps before going to Body English, also in the Hard Rock. 

Decent but not necessarily authentic Mexican food. The real treat is the good bar scene - and strong margaritas. If you like tequila, they have an impressive list to meander through. Come to think of it, just come for the drinks and get something basic like some quesadillas at the bar!
