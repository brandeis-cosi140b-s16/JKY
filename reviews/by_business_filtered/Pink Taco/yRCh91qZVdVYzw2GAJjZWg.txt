Maybe it's the Californian in me buuuut.....Not my place for Mexican Food and way understandable, its a restaurant inside of the Casino.  Meet up w/ some friends for Happy Hour...all I can say is that I'm picking out next happy hour spot

Carne Asada Fries: smh, no honey, sorry these are NOT carne asada fries.  Potato Wedges w/ bland seasoned carne asada, w/ pico de gallo drizzled sour cream.  Sounds good right???? it was OK, carne asada fries shoild never and I mean NEVER be made w/ potato wedges - Knock it off

Sangria: to me, very water down

Chip & Salas: subpar salsa, and stale chips

Super OVERpriced for mediocre food, and that's me being nice about it.  But who goes to Pink Taco for the food??? You go for the atmosphere

This is only my opinion, go try it out for yourself and form your own opinion of Pink Taco
