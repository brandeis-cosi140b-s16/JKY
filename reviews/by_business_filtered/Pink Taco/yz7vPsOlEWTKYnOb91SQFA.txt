We had a pre-concert dinner at Pink Taco and liked it.  First, I love the decor.  Its funky and fun and I love all the lit stars everywhere... I was coveting that look before I even saw it there!  The only negative is that it is EXTREMELY loud in there.

Our service was good.  For some reason, my husband did not think our service was very good, but I thought our server was attentive even though she had a lot of tables kind of spread all over.

We ordered the corn fritters and they were tasty.  Loved the sauce they came with.  For my meal I went with the app nachos.  I was going to get the Diablo nachos, but our server warned that they were insanely spicy, so I just went with the regular.  They were good, but the chicken on them was a little salty for me.  Still very enjoyable with both sour cream and guacamole and a cheese sauce and melted cheese.  Good stuff.

The husband ordered the signature Pink Tacos and he said he really liked them.  They came with Chicken and were served with Rice and Beans.  He must have liked it all because it was all gone!

The prices are reasonable for Vegas standards and we had a Restaurant.com certificate, so it was quite affordable.

Overall, a good experience and a restaurant I would return to.
