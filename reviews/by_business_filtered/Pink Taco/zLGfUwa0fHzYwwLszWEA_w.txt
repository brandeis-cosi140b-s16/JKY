Came here for happy hour while waiting for our room to be cleaned/ready at the Hard Rock! 
We got there at around 3:30 on Friday. Wasn't too busy. Found a spot at the end of the bar. 
Boyfriend and I both got margaritas. They were good, pretty strong. To eat, he got the ahi tuna tostadas and I got the sopes. I know happy hour plates are supposed to be small, but geez. 
His tostadas were literally 3 chips with a couple pieces of tuna on top. Super small! 
My sopes were GOOD. Like soo good. But again, so so tiny. I could probably fit two in the palm of my hand, and the plate only comes with 3 -.- 
Anyways, the food was good. Just wish there was a littttle more. Luckily they give you chips and salsa, which were bangin. Probably the best chips and salsa I've ever had. I'm always weary to try salsas because I'm a huge baby with anything spicy but this was delicious and smoky and perfect. 
Very well done, Pink Taco.
