Had dinner here with a coworker while staying at the Hard Rock Hotel.  Tried the frozen margarita during happy hour and the choose three tacos option.  Tacos were OK but nothing spectacular - found the pork one to be quite dry.  Drinks were OK and service was pleasant.  Definitely nothing to write home about.  Decent option if in Hard Rock.
