I have been a fan of this place ever since President Bill Clinton brought me here. Correction: ever since news of Clinton's patronage of Poncho's piqued my interest and prompted me to try this place. There is a room called the President's Room and tons of photos (some with funny expressions) of him on the walls. Poncho's is a great, family-owned business with lots of nostalgia.

The food is great. I highly recommend the green corn tamales, which are large and soft with just a bit of corn kernel sweetness. Other things I love: the green chili chimichangas (they are huge!), the green tomatillo sauce, and the green verde salsa. When it comes to this place, take Kermit's advice and "Think green!"

I do wish that there were some staples that I have some to expect from Mexican food restaurants on their menu. For instance, if you want a spinach enchilada or fluffy sopapillas, you unfortunately will not find those here. They do have a veggie burro for you vegetarians, but I would prefer algunas enchiladas espinacas.

At this time I arrived here, I was greeted by a "Food Servers Wanted" sign on their outdoor marquee. That should've been a warning for the slightly slow service to come. Here's a tip: avoid the 4 o'clock shift change unless you like waiting a bit extra. Regardless, the staff they do have on hand is always friendly, will take an extra interest in your party, and, if you're a regular, will always remember your name. I anticipate that the shortage in waitstaff is temporary, because Poncho's is a Phoenix institution.
