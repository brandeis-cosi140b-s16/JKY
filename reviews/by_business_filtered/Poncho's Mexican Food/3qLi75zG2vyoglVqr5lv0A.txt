Sunday, and the family wants to go on a picnic. Great.
You have a couple of choices.

Feign some sort of non-specific illness so you can sit home and watch Red Zone Channel, or tag along and act like a good parent for a change.
You choose the latter.

This was the drill.

I called in a takeout order at Poncho's, picked it up, then drove the entire crew up to Dobbin's Lookout atop South Mountain. (About a 10 minute drive from Poncho's on Central Avenue)

Yup.
A seven-mile vertical drive up South Mountain chocked with enough mountain switchbacks to ensure your entire family will be car sick upon arrival, leaving most, if not all of Poncho's feast available for your lunch tomorrow.

Hey, I didn't do this on purpose, things just worked-out in my favor for a change.
