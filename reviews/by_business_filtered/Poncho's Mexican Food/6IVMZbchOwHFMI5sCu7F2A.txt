Went there with a group of about 8 people.  I ordered a 'big' margarita...which actually wasn't bad.  The food on the menu looked good, but I was not a fan of the chips and salsa.  I know most people rave about it...but the whole squeeze bottle salsa was actually too thin for me.  I like my salsa chunky so that I can dig in with my chips.  Anyways, I ordered the my food and was happy with it.  It was very good.  Probably worth 4 stars in my book, but since I only gave this restaurant 3 stars your probably wondering why only 3 of you just said it's worth 4 stars.  Well the reason I knocked it down was because of the service.  Just not very good at all.  Our service seemed irritated everytime we asked for anything.  She only came to check on us 1 time during the whole meal.  We had to get up ourselves and go to the kitchen to get a side of sour cream and our own napkins.  I'll try them again to see if maybe she was just the bad apple of the bunch.
