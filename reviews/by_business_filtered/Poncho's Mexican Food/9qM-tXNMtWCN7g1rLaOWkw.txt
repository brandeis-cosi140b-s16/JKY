I would give them a 5 but it's been a year since I've been there. Ponchos is Mexican Food to me. I compare all other food to Ponchos. I've been there easily a million times. I blame at least 50lb on my body to them. I say that in a good way. Great chips and sauce. I always get the green chili burro enchilada style. They have an awesome bean burrito too. I can review all day. Love you Ponchos. I'll be back next time I'm in town.
