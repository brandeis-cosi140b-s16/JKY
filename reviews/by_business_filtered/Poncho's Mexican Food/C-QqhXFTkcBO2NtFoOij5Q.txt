Was So Good, We Ate To Much.

Every now and then I find myself at Ponchos Mexican Food to satisfy my  burrito cravings.  The only problem I encounter when I go to Ponchos is the food is so good I eat too much.

On this visit my lunch companions and I  started with the nachos and chipotle chicken.  The nachos were delicious  and we could have stopped there, but we didn't and ordered our entr√©e's. 

 My lunch companions ordered the Carne Asada Burrito, Carnitas Fritas, El Crudo Burro, and I had the Pollo Fundido.  The Pollo Fundido, was a wonderfully flavored, deep fried Chimichunga, with Jalapeno Cream Cheese on top. The chicken was tender and moist, the tortilla was crisp, and the Fundido sauce was perfect.

My lunch companion said his El Crudo Burro was delicious as well.  The machaca beef was lean, tender, combined with a light tomatillo sauce. The burrito is topped with red enchilada sauce and melted cheese, and  served with rice.  I think on my next visit I will have to give it a try.

The service at Pancho's is always great. Our drinks were always refilled and we were offered a take out drink as we left. 

If you're ever in the area and craving good Mexican Food give Pancho's a try.
