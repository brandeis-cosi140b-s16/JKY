Back in the day I used to drive all the way from Surprise to eat here, yes the food was that good. They used to have the most killer Pollo Fundido as well as amazing chunky salsa. 

Time has certainly changed this place.. we started with a cheese crisp with green chiles, delicious.. nice and crispy with just the right amount of chile strips.. also ordered their killer chunky salsa which was as good as I remember it. 

Then come my Pollo Fundido swimming, Im serious about this, swimming in a pool of grease!! They didn't even bother draining the thing before tossing it onto my plate. Was disgusting too, not even like clear oil but dark brown grease. Vile. Then the Misters Sampler showed up.. this thing was a fucking mess! You couldn't tell what was what under the piles of sauce and lettuce until you took a bite. Mini chimis were burnt, mini tacos burnt, tamales, cold and hard.. was a complete wreck. 

After a few bites we called it.. major loss of appetite.. a shame too cause the salsa was actually really good but the entrees were inedible. 

Meanwhile, the Mister was attached to the toilet within a few hours of eating here.. he was sick all day the next too.. so word of caution, eat here at your own risk.

Im sure going to miss the good meals I used to have here, what a real shame.
