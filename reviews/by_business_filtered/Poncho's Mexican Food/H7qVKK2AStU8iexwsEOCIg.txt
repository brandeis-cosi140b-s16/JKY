Ok... this old world, family owned Mexican restaurant is my favorite in all of the valley.  I have lived here for 10 years and just haven't found anything better than Poncho's.  It has been in the valley since the 50's, passed on with each generation.  The menu is as authentic as the family that runs it.  Wonderful people, and wonderful service!  My favorite items on the menu (aside from their salsa and bean dip for the nacho chips) is the Pollo Fundido and the strawberry margarita.  YAHOO!  The burrito is stuffed with chicken and chopped green chilis and cheese, then topped with melted cheese AND a jalepeno sour cream sauce.  OH YEAH.  The atmosphere is very old world... nothing fancy to say the least.  But when you make your way to South Phoenix, you surely won't be disappointed.
