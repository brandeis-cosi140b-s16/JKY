I went to Poncho's for my first time and I will not be going back after this, The young lady in the front was SO RUDE and was also taking personal phone calls while we were waiting just get seated & the place wasn't even full for the time we had to wait  and another reason is it's so expensive and the food is no good. My nephew ordered the carne asada and it was so flavorless and dry, We told the waitress about it and she even agreed and she even said that no one ever ends up liking the carne asada. Luckily she was nice enough to take that plate off our bill. The only thing I liked was the chips!
