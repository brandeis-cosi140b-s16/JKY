So, this place is like my family's tradition, yet today was the first time I've ever tried it (or the first time I remember trying it...) Anyways, it was great! We sat and ate in the bar, which at first looked kinda dingy, but it actually has pretty decent decoration. We were served right when we got there (we came when it opened up) and our server was really nice! She deserves to be mentioned by name, but I don't remember it.... sorry! Anyways, the menu was big but not-too-big, of you know what I mean. I ended up getting the shredded chicken chimichanga, and I also tried some of the Pollo Fundido (spelling?) and both were DELICIOUS! Yes, the portions are HUGE! It is imminent that you will fall into a food coma, even if you have a full box of leftovers to take home. It was a tad greasy, but it's fried mexican food, what do you expect? In conclusion, I say that it's my new favorite mexican restaurant.
