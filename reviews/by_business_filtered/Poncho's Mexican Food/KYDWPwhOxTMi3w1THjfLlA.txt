I love Poncho's. I grew up in South Phoenix so my family and I came here all the time when I was a kid and I continue to make the drive back here years later and always bring new friends to try the place out. My favorite dish is the Pollo Fundido. It's so good. The salsa in a squeeze bottle is kinda weird, but good. 

Be sure to check out the room with a mural of ex-Pres. Clinton sitting at the end of your table. And the secret service standing on the opposite wall.
