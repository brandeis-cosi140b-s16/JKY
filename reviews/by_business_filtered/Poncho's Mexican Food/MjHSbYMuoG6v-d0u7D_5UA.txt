We went on a Tuesday night so it wasn't very full, the AC was up high and the lovely waitress turned it down for me. 
My cousin had the burrito and the rest of us had the chimichangas. 
We had pitchers of margaritas, too. 
I could not move afterwards. I didn't get the full meal with the sides, just the chimichanga and even then we were in such pain because we ate so much, we had to go home. So, it's a lot of food. 
It was really yummy. The margaritas are yummy, too, they do not taste very strong, though. 
Overall, it was a good experience, minus the pain from eating too much afterward. I suggest NOT eating too many of the nachos they bring out beforehand.
