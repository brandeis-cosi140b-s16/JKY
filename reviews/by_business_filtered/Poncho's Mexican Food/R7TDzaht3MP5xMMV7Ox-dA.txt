I've eaten here a few times with the hopes I get something I like the next time I return considering the reviews. I still don't. The food is bland and greasy. Not very authentic IMO. They do give you a big portion for the price so I did like that. Also the service is great. I might go here again to try the famous pollo fundido. And also only because my boyfriend likes this place so I'm sure we will be here again
