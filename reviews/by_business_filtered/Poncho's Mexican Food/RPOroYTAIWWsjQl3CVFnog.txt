Green chicken tamale was amazing.  Perfect moisture.  Not to salty.  The kernels of corn added sweetness to it. There was a nice manageable amount of masa. The thing was like crack. Could not get enough.   Also had the
Chicken chile relleno.  Which was amazing tasting..       

The only downside was being tucked away in a broom closet with three other tables.      And cheddar cheese?     Go with some authentic Mexican cheese and it would have been perfect.   Eat here eat here. Cause dang its good.
