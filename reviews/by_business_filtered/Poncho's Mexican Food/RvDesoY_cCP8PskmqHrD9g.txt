I have heard many good things about this place and then saw mixed reviews on Yelp.  Bill Clinton even ate here.  (I don't think George Washington slept here!  You east coasters will get the joke.)

My overall opinion is that Poncho's is a run of the mill Mexican restaurant.

- my server was very nice and attentive (except for refilling my water) but the kitchen was very slow

- the chips were fresh but still very greasy

- the Pollo Fundido, one of their signature entrees was a good sized but soggy chimichanga with lots of moist chicken stuffed inside it.  It was then drowned in a white cream cheese jalape√±o sauce.  All very salty to me.

- I ordered rice and beans that we're okay at best.  I know they are refried beans but these were also greasy.

Bottom line - with over 20+ Mexican restaurants within a few miles of here I will continue trying new ones vs returning here.

Sorry Poncho's!
