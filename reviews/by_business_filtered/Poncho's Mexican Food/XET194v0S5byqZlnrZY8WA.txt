My wife is a die hard but that's because she grew up eating here. I can say this is not a bad place for food. They make a good everything. 

We had 
2x 3 way burrito green chili, red chili and bean with green sauce on top. 
1x Pollo fundito with rice (excellent)
A ton of chips and salsa 
The bill was slightly over $20...lol freaking MCD'S is more.
