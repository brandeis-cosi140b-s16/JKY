Absolutely delicious and my favorite place in town. This meal Is always two hours long though, service is extremely slow no matter which server you get. One of my top request is don't starve my thirst and refills are hard to come by. Food makes up for the slow service, be sure to check out the coupons in the newspapers and weekly adds.
