Hmmmm....didn't really impress me when i heard former President Clinton ate here in a whim on one of his trips in PHX. i was more distracted by this eatery being centrally located on a grimey street as well as the odd smell that greeted us in the narrow halls of the waiting area. It surprised me that the odd smell did not deter the number of people who were dining here. There was a brief wait time as this small eatery was packed in every room-including the bar's dining area. There was also a wait for the takeout line which they had conveniently outside...must be something worth yelping about....

So i decided to order what my cousin has been raving about-the chimichangas. I've eaten many a chimichangas before but never...a beef chimichanga... even with its regular guacamole +sour cream combo ever touched  the one i had at Ponchos! Simply stated-the overall meal came fast, FRESH & was filling. Now i understand how certain foods can trigger a massive release of endorphins throughout your body....i stuffed myself enough to put me in a food coma. Now i understand that i could never go back to a 'chain' Mexican restaurant again. 

Affordable as is delicious-Ponchos proves that QUALITY of food isn't necessarily determined by price-as some of the best & most authentic cuisines are truly hidden treasures in local neighborhoods waiting to be found...thank you cousin for helping me discover this gem!

The menu may look very typical (http://www.ponchosaz.com/eimenu/) but you'd only know the taste difference if you ate here & experienced it for yourself. Poncho's wont disappoint.
