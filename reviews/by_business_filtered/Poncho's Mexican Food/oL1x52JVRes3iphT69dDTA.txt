Pretty Decent food at good prices. My favorite is the Pollo Fundido. Seeing the photo of the cheese crisp here on Yelp, I'm definitely ordering that next trip.
The staff is very friendly and service is good.
It used to be a sign of a good restaurant if they brought water to your table before you ordered. Ponchos brings you water, chips and salsa.
Even before I lived close to Ponchos it was one of my favorites.

* I advise taking a table in the bar or else you might get stuck next to a very noisy kitchen or the bathrooms.
