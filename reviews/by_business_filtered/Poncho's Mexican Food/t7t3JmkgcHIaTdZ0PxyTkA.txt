A very good restaurant. Good hot sauce, Good chips, Excellent machaca tacos. Very good red chili burros. Cheese enchiladas are a little inconsistent, usually not cooked all the way but very good when they are.

Can be very busy at times.

One note for this and other Mexican restaurants. Why are people charged more when you order something without rice and beans? Most of the time the amount of food minus the rice and beans is way more than enough. I can't tell you how many times I see plates with rice and beans left on them. They just get thrown away.
