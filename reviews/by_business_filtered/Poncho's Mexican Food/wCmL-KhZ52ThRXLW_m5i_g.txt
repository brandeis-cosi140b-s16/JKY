Today was not a good day. For a Sunday it wasn't as busy as I expected but today it's my daughters birthday and we wanted good Mexican food. The waitress was very nice, a little busy but nice it's her birthday too. I think their bus boys quit because the table next to ours has yet to be cleared and it's going on 30 minutes, so this fly has found an excuse to circle around us. I'm not giving her two stars I'd give her five, but whoever is managing should be written up because there's really no excuse. We felt like we were eating in the kitchen. Just got the check and ready to go...still no bus boys :-(
