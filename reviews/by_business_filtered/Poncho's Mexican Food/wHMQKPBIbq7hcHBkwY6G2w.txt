Now for the review. I had the Pollo Fundido which was delicious. However it was truly smothered in the jalapeno and cream cheese mixture as in possibly an 8 ounce brick of it! That said, I would get it again but would ask that they go easy on the cream cheese jalapeno sauce on top.

I agree with the reviewers who said skip the guacamole. They put jalpenos in it which totally overpowers the more subtle flavor of the avocados. They also add sour cream as well. It seemed to be so whipped that there were no chunks of avocado in it whatsoever.

Fantastic waitress and service! So nice and a great job!
