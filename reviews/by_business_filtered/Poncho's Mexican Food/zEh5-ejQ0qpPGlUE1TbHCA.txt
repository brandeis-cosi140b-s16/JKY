There is a reason this was the place picked by President Clinton on his trip to Phoenix. The food is authentic. I recommend the pollo fundito. I would caution travelers. The ambiance is second rate and the neighborhood is quite sketchy. Definitely a day visit place.  Lines get long after five and the weekends.
