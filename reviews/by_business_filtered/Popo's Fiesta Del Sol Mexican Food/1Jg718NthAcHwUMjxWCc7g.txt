Nope, not coming back....the only good thing I can say about this restaurant is they have good chips and salsa.

We were dying in our pants when my kids said we should have called the fire department when they brought the fajitas. So much smoke which eventually meant burnt chicken. The steak fajita was just ok, but the beef was chewy and hard to cut.  

My daughter said the rice tasted like Mexican minute rice out of a box and my son said his enchilada tasted like hospital food. Jalape√±o poppers, save the $6...cooked from frozen. Blech!

Really wanted to like this place....but it just wasn't happening. Left the restaurant pretty unamused that we spent $70 on food we didn't even box up to go. Bland food, overwhelmed staff and tired decor. Still wondering why we had to wait 30 minutes to be seated.
