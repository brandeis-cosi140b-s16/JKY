I've only been here once myself, and I wasn't impressed. The service was great, staff was very friendly and helpful, we waited for nothing, even though they were pretty busy with the game 6 crowd. 

We got chips and salsa right away, the salsa was fresh but kind of boring, we asked if they had any hotter salsa which they brought out right away. This honestly seemed less spicy than the original and tasted more like ketchup. Stick to the original.

My boyfriend ordered the taco grande which was huge and tasty by his account. another star. As a vegetarian I didn't have many options, the only beans they use are refried with lard, so I ordered the veggie fajita burro, enchilada style which sounded pretty great. Food came out quickly but I have to say my burrito was a little... Taco Bell? Sauce was bland, the burrito was a lot of puffy flour tortilla and the veggies were too large to be consumed. I ended up ditching the tortilla and chopping up my vegetables with lettuce and the house salsa. Would have been a pretty average experience if I hadn't gotten violently ill on the way home. Not sure if even the veggie burro is safe for vegetarians. Sorry Popo's, I really wanted to like you, but I'm not coming back.
