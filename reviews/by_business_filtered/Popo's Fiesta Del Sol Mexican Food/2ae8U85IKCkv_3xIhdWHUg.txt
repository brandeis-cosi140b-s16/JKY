Yeah, I'm one of those that hit the original Popo's on Indian School circa 1979 or so  (remember the Meat Block butcher in that area? How about DoubleWheel, Skagg's, and Luckys!)   Anyway - we'd long since left that area and relocated North.   When I saw the Popo's replacing the Garcias on Bell Road - well, I was ecstatic to say the least.   

Long story, short:  Went to the new Popo's religiously for about a year or so.  That is, until we had an incident with long hair in the salsa.   I'm not going to rip them for that - it happens, I understand, we're all humans.  However, mentally, it ruined the restaurant for me.  I can't eat there for the time being.  

Perhaps one day I'll get that detailed image out of my head and go back (and if I do, I'll edit this review and make further notes if I can).  But until then I will still recommend it to others because that incident, while traumatic, was the only issue I've ever had at Popo's.  

The shredded beef is seasoned quite well (un-like Macayo's no-flavor shredded beef tacos).  Shredded beef Chimi's were good (but see my other reviews for my true fave).    Shredded beef tacos were good as well (I can eat 3 in one setting - oink!)
