First off, my rating has nothing to do with the service. 
Our server was nice & attentive and he received 20% 
I've been here before with a large party of family for a graduation & wasn't pleased then, gave it a second try and should've known better not too. unfortunately have nothing good to say about the food. The chips and salsa were ok, beans tasted like paste that had been sitting at the bottom of a container for a few days.. I felt sick a few hours after eating here.. Go down the street to some other Mexican restaurants and you'll be happy you did. :(
