Came with family and our waitress, Julie, took our order, left and then came back to recommend a different way to put the cream cheese sauce on top then add cheese to melt it. It was so sweet for her to come back and give her advice.

I chose to try it and it was amazing.
The cream cheese sauce was under the cheddar cheese and it was warm and creamy!

Thank you Julie!
