My family has gone to Popo's at least a few times a month for over 20 years. When they put the new location on 59th and Bell, we were excited. So far, we are not impressed. The new location is nice because of the area (compared to the one on Indian School Rd). The food is very, very inconsistent. One night we are thrilled that it is good... Another night we are frustrated because the salsa is bland, or my chimi didn't seem like it had been deep fried for very long, or not to mention how many times we were brought the wrong order. The most recent visit, Mother's Day, we received a flower for my mom. I love that they do this. However, the food was horrible! My mom and I shared a green chili chimi. They brought out a shredded chicken burrito...so we sent it back... As soon as she brought the correct order, we noticed a horrible smell. Even the table next to us looked over. We took a few bites and immediately sent it back. It seemed the meat was bad. We notified the server and she sent the manager over. We didn't like to complain because we have been loyal customers for so long, but we wanted them to know something was very wrong with our meal. They comped our entire bill! We will most likely be going to the Indian School location from now on. They are always consistent and the food is always amazing.

Just make sure you go to the Indian School location!! That one is AMAZING
