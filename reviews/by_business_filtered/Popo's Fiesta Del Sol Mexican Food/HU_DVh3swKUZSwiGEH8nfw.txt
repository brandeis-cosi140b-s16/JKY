Have been to this place before, didn't feel it was full of frills but always good hot food and good service. Went there last night and could not have been more impressed with the new entrance and patio. Whoever your contractor was, they did not miss a beat! Give them a bonus! Misters, heaters, fire pits, fire bowls, air conditioning. Wow! I felt like I was in a Scottsdale "esque" venue and only had to drive to 59th ave. We were absolutely impressed. We felt like we were on vacation in your new space. Can't wait to come back. You're officially my new favorite mexican on the west side!
