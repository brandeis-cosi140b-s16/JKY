I rarely go to a place more than once.  Now having made that statement, I have been to Po Po's 3 times in the last 3 months! I freakin' love this place! Happy Hour margarita's are only $3.00, yummy, tart,  and strong! My limit is 3 and I'm seriously schnockered. The food is what you'd expect from a place such as this, basic Tex Mex dishes covered in cheese (not necessarily a bad thing), the portions are large and the food comes out hot. The salsa is some of the best I have ever had and I eat the entire bowl every time. I had one of the salads the last time we went and I swear there was half a creamy delicious avocado on it. What a treat!
