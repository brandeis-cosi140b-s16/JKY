We eat here on a regular basis, typically at least once a week for dinner.  Food and service are always good and consistent.  2 item entrees are always good, as is  the green chile plate, which is very flavorful, but expect some heat with that one.  I love, Love, LOVE their salsa, which always has just a little zip to it, but husband prefers the smooth hot sauce, which really isn't that hot.  Plan to go early, before 5 for dinner, otherwise yiull wait.  This place is very popular and will not disappoint!
