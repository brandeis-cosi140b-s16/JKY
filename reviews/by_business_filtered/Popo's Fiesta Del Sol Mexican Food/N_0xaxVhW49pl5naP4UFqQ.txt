Real good Mexican food. Have been to this location 3x's and their Phoenix location 2x. Good salsa and chips. They don't have hot though if that is what you like. Love the chicken tacos and the burritos. The service is very slow though. All 3x the service was not very good. Service at the Phoenix location is really good.
