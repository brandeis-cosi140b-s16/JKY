I love Popos. I have been going to the Indian School location my whole life. Living in North Phoenix, i was stoked to find out about their new location. I finally tried it out last night.

I got my regular- Green chili Burrito Enchillada Style with r/b. It was excellent as always. The service was very fast. They re-filled my drinks quickly.

It was very clean and nice in the new location. 

Rec a million times.
