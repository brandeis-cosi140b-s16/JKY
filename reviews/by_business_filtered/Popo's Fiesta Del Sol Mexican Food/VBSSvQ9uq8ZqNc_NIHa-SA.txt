Probably some of the best Mexican food you can get in Phoenix.  THis location USED to be a Garcia's, and when it closed down, I was glad to see it remained a Mexican restaurant.  I had many happy memories there when it was Garcia's, from when I would come home and visit my family while on leave in the Army.  

However, as PoPo's, the food is WAAAAYYY more improved!  They also have build out the patio and as much as I liked it when it was Garcia's I like it far more now as PoPo's!  Very good food, always friendly staff, and the portions are huge.  You will almost always end up asking for a take home bag or box.  Shredded beef tacos are awesome there, as are the chimis and chili rellano!
