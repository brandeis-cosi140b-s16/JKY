Went to Popo's today on 8/4/11. I wanted to go somewhere close and get some somewhat "soft food". My Grandmother just had her teeth fixed and could not chew that well. I could have easily gone across the street to Macayos and had reliable service and food (well sorta). Instead, I decided to go to Popo's on 59th and Bell. Have had them a few times, NO PROBLEMS. Guess I never had take out from them before. I ordered  a fish burro and my Mother had a taco and tostada a la cart. Then I asked for a to go order of a green chili burro. I did not know that on togo orders you must order chips and salsa separate (FRICKIN CHEAP). Anyway, I had a good meal. The food was decent and the service up until this point was adequate. Or server who's name is Junior had a follow that day. I understand the stress, but make a good impression for the one that you are training so they will know the right way to do things. Anyway, asked for boxes and he brought us some. Then our TO GO order came out. No chips and salsa provided. I guess that's a way to generate more revenue for the company. Still, no problem since I had some on my table. I took the chips and salsa and walked to the kitchen. The Manager, Vicky Baird,  was standing right at the doorway. I asked her to please box up the chips and salsa. She then stated it was against health code and rudely walked away. I put the chips and salsa down and left. I was now very mad. I went to the table and told my companion "NO TIP". I told him we would NEVER be back. Junior took it upon himself to tell me that he, "encourages us to not come back." Wonder how his boss would like that???? NEVER again. I will continue to spread this message for at least the next two years. 3500+ local facebook friends I am sure will agree.
