I took the whole family there for lunch on a Sunday afternoon and there was about a 20 minute wait to sit down.  Figured it was a good thing that we were not the only ones there.  The chips and salsa were good and the waitress was super busy but still took good care of us.  We all ordered some form of chimichanga and they were all good.  They messed up my order and brought me beef instead of chicken which was ok because the beef had a little kick to it.  The kids had minichimis beef and chicken and they had no complaints.  We will definateley be going back.  Maybe next time we will take advantage of happy hour.
