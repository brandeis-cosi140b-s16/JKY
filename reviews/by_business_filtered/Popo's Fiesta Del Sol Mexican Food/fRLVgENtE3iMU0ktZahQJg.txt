I was hoping for some good Mexican food as this place is close to my work but that was far from what I got.  I felt the sevice was the only good thing at this place.  I judge a lot of places by their salsa and it was just lacking bold flavors or spice.  My meal was just average at best and I highly doubt I will be heading back.
