So been coming here for quite a while... Food is good.. Service is hit and miss... But tonight the service was horrible... I cannot believe this waitress(ceci)has a job!!!! The worst service from any restaurant in a long time. On a good note... Bus Boy Michael was outstanding.. Saw I was frustrated, notified the manager and made sure I had everything I needed.. The first time... The waitress had to be told a minimum of three times on everything... Not very busy so no good excuse except incompetent at her job. I think they need to promote Michael and demote Ceci!  I tipped Michael quite well.. As far as Ceci.. Here's your tip... Find a new line of work and don't eat yellow snow!
