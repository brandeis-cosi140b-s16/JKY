This is a pretty standard Americanized Mexican restaurant for the area. Our group of five was seated promptly (although it was very early, so no crowd yet.) Our server Manuel was very friendly and efficient, chips and salsa came out right away. I ordered a Fiesta Special which came on a big oval plate filled with refried, rice, and guac salad with a chili relleno and a machaca taco. The chili relleno was just OK, the shredded beef taco was delicious although could have used a little more beef. In all there was a lot of food on the table, they do not skimp on the portion sizes. 

Negatives: not much of a Mexican beer selection at all, they had mostly lighter domestic beers. Also, there didn't seem to be any really hot sauce to be found; the salsa was very mild and the 'hot sauce' they brought when asked was barely medium. So if you are really into that, bring your own bottle of hot sauce to put on their great food.
