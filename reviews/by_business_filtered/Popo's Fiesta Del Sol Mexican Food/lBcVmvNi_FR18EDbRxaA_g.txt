Went for dinner last night..The food was awesome, best meal we've had at this location since it opened. Had the green chili burro tasted amazing and very tender...Wife had tostada, taco dinner, excellent! Frankie was our server and he did a great job. Only one complaint, the back ground music was a tad loud..
