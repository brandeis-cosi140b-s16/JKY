The food is amazing. Me and my wife have been clients since we where children. Recently the service has been unbelievably horrible. Last night we visited the restaurant and there was no one at the front door to sit us down. We waited with another 3 parties for like 8 minutes. After going into the back of the restaurant all the employees where sitting behind the bar counting their tips. It only went down hill from there. I had to get up several times for drink and salsa refills. On top of that they start cleaning next to us stirring up dust into our plates.  If the owner is reading this my advise is hire new staff. The Asian girl who claims to be a manager is horrible. All she says is I'm sorry sir.
