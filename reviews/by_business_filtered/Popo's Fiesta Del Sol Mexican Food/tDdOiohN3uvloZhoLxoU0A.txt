Places needs more servers or a better way to take care of their busy times. I sat in the bar to avoid the 30 min wait for a table. Mistake! One server was handling the full bar and patio. We all suffered. When the manager was approached by another customer, she seemed unaware of what was going on. She did approach tables to ask about the wait and acted accordingly, so that was good.

I think the food is decent. Be honest, after awhile all basic Mexican food pretty much tastes the same. Beans are beans. Rice is rice. Seriously? If someone took the pictures from various Mexican restaurants at this level (Gracias,Macayos etc) and asked you to match the dish to the restaurant, we'd all probably fail.
