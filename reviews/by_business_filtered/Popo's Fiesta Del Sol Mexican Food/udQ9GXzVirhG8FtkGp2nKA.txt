I used to think they were OK for what they are. This is family owned American Style Mexican Restaurant that always has fresh made salsa that always taste good and dirt cheap $3.00 margaritas that gets you whoosey.

I was here this weekend and had the Chicken Fajita Salad (the only thing I eat from here) because it is decent. I pulled out a long piece of bacon from it. I didn't make a big deal about it because I thought maybe bacon was their secret seasoning. It sort of bothered me since I never noticed bacon before and I called them up today and the girl on phone said they don't have bacon in the restaurant so it must have fallen out of someones sandwich or something.

This place is a slop house. They don't care about what they slop on a plate. That Violates menu accuracy.
