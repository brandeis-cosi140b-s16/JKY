Service and food was AWFUL...the whole dining experience...from the time we sat down to the time we received our undercooked chicken (that we tried to send back and the manager was a total b**ch about it); THEY EVEN KEPT IT ON OUR BILL EVEN THOUGH WE DIDN'T EVEN EAT A BITE OF IT....WORST RESTAURANT EVER....totally not the same as the original....NEVER AGAIN WILL I GO THERE....
