My sister Judy invited me to dinner for my birthday, so I chose Popo's because my nine year old grand niece, Bella, says it is her fave, especially the salsa. What a pleasant surprise. The salsa is a close second to my fave Jalape√±os in Scottsdale. The portions are generous and their food was excellent. And the place was packed with a line out the door. And, the servers came and sang Happy Birthday!  Check it out, this place rocks it.
