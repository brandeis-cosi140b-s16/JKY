We went here a few weeks ago with a couple of friends who love this place. It was a good experience and we were very happy with the service and the food. My husband and I split the large fajitas and it was plenty of food! The meat was pretty good and it came out steaming hot, as you expect for fajitas. I currently have gestational diabetes so I was unable to try the chips, salsa, and margaritas, so next time we go I will definitely give those a try too. It was good Mexican food, but not something I would go out of my way for. If you are already in the area, then definitely stop by. Also, expect a wait.
