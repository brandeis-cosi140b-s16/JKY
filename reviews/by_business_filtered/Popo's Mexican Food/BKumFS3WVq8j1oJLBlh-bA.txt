Not sure why this place is such a fav for so many people. I thought it was "ok" but nothing that I would drive to. The $99 margs were great value and tasty but warning that they are VERY sweet and cant be altered to make less sweet.  Food was gringo mex food typical of AZ restaurants. I had the fajita salad and would definitely not order again not because it wasnt good but because it was completely average and didnt have many faj veggies .   Chips and Salsa were also typical avg mexican- nothing special or flavorful.   The one plus was our server who was very sweet. She was slow since it was busy for $99 margs but she was extremely cheerful and as attentive as she could be for as busy as she was.
