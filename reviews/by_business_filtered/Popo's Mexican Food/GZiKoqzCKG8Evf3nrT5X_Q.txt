I went for the first time on a Saturday at lunch time with my girlfriend. The place was quite busy, but we were greeted and seated within minutes. Within another few minutes, staff took our drink orders and brought out chips and salsa. I enjoyed the salsa quite a bit, however I thought the chips were just ok (I can't really complain about free chips!). The staff was definitely on point with their service. Everything came out at the right time and our drinks were always full.

I ordered a machaca chimichanga topped with guacamole and sour cream. It came with a side of rice and beans (my girlfriend ordered the same). Our food came out in a good appropriate amount of time. What I mean by that is we had enough time to enjoy our chips and salsa, but not enough time to finish the salsa and wonder where our food was.

My chimi was absolutely delicious! The saying "melts in your mouth" is how I would describe it. I would drive out to Phoenix (I live in the east valley) just to order this again. The rice was different than I expected, (a bit spicier?), but it was good. I wasn't a huge fan of the beans, but I wasn't overly concerned since I was completely stuffed and had to take the rest home.

The interior decor is pleasant and not overbearing. There are lots of TVs playing various games, but I didn't feel as though I was in a sports bar. The exterior looks a bit run down, but don't let this fool you! This is definitely a hole-in-the-wall sort of place and I was blown away by the quality of food and service. Based on my first experience, I would highly recommend you try Popo's Fiesta Del Sol.
