Dear Popo's,

   If I had a stomach made of steel and a titan digestive system I would just love you until you overflooded with love.

Unfortunately I do not, and every time I come back from a scrumtious meal from you I am full of heartburn and have a tummy ache all day long :(

Okay, away from my own selfish additives, here is the low down on Popo's Mexican Food:

Popo's is located in a small strip mall, so keep you're eyes peeled because it's easy to miss! It is a classic for west Phoenix residents and has created a permanent buzz. Right when you walk in the staff greets you and serves you like the pros they are. This establishment has stood it's ground and kept a huge amount of loyals for years upon years. 

The food is served in beyond generous portions. Mountains of guacamole, sour cream and meat are piled onto the dish. Beans are rice are given an extra flair with this way-better-than-average salsa and cheese. The meat is so flavorful and juicy it's sure to be remembered.

Overall, the food is really good! However, if you are not use to eating heavy portions and extra fried food, it can be a bit rough on you. I would give Popo's four stars but due to the stomach ache and heartburn I had the rest of the day afterwards, I had to deduct a star.

If you are into big and yummy meals and have no limitations on portions and fats, then this place will be you're wonderland ;)
