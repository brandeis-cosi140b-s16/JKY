Muy authentica y delicioso! 

I just could not resist giving this place a great rating, since I credit it with making me finally fall in love with Mexican food two years after moving to Phoenix.  Finally, a place that serves Mexican food that isn't afraid to be adventurous with its spices and fresh in its ingredients.  My manager described Popo's as "the best Mexican in the Valley - hands down" when I asked her where to take a guest for the real deal. She hit the nail on the head.

The place is NOT perfect - if you want a so-called "better neighborhood" then go to the counterpart on Bell Rd. - but the food is without parallel. From the spicy cheese dip to the fajitas to the Corona-battered fish burrito....I kept waiting for something to be "just okay," but as we tried each other's entrees, I could see all of our eyes light up with delight.  

It gets better. Not only do they have a mean 1/2 price margarita happy hour, I saw an advertisement for 99 cent margaritas on Tuesdays.  Even without specials like this, the food is moderately priced with large portions. I have since gotten take-out from the Bell location, and "the complete" was more than enough to feed two people.

And, joy of joys, there are actually tasty, healthy options on the menu as well! My grilled chicken salad was AMAZING. I got a side of grilled veggies last time I got take-out, and the zucchini was fresh and cooked to perfection.

My recommendation is to ignore the pawn shop next door. Be patient if the unpaved parking lot out back is full (we ended up parking at a business up the road and walking).  Wear casual clothes. Be prepared for a slight wait if you come with a large group.  

The service was right on - and THE FOOD IS WORTH IT.
