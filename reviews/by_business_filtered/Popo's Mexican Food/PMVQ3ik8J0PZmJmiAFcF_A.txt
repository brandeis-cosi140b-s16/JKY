The food is fabulous!
We are visiting from Ohio and will go to Popo's 4 times in 7 days, so that tells you my opinion.
I got the chimichanga with carne asada, fajita steak, and fajita chicken. All to die for, but I preferred the carne asada.
 You can pick 2 different toppings-I get double guacomole because it is fresh and fabulous.
The complimentary chips and salsa are wonderful.
So, why 4 stars and not 5?
Because of inattentive servers on multiple visits.
It is not unusual to run out of chips, salsa or drinks for a lengthy period of time.
Sometimes the servers just seem to pull a disappearing act.
Obviously, I like the place enough to keep going back.
If you are in the Glendale area, I would highly recommend Don Ruben's, which has top- notch food and service.
