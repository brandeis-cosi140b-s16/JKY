As visitors to Phoenix this past weekend, our group decided we wanted some delicious Mexican cuisine. We found a review for this place online and drove about 20 minutes (to what seemed like BFE) and finally arrived with hungry bellies. We were greeted by all 5 of the ladies standing near the entrance who seated us quickly. Our waitress arrived at our table quickly for our drink orders and was quite helpful. 

My only complaint about the service is that my friend's father wanted to try their $4 Rita-tini (?) that was advertised on the wall that was made with 3 Amigos Tequila. When he asked for the $4 special, we were told it was strictly for happy hour. The sign itself said absolutely nothing about happy hour - and the only reason I mention this is because every other sign in the bar that offered a drink special -only for happy hour- designated that clearly on the sign. The waitress wasn't amused when he jokingly asked if she could make an exception. 

Our meals were simply delicious. The carne asada was easily the best carne asada I've ever had, and being from Southern California I would like to think we have quite the selection. I personally ordered a 2 Chicken Tacos plate, which included rice and beans. The chicken was cooked differently from any other place I have ever been to, it was incredibly juicy and surprisingly flavorful. 

I couldn't pin point exactly what the other people at my table had ordered, but we were all settling into food comas shortly after commencing our delightful lunch (which wasn't the best thing considering we all had a 5 hour drive to make back to California).

If I ever find myself in Phoenix again, or even somewhere remotely close by- I would definitely stop in for another meal.
