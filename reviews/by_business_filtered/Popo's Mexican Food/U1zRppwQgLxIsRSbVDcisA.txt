Popo's is not a place you know about, but one of those places someone takes you to.   I've been going for 10 years now with my fellow co-workers.  When we go we could all order for one another.  My choice is almost always the Machaca taco and a side of beans.  Don't forget to ask for the "hot" salsa as well.  My company has taken every President or Vice President that has time for lunch to this establishment when they visit Phoenix.    They have all been impressed.  That's saying a lot when you work for a fortune 150 company and your visitors travel extensively.    This is truly a hole in the wall worth visiting.  Oh, yeah, they also cater....and it's good too!
