I remember coming to Popo's in the 90's and it was tha shiz! I'm not sure why I liked it so much. Maybe the recipe's changed since then, but it really isn't as great as it used to be. It might be that my palate has matured with all the great Mexican food I get in San Diego or maybe the thrill is just gone...
