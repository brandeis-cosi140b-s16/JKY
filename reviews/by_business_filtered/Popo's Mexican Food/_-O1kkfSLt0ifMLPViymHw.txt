My wife and I and some good friends all went to Popos today. Chips and salsa were great. Salsa was some of the best we've ever had. Flavorful with just the right amount of heat. They had a special of 99 cent margaritas that were really good!  We started off with a cheese crisp which was excellent!! We all ordered different food and everything was really good. My wife's taco was great and my green chili burrito was outstanding.  Their Spanish rice is really good also!! Service was fast and attentive. Our waiter was really good too!  He had a great personality which made our experience even better. We drove over 30 minutes from Mesa to eat at this place and I would do it again in a heartbeat! Highly recommended!!
