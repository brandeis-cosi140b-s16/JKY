I wish it was still one of West Phx best kept secrets, but anyone who knows better knows this is the beginning and the end of authentic mexican cuisine. I could hook their red sauce intravenously and be totally happy.

One gripe: Some of the hostesses are kind of young and inexperienced. I came in to order to-go once and instead of a normal greeting, she looked up and said "Wha happen?"  Dude... come on.
