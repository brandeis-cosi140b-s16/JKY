Food was decent, but service was awful. We had a large party none of whom were permitted to be seated until the entirety of out party had arrived, we were all coming from work and i didn't appreciate being pressured with "if they aren't here soon you lose your table" the staff was rude and I had high hopes for this place, people talk about it frequently. Would not recommend
