Be very careful with this place. I ate there a couple months ago as an invited guest of the proprietor Michael. The food was OK, but not better than OK. I wanted flan for desert, but they were out. I decided to have no desert but Michael insisted that I try the chocolate burritos. Why anybody would eat something like this is beyond me. It's just stupid and nasty. 

An hour after the meal I was in a Fry's grocery store. I barely made it to the restroom before a serious bout of projectile vomiting ensued. If you like food poisoning with your tired Sonoran dinner, this is the place for you.
