I got the Red Chili lunch special yesterday and it was solid as always. I couldn't finish it so I brought it home. Heated it up tonight in the stove and it was one of the best meals I've ever had. I need to go there full and reheat more often. 

Nice staff, clean enough, good service, reasonable prices, huge servings, second best chips and salsa in Phoenix. 

Crappy section of town in a hole in the wall strip mall. Right where one would normally find top notch Mexican food.
