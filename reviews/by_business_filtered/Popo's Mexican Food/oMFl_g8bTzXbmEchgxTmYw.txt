Couples date night.  Love this place,  20 years ago my husband and I found this place because we worked across the street at Smith's at that time, now frys.  This place had such great food.  Sally was our server and let me tell you she was Awesome .  Friendly & attentive this is our second time in a few months.  It had been years since we'd been here. Ours friends found it and now we are regulars again.  Their salsa is to die for.  All their food is awesome fresh and fabulous.   Never have had bad service.  Margaritas $. 99 with$7.00 worth of food.  What a great deal.  Go you won't be sorry.
