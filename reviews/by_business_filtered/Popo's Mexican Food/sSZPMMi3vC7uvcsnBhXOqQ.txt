Service was great even on a busy night was told 45 minute wait but was seated in under 20 minutes. Lots to choose from in the menu. Ordered the #3 combo which is a green chicken enchilada with a taco and rice and beans I was expecting a small enchilada is was more like a burrito very good and plate was over flowing with food. Food was brought to take pretty quick as well. First time visiting and we will be returning.
