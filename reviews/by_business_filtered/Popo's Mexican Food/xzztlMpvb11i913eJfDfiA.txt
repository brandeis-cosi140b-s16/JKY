After having others recommend this place to me as the best Mexican in Phoenix, even going so far to say "I drive such and such amount of miles just to get there!" I was sorely disappointed when I tried the restaurant's fare.

I had a shredded beef burrito with a side of beans and my wife had some sort of chicken quesadilla, but you wouldn't know any of the dishes from a saucer full of salt. Yeah, the saltiness was that bad. On top of that, my wife's food was so greasy she didn't eat more than a few bites till she lost her appetite and returned it.

The service was good; the waitress was nice and didn't give us any flak about the return, taking it off the bill. Other than her, though, this place loses; "best place for Mexican," indeed. 

I've basically given up on finding decent Mexican in Phoenix; can cook better, myself.
