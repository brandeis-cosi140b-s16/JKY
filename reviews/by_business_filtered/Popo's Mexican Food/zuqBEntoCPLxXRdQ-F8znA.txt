We have been to Popo's a number of times and it is on the list when we have friends in from out of town. Saturday was our most recent visit. All of the previous posts about the area are somewhat accurate. It can be intimidating. Once you get past the location, the inside is inviting, the service very friendly, and the food delicious. The best news of all is we learned Popo's will soon be opening a new restaurant in Glendale at 59th and Bell Rd (near the old Costco) the first week of December. Can hardly wait to try the new place.
