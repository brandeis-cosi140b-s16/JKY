Went to the new location at Guadalupe and Higley. 

I had the Shrimp Matazlan with was something new for me. What a nice surprise for my taste buds.
The honey & coco taste was really nice and just the right amount. The grilled vegetables and pineapple were nice.

The atmosphere leaves room for improvement. There was no music when we first got there, but then it came from the heavens.

The patio at the original is so wonderful, but the patio at the new location either is not finished or is not parts of their plans.

Service was pretty good and the price is fair.
