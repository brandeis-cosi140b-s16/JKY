Probably our favorite Mexican food restaurant in the SE Valley. The salsas are both fantastic. The shrimp tacos are great! Our problem is when we find something we really like (like the shrimp tacos) we seldom try the other items on the menu when we return. Some places we keep returning to. This is one of them. Some we never go back.
