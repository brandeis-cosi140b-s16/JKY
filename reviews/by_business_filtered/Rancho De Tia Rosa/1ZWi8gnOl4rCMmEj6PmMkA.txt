I'm an Arizona native and had never heard of Tia Rosa before I moved to Mesa.  Now that I have been to Tia Rose I find it difficult to gear up for any sit-down Mexican that isn't Tia Rosa.  I've traveled the West Coast, East Coast, Mexico, Europe, and Spain (I've also had lunch in Morocco once) and Tia Rose is quite possibly the most beautiful restaurant I have ever dinned in.  Tia Rose is tied with Damiana in San Jose del Cabo.  I love sitting in the back patio underneath the large tree.  The salsa verde is utterly fantastic and the grilled mixed vegetables side is a can't miss as well.  My wife loves the sweet corn tamale.
