So I have never been to Arizona before, and on my second night there, we had dinner at Tia Rosa. It's a charming restaurant with really quaint decor; they had their Christmas decorations up which added to the cozy atmosphere. The place was bustling even though it was a weekday so I assume hat it gets busy often

I had ancho peach glazed chicken. The chicken was very tender and the sauce was delicious! The side of corn was also really tasty. I am currently trying to recreate this dish at home because it's sooo good and I am a gazillion miles away /sigh. If you don't know what to get, try this!

The boyfriend had the chicken mole, which was also really good and his regular dish whenever he is in town visiting his folks. 

Add horchata and you'll be good to go.
