Went here last night (Friday, February 28, 2014) and I will NEVER go back to this place! We were a party of "3", they would not seat us until my friend arrived. I told the very RUDE hostess at the front desk (older woman with glasses and dark hair to her shoulders) that my friend would be here in just 5 minutes, that she just lives right down the road and I was super hungry and wanted to start eating chips & salsa now. She ignored me and spoke with the other hostess. She let me stand there not speaking to me, then repeated herself stating that she would seat us when the rest of my party arrived. Who are you KIDDING? REALLY? There were 30 people coming in behind me on a Friday night and you won't seat me? This was wrong and not very service friendly. I think they need to adjust their policy! I left very angry and will NEVER EVER eat at this restaurant or any of the other Tia Rosa's.
