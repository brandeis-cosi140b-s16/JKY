Love this restaurant!  I've been coming to Tia Rosa's since I was a kid and I am so spoiled by their quality of Mexican food that I can't even enjoy any other Mexican restaurant's food! There are so many great options but the best thing on the menu in my opinion is shrimp tacos. I'd definitely recommend the Chile Relleno as well. Different than your average Chile Relleno but seriously so delicious!! And not deep fried which I feel is a huge plus. The food generally isn't too spicy but they offer a spicier salsa if you ask for it :)
