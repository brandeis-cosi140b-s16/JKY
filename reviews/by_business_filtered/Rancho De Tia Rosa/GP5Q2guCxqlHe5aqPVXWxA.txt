We have tried this place twice (with open minds) and both times we were disappointed!  The food was borderline terrible. I had the chicken mole enchiladas and asked for the sauce on the side. They refused because it would take away from the presentation....really!?!

As a result, as I expected, there was WAY to much sauce on my plate.  I was able to get down half of the 2 enchiladas but was to overwhelmed to finish the rest.

Had they allowed me to get the sauce on the side I'm sure my view would have been a little different.

Point-  Rancho you are not a 5 star restaurant.  I would recommend getting back to the basics when it comes to customer service because, at the end of the day, it is about the food.
