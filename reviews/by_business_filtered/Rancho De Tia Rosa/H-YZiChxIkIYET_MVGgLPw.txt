Could not agree more with the reviewer who called the food bland. Best description I can come up with as well. Taco Bell or Del Taco have more flavor. Whether salsa or an entree it seems the cooks don't have any spices in the kitchen. Shame. Great ambience but even the drinks are weak and watery.  Wonder if Chef Ramsey is interested in visiting Mesa...
