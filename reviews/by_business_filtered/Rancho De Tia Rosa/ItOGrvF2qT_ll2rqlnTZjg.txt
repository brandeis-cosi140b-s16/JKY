There are so many other Mexican food restaurants in this town, go elsewhere.  I have given Tia Rosas so many chances and am continually disappointed.  I am sad to write this review because I want to like it so badly, it's a great location and atmosphere but the goodness stops there.  The food is bad, the service is AWFUL.  They keep you waiting at lunch (check and food) constantly have dirty dishes, or things floating in your water, get your order wrong, and when it's right - it's just not good.  I've tried a lot on the menu: burritos, enchiladas, seafood enchiladas, fish tacos, Carne asada, etc.  Nothing at all worth talking about.  I hear the chicken mole is good but I'm not paying $15 for anything there.  The final straw came today when 1- there was food in my water glass, 2- my order came out wrong and 3- my $17 bill was rang up at $30.  No remedies for all of these folies were offered.  not going back.  No more chances.
