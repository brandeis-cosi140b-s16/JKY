Update - I had to reduce it to 2 stars.  I would never voluntarily go here and that is a pretty good test for me.  I would return to most of my three star reviews.

I have had a mental debate whether to give this place two stars or three.  For fear of getting flamed, I bumped up my 2.5 to 3.  I guess the main thing is that I just don't get this place.  We went for the early bird service at 5pm because we had a big group and it was tough to find parking.  People were already flowing out the front door waiting for tables.  My in-laws think Tia's has the best food, but my inclination is that Mesa just needs some more restaurants.

The chips are good and the salsa is average.  I don't really like it when salsa tastes like enchilada sauce and this is borderline.  I have been here 3 or 4 times and the only time I thought my meal was good to very good was the time I ordered fish tacos even though I usually do not like fruit in my Mexican food.  Due to the fact that everyone seems to love the food, I keep trying new things but am usually sorely disappointed.  This time, I had average tortilla soup and an average mini shrimp quesadilla (which was served open faced, unlike most quesadillas and sweet).  I guess I will stick to the fish tacos or try Andrew's suggestion of carne asada next time the in-laws want to hit up Tia Rosas.
