Not sure why this place has gotten anything more than 2 stars.  I gave 2 stars for the decor and the atmosphere.  I live by this place and this was my third visit here only because our regular Mexican place was closed, salsa cabana. 

I had the chicken chimi with rice and beans. It was ok, could have been better, temp of food was warm not hot.  Wife had the veggie burrito.  This was a bean burro with lettuce?  The rice and beans were bland.  This place is not for me, I like my Mexican food to taste authentic not like taco bell. Wait I would have gave taco bell 3 stars because it's fast food Mexican and I know what to expect there.  

We had to buy chips and salsa, really?  Every Mexican food restaurant gives you this. For me this is why I go to get Mexican food.
