The restaurant was very cool and great for children and couples alike. The meals were prompt and the food was absolutely amazing. Hands down the best Mexican food in the valley. The server however seemed overwhelmed and at one point left us unattended for about 20 minutes. Over all the experience was great. Pricing was slightly high but for what you get it was well worth it.
