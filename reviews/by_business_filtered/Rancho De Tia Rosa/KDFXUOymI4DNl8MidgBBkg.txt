This is within walking distance of our house so we were excited when they moved into the neighborhood. The last 2 times we were here we received horrible service in fact NO service at all once we were seated. After waiting 10+ minutes we walked out. The first time we were seated on the patio. The last time we arrived and decided to eat in the bar and watch the football game. When we arrived half of the bar was full and the other half of the tables had not been cleaned. The young male bartender was busy flirting with a table full of girls. We waited and waited for the dirty tables to get bussed. I finally walked up to the hostess stand and spoke the the manager. He said that he would have someone clean the tables. The tables were finally cleared so we were seated. Again the bar was only half full. We waited for 10+ mins for the young bartender to come and take our drink order only to be ignored. We got up and decided to leave. I stopped by the hostess stand where the manager was camped out. I told him that since we were seated not 1 person stopped by to deliver water or to take a drink or food order. He apologized and said that he would have someone right over. At this point the damage was done. I told him that we were trying to patronize his establishment but the lack of service not once but twice was the breaking point. Needless to say we will not return nor recommend.
