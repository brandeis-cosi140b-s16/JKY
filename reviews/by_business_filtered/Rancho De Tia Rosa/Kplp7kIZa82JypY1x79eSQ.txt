The menu is great, the same as N. Mesa location, decore and site is great however service is lousy every time we go, napkins are too cheap and small as well. The manager seems to have dinner with his family right out in the bar when they are slammed... Most of the staff seem to be inexperienced high school kids... we have since stopped going because of this even though we live less than a mile away. Seems like a training and hiring issue...
