The East Valley does not have a lot of great restaurants, at least I haven't found them.  For a regular place to go where the food and service is dependably good, my husband and I choose Rancho De Tia Rosa on Higley in Gilbert.  We also like the original location but this one is closer to home.  My favorite food to order is the shrimp tacos, and salads, which are surprisingly tasty.  My husband loves the mole and blue margaritas.  We've taken a lot of friends here and they all seem to have a good time.  Nothing fancy, just good.
