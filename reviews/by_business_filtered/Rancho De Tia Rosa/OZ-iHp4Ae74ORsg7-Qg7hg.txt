I love coming here. It is a fun atmosphere and the food is exceptional. The food by itself makes it my favorite Mexican restaurant. The reason I am not giving it a five is because I have always had poor to okay service here. One time, I never even got the horchata I ordered and the wait time after we got to our table was ridiculous. Still, the food makes it worth it and I just come during a time that isn't as busy now.
