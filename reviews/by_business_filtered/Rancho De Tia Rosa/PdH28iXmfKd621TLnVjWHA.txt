I just came back from a trip to Mexico. So if you can believe it ,I was craving Mexican food. One of the best places I have been for Mexican is Rancho DE Tia ROSA.
Well, we got there early to beat the rush. But, sadly enough they were closed.
They had a horrible Kitchen fire and will be closed for at least 6 months.
Thank you Jesus no one was hurt. But, it has put them out of Business at least at this location.
The Tacareia is still open. That is basically just Tacos and to go orders.
It was already packed. So I was a bit ifffy If I wanted to go or not.
Then the girl giving all the info said we could go to the one in Gilbert.
She even gave us a coupon for a cheese crisp. So we went.
I love the whole ambiance at this location. I hope that they get it all back together soon. When they are up and running again. It is a great place to visit.
