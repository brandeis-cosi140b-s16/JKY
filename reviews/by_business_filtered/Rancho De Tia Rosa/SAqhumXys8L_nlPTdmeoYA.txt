Now I've been to Tia Rosa several times and I've always enjoyed the food and Margaritas.  I specifically love the grilled peppers and onions you receive with some dishes.  That said, last time I was there, I ordered a Vegetarian Burro ($12....which is already quite a lot for a Burro filled with beans), and asked to have some grilled peppers and onions put inside, instead of cheese....and then the grilled peppers and onions on the side instead of the beans and rice.  My burro ended up costing $18!  $3 extra for each addition of the grilled veggies.  I could have got a better tasting burrito at Chipotle...actually 3 veggie burritos at Chipotle for $18...and those come with peppers and onions, and Guacamole!

When you spend $60 on Margaritas, and another $80 on food,  I would expect them to throw in a side of vegetables.
