This is the place on everyone's lips right now - always crowded!  We tried it on a Friday night and somehow got seated in less than ten minutes.  Guess everyone wanted outside seating in the beautiful weather.  Ordered a shot on the menu that sounded yummy - but wasn't.   Cheese crisp was burnt.  Green salsa, as others have said was sweet but I loved it.  Food was good but not great.  The shining star in our meal was the server, Tara.  She was very on top of everything even though very busy.  And I was impressed that she asked my permission before serving my 11 year old refills on soda.  We may or may not try this again.  Wanted to be thrilled since it is within walking distance.
