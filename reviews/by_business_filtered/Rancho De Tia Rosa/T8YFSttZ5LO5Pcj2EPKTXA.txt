This was one of my favorite meals on a recent trip to Arizona. The place was packed, but we were seated and taken care of very quickly. Our server, Joe, had a great sense of humor and patience with our table. The atmosphere was very fun, if a little loud for conversation. 

We had the chicken quesadilla, chile rellenos, beef chimichanga, chicken carne asada fajitas, and a few different margaritas. It was all really good! The quesadilla had chile strips which added a nice little bite to an otherwise usually tame dish. For sides, these were the best beans I've had at a Mexican restaurant. I'm used to really really bland and mushy beans and hardly ever eat them, but these were very tasty. 

Just a great end to our vacation.
