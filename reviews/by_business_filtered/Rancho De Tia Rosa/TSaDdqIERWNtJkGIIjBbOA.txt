Chips came out, 1/2 the basket was soggy tortilla (not even crispy). Both salsas taste like they're from a can, the green one tastes like sugar water. Kids "quesadilla" is just cheese melted on top of a tortilla.

Maybe they were having an off day. Locals seem to like it because it was packed. I hate posting bad reviews but hoping they see this and step up the quality. I've never been served a basket of soggy chips, ever.

My note to the owner, make your salsa fresh. It would make a world of difference. If you already do, try a different recipe, it's as bad as a store bought can.
