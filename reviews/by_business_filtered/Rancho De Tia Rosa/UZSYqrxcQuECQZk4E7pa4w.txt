My husband and I had eaten here once before with our family about a year ago. My husband said he really wanted to eat here again. Even though I did not really care for the food last time I said okay. We sat in the main dining area which is very pretty. It has a fountain and there is a lot to look at. We order two appetizers to share. We ordered a cheese crisp and a sampler appetizer. The sampler appetizer was pretty bad. They give you a fried bean burrito which has way too much cheese, a nasty meatless tamale which tasted like dirt, a tostada which hardly had any beans, and these little taquitos which were the highlight of the meal. I will not ever come back here. By the way, my husband was disappointed with the food as well. I gave it two stars because of the decor and our waitress was nice.
