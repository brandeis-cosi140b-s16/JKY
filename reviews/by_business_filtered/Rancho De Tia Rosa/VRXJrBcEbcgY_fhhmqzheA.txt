Is it the fault of the restaurant if we were being serve by a bad waiter? Wrong food given, The waiter doesn't pay much attention while talking to us and when our bill came it was also a mistake. Everything didn't turn out right! My wife and I stared at each other when the other customer said in a loud voice that this waiter did an good job for them. Maybe we started on a wrong foot or it's just a bad hair day for this waiter! Hey, not everything didn't turned out bad....THE FOOD WAS EXCELLENT. Maybe in my next visit I shall write a better review for this restaurant.
