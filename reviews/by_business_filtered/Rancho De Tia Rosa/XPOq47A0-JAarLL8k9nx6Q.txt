Portions are HUGE and the food is great and service is friendly. The atmosphere is really cool as well. Went today for lunch and that was 3 hours ago and I am still full! They probably get really busy during the weekends and nights just by judging from the lunch rush but they handled it really well. Go check em out and try the Beef chimichanga.
