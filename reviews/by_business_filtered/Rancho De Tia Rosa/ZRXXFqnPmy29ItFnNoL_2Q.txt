This place has a really cool atmosphere.  The food is good but the margaritas are a little uninspired.  Be prepared if you're trying to go on a Saturday evening - the restaurant (and the parking lot) fill up quickly.  Although the food is average and the margaritas only passable, it is still a great place to go for the charming decor of the place and the friendly staff.
