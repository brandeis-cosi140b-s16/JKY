The chicken Mole was the best ever! Cooked to perfection spiced to please the palette and I've had homemade mole from Oaxaca Mexico. It's not for everyone but worth a try. A combination of over 22 spices chocolate and cinnamon balanced. Yum. Fresh homemade guacamole. Warm chips not greasy! You can ask for no salt on the chips. Margaritas top notch tequila resposado anejo Patron, Blue Agave. All the good stuff. Flan is not flimflam. Muy Sobrosas and reasonable. Not typical Text Mex. More like real Mexican food. Spinach enchiladas filled with whole leaf fresh. Con Carne with roasted corn. Fabulous. Clean, excellent service and a fun festive but not over done atmosphere.
