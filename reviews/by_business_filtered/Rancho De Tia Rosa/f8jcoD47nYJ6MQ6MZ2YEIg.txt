Every year on my annual trip back to my hometown, I look forward with mouth watering and tummy grumbling to visiting Tia Rosa's (the McKellips Road location). Not only is the food outstanding, best carne asada ever, best seafood tacos, and best salmon enchiladas, but the ambience and decor is top-nothch. The patio and main room are so beautiful and I get my fix of talavera pottery and mexican decor that is lacking in Cincinnati,OH.

Being a spoiled Gilbert native, the trek to McKellips sometimes seems so far, (I laugh now, because driving in Ohio everything is 15-20 minutes, but in Gilbert, you are soooo spoiled) so I was excited to see a new location on Higley Road just a block from home. Yeah!!

Now let's see how it stacks up against the original location!

The decor is still beautiful and they did their best with their space, but not near as gorgeous as the original. However, in comparison to other mexican restaurants, still above par.

The food= equally delicious. Had to get the seafood enchiladas and they were dynamite. I split them with my husband and I wish I ordered my own. They were that good!! Still the best and unique salsa that they give you with the chips. We went through 6 baskets of chips throughout the table and too many to count of the green tomatillo salsa!

My favorite new thing about this location is the fact that they have a soda fountain. The old location only serves plastic bottles of soda and you have to pay for each one. So stupid and annoying. Thank goodness they got it right with this one.  

The price is same as old one. Do not plan on your cheap mexican food because it's not that! It is higher priced grub but you get what you pay for.

Excited that the new one is closer to home, but still may visit the old one for the awesome patio!!
