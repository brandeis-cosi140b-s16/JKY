I'm sorry I just don't get it. This place is huge and always packed. My in-laws always want to go, so I've been there a bunch. I feel excited to go inside when I get there because it has a cool atmosphere of this semi-old world, pueblo restaurant. Other than that, I think it's barely decent Mexican food and cocktails.
