So we do not live on the east side but were visiting family and a local recommended this place to us. 

We arrived around 2pm on a Saturday for a party of 14 and a high chair. The place despite it being in a strip mall is gorgeous! Inside and out. I was rather impressed and it was very clean. 

At first I was really urked when speaking to the hostess because I told her we needed a table for 14 with a high chair. She told me to tell her when my whole party was arriving?! I was like everyone is traveling from different directions to meet for lunch ( Gold Canyon, Pine and El Mirage) I really don't want to stand at the front of your restaurant with my 2 children to wait for my whole party to arrive. She still made us wait. Finally a few of our party arrived and we told her we would like to be seated since the ones who arrived were our elders and can't "stand" around. I literally had to snap at her and say we weren't waiting for the rest of our party and she needed to sit us.....Need to have your hostess learn some hospitality and common sense. 

But they did finally sit us in our own secluded section and it was perfect for our big group since we are a huge group and not always everyone's cup of tea. Our server really did a good job keeping up with all of us ( sadly can't recall his name) 

There green salsa is disgusting! I was reading the reviews and unless you like sweet verde sauce, pass on it. 

Everyone enjoyed their food and no one seemed to have any complaints. He was really nice about splitting everyone's check so we only had to pay for our own party. 

For two adults and 2 kids (who both ordered a cheese crisp) it came out to $50 without the tip. I think my husband ordered an enchilada and I ordered the carne asada. 

Stepped outside to smoke after dinner and they have beautiful furniture arranged next to a roaring fire in a chimey. Could have sat there all day!
