This is my favorite Mexican restaurant of all time... Good, tasty food, full bar with great cocktails (big, intact mint leaves in their mojitos) and great atmosphere. I've been frequenting both the restaurant and the taqueria for years and it's one of the reasons that I think it's good to be back in the 480.

However, I was semi-disappointed last night when my friend Jarrod and I went to the restaurant for dinner and when he asked for hot sauce on the side and we informed that it would be an extra $1.00. Seriously? Extra charges for hot sauce at a Mexican restaurant? I mean, that's like a bar charging for water...

When you go here, I highly suggest the green sauce. Whether it be as the salsa on your chips or the enchilada sauce, it is absolutely fantastic. Also a big fan of the shrimp tacos with their pineapple salsa - om nom nom.

Glad to be back where there is plenty of good Mexican food to eat rather than in SF where the best Mexican is in burrito form (no offense to SF burritos but there's more to Mexican cuisine than that - SF still rocks the house in weather and culture though).
