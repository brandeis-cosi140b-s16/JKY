We went there this morning and it was great! My wife had their Green Chile Pork Breakfast Burrito, I had Chillaquilles (not sure if that is how it is spelled) with chorizo with some green chile pork on the side, and my daughter had the waffle with berries, whip cream, and home made strawberry and blueberry syrups! It was all amazing! I know where we will be going next time for breakfast!
