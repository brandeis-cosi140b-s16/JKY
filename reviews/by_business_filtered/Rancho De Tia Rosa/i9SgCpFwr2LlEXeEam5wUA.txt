We always seem to try this restaurant during our stays in Mesa.  We usually get either the Flying Saucer, Beef Carne Plater Tortilla, or the Chicken Chimichanga for a meal and have never been unsatisfied with what is served to us.  My wife likes it because they can make the food at a consistent spice level where it is not too "bland" or too hot for someone to eat.  I have read previous reviews and about the food being too "sweat" and am fortunate to say that has not been our experience.
