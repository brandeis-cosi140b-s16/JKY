Best Mexican food in the East Valley! I hate to call it 'Mexican food' because that will probably make you think of the typical burritos and tacos you get at every other 'chain' restaurant - BORING. The owner/chef really puts an exotic twist on many of the dishes. My favorite is the Shrimp Mazatlan which is a beautiful mix of Jumbo shrimp and Pineapple skewered over a bed of rice. Ingredients are always fresh (the owner has his own garden behind the restaurant! 
Been enjoying their menu since when they were in a little strip mall. Even back then their popularity caused crowds standing in the parking lot waiting to get a seat! Their new location is really classy so you can dress up of a nice dinner. But you'll still be in a crowd outside waiting for your seat. Believe me it's one of the few restaurants in the East Valley that's worth the wait.
