Visited Rancho Tia rosa last night... Couldn't have asked for better South west Mexican! Started with Margaritas and afterwards, a bowl of black bean soup. Mmmm... Entree was the glazed shrimp quesadilla, again, exactly as advertised and very tasty. My wife enjoyed soft tacos and had to bring one home due to the size. We'll be back, soon.
