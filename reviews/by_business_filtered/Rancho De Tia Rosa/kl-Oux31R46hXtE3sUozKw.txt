This place is a little out of my way, but when I'm visiting the folks in Mesa we come here.  The fish/shrimp tacos are good, as is the carnitas plate.  Great Mexican place to go to if you are trying to watch your carb in take.  Not a huge fan of the salsa or margaritas.  Love the outdoor patio seating.
