I've been to RdTR on 4 separate occasions... each with the hope that the previous visits were just bad nights.  What can I say.  We live within a mile of the place and will never go back.
Dishes have always been prepared with a lack of focus and flavor that should define this cuisine.  I had their braised pork which was so dry, I would swear they used loin instead of shoulder.
On a separeate occasion, we brought out of town friends and they pointed out how interesting their 'smoked' refried beans were.  I tasted them and commented that there was no such thing.  Their beans were burnt.  Fish tacos - just ok.  Burritos - go elsewhere for 1/2 the price.  Rellenos - not really rellenos.

If you want real Mexican food, look elsewhere.  If you want to eat at a really charismatic place, wait for 45 minutes for a table and leave feeling like Garcias would have been more authentic, then this is your place.

UPDATE:  After moving away from Arizona and coming back to visit family, I relented and tried this place again.  I really want to like you Tia Rosa, but sadly, no change.  What is it?  Why?  This is a Mexican food place in ARIZONA and it should be the bomb.  But its not and I don't think ever will be.  I can't really tell why but it feels like there is a lack of soul.
