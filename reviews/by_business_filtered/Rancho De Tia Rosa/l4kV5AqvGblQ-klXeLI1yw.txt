This hidden gem is a must stop for Mexican food, especially if you live in the East Valley.  I haven't been to Tia Rosa's in about 5 years, and boy has it improved.  The trees have grown so much that we drove past it twice because we didn't see the sign.  Tia Rosa's has two options, their front take-out restaurant and the main dining area.  It's just what you would expect when you walk into the Mexican style Hacienda, a water fountain and great courtyard for eating outside.  The menu is diverse and there are several vegetarian options.  I went with the Spinach enchiladas served with roasted corn and black beans, they were fantastic!  The table ordered carne asada, a beef burrito and the fish tacos.  All raved about the food.  The only complaint that we had was the salsa was just okay, it wasn't hot enough and their hot sauce was not very tasty.  We all wish we had a little more spice in our dishes, but the overall consensus is still a solid 4. If you decide to dine at Tia Rosa's try to get a table in the back courtyard or the room to the right of it, it will greatly improve the experience!
