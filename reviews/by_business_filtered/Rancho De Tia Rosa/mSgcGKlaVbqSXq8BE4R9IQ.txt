I was promised great Mexican food here. What I got was very, very good Mexican food. Still...I'll take it!

We had reservations for our big group (15 people) at approximately 7:30, but weren't seated until closer to 8. That's a bummer, but oh well. As a result, we ran past their closing time which I felt bad about, though we did not do so on purpose and did not linger. 

The first thing that hit me was somewhat negative - it's cramped. Really cramped. Many tables need to rely on other tables having their chairs pushed in enough, and having worked out that day and had very little to eat in order to fit. Even within tables, they seem to pack them in, elbow to elbow. The smaller the group, the better. 

It all goes up from there. Margaritas were delicious and strong enough without being lethal. Service was fantastic throughout - timely refills, friendly service, and a willingness to run 15 separate transactions. Funny thing though - it wasn't the final amoutn split 15 times, but rather each and every menu item on the bill split 15 times (since we said it was okay to just do an even split). Nothing wrong, it was just kind of funny to see "1/15 Margarita. 1/15 Chicken Mole. 1/15 Cheese Quesadilla". FYI, 1/15th of a Sprite is very, very little money. 

Now on to the food. I only had my one dish, but it was very excellent. Chicken Mole with tons of tender chicken chunks and a rich but not overpowering mole sauce. All of the spices seemed to be in proper balance. The rice was good, but I wish there was a bit more of it. I am not a mole expert, but one person at our table got it as well and, as someone who has it frequently, she said it was some of the better mole. Everyone else seemed very happy with their selections, be they salads, tacos, whatever.
