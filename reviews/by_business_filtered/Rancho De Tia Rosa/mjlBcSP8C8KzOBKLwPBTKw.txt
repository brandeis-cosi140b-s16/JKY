To say I'm a fan of Tia Rosa's is a bit of an understatement. I fell in love with the green tomatillo salsa and black bean soup the first time I ate at the old location on University in 1993. Since their move to the present location, I've noticed one significant factor that always reminds me why I keep coming back. Consistency. 

Each bite of fish taco, carnitas or chicken mole tastes just as good as the first time I tried them. Sure, the cuisine is in no way bold or spicy (unless you ask for the habanero salsa...) but it is always fresh and flavorful. And sure there are the typical taco/burrito/quesadilla offerings, but the rest of the menu is what really shines. 

Try the Ancho Peach Chicken for example. Not a lot of heat, but a juicy seared chicken breast immersed in a delicious sweet peach glaze with just a hint of smoke. Or the Enchiladas Mariscos with their grilled white fish, sauteed shrimp and Montery Jack wrapped up nicely and covered in a creamy green sauce. And my favorite, the slow roasted shredded beef. I haven't been able to find anything that comes close to its savory, tender, char-grilled goodness anywhere in the Valley. 

Now, it is true that there is very little you can do to get around the long wait for a table aside from coming in at an off time. The physical property itself is quite charming if not a little kitchy but is starting to show some wear and tear. 

Every taste convinces me that Tia Rosa's isn't your average taco/enchilada joint but rather something special to be experienced.
