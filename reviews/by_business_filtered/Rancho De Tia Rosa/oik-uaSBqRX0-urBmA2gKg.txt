I've been to the original RDTR, in Mesa, and always was pleased with the food and the service.
This location, well, let's just say it's no Mesa.  I'm not sure what happened at this location and don't know about the Mesa location as I haven't been there in a while, but this location is very so-so.
I've gone a few times now, really wanting to give it a shot, but each time I am coming up empty.
I won't go into alot of detail and describe everything.  Instead I will just say, "the food is just average".
Too bad, as I always liked the other location.  I don't think I will go back until I see the reviews rebound.
