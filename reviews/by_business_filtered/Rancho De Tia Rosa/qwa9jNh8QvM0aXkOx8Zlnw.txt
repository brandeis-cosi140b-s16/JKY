This is one of the few mexican food places that I will eat at. The chimis are great. Thats basically what I always get. The place seems to be always packed with old Mesa people and snowbirds. The atmosphere is fun and the chips and salsa are good, not the best, but respectable. I rarely go anymore since the discovery of  Cantina Laredo and Cravings Gecko Grill. But still worth going if in the area.
