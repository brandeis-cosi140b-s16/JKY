We drove nearly 40 miles to come here from Ahwatukee and try this place out. As a lover of Mexican food for close to 50 years I really wanted to try the Mole since the write up on it via their site made my mouth water. However, it was missing any bite at all and was far too sweet. The chicken was very tender and the mole sauce had a lot of flavor but, once again, no heat and too sweet. The best Mole in town, in my opinion, is at El Zocalo in Chandler. Mi esposa had to try the pork chop instead of her usual fajitas.. Bad choice, she should have had the fajita's. So much for trying to change things up a bit. I have to mention the Salsa since that's such an important condiment at a Mexican food restaurant and one to make the first impression. The one just below the Habanero salsa was great, the regular red was OK but too mild and the green was sweet and unlike any salsa I've ever had. Did this Salsa come from New York city? lol. Did they add sugar or honey to it? These guys seem to really like to sweeten up virtually everything. Finally, the drinks: The house margarita was powerful for a house drink but was also too sweet, The Sangria tasted like the wine coolers I used to buy in 2 liter containers to take to the lake. I'm guessing it was just wine and juice/pop as It had no kick to it at all and no fruit either. Quite a disappointment in this hot weather where Sangria, prepared properly, is so refreshing. They need to mix their own instead of using a pre-concocted mix via bottle. I suggest looking up a recipe online or checking with Secreto or Caraba's since either of them make what we feel is the best Sangria in town. The staff was very friendly and attentive but the bartender had a bit of a "don't bother me" attitude. In hopes that the Mesa location is catering to a more "Eastern or Midwestern" audience we'll be giving the Chandler location a try before writing them off permanently.
