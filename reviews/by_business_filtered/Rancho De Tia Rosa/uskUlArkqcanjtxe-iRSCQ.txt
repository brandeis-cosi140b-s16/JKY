From here on out this will be my go to spot when i get my Mexican cravings! Lovely atmosphere both indoors and out on the patio. The prices are for sure unbeatable and the quality of food is excellent. I'm talking plates (big plates) starting at 9 bucks. Service was good and they are very accommodating to make your order just the way you want it. Whole list of exotic margaritas also...and i love free shit (especially if its food)so you know the chips and salsa that came out when we sat down put a big smile on this girls face.

Good for family, date night, gossip time with the girls etc..

muy delicioso !
