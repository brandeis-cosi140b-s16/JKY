Nice atmosphere day before Valentine's. Excellent service. Wait time but they make sure to go around and call your name out loud. Ordered too much food. We didn't need appetizers. The portions are huge. Definitely order to share each item and take home. Each dinner entree can easily feed 2 normal adults. Everything was tasty and fresh. Took home and reheated our main entres and it was excellent and fresh the next day. Everything tasted fresh and unique. Enjoyed the food very much
