When the honey and I found out that Rancho De Tia Rosa had opened up a location a few blocks from our house we were so excited. We have been to the other location many many times and loved the food. 
On our first visit, the wait was over an hour but the food was delicious and you can't go wrong with getting a pitcher of their House Margarita. The service has always been a little slow at the other location and not much has changed in that regard.
We went for lunch the second time and I was less than impressed. I wasn't very hungry so opted to just get the Tortilla soup. The server was not very attentive and when he brought out my soup it was cold. It took some time to actually find him to get it taken care of and even then he asked me if I just wanted them to reheat it?!!! Uhh excuse me? Wow, why not fix the mistake by getting me a whole new bowl and actually cook it correctly?!  The other thing that rubbed me the wrong way was that I had asked for some cheese to put on top of the soup- they had the nerve after all of that to charge me a $1 for that! Now I realize it is just a dollar but really? After they screwed up, we had crappy service and by the time it was fixed my honey was done eating so I only had time to eat half of the soup anyhow. 
The reality for us is that we live in an area that has not many choices when it comes to mexican food so we will probably go back again. I will not however, be going back for seconds on the Tortilla soup.
