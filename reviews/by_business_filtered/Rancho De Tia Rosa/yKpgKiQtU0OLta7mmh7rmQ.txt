I have been going to Tia Rosa before it branched out and is now two restaurants, and I can tell you I love it just the same now as I did back them.  Love this place, give it try i really dont think you will be disappointed.  I have some family members that think the food is a little on the sweet side, so if you like really spicy may want to stick with Los Dos Malino's.  But if you want great flavor go to Tia Rosa's.
