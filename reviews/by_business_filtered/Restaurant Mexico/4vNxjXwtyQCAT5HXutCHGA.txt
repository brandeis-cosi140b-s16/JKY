I had breakfast for lunch here, and it was heaven-sent.  It was one of those days - when anything else just won't do.

I did the machaca scramble (basically a shredded beef scramble with bell peppers and tomatoes) with rice and frijoles and was very pleased.  The best part of this dish were the homemade tortillas -  I couldn't just have one (Lays eat your heart out, mofos). 

While it was good, I've definitely had better.  A good choice if you're moseying on Mill.  It's location now is very hidden - but it's right next to Ra, and once I tell someone that, they know exactly where it is.
