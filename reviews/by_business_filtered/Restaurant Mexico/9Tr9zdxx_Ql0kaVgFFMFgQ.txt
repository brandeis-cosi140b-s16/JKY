This place is overrated by some, and overpriced given the quality.  Starter Salsa is runny and bland. So called "steak" is the thinnest piece of beef I've had in a restaurant.  Food presentation is non-existent.  If this is called "authentic" Mexican food, it really is a humiliation to Mexican cuisine.  If you don't want to feel ripped off and still hungary after eating there, pls stay away and save the regret!!!!
