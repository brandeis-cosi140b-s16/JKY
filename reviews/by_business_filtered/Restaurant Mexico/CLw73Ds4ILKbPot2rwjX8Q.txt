Everything here is relatively tasty.  Nothing we have tried has been bland, with one exception:

That dang watery salsa that comes with the complimentary chips.

The salsa has a decent taste, what little taste it has; nothing bad can be said about the taste. But the consistency is just awful.  Completely chunkless.  And fairly bland.

Service is super fast.  No, really, I mean ULTRA FAST.  You'll get your food generally in under 5 minutes, unless it's a steak which has to be cooked for a while to get done.

This place would get 5 stars easy if they improved the salsa.  I take my teens here a lot.
