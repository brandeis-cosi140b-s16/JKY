Unforunately, I was underwhelmed. I read reviews prior to going to Restaurant Mexico the other night and I went in with low expectations. Maybe that isn't totally fair, but then again, that's why I yelp.

I ordered the cheese enchiladas. I ALWAYS order cheese enchiladas when it's my first visit to a Mexican restaurant. The sauce was bland (red), thus causing my enchiladas to be flavorless. Like many reviewers before me, the dish was lukewarm. My iced tea was the highlight of my meal. I don't think I would consider putting cinnamon in my iced tea but for that, one star. 

My girlfriend had the green chilie burrito and seemed to enjoy it. She also had the chorizo tostada and liked that as well. Another star for her enjoying her food.

Service...meh. We were one of two tables in there. Our server was overly attentive. 

I don't want to say I would never go back, there's always a possibility. I just won't be going out of my way.
