Simple nice restaurant. This is a family owned restaurant and the staff is very friendly and they remember me every time I come in. Their daily special is always a good deal. This is by far one of the most authentic Mexican food restaurants I have found in the valley. Very casual atmosphere. Don't expect margaritas and tequila shots here. This is a true restaurant.
