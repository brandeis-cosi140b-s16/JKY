Food is good, lots of flavor and spice. They refer to this style of food as Homemade Mexico city and Jalisco style. If you're going for lunch its a little spendy but they have a a few combos under $10. You can also order items al a cart. for about $3 each taco, enchilada, etc. They have a few breakfast dishes w eggs, chorizo. I ordered the fajitas w/ rice and beans My lunch w soda plus tax and tip came to $18. So if you prefer quality over price this is the place for you. If you want value you should look elsewhere. You get some chips and salsa while you're waiting for your food. The service is nice and the food came out quick even when they are busy. Located off Mill Ave in Tempe so there is limited parking meters, garages, etc.
