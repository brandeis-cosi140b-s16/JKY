Went there on a Thursday with my family from out of town. Wanted to show them a good Mexican restaurant and was completely disappointed. 

We walked in and waited for a table for about 10 minutes. That's not so bad normally except that the restaurant was nearly empty. Got seated and the chips were stale and cold, salsa was watery and bland. Went to use the restroom and they were out of toilet paper. Luckily I noticed before I sat down. Got out and told our waitress, waited 6-7 minutes for tp to get stocked. Ordered the beef and chicken floutas, they were tasteless and had very little flavor. The meal also came with the usual rice and beans as well as a little pile of guacamole. I found a hair in the guacamole.

When I confronted I waitress about it she was very kind and apologetic then went to show her manager the hair. I overhead their conversation and the manager saying "Another one?" They came over apologized and took the meal off of the bill.

So overall my experience with RM was one star. However considering the fact that my family was satisfied with the their meals and had no problems along with the courtesy of the staff, earned them one more star. Would I recommend this place to anyone? No.
