I give this place 4.25 for being extremely cheap yet amazingly delicious!
This is not your normal Taco Bell, Filiberto kind of Mexican food. According to my friend (who's actually from Mexico), this restaurant offers "Mexico city food.... southern Mexican food"
My fav is #4. It's small but enough to fill you up for lunch. Their spicy, juicy shredded beef in the flour tortilla is to DIE FOR! And their beans and rice are definitely the best in Tempe!
One of the best place for food on Mill.
