Now I understand why so many reviews trash this place. I don't think I've ever gone on a Sunday before, but what I got was:
--Stale chips
--Lukewarm food
--Bare minimum of service

The waitress had clearly decided I wasn't going to tip, as I couldn't even get a drink refill or a "how is everything?" check. Now, I usually tip 20%, but when waitstaff is doing everything possible to treat me like a non-tipper, at some point, I shrug and oblige.

When I told her the food was lousy, she offered to void the bill, which is the only thing she did right; but I did eat it, so I paid because it's not fair to stiff a restaurant, even one that I'd never return to.

Basically, if you haven't been a regular since the 1960s (literally -- I was the only customer born after 1960), you can find better Mexican in Tempe, and you should.
