I LOOOOOOVE RESTAURANT MEXICO!!!  I grew up in Tempe and have been going to Restaurant Mexico for as long as I can remember, at all of its various locations over the years.  It is, without question, my favorite restaurant in Arizona, and the best Mexican food out there.

The wait staff is so nice and has worked there forever.  The food comes out super fast and is always hot.  And most importantly - DELICIOUS.  Their enchiladas are amazing - with queso fresco (not gross yellow cheese) and green tomatillo sauce... oh man.  So good.

Now that they're back on Mill, the location is great.  I can't recommend this place enough.   Go, you won't regret it!!!
