In giving Restaurant Mexico 3 stars I wish I could change the rating of A-OK to Eh-OK. It's not bad, it's not great, it's just Eh ( insert shrug here) OK.

Went there today with some co-workers. I've been before and realized I have not written a review. Probably because it's a bit forgettable. I got the shredded beef tacos with rice and beans. My favorite tacos are from Los Olivos so I use those as a gauge when ordering tacos. These do not even come close to Los Olivos. They were okay. Decent amount of beef but they were kinda hard to bite through. The whole lot of beef would come out when I took a bite. This made me look like a slob in front of my boss. Awesome.

The rice and beans are also okay, nothing special. The beans are kinda watery. 

But to me the biggest disappointment is their chips. Chips and salsa can make or break a place and their chips just don't do it for me. They're really bland and kinda thick. But maybe it's good for my waistline because then I eat less overall. Trying to look at the positive :)

If you're in the area and craving Mexican head up Scottsdale Road to nearby La Fonda instead. They have pretty much the same stuff but better.
