In summary, this place is great for a quick bite when craving Mexican but not the slathered cheese and runny beans all over your plate. So, I haven't actually been inside, as my husband got take-out twice now but it looks modern and inviting when I drive by. They have some healthier Mexican options on the menu which is always nice. The burritos are big! I tried the pork one and my husband had the pulled chicken one. They are pretty good and reasonably priced. My menu fave is the creamy rice side. OMG it's so creamy and rich and delicious... this is not one of the healthier options I was talking about, but completely worth the calories. The black beans are good as well, better than most Mexican restaurants. On a final note, the management is responsive and they seem to genuinely care about customer satisfaction. That's always a bonus in my book!
