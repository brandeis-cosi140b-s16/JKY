I'm on Yelp almost every day and this is the first review I have written because I am so disappointed. I ordered a burrito for take out and the second I cut in to it my entire plate was swimming in juices. The ingredients were good but it was impossible to pick up and eat due to a soggy tortilla. I also said no cheese on anything and long and behold there was cheese on both my beans and rice.
