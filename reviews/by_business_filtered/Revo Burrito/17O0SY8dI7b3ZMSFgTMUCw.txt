Walked in and the place did not look like a normal Mexican food place, but it did look interesting. I was intrigued. Lemons? Hmm... 

I stared at the menu for a few minutes and finally decided on the Organic Black Bean Burrito...not my usual choice, but I didn't really feel like any meat that day. The Organic Black Bean Burrito also had an amazing description that made me want to try it. It read as follows "Organic black beans seasoned with cumin, garlic, and Mexican spices. Includes pico de gallo and our custom cheese blend." Ok now that I read it the next day it doesn't sound that amazing, so maybe I was just hungry... It did taste wonderful though! The portions weren't too crazy and the homemade tortilla chips that accompanied it went very well with the hot salsa. 

So apparently this place also makes a few different types of fresh lemonade. Upon asking the girl at the front what she recommended I went with the white peach lemonade and wow it was awesome! My only complaint for the lemonade was that it was a tad pricey and the cup isn't that large...I was left wanting more!!!

Definitely check this place if you're in the area...
