on the for reals my yelpers.  I'm gonna break it down for ya'll like this:

Boss and I decided we'd try the new hot spot for dinner tonight but we were in kind of a hurry.  We weasled our way to the front counter and  ordered the first two dishes the cashier suggested.  I had the carne asada burrito, the lady friend chose the fish tacos.  we shared a strawberry lemonade.

Food arrived quickly and and looked promising.  Served in what looked to be left over delux2go containers and Styrofoam plastic plates complete with little round stickers describing the contents of each plate. 

anyways, on to the food.  Bit into the burrito and wow utter shock as the mix of bland flavors filled my mouth.  Thinking I might have just hit a bad spot I tried again... then again...  No luck.  pure disappointment.  

The fish tacos were somewhat better.  Fish tasted fresh, not fried, ample cabbage and overall decent presentation.  The tortillas were decent though not stellar.  definitely the better of the two.

Needless to say, I was expecting more.  Its got a great vibe and atmosphere but could take some serious notes from the Filberto folks on the food.  Now maybe if they hired a couple of filibertos cooks to train these rookies this place could have serious potential.
