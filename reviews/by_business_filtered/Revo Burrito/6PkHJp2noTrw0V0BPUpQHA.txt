So if I were to base everything off of one experience, I would have given this a 1-star review. However, I want to give restaurants the benefit of the doubt after one crap experience. SO - because this place is #glutenfree, I've tried it out about 7 times. Overall, I'm giving it 4 stars, because it's awesome (and #gluten free) food, decent service, and has a parking space designated for pick-up only (for shut-ins like myself).

I would recommend the mahi mahi taco combo or the chicken machaca taco combo. The combo comes with black beans and this creamy rice with corn and red bell peppers. It also comes with these lightly seasoned tortilla chips that are TDF, and spicy but tasty guacamole (for a bit extra). The protein choices are great, and are quite filling for the $10 range. It's not fast food mexican food for sure. 

Now i'll leave you with my one bad 1-star review moment, as I'm not generally a liar and want to be upfront with my review. So I'm #glutenfree and it sucks eating out because you always have to be careful. One night I ordered the chicken machaca taco combo to go, took it home, and realized it smelled WAY too good to be #glutenfree. So I called and they said they mistakenly made mine with flour tortillas. Big mistake. They could either send me a gift card, or I could drive back and get the #GF corn tortillas. I argued, but was starving, so I drove back. They didn't comp my meal, but did give me some fruit side dishes for free. I explained to the manager how important it was as a #glutenfree restaurant to serve actual meals without gluten. They apologized and I've been going ever since. The food is just damn good for the price.
