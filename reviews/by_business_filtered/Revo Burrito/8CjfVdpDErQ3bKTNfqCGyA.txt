This is all I can really say...I am obsessed with Revo!  Literally have a problem...I think about it all the time! I could eat it for breakfast, lunch and dinner! And they are open late so I really can get it all night! The burritos are the best ever...and I feel I can say that because yes, I am a burrito connoisseur. More importantly...their fresh squeezed lemonade is the perfect blend of sweet and sour. If you went to Revo just for the lemonade..I assure you would walk away being the happiest kid. The best part about Revo is...they use very healthy ingredients so the food doesn't way you down. Did I mention how amazing their white rice is?  I can't even explain it...I could go on and on. I am so sure of how wonderfully delicious Revo is, that I would pay someone $100 if they weren't satisfied!
