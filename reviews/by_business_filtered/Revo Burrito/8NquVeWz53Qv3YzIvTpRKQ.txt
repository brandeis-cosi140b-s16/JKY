Something about an order counter and gigantic menu above gives the impression that this burrito place will be somewhere you can grab lunch in less than an hour. But that would be wrong,  slow to order. Forever to get drinks, forever to get chips and guacamole, and just about 50 minutes in the lunch entrees arrive. 
The lemonades are delicious, the guacamole is ok, needs a little flavor,  but the other food is good.  
I'm a fan of Mexican and there's not much competition in Arcardia/Biltmore but I find myself going to the chain Rubios over Revo. If I want something better, I drive all the way to America's Taco Shop.  Revo just disappoints and can't seem to work out the service kinks.
