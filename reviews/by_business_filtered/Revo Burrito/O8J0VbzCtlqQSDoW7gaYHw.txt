I loooooooove Revo... nice portions, the food is consistently tasty,and that friggin' creamy white rice is so addictive.. you're served salsa and chips while you wait, freshly made lemonade and tea. I recommend the green chile pork or the beef tacos.. yummy! 
It's not a very big and the bathroom is a little awkward, but the place is clean and the staff is friendly. 
Be warned, the plaza's parking is kind of awful and full of yapping Scottsdale ladies who impede traffic. It's worth the wait. Or possibly running over a cougar. Whatevs.
