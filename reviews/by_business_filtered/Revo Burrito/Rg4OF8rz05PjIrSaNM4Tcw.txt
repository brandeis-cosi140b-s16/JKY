Wow, this place needs help. Its in an amazing spot but just doesn't measure up to the caliber of other eating establishments that surround it.
The service:
 I called in a to go order consisting of two measely burritos and was told the wait was 45 min. Ok they must be slammed I figured. Get there and there are only a couple people there AND there are 4 employees just standing around behind the counter just shootin the breeze.  
Another customer is even waiting in front of me! Finally one of the chatters notices that they actually have waiting customers and we both get helped. My 45 min to go order is miraculously ready after only about 25 min! Whaddya know? Glad I didn't waste time getting there! 
 
The food:
I got a combo meal with a fajita chicken burro, black beans and rice. The burrito was pretty good. Nice chunky chicken and awesome hot salsa on the side. Beans were standard, but rice was gross!!!!! It was like rice made like  macaroni salad.

My honey had a chicken machaca burro that was pretty good at first but midway through the bottom fell out due to excess moisture and landed in an unappetising lump on the plate. 

Bottom line:
In my opinion, Revo is just not worth the wasted time and money.
