Short Version: Get the Carne Asada Burrito. The creamy white rice is awesome too.

Long Version: I came here when Revo Burrito first opened as long time fans of Delux so I figured it would be good. I was super disappointed and never returned. That was probably 4 or 5 years ago. Not sure when they opened. 

That said, I came back years later at the advice of a co-worker to get a Carne Asada Burrito and I must say it was pretty damn good. I was so against this place for all those years. You'd think I'd learn by now to let restaurants work out the kinks before I make a judgement call.

I got the Carne Asada Burrito with medium salsa in the burrito with a side of white rice and beans (comes with the meal) as well as a Mango Lemonade. The lemonade was pretty sweet so I'd tone it down a bit if I could. The Carne Asada was very tasty though. It had great seasoning and was very juicy. It looked small upon first review but I was pretty stuffed by the end of the meal in combination with the rice and beans. The white rice I got was really creamy and decadent. I'd highly recommend the combo I got.

I will definitely be back but not sure if I'll be able to sway myself from getting the Carne Asada Burrito again.
