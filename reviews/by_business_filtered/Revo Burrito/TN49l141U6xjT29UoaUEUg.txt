Cool place with a good menu and fair prices. Overall I found it very enjoyable for lunch. We sat outside on the patio and had a nice day. 

I thought the veggie burrito was very good, healthy portion, and high quality + tasty. They make their own fresh lemonade, which is also tremendous. 

I was, however, a little put off that they have someone bring you your food and buss your table. I only say this because it is a counter order and super casual... the kind of place where I go when I don't want to have to tip someone for service, but then I felt obligated when he brought my food.

All in all a very good experience, and it's blatantly obvious that Kathy Hayes designed the interior, and did a great job of it. It's a fun space. Love the take out window too.
