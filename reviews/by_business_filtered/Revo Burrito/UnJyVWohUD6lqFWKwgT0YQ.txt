revo is kinda like chipotle in that you don't go there for MEXICAN tacos or burritos, you go there for REVO (or chipotle) tacos or burritos.

that said, i actually always always get the chicken fajita bowl with creamy rice.  i'm not sure what's in the creamy rice, but i'm pretty sure it's (sour) cream (or something similar) and it makes it DELICIOUS...and definitely high in calories.  the fish tacos are really good, too.  i normally can't help myself and get a flavored lemonade...that i end up finishing before my food is ready.
