For the longest time I was not a big fan of this place. I like my Mexican a tad more authentic. Revo is like the Trader Joe's  of Mexican take out.  The place is modern, the tables are clean, the signage boasts of vegetarian or gluten free meals.  What it lacks for in flavor it tried to make up for in advertising. What's so special about the lemonade? Have you tried the horchata at Mesquite? Puuleeze. 

Then I got over myself and changed my expectations. The food is decent, the ingredients fresh and they make great fish tacos. Order them to go, get home and put some real salsa on them and you'll have a cheap and yummy meal. And let's face it, a lot less calories than your normal Mexican take out.
