This place by no means sells the best burritos or tacos in town but whats appealing about it is the service and the soon to be expansion they are working on. No don't take that completely as a negative because this place is super cute and quick and a really healthy option when comparing where you could go and they really have potential to step up their game... hence giving them a 4 star instead of 3. 

I had the carne tacos on hard shells and fiance had a carne asada burrito. There was a little bit of flavor lacking in the meat but you could easily combat that with the delicious salsas they offer. 

I am excited to see their expansion and see what they do with the menu, if anything, and hope that maybe they can perfect their menu a little more and this place will be booming!
