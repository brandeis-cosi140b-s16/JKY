Whole wheat tortillas!!!?? What!!!?? I'll come back for that alone. It's a mystery to me why more burrito places don't do whole wheat but way to go Revo. I guess it's because we don't associate healthy with Mexican food. With that said, I really give this place a 3.5. Service was slow but for what you get I think the prices are right on. The cheese crisp was a good amount of food for what we paid and my burrito was not bad. Since the ingredients seemed fresh and healthier, I didn't want to kill myself  after eating like I would if I had some greasy tacos from Tee Pee or Don Jose's. 

As mentioned above, the whole wheat tortillas will bring me back and i will always prefer to support the locally owned businesses but this place will not blow you away by any means. (P.S. the men's bathroom is pretty funny)
