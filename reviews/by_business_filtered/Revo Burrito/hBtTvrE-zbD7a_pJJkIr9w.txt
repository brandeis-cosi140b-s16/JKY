Been here twice so far... Yay!  I am a fan (like it says).  Both times I picked the shredded beef burrito combo and a strawberry lemonade.  The combo comes with a side of chips and salsa, black beans, and a creamy rice dish.  This creamy rice dish is different but really good, it has sauteed red peppers and onions along with what tastes like sour cream.  The shredded beef burrito was really good... cant decide if I like it better than Chipotle or not.  They are different but I kind of like the consistency of the meat better at Revo than Chipotle, it is more like the consistency of pot roast meat broken into chunks.  Oh and definitely get a lemonade!  so tasty... would be even better with vodka:)
