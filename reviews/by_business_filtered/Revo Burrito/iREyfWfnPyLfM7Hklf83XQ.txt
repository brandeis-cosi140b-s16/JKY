revo is good and i laik it. fresh menu with a ton of options. FYI "fresh" doesn't mean "fast". those are, to some extent, mutually exclusive. this is not chipotle - things are getting cooked in real time.

customer service is excellent, they've never gotten my order wrong. i believe they're expanding which should be cool.

the only thing i don't recommend is the green chile burrito. it's just too wet - makes it hard to eat. other than that almost everything has been stellar. good sides, great tacos. thumbs up
