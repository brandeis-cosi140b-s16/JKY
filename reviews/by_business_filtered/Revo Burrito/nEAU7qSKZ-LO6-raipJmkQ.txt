First and foremost I have hesitated going into this place due to the over priced food on the menu and the stand offish attitudes from the staff. 

After finally giving them a try I was greated with their not so customer friendly service. Two girls who looked like I was bothering them. 

After finally getting my order in, it took them what seemed like 20 min to make an extra small overpriced burrito.

When I ate this thing I almost vomited. It seriously made me nautious. I will not be going back to this establishment. Do not believe the hype people. The price you pay for the garbage they serve is outrageous. 

No thank you.
