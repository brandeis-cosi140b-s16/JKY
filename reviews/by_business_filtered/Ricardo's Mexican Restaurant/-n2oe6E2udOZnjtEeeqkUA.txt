We just came back for a Father's Day dinner. The ambiance was very nice, the inside was very clean, and the staff is exceptionally friendly, always checking on you to make sure you are content.

So why three stars? 

Simply put, the food is mediocre at best. The two dishes we had came with wonderful presentation, but the food was bland. Meat had very little flavor. All in all, we were very underwhelmed.

But the cocktails are really good.
