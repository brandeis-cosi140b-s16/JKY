This place is always a good place to eat. And now they r open late, very late for those drinking hungry people. Lol food has always been good and the service has always been good as far as I can remember, haven't been here in a while ,but we were staying down the road in a date night out. The Margarita's r always good. This place is a must try least one time if u come to Vegas.
