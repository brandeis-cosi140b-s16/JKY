The owner contacted my husband a few days later and was shocked to hear of our experience and offered a free lunch. However, I find it hard to believe he was shocked of this experience considering all the negative posts on  Yelp!

There are many other Mexican food restaurants in this town to with better food, excellent service and at a great value!
