Just went to Ricardo's restaurant for the first time tonight.Food was very good and great service.Had Steak Fajita,wife and son had steak and shrimp.Only problem we had was they brought out 3 steak and shrimp but they let us keep the shrimp and brought out extra order of steak,so NO PROBLEM!!!!!!!!! Our waiter was Pancho and he was great.Excellent service.I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone that's looking for a good Mexican restaurant in town.Reasonably priced,very good food,excellent service.I left there stuffed and had food to take home.
