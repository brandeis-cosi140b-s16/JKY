Ok, Vegas is a city with many things... Great Mexican food is not one of them. 

That being said, Ricardo's is ok. Just ok. The service is usually great and the restaurant is large and great for big parties. I always judge a Mexican restaurant by the chips and salsa...and well, their chips are red and green, enough said. lol

Many of the meals are tasty, but you can tell they've been prepared before hand and then warmed up again when you order. That is my biggest pet peeve in a restaurant, when they tell you not to touch the plate becuause it's hot. I want my food made to order, is that too much to ask?

I'd recommend coming in for their taco buffet. The food is pretty good and the buffet is rather inexpensive. 

In a pinch, this place will do, but I prefer Bonito Michoacan or Lindo Michoacan overall.
