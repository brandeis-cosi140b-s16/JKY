Pretty irritated with some of these down right RIDICULOUS reviews such as Rudy's.  Get it together people, complaining about SALT on chips!  I mean seriously?  Ricardo's is making chips for a mass of people, NOT YOU SPECIFICALLY RUDY!  I assure you, there is salt on the table.  Here is an idea, pick it up and use it!  "Here's your sign."

Now for my positive review.  Ricardo's did a downright amazing job catering my husband and I's wedding.  Every single one of out 120+ guests loved the food and I am sure many will be revisiting the restaurant.  I didn't hear one complaint and everyone left fat and sassy.  The drinks and service were unsurpassed and management was involved in every single step of the way...free of charge.  

I have been going to Ricardo's since I was a kid....20+ years.  The owner and his wife work Friday and Saturday and they know you by name and always have a smile on their face.  This is a touch of special for me, they are a great pair.

They have delicious food that I cannot seem to get out of my head.  The chicken Ricardo's is my favorite and melts in your mouth.

As for those chips and salsa you some ding-dongs seem to be complaining about.  Why are you complaining when you have a selection of three sauces?  You don't like one, here's an idea, try the other.  Most restaurants offer one selection and that's it.  What's the mean?  You don't like it and you are stuck.  

Don't rely on the YELP reviews of morons, try it for yourself!
