HORRIBLE service and HORRIBLE FOOD.... We only ordered 3 drinks and chicken nachos... Nachos was so nasty!!! Anyway.... It was 3am no one greeted us nicely just said just sit anywhere w/o eye contact or directed us were to sit anyway we waited long just to be helped and were the one who got out menus everything took forever to get to our table... We suppose to order more but how the service is we didn't... To make the story short the reason why I gave 1 star Is when I paid the bill I didn't put any tip yes I didn't because of how they treated us and how the service was... They bother asking the other table how their doing but didn't bother asking us if we want anything else or hot sauce for our nachos we have to ask for it for several times before it came... The person who got our check said to me "WE WILL SURVIVE WITHOUT YOUR TIP" so unprofessional I'm a good tipper but the way you guys treated would NEVER make me go back... Plus tip must be base on how you take good care of your customer!!!!!!!
