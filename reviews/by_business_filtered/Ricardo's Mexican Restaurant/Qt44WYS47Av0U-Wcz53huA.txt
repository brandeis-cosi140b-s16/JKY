I LOVE HAPPY HOUR HERE! cheap drinks and appetizers Monday-Friday 3-6pm and the super late night happy hour Midnight-4am.
Try the Pineapple/mango margarita on the rocks with Patron. My favorite!!  The chips and salsa are pretty darn good. 
Although I came for happy hour we also had a birthday dinner here after happy hour. our party was seated immediately and our orders were taken pretty quickly, they divided our checks for us, I thought that was nice of them allot of places don't like to divide checks. The food came quickly and our waiter was pleasant. The food was not bad but it was not the BEST Mexican food I've had either. The restaurant seemed a little stuffy and warm. I asked our waiter if he could adjust the temp. and that was taken care of as well.
I recommend this place for large parties and for Happy hour!
