This location is quite a way from our home so we usually meet for date night right after work.  I know there are a lot of Mexican restaurants in town but this is one of the best to me.  We had family in last time there.  All of our food was great and the server was funny (I believe his name was Poncho), personable and helped us celebrate the occasion.
