Not great. Mexican food is not hard to make. I understand they are cooking for the masses but the food needs a revamp. The beef is bland. Almost like it came from a can. It's just NOT great. 

We ordered the lunch menu Ricardo's burrito and the beef taquitos. The taquitos were over fried and my burrito was topped with some sauce, not chili nor beans. It was a weird sauce with chunks of something unidentifiable. 

I picked at my food and waited for the waitress to come by and ask if something was wrong because I placed my burrito off the to the side and waited for her. She never came back (She got busy with 2 other tables and attended to their order). In the meantime, the bus girl came over an refilled or drinks but couldn't do anything about the food.  When our waitress finally remembered us was when she was walking by our booth to get refills for the other tables, and I asked her for the check (at this point I was done with this whole experience). We paid the $26.00 for our food and left. 

We will never be back again. It USED to be a great place to eat. The service was ok. The place have changed their food suppliers, or recipes to cut costs or chef because the food is not what it used to be. Very sad.
