Love, LoVe, LOVE Ricardo's Mexican Restaurant. My family has been going there for  more than a decade and has followed the restaurant through it's various locations over the years. It's worth it. Hands down best mexican restaurant in Las Vegas. Not only is their food top-notch, but the service is always friendly. 

When we moved here from Phoenix we missed a certain appetizer our old Mexican restaurant offered (melted cheese and mushrooms inside a warm tortilla). While Ricardo's doesn't offer this dish, they're still willing to make it when we ask every time we come in, providing a little taste of home in the big city.

My #1 recommendation - The margaritas are superb. Order the largest one they have (we affectionately call it "the trough" in my family). Also, paying the extra for top shelf tequila is definitely worth it. You won't regret it.  

Hope you find this review helpful.
