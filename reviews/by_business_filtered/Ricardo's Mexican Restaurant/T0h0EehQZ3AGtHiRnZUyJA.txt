disgusting. crap.

the chips- tasteless
the sauces for them- watery/bland and the bean one looked like it had been sitting out since new years.
taco- vile, stringy, old
beans- prison slop "goop/sledge"
rice- microwave 4 day old soggy and hard in others
steak- grilled unseasoned 
even the tortilla were hard....
absolutely vile- avoid at all costs....

(and fyi the service sucked.)
