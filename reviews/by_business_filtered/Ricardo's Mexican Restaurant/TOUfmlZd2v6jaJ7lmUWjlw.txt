A few years ago, I attended a blow out pre- Jimmy Buffet party at Ricardo's in the MGM.
I mentioned that to a friend and he said - "it moved to Flamingo road and Decatur." He said Ricardo's had been in and out of the MGM on a few occasions.
Remembering the good time I had previously, I could not wait to try it again.

Ricardo's looks like a hacienda sitting on the corner of a strip mall.
The entrance is tiled and the decor is very traditional - other than the many awards they have posted for "vegas best restaurant. "

The service was good - they thought I would want to eat in the cantina, rather han the dining room since I was alone.....
but I got seated in the dining room eventually

The margaritas are made with Cuervo, and were very good.

The menu had an amazing number of choices ... and in addition the restaurant had a dinner buffet featuring a wide variety of dishes.
Wanting to try a little of everything I went for the buffet and was glad I did.

Even tried a little fried ice cream to finish the meal.

A very enjoyable dinner.
Nothing spectacular, but an enjoyable dinner.
