Ricardo's is a staple in my Vegas outings. It's open late (maybe even 24 hours? I forget) and their food is always high quality. We usually have to be wheelbarrowed out! I've been here with Emijandro, the BGB Harry, and even my parents The Griswolds, and it's always great service, strong margaritas, and plenty of great food. I personally recommend their breakfast burrito, or their Burrito Ricardo's. I'm certain I'll be back again, I'm sure.
