We were in town for a birthday celebration. The food was okay. The margaritas were a little weak, but since I'm not a drinker that was okay. The service was great. My autistic daughter had a melt down in the middle of the restaurant and the manager was gracious and the servers were kind. For that they get 5 stars.
