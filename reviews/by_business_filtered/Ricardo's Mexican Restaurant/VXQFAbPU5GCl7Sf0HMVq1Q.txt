We love this place. What is there not to like? Open 24/7, great atmosphere, salsa dip trays the best, huge Margaritas, good food. Price is right. Only negative is running your credit card at your table and asking how much tip to put on it. Com'on, have a little more class, your place is too nice for this kind of behavior.
