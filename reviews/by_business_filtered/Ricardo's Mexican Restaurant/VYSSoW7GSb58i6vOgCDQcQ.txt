The wife and I were out running errands and it was getting late so we decided to stop by Ricardo's because it had been a while since our last visit. It was after 9pm, so we were seated in the bar area, which was fine because it was pretty chill for a Friday night. We both hadn't eaten since lunch, so we were excited for the chips and salsa. The chips are pretty fantastic, fresh and not too salty. The mild salsa was like cold tomato soup, but the medium had nice full flavor, though could have been chunkier. The bean dip tasted like bacon fat, and that is kind of a turn off for me. 
My wife had the veggie fajitas (minus the mushrooms) which tasted very good. I had a Chile relleno and cheese enchilada combo plate. The Relleno was decent, but the chile was super mild and not a lot of flavor. The enchilada was very good, and the sauce was just right, not too overpowering. I also got a Pacifico for $4.25 which wasn't too horrible. 
The portions are a bit smaller than other Mexican places (the plate filled me up, but I had no leftovers which isn't typical for me), and the prices are a bit high, but if you have a  hankering for some late night eats that won't give you a big of a gut bomb as say Roberto's (which I love, so no trash talk here), this is the place for you. It is also not a bad place for an everyday dinner either!
