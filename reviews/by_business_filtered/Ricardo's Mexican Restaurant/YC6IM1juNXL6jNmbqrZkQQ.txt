Mexican only has about 5 ingredients, but Ricardo's does them in about a million combinations! As well as having the traditional meats they also offer a lot of fish (pescado) & even lobster (tho we had the lob tacos & I was a little creeped out...) On weekends there is a buffet which is only $10, less than most entrees, & it looked pretty decent.
Overall, I would say its good but not great. The margaritas are worth a trip though.
