Have been going to Ricardo's since I was a little girl and they were located in the Meadows Mall too.  Still love this place! The bottomless salsa trio and chips is just the starter, but is easy to fill up on and not be able to eat your meal. Had the shrimp and lobster enchiladas and they were FANTASTIC! Mostly lobster made them even better. As someone else posted, they have a barbeque pork sandwich, which my teen ordered, I was thinking, it can't be very good from a Mexican restaurant. I was horribly wrong! He said it was one of the best sandwiches he had ever had and it came with fries and a large side salad. The service can't be beat! Very attentive, never an empty glass on the table and they're extremely friendly and always smiling. Will continue to go back again and again.
