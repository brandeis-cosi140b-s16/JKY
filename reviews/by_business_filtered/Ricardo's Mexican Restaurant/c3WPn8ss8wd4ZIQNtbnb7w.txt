My boyfriend and I have been to several mexican restaurants in this area of Vegas and so far have been disappointed until yesterday when we went to Ricardo's. Chips come with salsa, beans and a super yummy verde salsa. The chips are to die for, they didn't even need any dip. As for our meal, I'm vegetarian & they made me an off menu veggie chimichanga & our waitress was really nice about it. My boyfriend had the nachos which he ate until he couldn't move. Service was good as well, our waitress was Chelsea & she did a good job up selling alcohol without being too pushy. Will definitely be back again soon!
