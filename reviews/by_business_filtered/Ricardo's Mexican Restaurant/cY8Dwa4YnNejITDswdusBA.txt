We asked Ricardos to cater my daughter's wedding.  Their catering rocks! Tanya took care of everything.  The food was fantastic.  Working with Tanya was very easy.  Everything she said she would do, she did.  From table cloths to appetizers to bringing a bar tender to an amazing meal, everything was absolutely perfect. Tanya communicated with us and was punctual.  They don't just cater Mexican Food, they will do other menus as well.  We had Mexican food, of course!  Our Thanks to Tanya and her crew for making the wedding very special.

Only one negative, she used Rebel Rentals and they did not pick up their equipment as requested.  I used RSVP for my portion of equipment rentals and they were easier to work with.
