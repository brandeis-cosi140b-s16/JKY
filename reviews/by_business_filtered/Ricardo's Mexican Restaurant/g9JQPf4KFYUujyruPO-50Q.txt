I can't believe this place has been here for so long and I am the 1st to review it.  Weird.  Anyways...this place is just ok to me.  I like that its open til 6am, I like that they make strong drinks and the mini TV's at each booth for sports is cool too.  If I was with a group, this isn't a bad place to bs and do shots etc.  But the food just isn't great here.  Its just average Mexican imo.  3.5 stars is what I would give this place if I could.
