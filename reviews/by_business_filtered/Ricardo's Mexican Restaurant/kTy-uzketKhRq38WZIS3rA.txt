This is actually a 2.5 star review. 

Wonderful service but the food is very "white" as far as Mexican food goes and a bit pricey as well. I prefer more authentic grub and items that look a bit more fresh. I did not like my Carnitas Verde Burrito at ALL but thankfully my husband agreed to trade and his Colorado Burrito was good. My favorite thing about my lunch was the bean dip that came with our chips!

We will NOT be returning to Ricardo's.
