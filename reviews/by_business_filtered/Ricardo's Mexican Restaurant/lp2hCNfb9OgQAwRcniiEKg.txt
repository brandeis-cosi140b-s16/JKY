How things have changed...

I can remember eating at Ricardo's back in the 80's & 90's, when the inside felt as authentic as the mariachi singers sounded; now, it's reverted somewhere between a Denny's and Chucky Cheeze.    

-No mariachi singers and the place doesn't even remotely feel authentically Mexican; it was almost like we stepped into a restaurant at a theme park...you know; those cheaply themed places where the quality of the food is determined by how loud the screaming child is next to you. 

Price:  I would never pay this much for crap American-Mexican food!

Overall Experience:  Yuck...
 
Conclusion:  Another original and locally established restaurant gone to crap over time.  A victim of poor planning and lack of investment.  You would think that a place like this should only be getting better with time, instead they've stripped it of it's authenticity.
