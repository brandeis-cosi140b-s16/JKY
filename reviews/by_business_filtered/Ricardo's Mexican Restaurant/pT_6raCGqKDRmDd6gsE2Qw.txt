Went there last night. My husband  ordered  a chile relleno and it was terrible  tasted old and stale. We told the manager and she took it away and brought an enchilada  it too tasted stale. I ordered  taquitos $8 (4 rolled tacos)  and they were  burnt and tasted like they were defrosted and reheated in stale oil. Very  greasy,  No rice and beans  like other restaurants,  just sour cream  and  Pico on a tiny bit of lettuce.  When I told them they didn't taste good they said  their food was fresh. 10% discount but i still had to pay for the whole meal. Never eating  there ever!!!!
