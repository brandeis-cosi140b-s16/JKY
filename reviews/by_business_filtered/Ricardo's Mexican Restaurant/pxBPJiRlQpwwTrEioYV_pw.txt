Just went to the bar for a drink. Juan, the bartender apparently doesn't know he can get tips for even adequate service. Instead, patrons seem to be an annoyance to him. I thought it might just be me, until I heard the same from others at the bar. He was aloof, unattentive and surprisingly disrespectful if you actually cashed out from any of the poker machines with a profit. Maybe they have him on profit-sharing. Well 100% of nothing is nothing. That's what you'll get from me in the future! Adios, Ricardo!
