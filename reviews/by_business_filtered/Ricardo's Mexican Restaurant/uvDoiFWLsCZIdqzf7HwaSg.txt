I was given a gift card to this place from work, so we thought we'd give it a try and MAN im glad we did!
The fresh chips and salsa (2 salsas actually, and warm beans too) kept coming and were always fresh. Then I had a large margarita...it is LARGE!!! Very good, and very big (the wife drove home!). 
Taco and enchilada were great, my wife had a chimi which she said was moist and great. Our daughter loved her chicken fingers (i also liked her french fries).
Our waiter, Sacramento, was 100% AMAZING. Funny, nice, treated our daughter like she was a grown adult (shes 3) and was very nice and punctual.

Between the great food and Sacramento's service, we will be back!!!
