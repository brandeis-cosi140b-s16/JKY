This was my first time here.  Had a nice time. The food was good, the staff pleasant and menu selections gives a wide variety to choose from.

I really liked the pitcher of margarita options.  Mango was the BOMB!!!  Next time I will have them mix the pineapple & strawberry together--sounds good to me.

Everyone enjoyed their meals so that was a plus++++

When time to pay up--it was great to see how they handle credit cards.  Instead of taking your card away to process, they do it at the table on a hand held charge machine.  GREAT!!!!
