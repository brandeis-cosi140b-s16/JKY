Richardson's is one of my Valley Favorites. I give them a 5 star for all of their meals, as I frequent Brunch on weekends, and dinner during the weekday. Their copper bars and Southwestern decor make for a fun atmosphere.

I can't pass up their skewars nor green chile potatoes (GCP). I also love their smoked turkey enchilada's and their Pasta Heidi (green chili linguine in a smoked cream sauce). 

I check in on their specials frequently, and love their salmon (typically specials have it prepared with apple-chile salsa, or pineapple salsa). There are always new preperations, but I've never been disappointed.

If you are planning to eat there during the weekday dinner hours (6-8pm)- call ahead for a reservation, or you will likely be waiting for awhile. Its worth the wait, but you should call just in case.
