I took my boyfriend out to a rare date-night dinner at Richardson's because it is right down the street from our apt. It was very dark, hard to read the menus, but was perfect for our semi-romantic dinner. He was wary at first, because of the construction (especially the wobbly wooden plank leading the front door), but it was definitely love at first bite for us! YUM!

We were sat at the bar immediately, and got to skip the 45 minute wait for a table. The place cleared out all at once at 8:30, good for next time so we can have the restaurant to ourselves. I had the red chile alfredo pasta, which I ordered just for the bacon-wrapped shrimp and was very happy (though full after 5 bites - super rich!) Mr. BF had a severe case of food-envy going on. Sooo good. 

My only wish was that there was a place to hang my coat, which was bulky enough on my lap to make eating neatly tricky, but other than that we will be returning without question. Oh and by the way...the male bartender is equally as quirky cute as the other!
