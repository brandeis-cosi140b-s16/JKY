Note to self....if you spot a barely visable restaurant, with minimal signage and BMWs parked in front......stop in!
Luckily I was with someone who knew where we were going and smart enough to rush me out the door "to get there early". We arrived just before 6pm on a Saturday night, and shortly there after the hostess stopped seating walk-ins, for those with reservations (or were quoting a 1 hour wait). The front of this establishment is deceiving, but behind all the construction and clutter due to remodeling another world awaits. The bar is large and friendly, and next time I'll ask to sit there just for the experience and a view of the open kitchen. Our waiter, Clark, did an incredible job of guiding us to some great selections. The whole staff was impecable, providing excellent "stealth-like" service. Clark replied, when asked, "try the scallops...they'll change your world!". My world has been changed. I don't eat scallops, but now I do..if , they are blackened, grilled over pecan wood fire then served with four sauces; chipotle, red chile, queso and roasted red pepper. The salad was fresh, chilled and tossed with jalapeno ranch dressing, topped with green onion, diced tomato and shredded cheese. It would seem the moment my salad fork came to rest, the entree' arrived. A juicy, tender, rare, 16oz. New York, blackened using chipotle spices, sauced with a Jalapeno Hollandaise along side their original Green Chile Potato (I'm making this for my next dinner party) and sautee'd eggplant. I did try the Blue, Red & White Corn Enchiladas,which were really good, still I felt really satisfied that I had won the "I ordered better than you did" award...for once!   
And dessert? one word....Flan.
