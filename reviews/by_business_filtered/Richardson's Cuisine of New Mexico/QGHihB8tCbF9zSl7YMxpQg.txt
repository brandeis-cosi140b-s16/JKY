I just ate there for the 1st time about 3-4 weeks ago. I had the Chamoyo Chicken and it was great. I liked the ambiance though the service was a little lacking. It wasn't very busy and yet the waiter seemed to have better things to do then serve us. Hope they rebuild. I have eaten at the sister restaurant Rokerij and they are just as good with better service.
