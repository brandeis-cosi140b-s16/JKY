I've been here a couple of times and while the food is pretty good, this is by no means a diamond in the rough.  The food tends to be on the spicy side so make sure you don't mind some heat or tell the waiter to go easy.  Also, the place is not very large and tends to be somewhat claustrophobic and dark.  It's difficult to see what you are eating which in my opinion takes away some of the appeal.
